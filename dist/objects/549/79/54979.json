        "Three boys, experimenting with everyday objects, discover the phenomena of refraction and reflection. Playing with a magnifying glass, a water-filled jar, and hose spray, they begin to grasp the principles of magnification, bent images, and rainbows, as they see light interacting with various materials. Suitable for middle and upper primary and lower secondary levels."
