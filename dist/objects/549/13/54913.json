        "Shows the basic language of camera work in a clear and linear style within the context of a planned film. In two parts; \"The Encounter\", the first part, is silent and shows Bob Thornycroft and Joe Bolza mime an encounter between death and a grave digger. \"The Elements in Detail\", the second part, shows all the film techniques used being carefully analysed as the action is repeated and also analyses different shots that can be used by students."
