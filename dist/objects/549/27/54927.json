        "This film concentrates on the main features of the coastal landscape of the south Pembrokeshire coast of southwestern Wales, showing how the two different rock types: old red sandstone and carboniferous limestone, have reacted to the erosive forces of wind, wave and weather. Suitable for secondary level."
