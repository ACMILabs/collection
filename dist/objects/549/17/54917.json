        "Episode of Series \"Indians of the Orinoco: the Makiritare\". Shows Makiritare women making bread from manioc roots. First they remove the poison by squeezing the shredded roots in enormous basket-tubes. From the flour they make yucca or cassava bread, a dietary staple. The bread is toasted on a flat piece of iron and tossed onto a roof to dry. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
