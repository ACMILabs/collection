        "Visualizes the spectral spirits and twilight superstitions that haunted the drowsy Dutch settlement of Sleepy Hollow. Concerns the rivalry between Ichabod Crane and Brom Bones for the hand of Katrina Van Tassel, and how the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow removes Ichabod from the scene. Screenplay by Joseph Cavella, based on the story by Washington Irving. Narrated by John Carradine."
