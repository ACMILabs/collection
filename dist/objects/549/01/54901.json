        "Crow and Lion, on an outer space trip, find a cell which begins to divide. The division continues until it approaches a crisis point: the two friends know the spaceship cannot contain the increasing volume of cells. A calculation has to be made to see how many days they can last. The computer read-out demonstrates a number pattern upon which a prediction can be made. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
