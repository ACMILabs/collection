        "This film is a strident criticism of the operation of apartheid, and investigates most areas of life in South Africa, including the Bantustans. The film produces a visual catalogue of the disparity of conditions within life styles, between the blacks and the whites. (Awards: Mannheim-Heidelberg; Melbourne)"
