        "A suspenseful drama about a girl who, while babysitting, is the victim of anonymous telephone calls. She tries to have the calls traced. In the taut climax the telephone company and the police work feverishly to reach the girl in time to avert a tragedy. Combines atmospheric music and good use of camera shots including long shots, overhead and close-ups."
