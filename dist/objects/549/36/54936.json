        "Shows young people how the law can work for them rather than against them. Distinguishes civil law from criminal law, provides a dramatised explanation of torts and contracts, and defines the medieval practice of \"outlawing\" people for he who defies the law is outside of it. Presented by Joseph Campanella."
