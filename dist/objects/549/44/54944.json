        "Episode of Series \"Asian insight\". A look at the historical and cultural background of Thailand - this film attempts to address racist preconceptions about Thai people and their beliefs and rituals. Concentrates on two elements that affect all Thais: Buddhism and the role of the monarchy. It points out how the Monks appear to be losing their leadership roles as Thai society becomes more urbanised and how the Government is attempting to inform the Monks about social change so they don't lose their place in society. Includes one or two scenes of violence (burning bodies, slaughter etc.) from newsreels. Presented by John Temple."
