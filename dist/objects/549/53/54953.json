        "Images of colonialism and independence in Kenya. A statement on British colonial policy in Kenya, the colony in British East Africa with the largest white population. Deals with the period from 1952 - 1957, when the \"Mau Mau\" were operating. Narrated by an African whose tone is bitter, the film looks at the Mau Mau from a different point of view."
