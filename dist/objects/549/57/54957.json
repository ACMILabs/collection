        "Shows the importance of water to desert people. Compares the Tuaregs, nomadic people constantly in search of water, with the Hajputs, who are cultivators, running water through an ancient irrigation system by camel power and natural flow. This film has no English dialogue, the images speak for themselves. However, you can hear the Desert people in their native tongue."
