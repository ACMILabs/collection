        "Breakfast to the Egyptian slaves, was a painstaking occupation. They could rarely get to work on time because the cook could not supply the required number of eggs to them. He had no system of organizing eggs into manageable number groups. A yo-yo salesman shows how grouping things into sets of twelve makes handling and counting more efficient. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
