        "An anti-war collage composed of fleeting black and white visual using a variety of animation techniques. The tone of this experimental film is surreal using sources of images and sounds from the 20th Century, opening with the rhythm from Screamin' Jay Hawkins' 'I Put a Spell on You'. Soundtrack by Jay Watt."
