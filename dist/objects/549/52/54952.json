        "Provides a penetrating view of the role played in the 1968 presidential election by the war in Vietnam, student unrest, and uprisings in the inner city areas, as it follows the paths of Richard Nixon, Eugene McCarthy and George Romney. Covers Robert Kennedy's entry into the race and Lyndon Johnson's withdrawal, the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy, rioting and bloodshed in Chicago streets during the Democratic Convention. Concludes with coverage of the election and Richard Nixon's victory over Hubert Humphrey. Based on the book by Theodore H. White. Editing, David Saxon. Narrator, Joseph Campanella."
