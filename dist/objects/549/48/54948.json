        "Nicky and his mother buy an old house where a three hundred-year-old witch lives.

She becomes the family cook and amazes everyone with her \"happiness\" pancakes, until her motive is revealed. Based on \"Old Black Witch\" by Wende and Harry Devlin. Narrated by Burgess Meredith. Suitable for primary school level."
