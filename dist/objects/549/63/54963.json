        "The story of a land with a magic tree that provides true or false answers to any problem posed. The king poses a question about wealth - experts disagree as to whether it is an addition or a sub-traction problem, although the tree maintains both methods are acceptable. Previewing is essential. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
