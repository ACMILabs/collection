        "This film is a study of plants and animals whose structure and habits enable them to live in rock pools. The close association between plants and animals is illustrated. The ecology of rock pools is related to the rise and fall of the tide, heating and cooling, desiccation and flooding. Suitable for upper primary and lowere secondary levels."
