        "In a combination of graphics and three-dimensional clay figures, a little man discovers the world of art. He sees an open door and wanders through into an art exhibition. Paintings come alive and move around him as he watches. As he turns to go, he himself is put on a pedestal and bronzed. A 1975 Academy Award winner. Suitable for upper primary, lower and middle secondary levels."
