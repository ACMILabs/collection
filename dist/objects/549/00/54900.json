        "Presents basic mathematical concepts. Crow and the Count travel to Scotland to claim an inherited castle. The benefactor has left a fortune to the person who can solve the mystery of the magic square. This the two friends do after much juggling of numbers; the reshuffling illustrates the interchangeability of addends in an addition equation (associative property). Previewing recommended for follow-up work for teachers. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
