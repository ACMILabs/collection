        "The International Ox Pull, highlight of the Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, annual fair, is a holdover from the pioneer past when oxen cleared the land and tilled the soil. That these great beasts of burden have lost none of their pulling power is well demonstrated as they drag tons of weight loaded on sleds (the winner pulls up to six tons). Competing teams come from various parts of the Maritimes and the northeastern United States."
