        "Two Neanderthals, in order not to be exploited by \"fast operators\" learned to share the leftovers equally with each other, that adding two odd numbers gives an even number, that in adding even numbers the sum will always be an even number and finally, if a number can be divided by two it is an even number. No other credits available."
