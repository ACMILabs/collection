        "Episode of Series \"Basic Metalwork\". This film shows the making of a child's mug right through from the sheet metal to the finished article and gives an opportunity for a number of craft operations to be observed; the design on paper, transference to metal sheet decoration, stages in forming the body of the mug, by bending, seaming, beating, and planishing. The base and the handle are seen being fashioned and joined to the body by brazing. Finally the cleaning up and polishing are shown."
