        "Rossini's comic opera, sung in Italian. One of a series of \"opera-films\", which feature the chorus and orchestra and some of the principals of the Rome Opera House, La Scala, Milan, and other famous Italian opera companies; each film combines scenes from a performance of the opera with an english-language commentary which explains the plot and telescopes the action. Features Tito Gobbi as Figaro."
