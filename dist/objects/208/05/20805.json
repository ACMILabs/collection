        "Although this is a film about the traditional and everyday uses of bamboo, it also portrays many aspects of contemporary living in Japan; life in urban centres and rural areas and aspects of agriculture, handicrafts, art and types of shelter are explored. This giant grass is noted for its beauty and commercial value and it provides a livelihood for many Japanese families."
