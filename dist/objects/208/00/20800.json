        "The apparently aimless flight of a ball which goes out of reach and wanders where it will, is presented in a series of amusing incidents and co-incidences as five boys try to capture it. Drama follows its appearance wherever it goes, people are bumped and shot, and it eludes them to the end. A whimsical film with a unique sense of humour."
