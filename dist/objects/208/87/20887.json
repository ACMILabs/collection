        "The music of Beethoven reflects the great social upheaval of the late eighteenth century, the composer's own unusual strength and genius and the transition from the classic formality of Haydn and Mozart to more romantic expression. The film develops the relationships between Beethoven's environment and his personal response to it in terms of his music. Excerpts from the following are included in the film. First and Fourth Movement of the Symphony No. 5; The First Movement of the Violin Sonata, Opus 12 no. 2; the First Movement of the Archduke Trio, Opus 97; the First Movement of the Symphony No. 3 \"Eroica\"; the Piano Sonata No.14, Opus 27, No. 2 \"Moonlight\"; and the First Movement of the Symphony no. 6 \"Pastoral\"; the First Movement of the Piano Concerto No. 5 \"Emperor\". No other credits available."
