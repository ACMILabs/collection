        "A variation on Aesop's classic fable in which mice aid the escape of a bear in return for past favours. Shows real animals doing exactly what the story requires. A bear catches a mouse, but eventually the freed mouse chews an escape route for his trapped benefactor, illustrating the point that the weak can sometimes help the strong. Suitable for Lower Primary level students."
