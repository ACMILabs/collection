        "The story of the birth of a new holden car, from an artist's conception,through the modelling of small and full scale models, to the making of the first prototype model. From the hundreds of scale drawings, skilled craftsmen create by hand, the hundreds of engine and body components of the prototype. Laboratory and road tests of components and the completed prototype ensue that every section of the car conforms to rigid engineering specifications. Only after all this preliminary work can mass production begin on a new model holden car."
