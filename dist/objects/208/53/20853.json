        "In this satirical animation British troops under a typical Colonel Blimp test the turbanned and rebellious riff-raff from over the border and all with a stiff sense of propriety. The story tracks back to the good old days on the North West Frontier of India. An example of animation technique as used by an amateur production group. Animation by Richard Horn and Ken Clark. (See also Title Code 006110 \"Let battle begin\" for the history of the making of the cartoon.)"
