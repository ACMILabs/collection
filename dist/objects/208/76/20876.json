        "A film for children, one of its greatest appeal is watching the beaver at work, busily and cheerfully demonstrating the characteristics for which it is famous. Sometimes, however, a beaver's industry runs counter to the plans of people. When the beaver's dam floods their father's hay field, two boys quickly devise a plan to save the beaver from their father's displeasure."
