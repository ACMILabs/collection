        "Episode of Series \"Care of the sick and injured\". This film, produced by the U.S. Navy, demonstrates how to make and manipulate beds for the sick and injured (particularly those bedridden for extended periods of time) so that the patient's comfort is increased and their recovery is thereby quickened. Demonstrates how to make a bunk as well as a bed in a ward so that the bedclothes do no need adjusting during the day, and also includes handy tips for materials which can be used to improvise elevations and inclines to vary a patient's position in bed. No other credits available."
