        "Making Chunky Move C.O.R.R.U.P.T.E.D. 2. is an exploration of how Chunky Move, one of Australia's most exciting contemporary dance companies created this new dance work. It follows the company from the germ of an idea, to the stage, behind the scenes and beyond, with snapshot interviews with the key players, dancers, creative collaborators and other cultural identities as well as unique virtual 3D segments, sound bites and extensive footage."
