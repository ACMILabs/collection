        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Why we fight\". Illustrates the German air attack on Britain, particularly London, by the use of film shot during World War II. The role of civilians in the Battle of Britain is highlighted. Concentrates on the Blitz in London and Coventry after Dunkirk, combining actuality footage with many extracts from fiction films. This film is credited with reducing anti-British sentiment among American forces."
