        "Episode of Series \"Music in Motion\". Beethoven often found his musical motives and themes in scenes of nature; scenes of the peacefully flowing Rhine river, ruined castles, leaves turning in the sun, an open field of grain express the charm and individuality of this movement of Beethoven's Eight Symphony. No other credits are available."
