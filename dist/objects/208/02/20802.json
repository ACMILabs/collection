        "Produced for the Baltimore Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, this film describes the world-wide activities of the Baltic Exchange. This is the international centre for the chartering of ships and aircraft - a vast clearing house where carriers are found for cargo and cargo for carriers - to and from any port in the world. The Baltic has the distinction of being the world's only shipping exchange. Narrated by John Le Mesurier the film features the work of a broker, John Hall, during a day at the exchange."
