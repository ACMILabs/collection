        "Follows closely the narrative sequences of the Bayeux Tapestry which is, more accurately, an embroidery - a piece of coarse linen 230 feet long and 20 inches wide. The story of Harold's journey to the continent in 1064, his experiences in Europe, the battle of 1066 and finally his death. Its origin is uncertain but the consensus of expert opinion is that it is contemporary and was probably executed in England at the order of Bishop Odo of Bayeux, William the conquerors' half-brother, as an ornament for his then new cathedral."
