        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Why we fight\". This epic film unfolds the great history of Russia, and the defeat of Hitler's Nazi armies. The depiction of the mightiest battle in war history, with a human life toll of 20 million Russians and 10 million Germans, becomes more than a first hand record of war; it is also an ode to a people's courage and self sacrifice, and the end of Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\". Historic film sequences of \"The Seige of Leningrad\" features the miracle of a \"frozen lake\" which becomes a rescue highway for a city surrounded and doomed, an event which turned the tide of World War II."
