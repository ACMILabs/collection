        "Banksia intergrifolia: a species of native tree growing on Stradbroke Island, Queensland. Explores the patterns of the characteristic serrated leaves, then buds slowly maturing over many months into nectar-laden flowers. These slowly change to woody \"Banksia men\" cones. The sound track features a duet of two noisy Friars imitating a pair of Wattle Birds. Music: Nancy Tow. No other credits available."
