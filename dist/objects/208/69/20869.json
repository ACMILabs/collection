        "An experimental short film about a bearded young man and a double bass. Clasping the instrument he tries to cross a street. Suddenly his attention is arrested by a girl whose charms he appreciates. She smiles at him and crosses the street. He stares at her and then realising suddenly that she has disappeared, he props up his double bass against the tree and disappears into the crowd. Music by George Dreyfus, edited by Peter Tammer."
