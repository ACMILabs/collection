        "An adaptation of Herman Melville's story about Bartleby, the scrivener, who answers an advertisement for work with a lawyer and after a brief spurt of intense work, gradually breaks down, refuses to move and eventually dies because he has lost the will to live. A detailed discussion and analysis of the story follows. Features a cameo appearance of the actor who played Greg Brady in the popular television series 'The Brady Bunch' as a law clerk."
