        "One of Beethoven's earliest works is finely played and recorded in this film. Dennis Brain (horn) and Dennis Matthews (piano) give a performance of the Sonata in F for horn and piano, Opus 17. Contrasts the horn as it was in Beethoven's time with the improved and more complicated instrument of to-day. No other credits available."
