        "A survey of sport and athletics in Great Britain, showing several champions and promising newcomers training as well as competing. Johnny Haynes demonstrates the art of ball control; Diane Leather, first women five-minute miler; Gordon Pirie competing in a two-mile event; Christine Truman, tennis star; Pat Smythe shows skill in show jumping; Jeanette Altwegge and Cecilia Colledge, figure skaters. Sporting activities play an important part in the everyday life of English people and a high degree of skill is maintained."
