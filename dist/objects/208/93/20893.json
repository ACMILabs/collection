        "A road safety film emphasizing the importance of using seat belts in vehicles and how they do save lives. Collision tests conducted at the University of California show what can happen in an accident. The uncontrolled movements can damage the body in numerous ways, ejection being the most fatal. Thousands of lives could have been saved if people used their seat belts rather than sat on them. Features Dick Van Dyke."
