        "Charlie Burke is a wilfully careless handler of fruit, and is generally unpopular with his fellow workers, the foreman, the producers, the fruiterers and the housewives. A visit to a psychoanalyst reforms him. He acquires a conscience and becomes a model handler, self respecting and respected."
