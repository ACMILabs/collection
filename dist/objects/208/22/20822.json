        "Every day at fishing ports along the coast of Britain, fishermen land their catch. Twenty-four hours later the fish is available for sale in shops all over the country. This film illustrates all aspects of this industry - the trawlers and drifters; busy quaysides and fish auctions, the freezing, filleting, washing and boxing; trains criss-crossing through the night; centuries old Billingsgate fish market."
