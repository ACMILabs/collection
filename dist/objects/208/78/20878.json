        "This is the story of a retarded child and how her parents and others cope and learn from each other. Special ways of training at home and school are shown and the possible need for specialised medical care is touched upon. Such children can emerge from the special treatment area and enter normal life. This poignant and yet cheerful family portrait tells us how one family successfully copes with having their child at home. No other credits available."
