        "Describes Britain's pioneering efforts with this medium, showing how the demands of war accelerated technical development and how the post-war years nursed the nation-wide impact of this home entertainment. The opening of the first regular television service from Alexandra Palace, London, in 1936; highlights from popular programmes and the linking of the BBC service with Eurovision and Intervision 25 years later. A record of successful transmission from Britain to Australia indicates a path of future achievement."
