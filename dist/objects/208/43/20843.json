        "A delightful film encounter with a man who found his own substitute for gasoline in barnyard manure. Mr. Bate is an inventor, a classic combination of single-minded knowhow and practical dreamer. But his discovery is real enough. The film shows how his homemade digester does turn manure into potent methane gas to power his auto. And for good measure he demonstrates his latest energy machine - a bicycle powered by the bumps on the road. Award: Yugoslavia."
