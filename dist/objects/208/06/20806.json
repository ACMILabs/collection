        "The story of a village that helped itself. When the villagers of Bamiri in Ashanti decided to build themselves a Community Centre they scarcely realised how this would stimulate the progress of the village. Now the people of Bamiri are not only improving their village materially, but they are educating themselves in many other ways. No other credits available."
