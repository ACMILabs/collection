        "Robert Conquest writes and narrates the history of communism from 1917 to 1969, showing that a true Marxist revolution of power to the people has never occurred. A masterly summary of 52 years of political history, this documentary includes a clip from the Halas and Batchelor animated film version of \"Animal Farm\", Leon Trotsky reading a speech in English, Leonard Schapiro commenting on Stalin vs Trotsky and archival footage of historical figures such as Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Churchill, Kruzchev, Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh. Stills filmed by Ken Morse."
