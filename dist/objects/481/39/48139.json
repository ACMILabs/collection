        "A dramatized example of what happens when two conflicting personalities must work together. Designed to stimulate discussion on the adjustment that supervisors must make, Peter is rather retiring, particular and conscious of his position, His new assistant, Jim, is exuberant and almost aggressively well-meaning. Pete dislikes Jim's suggestions on altering routines and resents his attitude even more. When he overhears Jim discussing the situation with other men in the cafeteria he is extremely angry, calls Pete into his office and has it out with him. Neither is satisfied and Pete takes the situation to the personnel manager, who tells him it is too late to make a change and that he is capable of making the adjustment. The audience is asked: how should Pete handle Jim?"
