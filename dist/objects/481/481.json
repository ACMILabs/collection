    "description": [
        "An experimental film that monstrously inflates a few seconds of old Andy Hardy footage into a wickedly subversive deconstruction of an Oedipal triangle. Throwing down the gauntlet to Hollywood's space/time system, Arnold tears asunder the film language of classic Hollywood cinema. By surgically sectioning single frames and reproducing them in multiplied and repeated sequences, he exposes the repressed sexual dynamics between Andy (Mickey Rooney), his girlfriend Betsy (Judy Garland) and Mrs Hardy (Fay Holden)."
