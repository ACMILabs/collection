        "Shows what fisheries science is doing, both afloat and ashore, to ensure that life survives in the seas and inland waters. Projects on Canada's three sea coasts and in many inland waters illustrate the vital and intriguing research directed towards restoring and protecting marine life. The film is encouraging evidence that old abuses of the great provider can be corrected and safeguards established."
