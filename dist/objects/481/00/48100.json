        "Springtime means being outside. It means being able to play hopscotch, and sing songs, and play with bolo-bats. This film is about little girls celebrating spring in Montreal. They play in alley-ways, in doorways, in parks, and on the street. They sing songs that were sung by their parents and maybe their grandparents. Gibberish rhymes, counting songs, and old folk songs ring out in children's voices. Without commentary, this short sketch travels the by-ways of Montreal where little girls play. Comptines is a French word for children's song games."
