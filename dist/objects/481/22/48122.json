        "To encourage more people to express themselves at meetings of their neighborhood groups, this film shows a Home and School Association whose members tend to keep their ideas to themselves until after the meeting. When a study group is formed to overcome this problem it learns the do's and dont's of stimulating discussion, and examines the role of the leader in fostering discussion among members and in maintaining focus on the goals of the group."
