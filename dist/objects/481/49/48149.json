        "Designed to illustrate the unsatisfactory relationship between education and the local necessities of life which characterises education in many parts of the USA. The film presents a study of farm families in the poorer mountain communities of the rural south, inadequately housed and clothed, ill-fed, living onland which yearly returns them less and less. One of the first tasks of education is to ensure that the children's school curriculum meets the needs of their daily life."
