        "A film about Norrbotten, in northernmost Sweden, where industrial and agricultural patterns have changed and people are being relocated in industrial towns far from the life they have loved. In a series of interviews we meet people who have known the dignity of independence and who have suddenly become welfare cases. The film asks: Are their lives being improved? How can we reconcile human values and economic needs?"
