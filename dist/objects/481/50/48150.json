        "The summit of Mauna Kea, an extinct volcano on the island of Hawaii, is an exceptional site for astronomers. In that clear, cloudless atmosphere scientists can observe the mysterious phenomena of space. The Road to Mauna Kea records the construction of one of the world's largest and finest telescopes - a joint project of Canada, France, and Hawaii that took over five years to complete."
