        "An English language version of a Russian propaganda film promoting the virtues of Stalinist policies for the protection of children's welfare. If much of this socialist child-rearing looks severe and Spartan, the film is punctuated throughout by genuine moments of charm and whimsy. In many respects this is an enchanting film; accordingly, the film is a fascinating study in propaganda cinema."
