        "An inspiring portrait of Glenda Watson, a young teenager with cerebral palsy who cannot walk, but who can ride a horse. She is one of a group of physically disabled people who are improving their capabilities with the help of volunteers at the Pacific Riding for the Disabled Association. This rewarding form of recreation with therapy is a welcome change for Glenda and provides the thrill of close contact with and control of another moving creature. In fact, when she's riding, she feels \"on top of the world.\""
