        "Longtime friends Jack and Ruby are about to share a big secret when publicist Ziggy arrives in their one horse town to find the newly successful romance writer, Ruby Vale. Trukkie Jack (Hugh Jackman), eager to keep his new vocation and the autobiographical elements of the two lead characters a secret, manages to convince Ruby to go along with the charade, provided that the publishing company foots the bill for Ruby's much anticipate wedding to Hamish. Alone and away from home, Ruby and Jack are forced to question what they're passionate about and whether they have the courage to resist the stereotypes surrounding them and stand up for it. Cast also includes Andrew S. Gibert, Jeanie Drynan and Bruce Venables. Music score by Oscar nominated Burkhard Dallwitz (\"The Truman show\")."
