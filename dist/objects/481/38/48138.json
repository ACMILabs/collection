        "The world is running low on cheap fossil fuels. To the question What else is there?\" many scientists have answered, \"nuclear power. But some physicists, as well as energy analysts, government consultants, and even law enforcement agencies, are alarmed by the proliferation of nuclear reactors. This film explains various experts' concerns, among them Dr. Hannes Alfven, Nobel prize-winning physicist. He no longer supports nuclear power, and states most determinedly, \"No act of God is permitted.\""
