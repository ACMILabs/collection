        "A history of Danish village churches and their architecture. The first churches were built of wood, but none survive in Denmark. In the 12th century stone was used; buildings were in a simple Romanesque style. Frescoes, telling Bible stories or legends of saints were used to decorate the interiors. In the 13th century bigger, more elaborate churches appeared in Gothic styles. Brick was used as a building material, particularly for additions to earlier churches. Changes at the reformation were not violent; seats became more common, since sermons were longer. Churches remain a centre of secular as well as religious life for peasants. Architectural history is briefly summarised. Supervised by Carl Th. Dreyer, Victor Herman, Bernhard Jensen, H. Longborg-Jensen."
