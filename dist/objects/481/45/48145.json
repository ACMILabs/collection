        "A cautionary document that explores in depth the impact that offshore oil discoveries have had on Stavanger, Norway, and on Aberdeen and the Shetland Islands in Scotland. Confronted by the huge deposits in the Hibernia field off Newfoundland, Atlantic Canadians are advised to begin planning now for the inevitable effects that this oil will have on their indigenous industries, particularly fisheries. In addition to its relevance to Atlantic Canada, the film holds interest for anyone concerned about the effects of heavy, rapid industrialization on both the environment and traditional ways of life."
