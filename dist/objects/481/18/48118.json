        "Life aboard a fishing trawler off the West Coast of England, under arduous and dangerous war-time conditions. Shows the daily life of the crew at sea, consisting of fishing day and night and hauling every three or four hours. Also looks at life on land as women repair nets, clean fish and greet their returning husbands. Tragically, the steam trawler 'Hondo' on which this documentary was filmed returned to sea with a different crew and was lost with all hands. Photographed by A. E. Jenkins, Chick Fowle and Cyril Phillips. Sound by Ken Cameron and Jock May. Music by William Alwyn."
