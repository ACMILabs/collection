        "A study of the various uses of china clay obtained from the Cornwall region of England. Begins with footage at a quarry, showing the excavation and treatment process before it reaches a kiln for drying. China clay sand, a by-product of this process is recycled and used in the manufacture of concrete block, extensivley used in the construction of the 'Cornish Unit House'. Presents interior and exterior footage of this type of home. Scenes within a china factory capture the skills of potters and painters who convert the clay into decorative household products. Also shows the manufacturing process in a paper mill which uses a combination of china clay and wood-pulp to produce newsprint. Commentary by Geoffrey Sumner. Editing by Len Green."
