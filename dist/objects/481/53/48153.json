        "This film is a lively mosaic of how Canadians use winter as a source of recreation and entertainment. We go from coast to coast catching a view of virtually every winter sport and outdoor pastime - from the grace of figure skating to the mayhem of a car race on a frozen lake. Aside from all the action, the camera often stops along the way and lingers on the frozen stillness of the long Canadian Winter. No narration."
