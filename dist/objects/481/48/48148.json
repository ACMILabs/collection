        "This vivid recounting of Nigeria's history, from pre-European times to the mid-20th century, provides dramatic background to the political maturing of Africa's most populous country. Of particular interest is the film's treatment of ancient African cultures as revealed in the three regions that make up the Federation of Nigeria."
