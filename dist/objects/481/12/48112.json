        "Charming animated teapots thwart the ancient order of droops and preserve marital harmony. Drinking tea is also demonstrated to combat noise pollution promote workplace solidarity, and inspire carnal passions. A very fine example of American studio animation of the period. The animation suggests the hand of the maturing Frank Tashlin. Music is a little fey, but quite sweet in its well intentioned way. Music score by Richard Dupage."
