Beginning with the preparation of the slate table top which is cut and smoothed flat before the pocket areas are chiselled out; shows the trimming and fitting of the rubber edges and the application and of the felt table top cover; presents artisans involved in the design and construction phases; shows the various performance tests that are conducted during the manufacturing process; also captures the care taken when packing the table for shipment. Finally, Sidney Smith demonstrates both basic and novelty shots on a newly crafted table. Narrated by Frank Phillips."
