        "The first scene of this film shows some attractive views of rural scenery in Tasmania. It is perhaps easier to make rural life in Tasmania attractive than in some of the other Australian states, for Tasmania has been blessed with many rural scenes of great beauty. Most of these shots were taken in the Huon Valley; the camera then lingers on an Area School at Huonville. There must be, however, in all the other Australian states many attractive rural districts which would provide a suitable environment for an Area school. Tasmania has many attractive one-teacher schools. The school shown is situated at Longley in the mountain district behind Mount Wellington. Since the introduction of the first Area school, however, the number of small rural schools in Tasmania has been diminished by about one hundred."
