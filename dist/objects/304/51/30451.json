        "This is an account of the growth and purpose of welfare organisations and the Community Chest movement in Canada. The practical neighbourliness of Canadian pioneer communities has evolved into today's welfare work. The many organisations which receive their funds from the Community Chest are indicated, and animated diagrams show how the incomes and overlapping programs of these welfare agencies have been centralised, with leadership provided by the Canadian Welfare Council. Their work is demonstrated in a dramatisation of an actual family problem, brought to a happy solution through understanding assistance."
