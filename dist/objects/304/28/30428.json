        "Based on the book by Mary Hayley Bell, this extract is the story about a group of children living on a remote farm in the north of England who find a man whom the believe to be Christ. In reality he is a murderer on the run from justice. In the extract we see the children in their country environment and at their home situation. For the first time since \"Christ\" came to the barn, they talk with him. In the farmhouse, at tea, their father questions Kelly about talking to strange men, which she denies. After leaving the village shop with goods for the man, the three children meet a crowd of friends. The crowd eventually follows them to the farm gate and Kathy is persuaded to let them see \"Jesus\"."
