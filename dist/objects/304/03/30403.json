        "Shows pre-school children in various situations, in some of which they require help from adults and in others manage successfully by themselves. Points out that sometimes help is necessary for the child to succeed in projects undertaken, and at other times it is important for adults not to impose their standards of speed or efficiency. Presents four scenes without comment, suggesting that the audience decide in which of these episodes the children should have been helped."
