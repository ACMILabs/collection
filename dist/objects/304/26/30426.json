        "Shows how a voluntary group of people set out to fill, in part, the needs of the aged people in the community. Discusses problems of selecting a suitable location to build a home, raising funds, and designing a home to meet varying needs of the people. Raises psychological problems of rehousing the aged; interviews indicate the anxiety they feel in leaving their own home, and their doubts of surviving on their own."
