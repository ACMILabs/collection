        "A passionate and ecological film for the defence of 'The Wash'. 'The Wash' is an estuary mud flat up to five miles wide that is washed by tides from the North Sea. Many birds and sea creatures call 'The Wash' home, or a t least a resting place. Flora abounds on the land edges. Acre for acre there is more protein in tidal mud banks than in reclaimed grain fields. Proposed fresh water reservoirs may pose a threat to wildlife."
