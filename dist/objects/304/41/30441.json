The Blind Institute in Auckland undertakes to teach the blind and partially blind to becomes self sufficient and happily employed. Blind persons are shown in various industries. A housewife is shown cooking with the aid of Braille thermometer and cookery book. In the school for blind children every child is given individual tuition and taught to co-ordinate fingertips and brain. It is in music that blind people excel."
