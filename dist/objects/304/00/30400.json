        "In the USA, the farmers formed co-operative societies within the framework of the Rural Administration, with the aim of bringing electricity to very farm. The co-ops were run by the farmers themselves. This film tells the story of how four farmers, who lived in a valley four miles off the main power line, persuaded their neighbours that they too should have electricity brought to their farm. The Co-op's Board of directors are all farmers from the district and they are made to remember that when the Co-op began it was thought that taking electricity to many of the farms was thought to be a had financial risk, because of the distance involved in getting power to their farms. Practical experience has since proved that electricity has allowed the farmers to expand and develop their farms, bringing greater financial returns; a local hospital, a sawmill: a poultry industry and more shops in the township have also resulted from the coming of electricity. The managers of the Rural Electrification Administration Co-operative Society in this district at length decide unanimously that bringing power to these four isolated farms will not only be a good risk but will add further to the districts' resources."
