        "A trio of stories, set in three of the world's great cities. Illustrates the theme that people, no matter who they are, or where they live, share the basic human qualities of love, kindness, generosity and compassion. Shows a teenage girl in Amsterdam, a hard-pressed business man in Montreal and a wistful little boy in Mexico City in episodes displaying their response to other people's needs."
