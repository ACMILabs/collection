        "A television special that takes a long and searching look at the devastation of the city of Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory after Cyclone Tracy on 25th december 1974. The city became the site of possibly the greatest natural disaster in the nation's history causing the mass evacuation south of three-quarters of the city's 43,000 people. The film looks at the results of the cyclone and the spirit of the people of Darwin, determined to rebuild their city."
