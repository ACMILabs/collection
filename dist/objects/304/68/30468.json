        "The importance of scientific method and the way in which scientists work, is illustrated by the study of such common phenomena as fleas jumping. Describes various parasites around us, fleas, Tsutsugamushi mites, rat mites, hood-worm larvae and how they find hosts to suck their blood. Concludes that carbon dioxide is the stimulus which alerts parasitic mites to the presence of animals, thus food."
