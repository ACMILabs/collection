        "Three boys, from unhappy home situations, share the feeling of being outsiders. Unable to join in the fun at a high school hangout the boys walk aimlessly along the dark streets. They climb in an open window at the high school to see a white rabbit in a science room cage. Impulsively, they destroy the whole class-room. At court the judge summarises the factors which led these boys into vandalism and the ways in which such acts could be avoided."
