        "In 1956 Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer joined with other Brazilians to build a new city and new society - Brasilia. Niemeyer continued to work toward the completion of the city, the buildings of which exhibit a high aesthetic impact that avoids American and European functional emphasis. His major disappointment is in the failure of the project to produce a new society - life in Brasilia remains stratified and formalised."
