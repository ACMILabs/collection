        "The story of the Bristol Britannia, Britain's great hundred-seater, turbo-prop airliner, the first to operate a scheduled non-stop service across the Atlantic between London and New York. Ten years of specialised design and research went into the Britannia and the development of the aircraft from its inception in the planning offices of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Shows the elaborate testing stages, test flights and the process of production; the proving flights and finally the actual operation of the Britannia by airlines in Britain, Canada, the USA and Mexico."
