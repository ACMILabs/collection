        "The problem of children who won't eat and what can be done about it. Uses example of the story of a small boy, Tommy, who wont eat. the need to understand the child is ilustrated, including consideration of habits that were begun in infancy. The necessity for a mother to be relaxed when feeding her baby, the importance of feeding the infant when he is hungry, the significance of pleasant surroundings, are emphasised. When Tommy's mother assumes a new attitude toward Tommy, he begins to develop proper eating habits."
