        "Le troubadour de Natashquan, singer, songwriter, one-man show - Gilles Vigneault is one of the most popular entertainers in French Canada. He sweeps the audience along with his irrepressible exuberance, every so often breaking into a little jig around the microphone. In this film you get to know him even more intimately than does his theatre audience. His serious side emerges when he speaks of the themes of his songs (the internationally popular Mon Pays is one of these)."
