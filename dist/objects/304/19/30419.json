        "This film tells the story of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. Ultimately the Scheme will double Australia's present power output and will provide ample irrigation water each year. Excavatgions are in progress for miles of tunnel which will divert the waters of the Snowy into the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Tumut Rivers. Maps and diagrams as well as photographs show what has been achieved. The Munyong Power Station was officially opened by the Prime Minister in 1955. The completed Guthega Dam supplies this station with water."
