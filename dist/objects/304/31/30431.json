        "Australian aboriginal cave paintings in ochre tell of their tribal life in western New South Wales. Finger, brush and stencil techniques are used to portray hunting kangaroos and emus, corroborees, magic and ritual maps. Special equipment is used by a field party to copy the paintings to scale for detailed scientific record and research. A cave-floor is carefully excavated to find implements used by the cave dwellers, and charcoal samples taken for dating tests. Music from \"Namatjira\" by Clive Douglas."
