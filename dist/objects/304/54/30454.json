        "Victor Vararely, Hungarian-born artist considered to be the founder of \"op-art\", believes that the truths of our time are represented by relativity, the speed of light, and the weight of an atom. To this end he has gone from representational abstraction, through kinetic experiment, to what he terms an abstract geometrical alphabet."
