        "Shows how the white blood cells capture the diseased organisms and destroy them. Special cells not only destroy bacteria, but are also capable of removing white blood cells that have been overcome in their battle with the invading organisms. Removal of invading organisms prevents them from multiplying and overwhelming the body defences. Shows the white blood cells in all the various work they do."
