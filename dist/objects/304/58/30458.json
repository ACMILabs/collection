        "An analysis of the teacher's vital role in a child's development. Three important questions are raised; how can we attract people of superior ability to the teaching profession; how should these people be trained; once trained, how can they be persuaded to stay in the profession thus giving up more lucrative careers. Various classroom situations are used to emphasize the important part played by the teacher in moulding the development of the child. The film presents a challenge to all concerned - prospective teacher, parent, the community as a whole - for the teaching profession to receive true recognition and for children to find satisfaction in their search for knowledge."
