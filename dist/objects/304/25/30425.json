Fringe Benefits: Benefits of smoking include extracting information from spies, damaging furniture and providing work for the medical profession. Funeral: A clever way to kill an enemy is to offer him a cigarette every time you see him. Hero: A man who works and plays hard may be a hero but a smoker is a slave. Lover: By the time a man reaches a woman whose very long cigarette he has lit, she has aged dramatically--\"the longer you smoke, the shorter life gets.\" Suicide: Smoking is recommended as an efficient way to commit suicide. Volcano: A voice bragging about having always smoked turns out to belong to an erupting volcano. Live-action clips include: Carmen: An opera singer prepares for the starring role in Carmen as she smokes but collapses in a coughing fit when she starts to sing. Coffee House: Exasperated by the number of people smoking around her, a woman in a cafe clears the premises by putting on a gas mask and petting a skunk. Cough Dance: A smoking couple cough as they dance until they can dance no longer.
