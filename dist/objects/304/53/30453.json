        "This drama, dealing with the impasse of understanding that often arises between teenagers and their parents, depicts a young girl who has arrived at the age where the old rules no longer apply, where resentments run high against parental authority, and where the gang comes first. She is bewildered, yet intensely aware of the new sort of world into which she is heading. The film provides an insight into the inner motivations and conflicts of adolescent girls."
