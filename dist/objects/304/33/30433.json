        "In late 1949, a joint expedition planned by the Governments of Britain, Norway and Sweden left for Queen Maude Land on the Antarctic continent - this was to be the first truly international expedition to the Antarctic. The film covers the first stage of the journey, from departure point in Europe to the establishment of the base camps and later withdrawal of the ship's party, leaving the groups of scientists to their study of the unknown world of ice and snow. Photography by Tom Stobart."
