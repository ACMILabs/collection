        "In today's industry, the conservation of human resources is vital. This film shows how employers keep their staff happy and increase output as well. Gives three examples of improved production as a result of studies by a productivity group: one in a clay pipe industry, one in an insurance office and one in a machine shop. The lessons to be learnt are applicable to many other industries."
