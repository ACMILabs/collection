        "This film considers the question of how to use the increasing amount of leisure time that people now have - and will have even more of through modern technology. It suggests the pleasures of creative pursuits such as pottery, painting, dancing and amateur theatre, and shows how the enthusiasm of a few who organise group activities can draw many others to develop latent talents."
