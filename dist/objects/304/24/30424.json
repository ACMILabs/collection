        "A live-action story into which the message is women that by caring for their teeth, young people will give themselves something valuable in life. Story of a school film society which tries to win 100 pounds for the best film about teeth. They find out that their original idea would cost too much, but by drawing their own posters they produce an intriguing five-minute film."
