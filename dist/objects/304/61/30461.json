        "Records the reorganization of production in accordance with Work Study principles at a British engineering firm. The firm's problem was that it made a variety of products in limited numbers and, in addition, worked in cramped buildings. Meetings and discussions over models and diagrams of the present system by which material moved up and down and in and out of the works, and plans of other systems, resulted in the designing of a more efficient flow line running at right angles to the previous one. This meant moving two hundred machines without stopping production. In addition, Departments were each grouped with their own stores and offices, and the production control office streamlined."
