        "Australia's most enduring industry is the development, breeding and grazing of the Australian merino sheep. A pastoral revolution based on land clearing, top-dressing and irrigation is increasing sheep production over vast new areas, but the traditional outback has hardly changed since farmers went inland to find sheep country."
