        "Tumbledown, weatherbeaten old barns and dwellings stand like gaunt skeletons of other times, reproachful of an economy that let them down. Unable to compete with food-chain marketing, the farmers have moved into town, and eventually the bulldozer applies the final indignity to buildings that once represented a full and wholesome way of life. Filmed in 1969 in the Upper Ottawa Valley of Ontario and Quebec, this film carries nostalgia in its mute question: What price progress?"
