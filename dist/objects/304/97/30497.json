        "Describes the techniques involving in well drilling - the erection of the derrick; the drilling at appropriate speeds through different formations; the hauling out and running in of formations; the hauling out and running in of the drill string; and the sealing and cementing of the various strings of casing. Work goes on night and day, involving at times great strain and tension. Finally, the flow tubing is run in, and gun perforation at the level of the producing formation allows oil to flow into the tubing and up the well."
