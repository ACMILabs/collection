        "By far the best of the action-filled frolics that made Douglas Fairbanks, popular before his swash-buckling period, this film pokes fun at psychiatry in a manner that is still modern. Full of comedy and thrills and dominated by Fairbanks' breezy personality, we see the star in some truly astounding acrobatics."
