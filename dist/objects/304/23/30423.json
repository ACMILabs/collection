        "The work of the Victorian Society for Crippled Children and Adults in helping the physically handicapped to learn full, happy and as far as possible, independent lives. The Society tries to reach handicapped children early, so that they may benefit from training and companionship in special play centres. Special schools and holiday camps are organised for older children, while Deva Hostel and its annexe provide a home for handicapped young adults from the country, enabling them to further their education and compete for employment. More severely handicapped people are able to work at the Society's Craft Centre at Albert Park."
