        "The history of printing is traced from its beginning to modern methods of large scale production in English Publishing Houses and the distribution and marketing of the finished book. At the same time, the film follows the life of an individual book, beginning with the author's MS, the reading of the proofs, the printing, binding, sale to shops and final use in libraries where it is indexed and catalogued."
