        "Designed to show how the aboriginal people of Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria are adjusting to the new life brought about by the discovery on their lands of vast manganese deposits which are now being mined by Broken Hill Proprietary. Made as a fragmented collage of images and sounds, it is intended to produce a direct emotional response, and suggest the confused values of the aboriginals undergoing a social and cultural revolution."
