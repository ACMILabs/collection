        "Episode of Series \"Earth and it's peoples\". In this section of southeast America, cotton and tobacco have depleted the soil over a long period of time and the damage done is now being slowly repaired. new crops and new industries are being introduced. The film shows something of the work of the county agent at Laurel, Mississippi, who visits every farm and aids the farmer in improving the crops and livestock. Students at the State Agricultural College experiment with seeds, soil analysis, etc. Crops include pecan trees, tung trees, legume crops, sweet potatoes etc. A program of conservation of the forests is in operation, and the saw mills turn out wood fibre for composition board. Textile factories from the north provide additional employment."
