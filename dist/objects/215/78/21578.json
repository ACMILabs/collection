        "A warning, though in comic style, that pure oxygen is a hazard, and a serious one, when handled without care in hospitals and elsewhere. Charlie, a hospital orderly, creates havoc just in moving a cylinder from storeroom to bedside. The film demonstrates how oxygen makes substances more combustible, even so unlikely a material as steel wool. A film for staff training wherever oxygen is used."
