        "Episode of Series \"Geometry\". Dilatations (central similarities) are introduced to solve the problem of inscribing an ellipse to touch the sides of a given triangle at their midpoints. Coordinate geometry is also introduced to solve a subsidiary problem stressing the importance of the geometric interpretation of algebraic equations. Narrated by Delbert Ball."
