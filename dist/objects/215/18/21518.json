        "This film deals with a situation in which one man is promoted over an another who has more experience in the same area. The man overlooked displays his resentment by insisting that nothing has changed and that he will continue to behave as he has always done. The question posed concerns the preservation of old relationships after promotion while making it clear that one is now boss. Suitable for upper secondary level."
