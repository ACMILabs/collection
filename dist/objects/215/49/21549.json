        "Set to the music of an all-wood orchestra, this simple un-narrated story portrays a pair of wooden dolls magically come to life. Initially the blocks formed a house for the man and lady. They then change into a fire engine to put out a fire in the house and into a truck, train and ship to take the wooden couple on a holiday. Finally they form a house again. Adapted from the book of the same title by Pat Hutchins. Animation by Zdenka Skripkova. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
