        "A dramatization of part of the Prologue to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and the Pardoner's Tale. Evokes the life and characters of the time, and gives some details of Chaucer's career and experiences, before going on to show the Pardoner himself. The narration and dialogue of the Prologue and the Pardoner's Tale are given in a modern English translation which retains much of the metre and rhyme patterns of the original. Short passages are quoted in both the original Middle English and modern English."
