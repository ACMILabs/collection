        "This film depicts a young man and a chair (animated by Evelyn Lambart) that declines to be sat upon. The ensuing struggle, sometimes farcical, sometimes thoughtful, is an open-ended commentary on relationships. The technique used is pixilation. The musical accompaniment is by Ravi Shankar and Chatur Lal."
