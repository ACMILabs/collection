        "Episode of Series \"English Literature\". Provides a background for the study of medieval English literature. Identifies the early literary forms - the ballad, mystery play, allegory and romance - and shows how each of these was an expression of different aspects of medieval society. Re-enactments of portions of the Canterbury Tales; Piers Plowman; Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; Morte d'Arthur, illustrate the variety and vigor with which medieval literature is endowed. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
