        "One of the \"You are there\" television series. This docu-drama takes its audience back to September 29th, 1938. It deals with the efforts of Britain's Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, to preserve peace with Germany, and Adolf Hitler's empty promise made in the Munich Pact. Captures the tension and fear which hung over Europe as Daladier and Chamberlain yielded to Hitler's demands and signed the Munich Pact. Contains archival footage and a cast including Roland Varno, Noel Drayton, Mike McHale, Robert Burton and Stephen Bekassy. \"All events reported and seen are based on historic fact and quotation.\" Narrated by Walter Cronkite."
