        "The advantages gained by industry from a systematic training of operators. A middle-aged woman, discontented because the personnel officer regards training as an expensive gimmick, takes another job where, given the chance to learn, her whole attitude changes. A small garment factory adopts a training program which becomes an indispensable part of normal activities."
