        "Episode of Series \"Geometry\". Reviews the definition of range and pencil. Introduces the basic projective transformation, namely the central perspectivity. When the narrator poses the question of the number of points required to uniquely determine a projectivity (product of perspectivity) the viewer is led to the fundamental theorem of projective geometry."
