        "A film report on how chemical research is on the side of the farmer in battle against the plagues that threaten his crops. Insects, plant diseases and weeds come under close scrutiny as scientists develop new formulas to check the invasions to which field and garden crops are subject. The film shows laboratory experiments at a government research station and examines the questions that still need to be answered about the ultimate effects of toxic substances on food-producing soil. Narrated by James Tapp."
