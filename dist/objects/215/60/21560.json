        "The West Queensland cattle country. This film shows the plains of South-western Queensland and the intricate network of water courses, which during the wet season flood and provide irrigation for rich natural pastures, on which large herds of cattle are fattened for marketing; but which also brings the mail, freight, news and gossip to the outlying homesteads."
