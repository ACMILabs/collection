        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Charley\". A \"Charley\" cartoon showing the fundamental importance to the national economy of a plentiful supply of cheap coal. Britain's source is at present coal but it is not cheap and to remedy the situation there is need for development and re-organisation of mines. The problem of finding enough money for this task will necessitate an increase in the cost of coal, but this situation will be improved as mines become more productive. Voices: Harold Berens, Jack Train."
