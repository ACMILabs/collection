        "This film examines the changing economy of Canada's Atlantic provinces and the factors that contributed to the expansion of industry in the early to mid-1960s. The film focuses primarily on the choice confronting many inshore fishermen - whether to stay with the free but frugal life that their nets provide, or to move to the city. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
