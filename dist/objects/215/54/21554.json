        "A brief essay on the ecology of a forest area of the type found along the southern fringes of the Laurentian Shield. We see the forest as an integrated community of living things, both plant and animal, balanced by conflict as well as by harmony, and learn why the maple tree is best able to survive the struggle for supremacy in the Laurentian forest area.
