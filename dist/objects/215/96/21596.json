        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". Starting with a display of samples of over 70 elements, the film demonstrates methods by which chemical similarities among the elements have provided the basis for dividing them logically into families. By experiment and observation metals, non-metals, and the doubtful elements are grouped. The film demonstrates how atomic numbers have provided the key to the ordering of the elements in the periodic table."
