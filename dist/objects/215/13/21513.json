        "Episode of Series \"This Modern Age\". A survey of the history and position (as at 1948) of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the newest Dominion of the British Commonwealth. Shows the civilization of the Lion People who invaded Ceylon from Northern India; the influence of Portugese and Dutch colonization which preceded British rule. The achievements of a 150 years of British rule are evaluated. The practical results of British government in terms of increased production of tea, rubber and coconuts are illustrated. Shows the modern educational system; defeat of malaria; extension of irrigation and recolonization of the north; difficulties facing the new Dominion. The population of six and a half million people is made up of five races with four religions and three languages. Poverty, lack of finance, high cost of imported food are barriers to progress, but progressive social schemes have been started."
