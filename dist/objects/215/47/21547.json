        "Shows how the formidable forest covered mountains of British Columbia have been transformed over time. Engineers have built around and through the mountains; abundant mineral resources have been utilised; arid areas irrigated; and the port of Vancouver rapidly expanded. But there still remains a beautiful wilderness of mountain scenery. Suitable for upper primary level."
