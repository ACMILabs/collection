        "Episode of Series \"Moral Decision Making\". Part of the \"Moral decision making\" series, this film is designed to stimulate a classroom discussion on cheating. A situation is dramatised showing a student, whose performance has dropped in maths, being offered a chance to see a test before it is given to him by the teacher. With the development of this situation, questions are posed and various possible responses for the student to his opportunity are depicted. Projector stops allow for class discussion as problems arise in the film. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
