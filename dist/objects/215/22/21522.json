        "After assisting Libya to gain independence in 1951, the United Nations has continued to give technical assistance to develop the country. As much of the land is unsuitable for cultivation, future prosperity depends on improving crops. Cooperatives for the citrus fruit and sheep industries have been formed and reforestation and irrigation projects are under way."
