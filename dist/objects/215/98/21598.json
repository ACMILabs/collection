        "This film directs the student's attention to the significance of chemistry in the modern world. It traces the steps leading up to the reproduction of electric furnace phosphorus. In showing the work of research chemists and chemical engineers who work from an original idea until it reaches its final form in the shape of a finished product, the film also provides information which may be of value in vocational guidance."
