        "An analysis of Vittorio De Sica, as director, actor, man; relaxed and informal, then occupied and businesslike. De Sica himself guides the narrative and introduces interesting sidelights from his intensively creative life. We learn much of De Sica's ideas and methods from long detailed excerpts of his films, including Bread, Love and Dreams, Shoeshine, Bicycle Thieves, The Bed, Miracle in Milan."
