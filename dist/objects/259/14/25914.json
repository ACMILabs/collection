        "The harsh social inequities of the Middle Ages form the background for this film. By focusing on the Peasants' Revolt of 1381- a determined thrust for freedom by English peasants against the intolerable conditions of the manor - the film examines the grim reality of life in the late Middle Ages. Cast includes Anthony Hopkins, Edward Fox."
