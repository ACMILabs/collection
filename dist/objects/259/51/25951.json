        "Made for use by management bodies, the film shows with humour and understanding how not to supervise. A new worker arrives in a small factory where changing work patterns keep the place in chaos. An overbearing supervisor creates a successful plan, but with further change and pressure, destroys the group's motivation. The factory is back where it started."
