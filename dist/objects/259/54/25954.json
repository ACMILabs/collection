        "A story of men and machines, of the difficulty of adjusting everyone to the standardized needs of modern industry. Photographed in a washing machine factory, the film shows what happens from the humans relations point of view when a speeded-up conveyor system and a clash of temperaments disrupt the harmonious work of a group of men on an assembly line."
