        "Discusses the problems of introducing Work Study into industry. In one of the departments of a factory there is a bottleneck in production. It is decided to bring in a Work Study expert to see if the job can be streamlined. The worker mainly affected, remembering the hard times of the 'thirties, convinces his workmates that although he is the only one threatened, it might be their turn next. They are behind him and there is not only trouble for the firm but also the unions whose agreement with the firm sanctions the introduction of Work Study. Rumours of impending sackings spread, tempters get short, but the shop steward reassures the men that they will not lose. The situation is resolved. One man is transferred to a job in another department and when he is being re-trained for it, his pay is being made up. The bottleneck which started the trouble is eliminated and the central character - the worker who feared the sack if the if the Work Study reorganisation took place, now finds himself actually earning more, even though, as a result of the re-arrangement, he is doing the job single-handed."
