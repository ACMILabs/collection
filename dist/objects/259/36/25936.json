        "Episode of Series \"Biology Program. Unit 5. Heredity and Adaptive Change\". This film explains how meiosis, or reduction division occurs in the formation of sex cells. It illustrates the sequence of changes in the parent-cell nucleus which results in the creating of two daughter cells, each having half as many chromosomes as the parent cell. Meiosis also enables plants and animals to produce offspring with a variety of characteristics."
