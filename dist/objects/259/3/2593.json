        "The North Richmond Community Health Centre has an extensive Arts and Culture program which invites community members to describe and celebrate their culture and ideas. The HIGH ART CDROM is a documentation of more than 14 projects and uses video, animations, interviews and graphics to exhibit the work.  HIGH ART also expores the more complex elements of cultural diversity by asking a number of questions including, \"What is a community and who belongs to it? Is it where they live or how they live? Can art make you healthy? If it does, is it art or is it therapy? Do migrants get a fair go in the media? What does multiculturalism mean at the end of the 20th century  Also included in the CDROM is a series of essays that describe and evaluate the relationship between art and health."
