        "Inspired by Franz Kafka's short story of alienation and grief Metamorphosis, this animated film communicates through images of sand and sound what Kafka expressed through words. Simple materials are used with subtlety and precision to create the sad plight of human angst. From ordinary beach sand spread on a piece of glass, Caroline Leaf produces the tragic world of Gregor Samsa, half man. half insect."
