        "This film describes the NSW penal system and explains the efforts made by prison officers to rehabilitate prisoners. Shows how hardened prisoners enter Grafton Gaol, a prison of bars and locks, while those who show promise of reforming are sent to training centres in Goulbourn, Berrima and Emu Plains where they are taught trades and how to live in a community, preparation for the day of their release."
