        "When roads, waterways and railways are made through a cutting, erosion occurs on the banks or batters. The subsoil having been largely removed, grass or other plants will not easily grow. Mechanised equipment is now used to stabilise these batters. First the eroded gullies are eliminated, then a mixture of bitumen and straw mulch applied and finally water, seed and fertilizer sprayed on. The bitumen stabilises the soil, the straw mulch protects the seedlings and pasture regeneration is no longer a problem."
