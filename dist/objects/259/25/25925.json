        "Shows how the Mediterranean climate affects vegetation. The acute shortage of water in summer and the vital necessity for irrigation is shown, also characteristic villages and farmhouses and the grape harvest. Autumn is a time of violent storms punctuated with brief periods of sunshine enabling cultivation of crops and flowers to continue, in spite of the mistral winds of the season."
