        "Episode of Series \"Adolescent Development\". This film describes some of the ways in which parents may help prepare their children for adulthood. It deals with a family which includes a seventeen-year-old girl and a fourteen-year-old boy. It shows how their basic physical needs are met, how they are guided in their spiritual growth, and how parents can develop the social consciousness which will service to aid their children in making a satisfactory adjustment in later life. The film points out what parents can do to help constructively and indicates some of the needless worries that parents have about their teenagers."
