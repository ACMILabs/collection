        "The town of Nuriootpa - an aboriginal word meaning \"the meeting place\" - lies in the rich Barossa valley in South Australia, about fifty miles from Adelaide. Although superficially Nuriootpa may appear to be much like any other Australian country town, it is in fact a place where co-operation and collective effort have won for the community many facilities which most country towns lack. Acting through a community committee consisting of representee of the residents of Nuriootpa, a hotel and a co-operative store have been established a technical school and youth centre opened, a swimming pool and a health centre built, and plans for future development drawn up."
