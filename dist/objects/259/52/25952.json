        "Four of the world's most eminent physicists, Denys Wilkinson from Oxford, Bernard Gregory from Paris, and Geoffrey Chew and Richard Feynman, both from California, discuss their work in trying to make sense of the fundamental particles of matter in the central nucleus of the atom. The solution could give a complete understanding of the matter of which we, and the entire universe are composed. The cost of the research is too great for one county, except the U.S. or Soviet Union; therefore 14 European nations including Britain have pooled their resources and built a 10 million pound machine in Geneva."
