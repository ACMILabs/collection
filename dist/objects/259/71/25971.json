        "An experiment at Brooklands. Contrasts overcrowded ward in a public hospital where hard worked staff have no time to train the children in self-help and the family activity style of training at Brooklands. Small groups with a 'mother' learn some independence by living together as families; the active outdoor life enables them to become more and more independent."
