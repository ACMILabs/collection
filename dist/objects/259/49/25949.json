        "The conquest of the Artic Sea, beginning with attempts by early seafarers to thread their way through dangerous channels in search of a north-west passage across the North American Continent. Exploration by sea and air, right up to most recent developments. A forecast is made by Michael Marsden of the Artic Institute of North America. He sees the atomic-powered submarine paving the way for the industrial development of oil recourses in the Arctic."
