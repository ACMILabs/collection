        "A new direction in the art of film animation-using a computer to assist the animator. In this film, it was the computer of the National Research Council of Canada that performed most of the work of animation, registering the hundreds of movements to produce a fluid, evolving effect. Without the computer, each movement or impression would have had to be painstakingly arranged by hand. The theme of the film is our universal desire to escape the demands of life. A film without words. Music by A. Clavier. (Awards: Oberhausen)"
