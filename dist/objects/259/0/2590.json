        "The Warrior Women CDROM and booklet evolved out of the Warrior Women Exhibiiton. Warrior Women is a moving, insightful and innovative mixed media art exhibiiton created by women exploring their experiences of breast cancer. Women of all ages, cultural and social backgrounds collaborated with women artists to develop this significant exhibition. The collaborations took place over a two year period and resulted in over 100 pieces of art including videos, projections, audio, slides, photographs, digital designs and writing.  The Australia Council for the Arts funded the redevelopment of the Warrior Women Exhibition artworks into a booklet and an interactive CDROM. These were distributed throughout Australia by the Breast Cancer Network, Australia."
