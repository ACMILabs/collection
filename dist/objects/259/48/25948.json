        "The memorandum was Hitler's and the subject was the final solution to the 'Jewish problem'. In this outstanding documentary, a Jewish Canadian takes a holiday from his glazier's shop in Toronto to join an emotional pilgrimage with 30 Jewish Americans to the necropolis of Bergen Belsen. In travelling through the New Germany, this man remembers - scenes still vivid in his mind are recalled in flashback. Includes footage of concentration camp administrators on trial for their role in the Holocaust. (Awards: San Francisco, Venice, Vancouver, Montreal)"
