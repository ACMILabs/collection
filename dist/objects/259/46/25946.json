        "A fresh approach in the field of automobile safety, Memento uses picture and sound contrapuntally. Photographed in an automobile \"graveyard\", the film presents a picture study of cars irreparably smashed in accidents, while the sound track reconstructs the voices of the participants of three particular accidents."
