    "description": [
        "'Slow Service' is a series of portraits shot using a high speed video camera. This camera, which is normally used for filming mine detonations, science experiments and military tests, captures 1000 frames a second. The footage, when played back at 25 frames per second, has been slowed down so that a second of real time takes forty seconds on the screen. 'I asked the subjects to pose as if for a passport photograph. We see the transition between this artificial pose and their natural instinctive reaction to the bucket of food that is being thrown at them, and then the impact of the food itself.  I liked the idea of capturing a wasteful, slapstick, human gesture using a medium that is normally reserved for 'serious' scientists and bomb designers'.  (Marcus Lyall, 2004)"
