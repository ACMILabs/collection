    "description": [
        "CD-ROM completed as part of Major Project in second year of RMIT Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia. Inspired by the conventional comic strip's linear format the work attempts to both work within and reinforce the conventions of a left to right frame sequenvce as well as explore the possibilities of breaking these parameters. This prototype interactive comic strip allows for multiple narratives and breaks the sequence to create variable storylines. Suitable for most age groups; contains low level offensive language."
