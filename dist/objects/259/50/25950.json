        "From the small flocks raised by the early settlers in New South Wales, the wool and fat lamb industry of Australia has grown to its present importance in the nations economy. \"Men and mobs\" tells the story of sheep in Australia from the time of the first poorly-fleeced animals brought by Governor Phillip, and alter, the first merinos introduced by Captain Macarthur, until today, when buyers from all over the world compete to purchase the annual woolclip."
