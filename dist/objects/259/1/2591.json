        "One of 6 works selected by AIM director David Atkinson as representing the best interactive work produced by the AIM centre up until 2004. Three Mile Creek is a collection of anecdotal accounts inspired by an experience of growing up in rural northern NSW. The aim is to transport the participant into what is a distinctively Australian time and place, with the child who lives on the farm as their guide. A contemplative approach is the key to appreciating the stories. Music, dialogue and soundscape evoke the richness of the environment and create the sense of being there"
