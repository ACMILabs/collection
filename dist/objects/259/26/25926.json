        "The medium, of course, is television, and those massaged are the vast viewing audience. But this 1969 film is not an enquiry into the effects of television on the viewer, although there are some expressions of opinion in man-on-the-street interviews. For the most part, the film takes place in a Vancouver classroom where young students are given the facilities (camera, TV monitor, videotape recorder) to stage their own little act for the television screen. What they do reveals the impact that television has had on them."
