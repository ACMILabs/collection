        "Begins by showing some of the remnants of the medieval world to be found in European cities, beginning with York. The growth of cities and the necessity for protection provided by fortified towns is explained. The film then shows how religious belief helped to bring about the expansion of the medieval world by means of the Crusades. The demand for products of the East stimulated trade and new centres of trade arose. Ghent, a typical town of the Middle Ages, is described in the film. The Cathedral of Chartres is also shown. Finally, in the Middle Ages, arose such great universities as Paris, Bologna, Cambridge and Oxford."
