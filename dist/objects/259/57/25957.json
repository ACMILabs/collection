        "These men in the park are pencil drawings, but this is no still-life study. Here the figures move; facial expressions change; a figure of a man rises and shambles off the scene; a bus flashes past in the nearby blur of traffic, and in the background are all the blatant, hurrying sounds of the city. It is as if the artist's sketchbook has become animate, alive. The result is intriguing, especially for those with an eye for the art of film animation."
