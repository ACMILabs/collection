        "An animated film showing meiosis, the chromosome halving cell division preceding the formation of sperms and egg cells. An introductory chart shows the production of male and female gametes and their union to form a new individual. The destruction between the chromosome complement of somatic cells and sperm cell or ovum is made. The process of meiotic division is illustrated by diagrams using, first, one set of chromosomes, and then again with four sets of chromosomes."
