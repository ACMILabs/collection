        "Episode of Series \"Life in Australia\". This film, directed by Douglas White, opens to the roar of a crowd at the MCG. The camera then sweeps across the city of Melbourne as the soundtrack fades to an easy listening score by composer George Dreyfus (notable for his TV score works like the classic theme from Rush). The film has no commentary, just a skeleton narrative, which is ingeniously used to feature the city of Melbourne. We see a young man wave goodbye to his mum and drive past the commission flats to pick up his girlfriend (Meg from \"Prisoner\" - the young Elspeth Ballantyne). In the city, people work and shop and the music turns more dramatic as the crowds and traffic grow. In the evening the couple window shop for funky furniture and see \"Busybody\" at Her Majesty's, then twist the light fantastic at a bar. Part of the Life in Australia series, produced by The Australian Commonwealth Film Unit."
