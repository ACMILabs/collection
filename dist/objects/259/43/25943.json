        "A school instrumental ensemble consisting of violin, tuba, piccolo, flute, chimes, piano, cornet and French horn, learn the importance of melody in music. The film hows how variations in note arrangement, lyrics, different music instruments, note length, and tune all effect the melody. Students are encouraged to make their own melodies by learning how other melodies are developed. The film concludes with a performance by the ensemble of a simplified arrangement of the final movement of the Brahms First Symphony."
