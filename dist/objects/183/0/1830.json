        "Viola lives her life in isolation, hiding her disfigured face from the outside world in a darkened room where she writes her novels. Marie, her sister and only companion, takes care of her every need, acting as her protector from the cruelty she perceives surrounds them. The two women happily live as co-dependant social pariahs until a male stranger arrives and throws their tenuous order into chaos. Caroline Leaf's masterful animated short explores the psychological ramifications of isolation and the distortions it can create in a persons mind."
