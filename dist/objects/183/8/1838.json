        "Moorabbin - The shopping mall is now a permanent fixture of our suburban landscapes. Carpark consists of multiple scenes of shopping, parking and just hanging-out juxtaposed against an aural collage of people talking about their experience of mall culture. This is a superbly crafted short experimental work that will resonate with each and every one of us who has spent time 'down at the Mall'. Carpark was made over a weekend in the carpark of Southland shopping centre."
