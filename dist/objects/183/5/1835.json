        "This warmly comic documentary is about Beryl from Brunswick whose prized garden frog is stolen from her verandah. Very soon the police and the neighbours are on the trail of the thieves, everyone wanting to do their bit to ensure that Froggie comes back home where he belongs. This acclaimed short film was made by Beryl's niece as a celebration of community, and is an example of how remembering an episode from your life can make a wonderful piece of film."
