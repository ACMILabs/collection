        "Kensington - this short film is created from a series of photographs and interviews with Mr and Mrs Kemp, residents of the Kensington Public Housing estate for 38 years. 'reLOCATED' documents the lives of residents from the estate who were moved when the estate was redeveloped. It is a visual record of how places contain the memories of people's lives as well as a fantastic example of how you can use non-video media to make a powerful moving image story."
