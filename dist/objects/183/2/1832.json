        "This award-winning animation film spares no feelings and minces no words. A poignant interpretation of a short story by Montreal author Mordecai Richler, it makes what is sometimes an embarrassingly frank statement about how many families respond to their old and infirm members. In soft simple washes of watercolour and ink, the filmmaker interprets reactions to a dying grandmother, capturing family feelings and distilling them into harsh reality."
