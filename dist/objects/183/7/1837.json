        "In 'Stack', sound artist Ros Bandt captures sounds from the city stack emissions, a 55 metre chimney stack that extracts fumes from the Citylink tunnel. Sounds from the cylinder, the external grid and internal resonant surfaces, along with ambient sounds of the industrial extractor fans and builders working were recorded. Sections of the steel frame were electrified in order to generate original percussion timbres. The tunnel footage was shot and edited by Martin Wright."
