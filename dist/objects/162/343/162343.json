    "description": [
        "'100 Pages' is a project based upon the theme of North Sydney Girls High School's Centenary. This project used the School's identity and history as inspiration for artmaking. Through the artmaking, students are celebrating the school's identity in the present and past community; isolating individual events, subjects and objects as inspiration. The title of the unit, '100 Pages', comes from the initial idea of 100 animations, for 100 years of history. This project has been developed for the Stage 5 elective, Year 10 Photography and Digital Media class (PDM), which comprises 12 students from North Sydney Girls High School."
