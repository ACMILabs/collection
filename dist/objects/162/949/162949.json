    "description": [
        "'Monash: The Forgotten Anzac' is the story of an unlikely hero; a middle-aged German Jew with great self-belief who fought not just the German army but those on his own side who used his heritage to undermine him. To many, Monash's cultured European background made him unsuitable to command an army made up of egalitarian Australian volunteers. However, his sophistication and ease with the British aristocracy allowed him to exhibit his skill as a military strategist. Defeating powerful opposition to become commander of the Australian Corps, Monash devised a plan that won key World War One battles and saved thousands of lives. It was largely through his efforts during the war and its aftermath that the Anzac legend was forged. Source: Film Australia Collection."
