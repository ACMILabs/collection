    "description": [
        "'Morning of the Earth' is a 1971 classic surf film with cult status. Part of the film's attraction is the way that director Albert Falzon creates an inspiring and romantic mythology around the act of surfing. 'Soul surfing' (as opposed to competitive surfing) was not a new concept, but 'Morning of the Earth' offered a visual manifesto for its would-be followers. The film portrays surfers living in spiritual harmony with nature, making their own boards (and homes) as they travelled in search of the perfect wave across Australia\u2019s north-east coast, Bali and Hawaii. The film's soundtrack included music and songs by notable Australian music acts (most famously Brian Cadd and Tamam Shud) and became Australia's first Gold soundtrack album."
