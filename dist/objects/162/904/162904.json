        "Faithfully captured here by Fred Daley, steam train enthusiast and 8mm home movie maker, is a family road trip from Melbourne to the New South Wales town of Cooma.  Winding dirt roads, sign posts, look-outs and country museums are enjoyed by the family on their journey. It appears to be summertime as there are roadside stops near cooling lakes and weirs. The refreshing river at Bright is enjoyed by many people with kids jumping off a bridge (right next to the \"Do Not Dive From Bridge\" sign!) and enjoying a long metal slide into the water. Places featured are: Eildon, Whitefield, Bright, Mt Buffalo, Tatra, Tallangatta, Merimbula, Buchan Caves and of course, Cooma. An inter-title at the end shows there must have been a drought that year \"Cooma - Very dry in '65\"."
