    "description": [
        "In 2011, journalist John Martinkus was commissioned by the Australian War Memorial to record the life and times of Australian Defence Force members in an active theatre of war - Afghanistan. This work, one of three short films produced from that commission, takes you into the world of Australian soldiers at Al Minhad air base in the United Arab Emirates, and Tarin Kot in Uruzgan, Afghanistan. The film explores the day-to-day realities of those in the ADF deployment, including training Afghan National Army members and disposing of 'Improvised Explosive Devices', identified as the biggest single threat to Australian troops in Afghanistan. Martinkus' revealing one-to-one interviews with ADF personnel tell of the changes to the operational environment over the last ten years, and go on to detail some of the harder experiences facing Australian frontline soldiers."
