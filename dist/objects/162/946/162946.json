        "A dramatisation about the famous sea battle between the German warship Emden and HMAS Sydney in November 1914. This 1931 film has been recut from the popular 1928 film 'The Exploits of the Emden'."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "'Sea Raider' is a reconstruction of an earlier film, 'The Exploits of the Emden' (Louis Ralph, Ken G. Hall, 1928) which opened in Sydney's most prestigious cinema, the Prince Edward, on 21 September 1928. It ran in the cinema for three weeks, making it a considerable success. 'Exploits of the Emden' was itself a partial reconstruction as it combined new footage shot by Ken G. Hall  with footage from the German film 'Unsere Emden' (Louis Ralph, 1926). While the reasons for releasing a condensed version of the film are unclear, 'Sea Raider' appears to have been intended as a supporting short for 'Exploits of the Emden'. 'Sea Raider' has removed most of the previous two films' scenes of character development to provide a straightforward dramatised documentary that covers the career of SMS 'Emden' and its conflict with HMAS 'Sydney' in November 1914. Intertitles describe 'Sea Raider's sequence of events. Source: Byrnes, Paul 'Curators Notes' on 'The Exploits of the Emden'. Australian Screen [aso.gov.au] (Accessed 23rd March, 2015)"
