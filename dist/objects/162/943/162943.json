        "Made immediately after the Gallipoli landings, this feature film was praised for its patriotic spirit and realism, which included a Gallipoli re-enactment staged by real troops at Sydney's Tamarama Bay."

    "description": [
        "'Hero Of The Dardanelles' charts the fortunes of Will Brown (Guy Hastings) who answers his nation's call to do his duty. While only one third of the original film survives, it is a significant fragment of Australia's film heritage - not least for its inclusion of real troops and a real training camp at Liverpool, NSW and an elaborate re-enactment of the Gallipoli landings staged at Tamarama Bay. So convincing was the re-enactment that within a decade of 'Hero's' release, the landing sequence was being used erroneously as actuality. A hit with home-front audiences, whose appetite for heroic figures was yet to be sobered by the harsh realities of a protracted and bloody conflict, the film's anti-pacifist stance and clear messages to women about their duty to their own menfolk, provide valuable depictions of political currents of the day. The version presented here is a partial reconstruction made possible by the research of Dr Daniel Reynaud and the work of the NFSA.
