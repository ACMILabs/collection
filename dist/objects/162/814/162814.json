    "description": [
        "Born in 1890, Duke Kahanamoku was a Hawaiian-American five time Olympic medallist in swimming. After retiring from the Olympics, Kahanamoku travelled internationally, including to Australia. He gave swimming and surfing exhibitions which popularised the sport of surfing, previously known only in Hawaii. His surfing exhibition at Sydney's Freshwater Beach on December 23, 1914 is widely regarded as a seminal event in the development of surfing in Australia. In 1958, the newsreel cameras recorded his visit to Sydney's Bondi Beach and interaction with a young Australian surfboard rider."
