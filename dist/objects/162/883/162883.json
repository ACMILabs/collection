        "In 2011 the curator of  Film and Sound at the Australian War Memorial travelled with the Australian Defence Force to Afghanistan. This video is a compilation of footage and interviews recorded during a three week deployment alongside scores of Australian men and women serving in a variety of roles across the Middle Eastern Area of Operations, in a range of locations on base and in the field. Their fascinating and inspiring stories provide a unique insight into the life and times of Australia's current serving military, from young privates on their first deployment to senior ranking officers, all with their own perspective on Afghanistan, on life in the military, and on their own lives."
