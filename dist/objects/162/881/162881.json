        "In 2011, journalist John Martinkus was commissioned by the Australian War Memorial to record the life and times of ADF members in an active theatre of war - Afghanistan. In this, the second of three documentaries produced by Martinkus, he observes the arrival of new Australian troops to Patrol Base Samad, and outlines the difficult living conditions - including physical hardships and threat of Taliban attacks - under which Australian troops worked whilst mentoring Afghan National Army troops in this remote Afghanistan base during 2011."
