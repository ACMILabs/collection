        "This open ended Oscar Wilde tale challenges us to consider whether a bully is aware that they are a bully. It questions whether you can expect a bully to reform by asking them to reflect on their actions. The story shifts focus from the question \"what is a bully?\" to \"what is a true friend?\"."
