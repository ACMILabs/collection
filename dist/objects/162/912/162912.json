    "description": [
        "The 'Warburton Line' steam locomotive railway filmed originally in 1963, shows the clean and flowing Yarra River and the lush surrounds of the Yarra Valley as it meanders on its journey. Shot by Fred Daley, steam train enthusiast and 8mm home movie maker, this is a tribute to the Line as two years later \"despite opposition, 1965 line closed\". \"But the rails are not silent in April 1968\" when Fred and friends use a hand-pump rail car to run along the overgrown and forgotten tracks. His inter-title stating: \"Now it's goodbye Warburton June 1968 - perhaps the prettiest broad gauge line of all.\" The line found new use years later having been converted to a walking and cycle track but one gets the feeling Fred was right about the use of it as a railway line as this film stands testament to the grandeur and beauty of the original steam adventure."
