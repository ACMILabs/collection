    "description": [
        "Fred Daley, steam train enthusiast and 8mm home movie maker, follows his family's trip into the City of Melbourne. Starting out at St. Kilda Road, they go on into town to sample coffee and sandwiches al fresco-style before journeying on to an exciting game of Australian Rules football at the MCG (Geelong vs. Hawthorn). The family meanders around the fountain at the Southern Cross hotel and ventures to Cook's Cottage in the picturesque Fitzroy Gardens. They finish up the relaxing day with a cold beverage in the beer garden of the Chevron Hotel."
