    "description": [
        "Unbelievable as it may seem, in 1901 Australians were not allowed to swim in the sea during daylight hours. Public opinion saw this restriction soon abandoned, however due to many not being able to swim many people drowned. In reaction, groups of young volunteers were formed to patrol the beaches and eventually the surf life-saving movement was born and is now established world-wide. This package includes films from our earliest records of surf life-saving activities and the emergence of surf culture in Australia. The package also captures the innovation and evolution of surf-board riding, and board design."
