        "Futuristic satirical comedy which revolves around the use of drive-in theatres as internment camps for outcasts from society where the unemployed and weak are fed junk food, music and bad films. When the film's main character finds himself there by accident, he is obsessed by a desire to escape and find a new sense of purpose in his life."
