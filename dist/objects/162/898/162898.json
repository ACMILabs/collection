    "description": [
        "The A.R.C Cement Works, Geelong, in the early 1960s is faithfully captured here by Fred Daley, steam train enthusiast and 8mm home movie maker. Fred has recorded a moment in industry that - post 2000 - no longer exists, that of the use of powerful steam locomotives. With the 'loco' pulling people on this occasion and not cement, this is most likely a farewell celebration to the use of the engines at the Plant. Fred's titles tell us it is \"3ft 6 Gauge\" and there is a close up on an engine name-plate indicating this engine had come all the way from Manchester and  another \"1903 Leeds, Hudswell Clarke & Co Ltd No. 646\", a smaller black engine that had obviously been a working machine at the Cement Works for many a year. There is a sense of this being quite an occasion with many people visiting to take pictures and enjoy the plumes of steam from these majestic work horses."
