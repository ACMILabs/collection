        "Filmed in the mid 1960s by steam train enthusiast and home movie maker Fred Daley who captures a family outing to the popular sea-side amusement park in St Kilda. 'Luna Park' is shown in all its summertime glory with the 'River Boats', the 'Dodgems', the 'Rotor' (a washing spin cycle for humans!), 'The Spinner' and of course its famous wooden roller coasters, the 'Big Dipper' and the 'Scenic Railway'. Courageous Fred even films during the ride where you catch a glimpse of Port Phillip Bay from the very top!"
