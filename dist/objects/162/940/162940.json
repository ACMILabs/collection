        "This suite of four, short film compilations - 'Enlistment', 'Gallipoli', 'The Home Front' and 'April 25' - is the perfect place to begin exploring the National Film and Sound Archive's remarkable collection of film and still images from World War One."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "The following four compiles are drawn from the wealth of newly restored content from the National Collection. 'Enlistment' shows the departure of the Australian Imperial Force from Albany, Western Australian in November 1914; 'Gallipoli' features stills from the recently digitised Alan Anderson glass slide collection; 'The Home Front' captures various aspects of life in Australia, including the activities of the Red Cross; and 'April 25' combines war-era stills with footage from the 2014 Anzac service in Braidwood, NSW to highlight the significance of annual remembrance events across the country. The compilations are narrated by award-winning actor Bryan Brown and accompanied by music composed by Nerida Tyson-Chew."
