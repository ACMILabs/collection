        "This film, shot by steam train enthusiast and 8mm home movie maker Fred Daley, records a special day in the life of the train and line known as 'Puffing Billy' in Belgrave, Victoria. It would appear this is not just a regular day for the engine and visitors as people are dressed in their 'good clothes', there is a visit from a dignitary, possibly the Governor of Victoria at the time, speeches and some lovely vintage cars join the celebration. The line was extended to Emerald in 1965 so this is most likely the official opening of the extended line. It is the children who enjoy the day and the ride the most, as is traditional, hanging their legs out of the side of the open carriages, putting a coin on the track for the engine to flatten and waiving enthusiastically at cars through every crossing."
