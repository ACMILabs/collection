    "description": [
        "In 2011, journalist John Martinkus was commissioned by the Australian War Memorial to record the life and times of ADF members in an active theatre of war - Afghanistan. The Rotary Wing Group are the Australians whose job it is to pilot and maintain rotary wing aircraft from their base area at the Kandahar Airfield. In a country where road travel for personnel and supplies is fraught by the danger of 'Improvised Explosive Devices' and ambush, the role aircrews play is essential. In this film, members of the Chinook air and maintenance crew describe the challenges of flight over Afghanistan, as well as the pattern of everyday routine. The insider perspective affords real insight into what is probably a little known but essential aspect of Australian Defence Forces, bringing a fresh look at the life of Australian rotary crews and of the important role they played in supporting Australia's presence in Afghanistan."
