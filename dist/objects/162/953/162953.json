    "description": [
        "This compilation is a collection of abridged films from the NFSA collection of Australia's domestic war work. Australians rallied behind the war effort with a number of fundraising and recruiting activities aimed to encourage men to enlist. The Red Cross played a major role in these fundraising events and Martin Place was a popular spot to raise financial support for the war. The films depicting industry during the war would have been used to maintain morale in the wider community and to show Australia's high productivity in munitions and machinery. It also demonstrates the importance of women working in munitions factories. The compilation ends with footage of children engaged in a mock battle. Clearly staged for the camera, their game is a disquieting reminder of the generations whose childhoods were interrupted or overshadowed by the war\u2019s far-reaching impacts, which continued long after the declaration of peace."
