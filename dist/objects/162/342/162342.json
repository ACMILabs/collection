        "'Time Machine' is about robots that take over the world but there is a scientist that builds a robot that will take back the world. So it is your job to get past the boss. When you get past the boss you get a high score and the minions will try to kill you so watch out and have fun. There are bouncing pads that can help you jump higher and get things like health and score and save you too. There is also health which goes down when you are hit by evil robots or fireballs. Health packs increase your health."
