    "description": [
        "Captured here by Fred Daley, steam train enthusiast and 8mm home movie maker are highlights of a Melbourne family during the mid 1960s. Christmas for Fred included showing the trains of Flinders St and a W-Class Tram in the City of Melbourne, along with the famous 'Foy's Corner', corner of Bourke and Swanston St.  There are some amusements in the gardens and some 'Viking' boats rowing on the Yarra. A Santa in the back of a truck can only mean the office Christmas party. The family relax at a swimming pool and have a picnic in a bush setting. Back to a brief sequence of a helicopter landing on the helipad on the Yarra River, then there is a road trip. This features some impressive footage from the camera mounted on the car, to the Mornington Peninsula and Rosebud. Fred and the family relax staying at a caravan park at the beach, go water skiing, spend time in paddle boats and sand dune frolicking. A highlight is the joy flight taken over the area. Returning to the city, the family enjoy a sunny day at 'Luna Park' with the wonderful rides and amusements on offer. Fred's camera work on the 'Scenic Railway' in particular, shows his steady hand."
