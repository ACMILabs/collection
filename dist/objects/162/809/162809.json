        "'Crystal Voyager' was one of the most beautiful and successful surfing movies ever made. Shot largely in California, Greenough and his surfing friends Richie West (a Californian) and Nat Young (Australia\u2019s world champion surfer) take to Californian waters, searching for undiscovered waves. The final sequence is a 23 minute odyssey containing Greenough's legendary short film 'Echoes' and including extraordinary slow-motion footage shot inside the curl of the waves. The shots were achieved by using a camera in a waterproof housing, which was strapped to Greenough's back. The footage has an abstract beauty and is further enhanced by the music of Pink Floyd."
