        "Australia farewells its first troops to embark for service in World War One. The men's eager faces and their larrikin antics for the camera are all the more poignant with the knowledge that 60,000 of these young souls would never return home."

    "description": [
        "This compilation from the NFSA's collection begins with fragments of what is thought to be the only surviving footage of the famed Cooee March that saw 26 men set out on foot from Gilgandra, NSW to enlist. Next follows scenes of the NSW Expeditionary Forces at Randwick Racecourse, which was used as a camp for embarking soldiers - and as it happens, their mascots. The first troops are also shown leaving Sydney, followed by scenes of troops embarking from Albany, WA. The next clip shows Australian soldiers on camels in the Middle East. The compilation concludes with a selection of hand-coloured glass slides showing scenes of Gallipoli. Many of the original photographs were taken by Surgeon General Sir Charles S. Ryan, who appears in one of the images seated outside his dugout."
