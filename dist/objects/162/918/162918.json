        "Model railways and miniature steam locomotives have been a great hobby for people passionate about engines and also about 'quality' family time. Fred Daley, steam train enthusiast and 8mm movie maker, has captured a meeting of these enthusiasts running their miniature steam engines and pulling the kids along behind them in purpose built 'carriages'. There is a sense of camaraderie and enthusiasm from the people tending to their fully functioning but small steam locomotives. Both the little kids and the grown up kids seem to be having a lovely day out. [This film is the final segment from the original film 'ARC Cement Works, Geelong'.]"
