    "description": [
        "Upon the outbreak of World War One, the newly formed Australian branch of the Red Cross put great effort into training medical staff and sourcing supplies for the troops, both for those overseas and those that would return maimed and injured. These rare archival films show the enthusiasm and dedication of the mainly female volunteers in providing this vital support. It is not clear where or how this footage was screened, but the material is remarkable for both the detail of activities captured, and for the quality of the image itself, much of which is in excellent condition. The scene of the Red Cross in the linen room is in fast-motion. This effect would have been achieved at the time the material was filmed by cranking the camera at a rate lower than 16 frames per second, which was the speed at which the rest of the footage was filmed.
