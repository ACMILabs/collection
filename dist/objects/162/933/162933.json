        "Prior to the Anzac Centenary, the National Film and Sound Archive reviewed its collection of holdings on Australia's experience of World War One from a military, domestic and international perspective. Many of these films have been restored from original nitrate material. This package includes feature films like 'The Hero of the Dardanelles'; a documentary about one of Australia's best known solders, Sir John Monash; propaganda cartoons satirising the war; compilations around the recruitment, enlistment and training of soldiers; the effort of Australians on the home front and the vital role of the Red Cross."
