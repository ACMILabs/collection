        "Paul and Ben are blood brothers. They've got heaps of brothers and sisters, but they're the only ones with the same mum and dad. They live in Willmot, an isolated community on the outskirts of Western Sydney. It's a no-go zone, a suburban wasteland with huge powerlines overhead. Paul and Ben struggle to survive poverty, \"westie\" stigma, violence and abuse. Each has their own way of keeping feelings of powerlessness and fear at bay but, ultimately, they have each other. Their story is about family, love, loyalty and what it truly means to be a blood brother."
