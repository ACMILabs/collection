        "B.L.A.C.K. is a cipher scribed by independent and Indigenous Hip Hop artist, Wire MC. Through interviews and observation the song is visually and dialectically deconstructed to speak of contemporary issues around Aboriginal blackness, politics and culture. The filmmaker, with his own roots in Hip Hop, aligns himself with Wire MC and through a rapped narrative adds another layer of complexity to notions of blackness by pulling apart his own identity. This is a musical documentary that exposes an authentic and empowering  B.L.A.C.K. voice existing underneath the hype of \"bling-bling\" hip hop. This is a film with rhythm, rhyme and reason."
