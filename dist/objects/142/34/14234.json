    ], 
    "description": [
        "\"Coming out\" to family, living with HIV and religion - some of the life changing situations faced by two Aboriginal gay men, Sam Barsah and Aaron Clark. Sam has \"come out\" twice; first to his family about his sexuality and then about his HIV status. Like other indigenous gay men, he wants respect and understanding and only now, almost ten years later, does he feel able to speak openly about his story. Aaron is young and relatively new to Sydney. Growing up as a Jehovah's Witness, he is looking for an alternative gay Christian group. Using a contemporary blend of semi-observational filming, photos and animation, this short documentary about race and sexuality describes two very different stories of  being Aboriginal and gay. N.B.  \"Tidda\" is an Aboriginal word for \"sister\"."
