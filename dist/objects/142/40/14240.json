        "Documentary containing sensitive material about the death, in 2004, of a young 17 year-old Aboriginal boy from Gamilaroi country (Walgett) known as TJ Hickey. Through interviews and news footage, the film attempts to establish the truth of what really happened to TJ whose \"acccidental\" death not only triggered a riot between the Redfern community and the police, but also conspiracy theories, rumours and media misinformation."
