        "Zatul Rinzin Rinpoche is the 11th reincarnation of the lama (or spiritual leader) of the highest monastery in the world, Rongbuk, which lies at the foot of Mount Everest in western Tibet. In 1959, when the Chinese invaded Tibet, Rinzin was forced to flee his homeland. Now 57, he lives in Greystanes in the outer western suburbs of Sydney with his wife and three children. Rinzin is no longer a monk but he is still a lama - a responsibility he must hold his entire life. He now works as a security guard to support himself, his family and his monastery back in Tibet."
