        "A star studded short drama, Morris Loves Jack is an off-beat romance between Jack, a young policewoman and Morris, the charming but feckless out of work actor who shares her house and her money. She is happy to support him emotionally and financially in spite of his irresponsible attitude to life until she finds him in the arms of another. Starring Kris McQuade and John Hargraves"
