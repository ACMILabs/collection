        "Nice Coloured Girls contrasts the relationship between Aboriginal women and white men in the past and the present. The film juxtaposes contemporary images of black women taking advantage of a white man with voice over extracts from early journals of white settlers and sailors, in order to question the validity of conventional white history and to deny the image of Aborigines as passive and powerless."
