        "In an isolated community, a man and woman are promised under the traditional laws of marriage. The time has come for Delia and Alvin to move in together. Things don't turn out as smoothly as they might. My Bed, Your Bed explores notions of Aboriginal identity through an examination of the ways that Aboriginal people living in Central Australian bush communities adopt values from both contemporary and traditional works."
