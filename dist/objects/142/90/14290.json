        "Being a struggling artist is tough at the best of times but when you're thousands of miles from home, your debts are mounting and you're making no money, something's got to give. Amy made the long trip from Australia to London to paint. The rent on her workspace is now a month overdue, the landlord is knocking and working part-time in a cafe is not making ends meet. She could try selling her work - but that would entail showing people. Shot on location in London with original music by Horse Stories. Produced, directed and written by Catherine Green."
