        "Aboriginal couple Annika and Randle have very different ideas on how to approach the Sydney Harbour Bridge reconciliation march between black and white Australians. Annika thinks that they should be up there on that bridge showing their support while Randle prefers to show his support on a smaller, more personal scale. After the march a white woman collapses and, while Randle is off calling for an ambulance, Annika stays with the woman. It is here that she is forced to confront her own prejudice and ultimately acknowledge that she just may be one of the biggest hypocrites of all. Cast: Janine Matthews, Laurence Clifford, Victoria Longley"
