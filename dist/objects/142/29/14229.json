        "The good fight is a documentary film about masculinity in a modern world, spirituality and the lore of the boxing ring. Set in Dulwich Hill, Sydney's inner west, the film delves into the gritty existence of a local 'Fight Club' led by an unlikely character, Rev. Dave Smith. The story evolves around Rev. Dave's relationships with the young people who frequent the Fight Club. Includes interviews with Jared Tekaki, Craig (Shorty) Sutton, Shaun Joyce and Alex Tui. Contains some b&w images."
