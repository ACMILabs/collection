        "A young Aboriginal girl seeks revenge for the death of her older brother"
    ], 
    "description": [
        "A young Aboriginal girl wants to revenge the death of her older brother who has died while in jail for a petty crime. He was the only person she had in the world and now, desperately alone and angry, she finds the judge that sentenced her brother. The film unfolds in the judge's bachelor apartment where he is tied up and held captive as each of them confront their own judgements and their own pain. An intense drama between two completely different people in one room over one night unfolds as they both behave in unexpected ways. Human emotions cross between the race, sex and class divide as each rediscover the meaning of loneliness, loss and judgement. Cast: Shai Pittman, Chris Haywood"
