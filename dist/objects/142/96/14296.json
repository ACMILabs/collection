        "A beautiful aesthetic piece of instrumental contemporary classical music, in rondo form (repetition of a single theme) with various tempi and expressions (music cycle). Colin Chee uses animation to portray music as both a life force and an escape from reality. Ethereal in style, movement and sound. Music composed by Rae Howell or Sunwrae."
