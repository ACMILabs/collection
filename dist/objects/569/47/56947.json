        "Investigates some of the problems of school administration and management by focusing upon a dramatized presentation of one of the first days in the job of Annie Probert, a newly appointed school principal. Although she is not feeling well, her day looks fairly simple. However, as the days develops, unexpected problems intervene and Annie becomes a victim of the multiple expectations that are a universal hazard of the job. Useful in the areas of decision making, conflict resolution, time management and leadership."
