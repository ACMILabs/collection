        "This sensitive drama examines the effects of divorce on a family, particularly on a twelve-year-old girl. Although Helen Murray's parents were divorced two years ago, Helen still hopes for a reconciliation. When a visit from her father is cancelled, an emotionally charged confrontation with her mother takes place. Helen admits her anguish over the divorce and realizes that she must learn to accept the situation. An excellent film for both children and adults on the themes of family communications and coping positively with family break-up, The Way It Is can be used for discussion in family-life courses and single-parent groups, and for individual and couples counselling. Cast: Stephanie Daniel, Anick Farris, Kevin Riley, Ronna Sinclair, Shauna Wilkie"
