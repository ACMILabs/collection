        "A humorous parody of David Attenborough's \"Life on earth\" documentaries. Our suburban mode of existence with its annual return to the beach resorts is likened to the ritualistic behaviour of members of the animal kingdom. Raises issues about the way we define the behaviour of cultures different from our own. Contains an early performance by Steve Vizard."
