        "Episode of Series \"Changes...From the Inside\". Devised by Glenn and Les Mack for the Supplementary Grants Program and shows a school community breaking down barriers to encourage community involvement in school decision making. The school draws its pupils from a housing commission estate and the principal's aim is to create a school that responds to the community rather than the conventional process of making the commnity respond to the bureaucratic needs of the school."
