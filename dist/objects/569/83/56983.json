        "Follows the trials and tribulations of the unsuccessful exploration team of Sir Ernest Shackleton which set off from South America aboard the \"Endurance\" to sail to the Antarctic via South Georgia Island. After 9 weeks at sea, the ship was caught by an ice pack and frozen in. Uses archival footage, comments by surviving team members and original film footage taken by Frank Hurley. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
