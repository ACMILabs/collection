        "Presents an overview of the work of conservationists Laurie Levy and Neal Bethune established the Whale Rescue Centre in Melbourne. They argue against the view that whales mass suicide and stress attempts should be made to save them. Includes footage of both successful and unsucessful attempts to rescue stranded whales on the Victorian and Tasmanian coasts. Narrated by Lynda Stoner."
