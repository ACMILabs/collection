        "Canadian poet Earle Birney indulges his love of trains in this performance of his sound poem \"To Swindon from London by Britrail\". Told in fluent \"trainish\", he interprets the experience of excursions by rail. Imagination sparked by the rhythm of wheels and the clink of couplings, Birney hums, hisses and hoots his way through archival footage of vintage trains and English countryside. A must for language, animation and train buffs."
