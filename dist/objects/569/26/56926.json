        "Depicts the conflicts faced by an adolescent girl who must choose between her dream to be a singer-song writer or living up to her mother's hopes by following a secure but not totally satisfying career as a bookkeeper. This film would be useful for discussion of values, decision making and communication. Cast includes Trini Alvarado, Joanna Merlin. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
