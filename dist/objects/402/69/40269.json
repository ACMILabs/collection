        "This video seminar presentation led by Debra Smith and Helen Sutton looks at spelling and usage of words in the pursuit of achieving total accuracy in written communication. Areas covered include: a fun test to see how good your spelling is; how and when to use your computer's spellchecker; capitalisation rules; when to use numbers and when to use words (50 or fifty); 200 frequently misspelled words; frequently misused words; the most commonly confused pairs of words and a proofreading post-test to see how much you've learnt."
