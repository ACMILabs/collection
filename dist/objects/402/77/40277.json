        "Carl Fitzgerald (Sam Neill) is the hard-luck hero in this pleasant little black comedy set in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick. Carl lands a chef's job in the cockroach infested kitchen of a dodgy nightclub. He meets a luscious young barmaid (Zoe Carides) who has the hots for him, but as luck would have it, the rocky romance is headed for trouble when an unfortunate incident at the club embroils Carl in a complicated mess. He enlists the help of his mate Dave (John Clarke)...things can only get worse from here on."
