        "Director Billy Wilder's acclaimed 1957 courtroom melodrama based on Agatha Christie's hit London play left audiences reeling from its surprise twists and shocking climax. Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich and Elsa Lanchester make this Oscar nominated classic a rivetiing experience. When a wealthy widow is found murdered, her married suitor, Leonard Vole (Power) is accused of the crime. At his trial, everyone is stunned when the prosecution calls Vole's wife (Dietrich) to testify against him. Now it is more difficult than ever for Vole's flamboyant defence attorney (Laughton) to prove that his client is innocent."
