        "As seen on ATN 7 The World around us. A record of a month long expedition by Greg Grainger to Irian Jaya to observe the rituals and customs of two remote highland tribes in the Baliem Valley. Anthropologists believe that the Asmats of Senggo in the rainforests are the last surviving culture to occasionally practise cannibalism, head hunting and ritualised warfare. Shows aspects of the Dani way of life in Wamena."
