        "Bernard is an eccentric clockmaker; Terese is the sultry young Salvation Army worker with whom he is having an affair. Obsessed by the past, he finds a golden braid in an 18th century cabinet and immerses himself in the pursuit of a fantasy. It is up to Terese to lure him away from the ghost of the past, reignite their passion and seduce him back to reality."
