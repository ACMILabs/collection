        "Designed to develop skills which will enable employees to cope with change and managers to introduce change with positive effects. Part 1 looks at understanding change. Part 2 presents keys to becoming change skilled, to become a victor rather than a victim of change. Part 3 gives six steps to responding to organisational change while Part 4 examines the development of future tense thinking. A handbook accompanies the series with exercises to reinforce relevant points."
