        "This adventure records the superb wildlife and wilderness of outback Canada, beginning in the stunning Queen Charlotte Islands, the Galapagos of North America. We sail past foraging bears, whales, raccoons, seals and sea lions, catching Coho Salmon in the land Haida Indians. The action then moves to the Rocky Mountains with a spectacular horse trek and white water rafting in the famous raging rapids. We then travel to Baffin Island in the Arctic Circle to hunt caribou and seal with the Inuit Indians - the Canadian Eskimos. It is a wonderful journey through the beautiful and remote Canadian wilderness."
