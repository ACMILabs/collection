        "Only weeks before the August 1991 coup in Moscow, Australian Greg Grainger embarked upon a ten thousand kilometre odyssey across the U.S.S.R., through Siberia and Central Asia, observing the lives of people at a time of extraordinary change. We observe Russia' first ever presidential elections, visiting a polling station as Boris Yeltsin makes his historical win. A look at the lives of ordinary people in a time of extraordinary changes. See the stunning beauty of a Siberian summer, journey thousands of kilometres on the Trans Siberian Railway, drink vodka with soldiers and travel the legendary Silk Road through Uzbekistan, visiting ancient cities such as Bukhara and Samarkand."
