        "Episode of Series \"Olympic glory: the golden years\". The Olympic tradition has not only fostered great sporting champions, it has created immortal images of heroic proportions. Legends such as Johnny Weissmuller, Emil Zatopek, Ron Clarke and many others have become household names, their personalities taking over where sporting achievement leaves off. This is their story - a story of heroes and heartbreak - where athletes are pushed to breaking point and beyond in the struggle for Olympic glory. It is also a look at the lighter side of the Olympic personality and the truth behind the iron-clad determination athletes must present in the heat of competition! Production is based on the \"Big Fights Olympic Library\"."
