        "Based on John Braine's best-seller and directed by Jack Clayton, the top-notch cast, steamy sex scenes and candid exploration of class-divided Britain had critics hailing it as one of the most vivid stories of modern times. Determined to make it to the top, returned serviceman, Joe Lampton (Laurence Harvey) pursues the daughter of the richest man in town (Heather Sears). At the same time, irresistibly drawn to an older, married woman (Simone Signoret), Lampton becomes tangled in a web of lies and deceit which can only end in tragedy. Nominated for six Oscars and honoured with Academy Awards for Best Actress and Best Screenplay, this film is truly a great British classic."
