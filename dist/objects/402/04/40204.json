        "Edmund Purdom and Ann Bltyh star in this romantic musical set to the music of Sigmund Romberg. Prince Karl is in love, but not with the princess he is supposed to wed in a state-arranged marriage. The object of his affections is a mere Heildberg barmaid. Mario Lanza provided the singing for the film."
