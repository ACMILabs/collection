        "This live video seminar presentation with Debra Smith and Helen Sutton begins with a one-page pre-test to determine your current proofreading accuracy. By the end of the program you'll be able to see and measure your improvement! Some of the skills learned include: spotting common typographical errors; how to correct writing without changing the meaning; overcoming monotony and staying alert when proofreading; creating distance from your work so you can coorect your own errors; how to use proofreader's marks for consistency and time saving and how to stay alert and accurate."
