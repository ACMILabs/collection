        "Deals with the treatment and care of children crippled by cerebral palsy and poliomyelitis. The program of treatment is designed to integrate children into society. Demonstrates how training and practice in the handling of toys and hobby materials can be transformed into handling of tools and utensils necesary for everyday life. Photographed in a summer camp, the film ends as a small boy leaves his parents to take his first steps on a crowded city street. Academy Award winner for best short documentary 1947. Narrated by Winston O'Keefe."
