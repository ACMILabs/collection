        "Program leader Jimmy Calano, provides a step-by-step seminar presentation where we learn to turn a dreadful task into a motivating tool. Performance appraisals are one of the toughest jobs in management, yet executed properly they are an important way to keep people growing. Some of the skills include how to identify over- and under-performing achievers, eight traditional performance appraisal methods and how to design an appropriate appraisal format."
