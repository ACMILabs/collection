        "As seen on ATN 7s \"World Around Us\", this documentary looks at the lives of the Cambodian people one decade after the downfall of Pol Pot. Over one million Cambodians lost their lives as a result of his genocidal policies. A train trip across Cambodia, reveals a country and people freed from the shackles of tyrannical despotism. It is a film of enormous courage which offers a unique insight into the culture and strength of a country torn apart by political and social genocide."
