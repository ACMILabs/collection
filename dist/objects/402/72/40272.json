        "This video and guide were prepared to aid overseas students' undestanding of communication in Australia. They allow the student to consider the similarities and differences in social rules that exist between cultures. The video is 18 minutes long and includes 10 scenes illustrating communication difficulties that the student may experience whilst living in Australia. The guide has been designed to follow the scenes in the video, briefly summarising each scene, discussing potential questions, and commenting about the situation and the associated socil rule."
