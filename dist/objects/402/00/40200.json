        "Skippy, the famous bush kangaroo, joins with her friends in the National Park for three exciting adventures. In \"Skippy and the vandals\", Jerry is accused of vandalising the local school. With the help of Skippy, the vandals are soon caught. In \"Skippy and the beach bullies\", Jerry, Lou and Skippy are enjoying the beach. However, two bullies are intent on spoiling their fun and getting Skippy into trouble with the Police. The final episode entitled \"Skippy and the balloon\" has a young Japanese tourist aloft in a balloon over the park because he doesn't want to go home!"
