        "This is compelling viewing, documenting a communist country as it undergoes profound changes. The program traces the breakdown of the communist system, watching Soviet soldiers withdraw for the first time since the Popular Uprising of 1956. \"Danube interlude\" shows Hungary at its most majestic, from a gentle trip down the Danube River to a ride on the famous Lippizan horses in the Bukk National Park."
