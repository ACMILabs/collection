        "An intimate portrayal of the experiences of three terminally ill cancer patients being cared for at home. By allowing these patients and those closest to them to tell their own stories, the film conveys a broad range of circumstances, amotions, and insights including the fear and confusion felt by those coping with terminal illness and the strengthening of family bonds that can accompany this distress."
