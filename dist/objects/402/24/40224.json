        "The ultimate travel fantasy begins with a gondola ride in Venice and ends on a cruise ship in the Pacific. In between, the armchair traveller can take a hot air balloon ride in France, fly Concorde with Lauren Bacall, see the snow covered Mount Batchelor or the world from the cockpit of an American Fighter Plane. A more sedate time can be had riding an elephant on a South African safari. This video documents the ultimate in around-the-world travel."
