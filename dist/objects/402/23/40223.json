        "Moving beyond the popular images of ugly labour camps and frozen wastelands, Siberia in summer is stunningly beautiful as the inahabitants take advantage of the warm weeks. In St. Petersburg, we ride up the canals, incliding the famous Winter Canal. Joy turns to sadness as the mass war graves of half a million Russians who died during the seige of Leningrad in World War II, are visited. Filmed at the time of great change, this is a compelling insight into the lives of the soviets."
