        "Reporter James Penfield makes his money rearranging the facts, a talent he ruthlessly exploits in his friendship and love affairs. A political drama set against the backdrop of the Falkland's crisis, the film takes a wry look at the Government's attempt to justify the war. Set in the heartland of bourgeois England among media creators and academics, the personal, political and historical deceit of Thatcher's Britain is ruthlessly exposed. Stars Jonathan Pryce and Tim Curry and features an astonishing climax as the crew and cast filmed undercover during the Conservative Party Conference."
