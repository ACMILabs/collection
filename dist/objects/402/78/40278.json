        "Nicholas Cage is Jack Singer, a second-rate private eye who has somehow managed to win the undying love of gorgeous school teacher, Betsy Nolan (Sarah Jessica Parker). Now, after 5 years Betsy wants a commitment, but Jack is plagued by his mother's deathbed wish that he never marry. In an irrational moment Jack relents and they travel to Vegas to exchange their vows, and this is where the trouble begins. Featuring James Caan as a wealthy, evil card-shark and a cast including several-hundred Elvis impersonators, it's a hunka hunka burnin' fun!"
