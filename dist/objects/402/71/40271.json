        "Designed to assist managers in the implementation of change and to ensure that employees deal with change effectively. Part 1 examines management and leadership issues and understanding the processes involved in organisational change. Part 2 looks at planning for change rather than allowing it to happen suddenly. Part 3 presents the \"4 C's\" involved in managing the implementation of change. Part 4 highlights the issues involved in leading a team into the future. A handbook accompanies the series with exercises to reinforce relevant points."
