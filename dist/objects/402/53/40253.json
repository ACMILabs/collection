        "In this seminar presentation with Stephen Carline, we learn powerful new ways to control the flow of information by using the key question guide to keep interviews on track in order to get the required information. We learn to compile and analyse the interview information to reach a smart hiring decision. Interview and hiring skills are too important to \"pick up as you go\". This program provides complete and professional training in how to select employees who will contribute positively to your organisation."
