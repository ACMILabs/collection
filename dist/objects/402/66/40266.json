        "This is an audiocassette seminar led by Mickey Kinder. How do you get people excited about working - when their work isn't all that exciting? This is one of the toughest challenges facing managers. Ultimately the organisations success depends on an interested, motivated staff. This audio program describes motivational strategies that get results from inspiring staff from within. Some of the skills you will learn include; motivational strategies for specific situations, including self-directed teams, how to keep spirits high during down-sizing, how to start new employees off on the right foot, and how to recognise the needs of current employees. Looks at motivational theories to explain the types of motivation available and the situations in which they do or do not work."
