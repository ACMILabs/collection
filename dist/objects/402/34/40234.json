        "Examine the wide diversity of cultures that are flourishing in the South Pacific and examine the traditions and customs of our nearest neighbours. Visit Tonga and meet the Pacific's last remaining Royal Family and feast with a rowdy traditional local wedding; travel to colourful Tahiti for a celebration of physical strength and competition; off the island of Bora Bora in waters thick with colourful fish, watch local Tahitian fishermen test their strength against the sea; and in Fiji's Yasawa Islands witness an ancient Kava ceremony."
