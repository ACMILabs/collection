        "Walt Disney and his staff of animators the 1950s were marked by transitions and experimentation, resulting in some of the most revolutionary cartoons ever released. The technique of \"limited animation\" and sylised design won \"Toot, whistle, plunk and boom\" the Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject of 1953. Breakthrough results were also achieved in \"Noah's Ark\", which utilised stop-action photography and the animation of stick figures composed on pencils, cork and pipe cleaners. Titles included are: \"Lambert, the sheepish lion\" 1951, \"Pigs is pigs\" 1954, \"Toot, whistle, plunk and boom\" 1953, and \"Noah's Ark\" 1959."
