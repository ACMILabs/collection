        "In this seminar presentation with Stephen Carline, we learn that when people don't succeed, it is rarely because they lack skills or credentials. It is usually because they don't fit in. This program helps to find the ones who will fit. Learn powerful new ways to determine what you really need in the position by learning to write job descriptions that help you define excactly what you are seeking. Discover how to see past resume hype by preparing pertinent questions to get a clear picture of each candidate's track record."
