        "Filmed on the eve of the historic Arafat Peace Agreement and records the daily lives and views of Jews, Palestinians and Christians. We learn how they perceive their country during this time of change, how they deal with constant war and the conflicts of the different religions in the Middle East. We are taken on a series of adventures; camel riding across the Negev Desert to meet nomadic Bedouin tribesman, kibbutz living on a Lebanon border and driving tanks in the Golan Heights. We also see female soldiers on the Syrian border, a Jewish wedding and the ultra-orthodox Jews of Mea Shearim who dress in 18th Centruy styles from Eastern Europe."
