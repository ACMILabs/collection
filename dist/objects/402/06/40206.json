        "Beth (Lisa Harrow) is a successful novelist who runs her career and inner-city household, \"Chez Nous\" with great energy and humour, despite her hectic life with her French husband (Bruno Ganz), her carefree teenage daughter (Miranda Otto) and a new boarder (Kiri Paramore). The return of her younger sister, Vicky (Kerry Fox) sparks a chain of events which escalate in the intense heat of an Australian Summer and could spell the last days of \"Chez Nous\". Also stars Bill Hunter."
