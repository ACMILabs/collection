        "Full of surprises, this film did more than win extraordinary critical acclaim throughout the world. It upstaged the competition by receiving six Academy Award nominations and an Oscar for Best Screenplay. Set in Ireland, this spellbinding thriller involves a black British soldier, Jody (Forest Whittaker), who befriends his reluctant IRA captor, Fergus (Stephen Rea). When Jody is killed in an ambush, Fergus fulfills his dying wish - to find his girlfriend Dil (Jaye Davidson) in England. When Fergus and Dil become romantically involved, the crying game begins. Electrifying and seductive, this is the movie that had everyone talking. Also stars Miranda Richardson."
