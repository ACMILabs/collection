        "A riveting courtroom drama of rape and premeditated murder is brought to life with an all-star cast in Otto Preminger's suspenseful and highly acclaimed production. Packed with drama, passion and intrigue, the film pits humble small-town lawyer, Jimmy Stewart against hard-headed city prosecutor, George C. Scott. Emotions flare as jealous army lieutenant, Ben Gazzara pleads innocent to murdering the rapist of his seductive, beautiful wife, Lee Remick. Honoured with seven Academy Award nominations and featuring a brilliant score by Duke Ellington, this film is a masterpiece that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Based on the novel by Robert Traver."
