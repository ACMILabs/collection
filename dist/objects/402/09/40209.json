        "Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) witnesses the arrival of flying saucers from an alien world. Thus begins an incredible series of events, culminating in the ultimate encounter with other worldly beings as Neary is led aboard the awesome mothership. Humans and aliens have made peaceful contact. Spielberg has replaced certain scenes with previously unreleased footage and expanded the dimensions of special effects with a breathtaking new ending that takes the viewer inside the dazzling Mothership and beyond the outer reaches of the imagination. Cast also includes Teri Garr and a special appearance by Francois Truffaut as Lacombe."
