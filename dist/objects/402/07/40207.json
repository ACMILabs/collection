        "When a volcanic eruption destroys the mining colony on Jupiter's moon Io, Michael, Kumiko, Gereard, Kingston, Anna and a small group of surviving adults are forced to flee their crumbling world. They convert the derelict space station KL5 into a makeshift spacecraft and head off in a desperate attempt to reach Earth. Their hazardous journey takes them past the spectacular rings of Saturn and through a massive asteroid belt. As they approach the safety of Earth one last and unpredicatable disaster awaits them. There is only one chance for survival... Based on the Film Australia/NHK Co-production."
