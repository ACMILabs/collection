        "This seminar presentation with Lisa Ford looks at pleasing the challenging customer; defusing anger, solving problems and recovery skills. Some of the things you'll learn include; why customers complain, the most common reason, how to empathise with customers and keys to fast, effective problem solving. This is the antidote to high-stress situations, times when customers seem especially difficult."
