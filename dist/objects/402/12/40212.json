        "Episode of Series \"The Adventures of Tintin\". Based on the novel \"The Crab with the golden claws\" by Herge, this is the story of Tintin and his loyal friend Snowy. In this adventure Tintin finds himself following a trail of clues that starts with an empty crab tin. Tintin first meets Captain Haddock, a prisoner aboard his own ship due to his liking for whiskey. A more loyal friend Tintin will never have. By the end of his journey you'll have a taste of Haddock's unusual exclamations: pockmark, gibbering ghost, freshwater swabs, blistering barnacles, and many more!"
