        "The installation is composed from 'fragments' of video and audio captured in real time from short bursts of activity to longer passages of action or inaction.  Each monitor contains an individual person who has been videotaped while barracking for a particular sport. Each person is presented in close-up, with the eyeline straight to camera, staring directly at the viewer. The sound of each person is also in 'close-up', transmitted through a number of loudspeakers in the space. With apparent proximity, we can hear great detail in the breath and voice."
