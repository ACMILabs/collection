        "Episode of Series \"Cities\". Hildegard Knef opens Berlin to the viewers of this film in an extensively historical yet highly personal manner. She introduces us to her personal family history and to the ramifications of Nazi power. The tour also includes historical footage of the \"formidable women who cleaned up the rubble of demolished Berlin\" after World War II, of John Kennedy's famous speech declaring his Berlin citizenship, of the 15-foot-high concrete barricade that divides the city, and of the airlift that kept the city of two million people totally supplied."
