        "Episode of Series \"Our Asian neighbours: India\". The \"God rich colony\" is a huge industrial estate on the outskirts of Bombay. It is a self-contained company town where everything is provided for the factory workers and their families, including schools. An Australian director and a group of 15 year-old school children have a relaxed discussion about their concept of the Australian way of life and their lives in India."
