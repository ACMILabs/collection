        "Episode of Series \"Geometry\". Computer animation records the deformation of regular closed curves and the rotation of tangent vectors and demonstrates the theorem that two regular curves in the plane which are regularly homotopic must have the same rotation number. Concludes with a concrete problem and a challenge to explore the converse of the theorem as discussed in part 2."
