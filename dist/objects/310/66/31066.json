        "Episode of Series \"Sentinel\". The Army Aviation Centre at Oakey, Queensland, has more helicopter movements per year than any other airfield in Australia. Therefore the potential of aircraft accidents is great. The Army Aviation Corps have devised a crash rescue system designed to provide medical assistance to crash victims in the shortest possible time."
