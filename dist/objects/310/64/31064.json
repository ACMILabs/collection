        "One of three films as part of the National Drug Education Program which take an in-depth view of drug addiction in the day-to-day lives of ordinary people. Bob, a travelling salesman in children's wear is an alcoholic. Although his is a loving family, his drinking and gambling cause his wife great stress and anguish. His drinking leaves him with little or nothing for housekeeping and expenses as he often \"drinks\" away his wages. Bob wants to lead a normal life and \"tomorrow he'll be sober\", but for him, tomorrow never comes. Photography by Dean Semler. (See also \"All in the same boat\" T/C 012758 and \"Hassles\" T/C 012851)."
