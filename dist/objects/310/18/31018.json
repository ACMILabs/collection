        "Presented by the 14 Eastern States in co-operation with the United States Department of Agriculture, this film tells a story about a boy at a summer camp who, bored with camp routine, adventures into the forest, talks with the birds and animals, gets lost in the woods, sees the destructiveness of a forest fire, and returns to camp with a better understanding and appreciation of forests and forestry. However, the basic message of the film would appear to be that if we look after our forests, they will serve us better, ie the manufacture of plastics and chemicals etc rather than saving forests and preserving the ecology."
