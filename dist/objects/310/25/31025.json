        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Web of life\". Looks at some of the strange plants seen on a journey from the shores of the Caribbean in Venezuela to the moorlands and peaks of the Andes Mountains, then across the world to Mount Kenya, with its weird giant plants and tiny sunbirds. Shows how plants and animals survive in extreme conditions and also indicates that today the seemingly invulnerable mountains are less secure from human intrusion."
