        "Episode of Series \"Wildlife Australia\". Observes insect, bird and animal life around creeks and billabongs-the metamorphosis of a grublike mudeye into a dragonfly, yabbies, a kingfisher begging a meal from another kingfisher, a caddis fly building itself a sort of flying fortress to swim about in - and explains with superb close-ups, why wrigglers wriggle. The interrelationship of creatures living in these two aquatic environments, and the food chains of animal life found in freshwater are shown. Depicts the metamorphosis of the dragon-fly and the mosquito and looks at the caddis-fly, yappy, platypus, Murray cod and the water-rat."
