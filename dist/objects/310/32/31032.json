        "Examines the status of women in Japan since the end of World War II, and their new social and economic conditions. Raises the question of whether the Japanese women are better off since their emancipation from the traditional way of life. Shows the changed life of women of the fishing villages and rice farms, and of women in the city; geishas, a Zen-Buddhist 'Garden of Nothingness', and the famous Japanese Tea Ceremony are also recorded. Awards: Winner of Silver Award, Documentary Category, Australian Film Awards, 1965)"
