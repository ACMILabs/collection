        "An introduction to the country and civilisation that produced the intricate gold ornaments and artefacts shown in the recent Columbian Gold Exhibition. Historical maps and lithographs intercut with present day living conditions explain the disastrous effects of European domination of the Indians, and explains why, with so little of their complex and powerful civilisation left, these gold objects remain the Indian's most refined cultural expression"
