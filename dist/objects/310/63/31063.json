        "In 1972 a Chinese archaeological dig excavated the tomb of a woman who had been buried for 2,100 years. The body was so well preserved that many different scientific teams were requested to dissect and examine it to determine what it could reveal about ancient Chinese civilisation. With English commentary and subtitles."
