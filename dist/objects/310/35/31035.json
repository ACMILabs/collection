        "Episode of Series \"Monday Conference\". Dr. William Belsen, who has carried out extensive research on children, television and violence, talks with a Monday Conference audience comprising researchers, industry people, teachers and parents. Many interesting areas are touched upon including the difficulty of establishing casual links between television violence and real violence carried out by children, how parents can identify which programs are likely to be \"casually\" violent, and the possible cathartic effect of television violence"
