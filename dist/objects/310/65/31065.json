        "Shows the works of two artistic and talented Australian fashion designers. Jenny Kee's colourful designs are inspired by the tones of the bush, birds and flora, whilst Linda Jackson's inspiration comes from the ocean and the sealife. Jenny's designs are made up into outstandingly colourful handknitted garments, whilst Linda uses chiffons, cottons and appliqued designs."
