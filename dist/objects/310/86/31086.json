        "Episode of Series \"Why can't they be like we were?\". Mick, the adolescent son of migrant parents, has been in trouble with the law since he was in Year 8 at school. He did not succeed at school. He cannot find a job and believes he is better off on the dole than working in a factory. He is hooked on tattoos and his ambition is to be tattooed all over. Explores the problems of being young in Mt. Druitt (New South Wales). NB: A sequal to this film was made two years later - \"Mick revisited\" (Title code 012754)."
