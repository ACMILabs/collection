        "Sponsored by the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Developments, this film adopts a satirical approach to the needs of a coastal dwelling nation like Australia actively trying to preserve coastline ecosystems. The film is short and its \"message\" is sharp: building on sand is insecure in more than one sense. Largely because of the humorous approach taken by the scriptwriter, the future impact of interference with dune communities should be felt by all audiences but, in particular, those who see the film in the classroom."
