        "The platypus is one of nature's shy creatures. Only twice has a platypus bred in captivity. Because they are found only in Australia, and will not breed in zoos, most people know very little about the platypus. This exceptional film shows the platypus on dry land, underwater and, by means of carefully sectioned burrow, we even follow him into his home. This is a unique chance to see the mammal in its natural environment. Suitable for primary school level."
