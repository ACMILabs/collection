        "Episode of Series \"Journey into the Himalayas\". Ladakh, known as Little Tibet, lies to the North East of Kashmir. Keith Adam finds that its barren moon-like landscape provides a stark contrast to the soft, green hills of Kashmir. The capital, Leh, has been for centuries an important regional trading centre, and remains as such today."
