        "Episode of Series \"Why can't they be like we were?\". Rui is a young adolescent with an industrial inner suburb as a playground. His family does not get away during the school vacation so in order to cope with his environment Rui and his friend Con act out fantasies borrowed from television police dramas. While offering positive criticism on improving the area he also displays how he has been hardened by his environment. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
