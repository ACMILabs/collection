        "This film about the National Gallery of Victoria is beautifully conceived and deserves its many film festival awards. Kerry Brown (editor) and Graham Chase (cinematographer) provide stunning contrasts, dissolves and cut images of the architectural design and art holdings. The Great Hall with its lead light ceiling and water window is also featured. These images are complimented by Leslie Dempsey's impressive electronic score. This film is carefully composed without voice-over narration. Winner of top awards at film festivals in Cork, Brussels, San Francisco, Melbourne and Chicago. Edited by Graham Chase. No spoken commentary."
