        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 11: \"Red Star\" The story of Russia's massive lonely war with its 20,000,000 military and civilian casualties. A Leningrad housewife who survived the 890 day siege from September 1941, until January 1944 appears in this program. She agrees she was lucky to survive. In her city of three million inhabitants 200,000 people were killed by German shells, a further 630,000 died of cold or starvation. Incredibly the Russians survived and went on to rout the Germans. Part 12: \"Whirlwind\" The blitz on Britain brings strident public demand for revenge bombing but by the end of 1941 Britain's force of 700 aircraft is being eaten into by the demands of the North Africa and Atlantic battles. The arrival of Arthur \"Bomber\" Harris to take charge of Bomber Command heralds a new attitude. Harris is very much in favour of revenge - \"They have sowed the wind and now shall reap the whirlwind\", he proclaims publicly. More important, he believes that bombing can, on its own, defeat Germany."
