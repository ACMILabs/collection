        "A lively and realistic video training program, demonstrates spill response and clean up procedures in comprehensive step by step detail. Beginning at the moment a spill happens, the program takes viewers through the process of identifying, reporting, containing, cleaning up and decontaminating the spill. The program demonstrates three spill scenarios of different severity: an environmental contaminant; a highly toxic acid spill; and a medium flammable spill. A complete training program designed for all employees who work with hazardous chemicals or respond to spills."
