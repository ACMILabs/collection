        "He's on a mission and that's just where he belongs! He's told not to engage the enemy. \"Just take pictures\", they say. But telling Rambo to hold back is like ordering a rattle-snake not to bite. Rambo's dropped into the Vietnam jungle to find out if there are still any POW's about. There are. And now Rambo's going to get them home - on his own! Caption version only available. Rated: M"
