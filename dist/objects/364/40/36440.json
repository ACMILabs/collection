        "Episode number 7 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 13: \"Tough Old Gut\" Winston Churchill describes Italy to Stalin as the \"soft underbelly of the crocodile\". It is his arguments that persuade the Americans to join the Allies - reluctantly. On the road home in November, 1942, eleven months after Pearl Harbour, they meet the Wehrmacht for the first time. And in Tunisia they suffer what is to be their worst defeat of the war at the hands of the better equipped more experienced Afrika Corps. Part 14: \"It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow\" Monsoonal conditions for five months of every year and disease make the lot of the Burma Army \"just another nightmare\". Europeans find jungle conditions alien and the Japanese ability to not only endure but to thrive in the same circumstances helps build a \"superman\" myth among the Allied soldiers."
