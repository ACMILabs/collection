        "A portrayal of a young woman's conflict with an unresponsive world. Cath is rushed to hospital after a suicide attempt and the film traces back to her adolescence to reveal what has led to a despair so severe that suicide appears to be her only option. Her conflicts with her family, principally with her father, are later identified in her relationship with her husband. Each leads her to attempt suicide. Both attempts are the result of her utter despair at the loss of the love of the person who matters the most to her."
