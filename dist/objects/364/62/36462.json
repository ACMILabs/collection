        "This documentary about Aboriginal women today includes interviews with successful, strong Aboriginal women, including Sally Morgan, Lois Olney, Helen Corbett and Helen Dorondorf. Stills of Aboriginal people and the land, stories in two Aboriginal languages about their fate after the white man, and Aboriginal music and dance are presented between the interviews. The women raise issues about how the Aboriginal people can best help themselves, and recount their own life experiences and achievements. Highly successful, these women act as a foil to the bulk of information received through the media about Aboriginal people. They are positive role models for Aboriginal women and girls."
