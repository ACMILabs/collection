        "Rare insight into the prime ministership and life at the top. There are wide-ranging interviews with five successive prime ministers from Sir John Gorton, Sir William Mcmahon, Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser to Bob Hawke, tracing how the prime ministership has evolved since Federation and what the role entails today, interwoven with absorbing reflections from the five men whose terms of office span one of the most eventful eras in Australian politics. The wives of the prime ministers are also interviewed. They discuss adjusting to domestic and official life at The Lodge; the effect of stress and the prime ministerial workload on their husbands; and of the support and advice they gave their spouses."
