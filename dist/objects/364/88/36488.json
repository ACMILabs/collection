        "Nichol's debut feature after a string of successes on Broadway retained the taboo-breaking profane and sexually charged dialogue of Albee's stage play, the likes of which had not previously been heard in a big studio film. Burton and Taylor play a married couple in decline who engage in a relentless, vitriolic war of words over the course of one night in the presence of their guests. The film was rehearsed for three weeks before shooting started and was both a critical and box-office success, winning five Oscars. Cast: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Sandy Dennis, George Segal."
