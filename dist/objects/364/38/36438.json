        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 9: \"Stalingrad\" The encirclement and defeat of the German Army at Stalingrad holds more importance than the number of men lost - large though these were. For the first time, the Germans are beaten in the field. The legend of German mastery on land is dispelled as the people Hitler once called \"sub-human\" prove themselves more clever than he. Part 10: \"Wolfpack\" The German attempts to starve Britain by attacking ships bringing supplies from North America are very nearly successful. Many tons of shipping are sunk and many lives lost to the U-boat attacks (Wolfpacks) of Gross Admiral Carl Doenitz. The allied merchant ships, despite convoy techniques, Navy escorts and elementary underwater detection devices, are extremely vulnerable. Admiral Doenitz and some of his U-boat commanders, as well as some British Officers who survived being sunk in the Atlantic are among those who appear in this program."
