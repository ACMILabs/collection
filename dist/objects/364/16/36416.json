        "Yachts, motor cruisers, fishing vessels and merchant ships that rely on HF radio will soon be covered by a new safety net; the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, which will combine the latest satellite technology with a number of new HF communications frequencies. The system will be introduced in Australia on 1 July 1991, and it's vital that offshore mariners become familiar with the changes and the new HF frequencies."
