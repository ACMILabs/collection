        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 1: \"A New Germany\" Germany, a nation stricken by humiliating defeat and deep economic depression begins to respond to the hopes and promises of regained pride and prosperity under National Socialism. Adolf Hitler comes to power with the whole-hearted support of millions of ordinary Germans. As Europe looks on apprehensively, Germany threatens to attack Poland. Part 2: \" A distant war\" Germany invades Poland and bombs Warsaw into submission. Prime Minister Chamberlain is forced to bring Britain into the war but the nation is totally unprepared for a war which still seems far away. Following the failure of the British expeditionary force to Norway, Chamberlain is replaced by Churchill as the Nazi war machine rolls into the Low Countries and France. Also available on DVD [318986]."
