        "Superlative documentary tracing the career if one of Hollywood's most acclaimed and ambitious directors, George Stevens. Unlike other similar documentaries, this is not a mere star studded exercise in hero worship; a real sense of the director's personality emerges. Excerpts from many of his films are used, including \"Giant\", \"Shane\", \"Gunga Din\", and \"The Diary of Anne Frank\". This tribute was written and directed by Stevens' son."
