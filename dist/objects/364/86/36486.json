        "A faithful screen translation of the Broadway play, based on the book, about the harrowing experiences of the Jewish Frank family and their friends when they are forced to hide from the Nazis in an Amsterdam factory for two years. Millie Perkins is visually perfect as the young Anne Frank whose spirit gives the group courage to continue when they lose hope."
