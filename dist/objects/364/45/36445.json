        "Episode number 10 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 19: \"Pincers\" With the liberation of Paris on August 25, 1944, the war seems to be as good as over. The Russians from the East and the Allies from the South and West are ready for the advance on the Fatherland. At this point, the disparity of views between Montgomery and Eisenhower reaches a critical point. The American plans advance on a broad front; Montgomery wants a narrow strike to burst through to the Ruhr and thus plans the Arnhem raid. Part 20: \"Genocide\" When the Nazis came to power in 1933 Heinrich Himmler was already Reichstfuehrer of the SS. The new eminence of the National Socialistic Party allowed him to set about realising his dream of awakening the Germanic race within the German people. He had already refined the philosophy of Nazism, its ideas on politics and on race. His aim is recreating an older \"Aryan\" Germany. Also available on DVD [318988]."
