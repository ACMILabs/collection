        "Episode of Series \"Wind in the Willows Series\". Oarsman Toad - When Toad decides to enter for the River Bank Regatta, it takes a china vase, a clock and a window, to build a floating banana. Yes, he's confused too. \"Midsummer Night's Disaster\" - Who could dare to rewrite Shakespeare? Who would have Robin Hood, Ophelia and the fairies in the same play? Who could trust a weasel with the scenery? Oh! You guessed! \"The Compleat Bungler\" - Toad takes up fishing but his friends doubt whether he'll catch anything. In fact he lands a big one - even if it isn't a fish. Rated: G"
