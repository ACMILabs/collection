        "Presents Tasmania's remote mountain highland wilderness, the world of high peaks and glacier lakes. In the valleys of Tasmania's tall forests are the tallest eucalypts of the planet. Scientists have found that plants have existed for 35 million years, but many, such as these tall trees are now threatened by man. Australian animals, such as platypus, wombats, and possums are also shown."
