        "On the 8th march 1965, 3,5000 American marines landed on the beaches of DaNang - the first American combat troops to arrive in Vietnam. By 1967, there were half a million but the world's most powerful war machine found it could not defeat a guerilla army a fraction of its size. It was, for the first time, a television war and TV news reports are a major feature of this program. The reporters who brought the sights and sounds of battle into American living rooms also told of Agent Orange, Napalm and My Lai. When Middle America saw the unrelenting footage they turned against it and the influence of television caused politicians to end a war in which one million Vietnamese and 60,000 Americans died. WARNING: CONTAINS SOME GRAPHIC TORTURE AND DEATH SCENES."
