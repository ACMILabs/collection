        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 3: \"France falls\" France has the largest of the pre-war European armies and the protection of the heavily fortified Maginot Line. Incredibly, though, the Line did not stretch to the Channel and the German invaders simply skirt the defences and forge south. The French Army is humiliated. Paris is captured and France falls. The British Expeditionary Force is pushed back and Hitler stands poised ready to invade Britain. Part 4: \"Alone Britain\" Under the leadership of Winston Churchill, Britain fights on alone. Nearly 350,000 Allied troops have to be rescued from Dunkirk and British morale is never lower. On the brink of defeat, despite the heroism of the RAF in the defeat of the Luftwaffe, Britain is saved only by Hitler's decision to switch his offensive to Russia. Also available on DVD [318986]."
