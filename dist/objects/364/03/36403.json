        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 7: \"On Our Way\" The conflicts in Europe and the Pacific are two separate wars. Many Americans are content to forget about Hitler and Europe and concentrate their war efforts on the Japanese. President Roosevelt is committed to the fight against Hitler but Congress is not. Inexplicably Hitler declares war on America, thus relieving Roosevelt of a difficult decision and, ultimately, altering the course of the war. Part 8: \"Desert: The war in North Africa\" takes the best part of three years to resolve and is fought and re fought over the same 600 miles of desert between Alexandria in Egypt and Benghazi in Cyrenaica (Libya) before Montgomery's \"Desert Rats\" defeat Rommel's Africa Korps at El Alamein. The Germans are driven from North Africa and the way seems clear to the underbelly of Europe, Italy. Also available on DVD [318986], [318987]."
