        "The Punters Club Hotel, Fitzroy. These are committed poets of the eighties who wish to take their poetry to the people. They confront, they amuse, they berate, they seduce, they delight in the powerful and poetic use of words, rhythms and aural imagery. They challenge one's perception and evoke moments of wonder, at a phrase, a rhythm or a point of view. Theirs is the poetry of anger, of love, of deprivation, of desire to see."
