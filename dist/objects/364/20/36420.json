        "Fact meets fantasy in the forests of East Gippsland. Carolin is a city kid; she doesn't like the bush. Her parents are excited about their holiday in East Gippsland but to Carolin it spells dirt, insects and discomfort...until she encounters a frog! She rushes into the bush to find her voice and discovers the enchantment of the forest. Deals with the flora and fauna of East Gippsland and explores the meaning of wilderness."
