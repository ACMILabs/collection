        "Robert Bolt's literate and penetrating treatment of the conflict waged between Sir Thomas More and King Henry VIII makes a smooth transition to the screen. Zinnemann has mounted a film with an eye for characterisation rather than spectacle and the result is a superior drama. Stars Paul Scofield, Robert Shaw, Wendy Hiller, Orson Welles, Susannah York and Vanessa Redgrave. Rated: G"
