        "Episode number 9 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 17: \"Morning\" In the early morning of 5 June 1944, the largest amphibian invasion force ever gathered reaches the beaches of Normandy. Americans, British and Canadians attack on five separate beaches - and although the beach-heads are made on all, the Americans meet strong opposition and have many casualties. Part 18: \"Occupation\" The Netherlands, a neutral country, is attacked without warning in 1940 and to stop more bloodshed capitulates quickly after Rotterdam is badly bombed. So subtly do the German occupiers proceed - with assurance of \"no animosity\" - that most find it easy to carry on their normal lives. Also available on DVD [318988]."
