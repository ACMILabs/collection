        "Jackie is 38 years old. She lives with John and they have two small children. Once she wanted to be an opera singer. Once she had a boyfriend called Paul who married someone else. Once she travelled overseas. In the Sixties she was in love with Charlie. In the Seventies she sang in a band. In the Eighties she makes scones with the kids. In the process of (re) presenting an ordinary woman's life this film explores questions of identity, representation and truth."
