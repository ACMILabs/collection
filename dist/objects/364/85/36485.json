        "The life, works and beliefs of the late Black American writer and civil- rights activist, James Baldwin; what it is to be born black, impoverished, gay and gifted in a world that has as yet to understand that \"all men are brothers\". In this documentary without narration, Baldwin tells his own story. Using rarely-seen archival footage the film melds intimate interviews and eloquent public speeches with astounding cinema-verite glimpses of James Baldwin. An emotional portrait, a social critique and a passionate plea for human equality."
