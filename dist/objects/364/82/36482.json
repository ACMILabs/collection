        "No body. No motive. No weapon. The facts in the Australian murder trial of Lindy and Michael Chamberlain didn't add up. But strangely, other things did. Things like bigotry against the couple's religion. Scattershot forensic evidence was accepted as fact. And a nationwide hysteria that was the 1980s equivalent of the Salem witchhunt. Much of \"Evil Angels\" has the bizarre ring of the tabloid headlines. The wholesale abandonment of reason and justice seems too preposterous to be possible in a free and modern country. Believe it. It's documented in John Bryson's book \"Evil Angels\". Stars Meryl Streep and Sam Neill."
