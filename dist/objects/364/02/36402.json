        "This video explores the beginnings of mutual attraction between Elizabeth (Kim Basinger), beautiful and inhibited by love, and John (Mickey Rourke), impressive but strange, and follows the romance through the various stages of seduction, power, submission, rage and death. Their relationship lasts, predictably, 9 1/2 weeks."
