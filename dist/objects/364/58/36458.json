        "Margaret Mead was one of the three best known women in American history. Known as \"Mother of the World\", this video is about her sensational discovery of a Polynesian culture free from the stresses of adolescence; a place of sexual promiscuity, free love and harmony, described in the book that made her famous \"Coming of Age in Samoa\". More recently scholars have challenged the validity of Mead's views."
