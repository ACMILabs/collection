        "Life is very pleasant for a Californian family until a host of other worldly forces invade their peaceful suburban home. There presence is kind of predictable, given that their house is built over a cemetery. The poltergeists takes a particular interest in their 5 year old daughter, who communicates with them through the infamous television scene (a clever about turn on the communication that another alien, ET managed to do in Spielberg's 'ET'). Soon their house is turned into a swirling supernatural side show. The forces at work are anything but friendly and if the luckless family doesn't soon clear out, they'll all be swept off into a nightmarish chaos. The dark humour of the piece manages to lift Hooper's ('Texas chain saw massacre') scary tale above the horror on the screen. Cast includes Craig T Nelson, Jobeth Williams, Beatrice Straight and Dominique Dunne."
