        "This program explores the life and death of a 19 year old Aboriginal youth who was shot while trying to escape from Canning Vale Remand centre in Perth. His death is one of 35 in Western Australia investigated by the Muirhead Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. These facts alone cannot tell the story of Ricci Vicenti whose creativity, humour and sheer zest for life impressed everyone with whom he came in contact. This narrative documentary poses many questions about Australian society, its laws, its sense of justice, cross cultural attitudes and the experiences of Aboriginal people with the law. Ricci's story is told by his mother and foster mother and juxtaposed with the news coverage of the time. A moving exploration of a rich but short life."
