        "John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) finds himself caught in the war torn Middle East, after his longtime friend, Colonel Trautmen falls into Russian hands. The Soviets, equipped with state-of-the-art weapons, horrifying hi-tech helicopters, tanks and an army of highly trained men, are capable of annihilating any opposition they encounter. However, Rambo is no ordinary soldier, he's a one-man army who will face the Russians head-on in the most awesome confrontation of his life."
