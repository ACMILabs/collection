        "This is a quirky film about Kerry, a modern career woman, who becomes pregnant for the first time. With hormones whizzing around her body and her mind whirling with fantasies, we view the side of pregnancy never seen before - from the expectant mother's eyes. As she tries to deal with mental, emotional and physical changes, she begins to fantasise about her own capability as a mother, her misogynist obstetrician, over-zealous relatives and a husband in the midst of sympathy toothaches and training for his first marathon race! Cast includes Tracy Mann and Jim Holt."
