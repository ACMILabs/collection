        "Bitter medicine explores the personal experiences of migrant women in Australia and their use of tranquillisers. Through a dramatised reconstruction the video explores reasons that compel women to seek help and the common medical response. This video suggests alternatives to medication and presents migrant women's personal experiences and their determination to face a pill-free life."
