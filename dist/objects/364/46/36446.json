        "Episode number 11 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 21: \"Nemesis\" As the front lines shrink around Germany, the death toll mounts, many thousands die as the RAF and USAF attack by night and day. Allied prisoners-of-war are released by their advancing comrades, while German soldiers are captured by the thousands. Hitler marries the faithful Eva Braun while waiting in a bunker for the end. Part 22: \"Japan 1941-1945\" Many Japanese were stunned and fearful when war was declared against the West in 1941. But after the scales had tipped fully against Japan. But still they defended their homeland, unaware of the terrible weapon to be used against them. Part 23: \"Pacific\" The Allied Pacific offensive came under the command of two rivals: General MacArthur to sweep upwards from the Solomons and New Guinea to the Philippines - Admiral Nimitz leaps from island to island, starting in November, 1943, in the Gilberts at Tarawa. The Americans thought it would be easy. The casualties were to prove them wrong. Also available on DVD [318988]."
