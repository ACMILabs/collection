        "Lilli (Judy Davis) is back-up singer for an Elvis Presley imitator (Frankie J. Holden) and living an aimless life on the edge of show business. She is strong minded and independent. She is also alone and lost, drifting to escape commitment. When Lilli is kicked out of her act she finds herself stranded in a coastal town with a broken down car, no money, no job and nowhere to go. Through a strange twist of fate she befriends a teenage surfie kid, Ally (Claudia Karvan) who is the daughter she abandoned as an infant who was raised by her grandmother, a gutsy stern survivor (Jan Adele). \"High Tide\" follows the painful reunion between mother and daughter with an unflinching and at times hurtful honesty."
