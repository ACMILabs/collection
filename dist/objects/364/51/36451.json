        "Dr. Meichenbaum, professor of Psychology at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, is one of the founders of Cognitive-Behaviour Modification. His system is an attempt to integrate the clinical concerns of Psychodynamic and Cognitive Semantic therapists with the technology of Behaviour therapy. Meichenbaum says that behaviour, from a Cognitive-Behavioural perspective, is a reflection of several processes: the kinds of thoughts, beliefs, internal dialogues, images, feelings, and the ways we appraise the environment. The job of the therapist includes helping the patient become aware of each of these processes, the kinds of behavioural patterns the patient elicits from others. Dr. Meichenbaum touches on many of these processes and roles with Richard in a very effective and moving interview."
