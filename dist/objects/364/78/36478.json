        "My father has stuck it to me all my life, complains Charlie Babbitt, a callous self-centred young hustler who feels he's been cheated. After his father's death, Charlie's inheritance comprises of prized rose bushes and a vintage '49 Buick convertible. Charlie soon uncovers yet another surprise - a brother he never knew he had. Dustin Hoffman's Oscar winning portrayal of Raymond, an autistic savant living in a world devoid of human perceptions, may well be the crowning achievement of his distinguished career. Discovering Raymond in an institution, Charlie abducts him in a last ditch effort to extort his \"fair share\" of the family estate. What begins as an unsentimental journey across the country, evolves into a mystical odyssey of love and self revelation as Raymond forces Charlie to grow beyond the limits of his own handicapped heart. Stars Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise."
