    "description": [
        "'Travelling North' (adapted for the screen by David Williamson from his award winning play) is the story of one man's struggle to retain his dignity in the face of adversity. Leo McKern plays Frank, a crotchety old man who has an unending zest and passion for life. Julia Blake is Frances, his much younger companion who watches helplessly as Frank enters a traumatic period in his life - unable to understand the complexity of his personality and his strong desire to live life to the fullest. Cast also includes: Graham Kennedy as Freddy, Henri Szeps as Saul, Michele Fawdon as Helen, Diane Craig as Sophie, Andrea Moor as Joan, Drew Forsythe as Martin, and John Gregg as Jim."
