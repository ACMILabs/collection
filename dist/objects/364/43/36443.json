        "Episode number 8 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 15: \"Homefires\" After the defeat in the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe changes the direction of their bombing raids from London to the provincial cities, Portsmouth, Sheffield, Glasgow and Bristol all suffer heavy casualties and damage, but Coventry and Plymouth are the worst hit. In Coventry, the heart is torn from the city and the situation is desperate. Part 16: \"Inside the Third Reich\" - In the summer of 1940 the German forces are the conquerors of Western Europe, and at home the feeling is that the war is over. German cities are untouched and there is thankfulness that the carnage of the First World War has not been repeated. There are no plans for a long struggle and the Nazi Regime, looking at repopulating ensures that most peacetime goods are still in the shops. It is for the Germans a happy time and many babies are conceived. Also available on DVD [318988]."
