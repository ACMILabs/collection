        "Tells the story of a group of Jewish men who after the outbreak of World War II, were rounded up in England and, in the face of there being suspicion about them, sent out to Australia on board the S.S. Dunera. In Australia they were interned in a camp at Hay, in New South Wales, a location which, with their sense of humour intact, the \"boys\" transformed into a parody of Vienese cafe society. Among their number were some of the most remarkable and individual characters to arrive on Australian shores and slowly but surely they broke down the barriers and established a bond of trust with the Australian authorities, a trust which eventually allowed the group to become part of the effort to defeat the threatening Fascist forces, and later, people of great distinction in post-war Australia."
