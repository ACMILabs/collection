        "Based on the Noddy stories by Enid Blyton. Noddy helps Tessie Bear sell her eggs on market day after which they then buy a kite to fly in the strong wind, in a nearby farmer's paddock. They tie the kite to a milk churn and a basket full of eggs, and the kite lifts the milk and eggs aloft raining milk and eggs on the market before eventually Noddy comes to the rescue. Narrated by Richard Briers."
