        "America, \"Tonight\", \"Maria\", \"Somewhere\", \"I Feel Pretty\" - just some of the sensational evergreen songs from \"West Side Story\", the winner of ten Oscars including Best Picture. Opening with the now famous helicopter shot of Manhattan, \"West Side Story\" is the heart-rending, brilliantly tuneful contemporary version of \"Romeo and Juliet\". The gang rivalry between The Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks reaches fever pitch when ex-Jet Tony falls in love with Maria, the sister of Shark leader Bernardo. When Bernado is killed in a gang misunderstanding, Tony and Maria become the unwilling, tragic participants in the resulting vendetta. Music by Leonard Bernstein. Starring Natalie Wood as Maria, Richard Beymer as Tony, Russ Tamblyn as Riff and Rita Moreno as Anita. Based on the book by Arthur Laurents."
