        "The Bachdisc marks a milestone in the treatment of musical subjects in laserdisc format. How does one add visually to something that is not only heard, but is considered to be the most subjective of the arts? Bachdisc creator, Juan Downey, incorporates onto a multiple-image screen various images of the famous New York harpsichordist Elaine Comparone playing Bach's Fugue #24 in B minor. On side 2 of the disc is a documentary of Bach's personal life and work."
