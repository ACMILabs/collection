    "description": [
        "Using the opening of Godard's film 'Alphaville' as a foundation, Lord constructs a vision of the evolving global city during the last years of the 20th Century. Structured as a series of repetitions, the montage of the changing city is offset by shots of Silicon Valley corporate facades. The result is a dialectical contrast between urban and suburban space, body and mind, chaos and order, and the post-modern and the modern. Shot in Hi-8 video in Tokyo, Fukuoka City, Mexico City, Rome, San Francisco, Naples and Los Angeles."
