        "A dreamlike interpretation of Matthew Arnold's poem ' Dover Beach'"
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Two people are thrown into a strange, mysterious place where nothing is as it appears to be and where the relation between cause and effect is never stable. As they explore their surroundings they discover that space, time and themselves are elements of a carefully constructed illusion. Thrownness has been inspired by Matthew Arnold's poem, 'Dover Beach' and philosopher Martin Heidegger. Arnold's poem of 1867 has surprising contemporary relevance in a time where 'ignorant armies clash by night'. The romantic photography reminiscent of 1950 Technicolor films, fantastical sets inspired by Fellini's films and the use of old style in-camera effects create an intriguing, magical aesthetic.  As viewers Thrownness asks us to consider our role in creating narrative coherence through our understanding of cinematic traditions and visual language. The story has an integral, essential and evolving relationship with the elements that create it. The effect of this is the generation of an unexpected alternative narrative which reveals the complex artifice that is the film language."
