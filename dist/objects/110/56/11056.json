        "Dolores from 10 to 10 is a multi-channel installation, adapted from Fusco and Ricardo Dominguez's 12-hour performance at Kiasma in Helsinki, which was streamed live to the internet in 2001.  The work refers to the true story of a maquiladora (assembly line) worker, falsely accused of unionizing workers at her plant.  Locked in an office for 12 hours without food, water, or telephone access, she was coerced into signing a letter of resignation.  Her lawsuit against her employers was eventually denied on the grounds that she had no 'proof'.  Dolores from 10 to 10 is Fusco's interpretation of this real-life internment and a re-construction of what might have been seen if there had been surveillance cameras in the office.  Framed by the female labour situation in Mexico, Fusco highlights the inequalities of the relationship between women and technology across the world."
