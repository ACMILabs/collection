        "An anonymous digital dairy created by a young person as part of a day long workshop run by ACMI.  Each diary is scripted and a voiceover recorded by the individual young person. Some diaries use photographs brought in by the participant, but the primary visual content is often black and white, 'stock' footage of a poetic nature. At no point should the creator or school be positively identified when screening this work."
