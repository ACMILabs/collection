        "Diverse productions made by brothers Frank and John Straford in their Brighton Backyard between 1951 and 1956.  Without formal training and using the most basic of equipment and self invented production techniques, the brothers produced an irresistible array of short animations, scripted dramas and home movies that have a freshness and charm 50 years later."
