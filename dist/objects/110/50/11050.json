    "description": [
        "The 1956 Olympics warranted the Straford Brothers using their cherished stock of coloured film to capture this unique event. Original footage of the Athletics field (notably pole vaulting), swimming and diving events in the pool have been compiled by Frank years later with additional video content and a voiceover. Despite shooting some of this additional footage on his living room floor (inadvertantly including a glimpse of shagpile carpet) and such 'special effects' as a whiteboard marker illustrating points on a map, the documentary has a lot of interesting detail about the event; about their personal experience of it and the novelty of seeing OB Television crews in action."
