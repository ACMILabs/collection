        "Interactive television late night show set on Coode Island in 2040."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "The \"Tonight Show\" is an interactive 'late night' show set in the year 2040 on Coode Island. The robotic host 'Cyborg\" is the host of the show, asking each user to make their selection from a menu of 'items' to compile the show. The content for each section (listed in a menu) offers musical interludes, comedy segments and interviews in traditional late night format which the user can mix and match to create their own late night program. This interactive cleverly and subtlely comments on environmental issues and the formulaic nature of late night television. Kids will love the robotic host and guest stars (NOTE there are 2 versions of this work - G rated for general exhibition and the original version featuring mild drug references and swearing)"
