        "Episode of Series \"Creative Spirits Series\". This is a revealing film about one of Australia's leading painters - Brett Whiteley. Whiteley takes us into his studio where we catch glimpses of his free ranging talent. We see him at a huge canvas as he creates and completes a work during the film. He talks of being born with a gift and his desire to test and abuse that gift, but ultimately share it; as well as the influences in his life, Van Gogh and Francis Bacon and his preoccupation with the sensual."
