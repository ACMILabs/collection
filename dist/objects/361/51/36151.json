        "Episode of Series \"The Nature of things\". Roger Tory Peterson is a man of remarkable talents. A world-renowned naturalist and outstanding wildlife photographer, he is an artist whose wildlife paintings have been compared to those of the great Audubon. Throughout his distinguished career, Peterson has stuck to one principle in particular, the idea that knowledge about life will lead to a reverence for life. This video includes some of Peterson's own spectacular footage from Antarctica, painting plates for a major revision for one of his field guides, bird watching in several locations, and talking about his love of birds. Presented by David Suzuki."
