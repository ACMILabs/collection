        "Episode of Series \"Creative Spirits Series\". A delightful journey through the world of opera, this film is constructed around Joan Carden's preparation and performance as Cio-Cio San in Puccini's highly entertaining and accessible opera \"Madam Butterfly\". Sequences of Carden preparing for that production are intercut with her preparation for the role of Musetta opposite Dame Kiri Te Kanawa's Mimi in the Victoria State Opera's \"La Boheme\". Historical film shows notable performances from her past that firmly implanted her on the international scene. We see Carden as an actor and singer and she talks of the influences, techniques, demands and pitfalls that are part and parcel of her art."
