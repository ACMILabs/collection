        "In the diverse and complex countries of Asia today, it seems that the only unifying forces are both change and tradition. This video covers: Student protests in China; peasants in modern China; the new Cambodia; Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong; Japanese youth - an education for life and breaking the pattern of tradition; the depletion of Asian forest resources; Sado - the Japanese tea ceremony; Yum Cha - traditional Chinese tea and snacks."
