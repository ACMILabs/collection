        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". Shows cameraman, Alan Root, and his wife Jean's experiences with their own hot air balloon over Kenya. As they were learning how to operate it, forced landings in lakes, thick bush and herds of animals became almost daily occurrences. The Root's balloon adventures took them across some of the most spectacular places in Africa, but they were drawn towards Mount Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania, where they realised their ambition to fly by balloon above its snow-capped peak."
