        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". It is not known how many gorillas are left in Africa. Possibly as many as 15,000, maybe as few as 5,000. Their natural habitat of inaccessible high altitude rain forests is being felled and cleared and the greatest of the great apes has become an endangered species. This fascinating film tells the story of one man's struggle to protect one small population of gorillas on the slopes of Mount Kahuzi in Zaire and of his incredible relationship with Kasimir, the great silverbacked male and his family. It took Adrian Deschryver four years of daily contact and study to persuade the gorillas to let him approach closely, during which time he was charged many times by Kasimir and other senior males. They now let him move with them through the forest, watching them feed, eat and play. This is the most complete record ever obtained on film of these imposing and elusive animals. Rated: G"
