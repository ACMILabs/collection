        "The Perahera that takes place in Sri Lanka, is one of the most magnificent torchlight pageants in the world. Known as the Festival of the August Moon, the Kandy Perahera is held annually in the lunar month of Esala (July/August) in the hill capital of Kandy, stronghold of the proud Sinhala Kings for over 20 centuries, and Sri Lanka's most beautiful city. This video captures an impression of the visual splendour and exciting atmosphere of a pageant that includes up to 1200 elephants with an animated cast of thousands."
