        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". With a brain over five times the size of man's, the Humpback Whale is known to possess a remarkable, though as yet unfathomed, intelligence. It is also known as the \"singing\" whale, as the strange and mysterious sounds it utters have, to our ears, the quality of songs. Filmed in the clear waters off Hawaii where 400 Humpbacks meet each year to breed and sing, and in their cold feeding grounds off the Alaskan shore, this remarkable film is an attempt to try and unravel some of the mystery that surrounds these elegant creatures. Rated: G"
