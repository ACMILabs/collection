        "Wilbur Wilde and Kerry Simpson feature in this rap cartoon addressing the importance of not sharing needles and how to correctly clean them. Using animated and studio footage the story revolves around a party where the issue of safe needle use arises. \"Big Night Out\" provides safe use messages (ie: cleaning injecting equipment effectively and where to get new needles and syringes) via the Streetwise cartoon character, Dr Klevadik. The language utilised within the video is \"street based\" in order to increase target group acceptance. Aims to provide safe messages regarding intravenous drug use and potential HIV and HepB transmission."
