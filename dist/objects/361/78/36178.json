        "Richard Linton was born in Melbourne in 1935. He began working in photolithography after studying at the Australian School of Printing. His first serious painting of a sailing ship was in 1957. His love of history and meticulous attention to detail make him a world authority on the subject and unique in today's art world. With his knowledge of printing he also produces limited edition prints of his works. In this video, Richard Linton explains his working process, including researching and painting, and talks about his paintings of Australian and overseas built sailing ships."
