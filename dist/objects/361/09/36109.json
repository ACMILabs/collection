        "Episode of Series \"Creative Spirits Series\". A personal perspective on the life and music of jazz multi-instrumentalist, James Morrison. He heads us through the documentary in a series of statements derived from interviews at a variety of locations - from an empty jazz club in the afternoon, to a studio in New York, seated among some of the finest international jazz musicians of the last fifty years. We encounter his family, his musical colleagues, friends and critics and learn about Jazz and about James Morrison: musician, composer, dare-devil and philosopher, and we listen to his music."
