        "A collection of three experimental films made by filmmaker, Paul Winkler. These films present fascinating combinations, juxtapositions and manipulation of moving and still images. The first film makes use of images of the Ayers Rock, Australian bushland, and patterns from aboriginal bark paintings. The second film uses images of bricks and tiles. The last film shows juxtaposition of rural and urban images. Each film has an interesting soundtrack, matching the moving images."
