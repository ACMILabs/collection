        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". This award winning film tells the story of 300,000 wild snow geese - and the fourteen snowgeese who thought they were human beings. One late spring, naturalist cameramen, Des and Jen Bartlett, marooned themselves on the rugged Arctic tundra for four months. Their objective, to cover for the first time the incredible migration story of the snow geese, from their arctic nesting grounds west of Hudson Bay, south to Texas and the Gulf of Mexico, (a 2,500 mile journey). Living in their tent among the geese, the Bartletts found themselves \"leaders\" of their own gaggle of strongly attached young geese who now had to make the journey with them. This beautiful film reveals the adventures of the wild geese and the orphans who eventually had to break with their human \"parents\" and find their way back into the wild. Rated: G"
