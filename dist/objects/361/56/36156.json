Presents the rationale underpinning the IVDU/HIV Prevention and Management Strategy through interviews with experts, user advocates pharmacists and needle exchange staff. Role plays the use of needle/syringe exchange programs addressing the implications occuring when staff do not advise clients correctly and others where users are given appropriate information and access to new equipment."
