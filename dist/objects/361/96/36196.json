        "Probably the most important video many of us will ever see. Record cold winters and record summer heat and drought, increasing floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, dying forests, massive fuel burning and the clearcutting of the tropical rainforests are all related. The next Ice Age may be virtually upon us, a natural 100,000 year cycle driven by erosion, the death and rebirth of forests and the rise and fall of greenhouse gases. It has already resulted in massive starvation. If we act quickly we may be able to stop it, if not we may be eating less in seven years."
