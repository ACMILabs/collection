        "This video provides information about recycling. By following the investigation undertaken by Brunswick East High School students, viewers will learn a great deal about how paper, glass, metal, plastic and vegetable matter is recycled. Recycling plants are visited, processes are demonstrated and explained and end products are shown. The main value of this video, however, is to demonstrate graphically how students can become motivated and actively involved in improving their own environment."
