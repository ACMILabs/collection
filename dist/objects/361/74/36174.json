        "The rise in popularity of outdoor recreation has led to a vast increase in the number of bushwalkers visiting national parks and wilderness areas. With this rise in use has come increasing damage to the natural environment. Fortunately, a new bushwalking ethic has developed and the \"Minimal Impact Bushwalking\" philosophy is now widely adopted by bushwalkers. This program covers the major Minimal Impact Bushwalking techniques."
