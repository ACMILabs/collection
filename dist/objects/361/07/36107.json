        "Westminster Abbey is the most famous Anglican church in the world. Periods of neglect and dissolution, as well as privilege and great ceremonial occasion have chequered its 900 year life. Here we are taken on a remarkable journey through history, visiting parts of the Abbey where the public never go, seeing priceless documents and books from the Abbey's library and hearing from experts on its history. The result is an absorbing portrait of one of the finest Gothic cathedrals in Europe and a magnificent monument to a millennium."
