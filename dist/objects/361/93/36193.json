        "The giant panda is undoubtedly a beautiful and endearing animal. Only known in the west for a hundred years or so, and extremely rare, it has nevertheless become the best known of threatened species, and an immediately recognised symbol for conservation throughout the world. Through newsreel, archival and contemporary film, this program explores the past, present and likely future of the giant panda."
