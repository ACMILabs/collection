        "This video looks at the effects of weather on bushfire behaviour. Weather factors discussed are temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric stability, air mass, pressure systems and fronts. Focusing mainly on Victoria, it concentrates on the implications for firefighters. Knowledge of these weather factors will enable the fire fighter to predict fire behaviour."
