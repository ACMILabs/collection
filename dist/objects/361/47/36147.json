        "Episode of Series \"Wildlife on One\". Meerkats united Perched upright, high on a termite mound in the Kalahari Desert, a furry brigand, only 12 inches tall, gazes with beady eyes across the arid wilderness. He's a meerkat and he's on sentry duty. Meerkats are a kind of mongoose, curious little creatures who live in gangs and use brilliant teamwork to survive in their hostile environment. This delightful film follows the lives of one band of these outrageous characters for whom survival demands that they're all for one and one for all. \"The Impossible Bird\" - The ostrich can't fly but can run at 40 mph! It is the world's largest bird - nine feet tall. It lays an egg equal to twenty hens eggs, and can kick a man to death. This film probes the remarkable world of this most unlikely bird and comes up with some fascinating answers. Both films are narrated by David Attenborough."
