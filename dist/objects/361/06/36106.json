        "Dogs can be a problem. Whether puppies or fully grown, they can give owners a lot of trouble if they are not properly trained. How do you cope with a young puppy and prevent puddles in the hall? How do you deal with an adult dog pulling on the lead, jumping at people or terrified of traffic? Barbara Woodhouse's tackles fundamental problems of obedience facing new dog owners and provides strategies to overcome them. Mrs Woodhouse takes untrained dogs of different breeds and shows how dog and owner can quickly become a happy team."
