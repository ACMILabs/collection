        "This video graphically illustrates in dramatic style the problem facing a teenager whose dog is run over and in urgent need of help. Nick is hearing impaired. An alert young man with limited speech, he is devastated when his dog, Smoky, his closest friend, is run over. In his efforts to get help he grabs Gavin, a passing cyclist, and desperately tries to make him understand his problem; but Gavin thinks Nick is a \"right Wally\". \"Look at Me\" is a compelling introduction into the everyday problems facing the hearing impaired."
