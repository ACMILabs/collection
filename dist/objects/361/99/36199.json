        "This inspired madness makes the impossible possible by assembling the greatest cast of comedians that ever lived. This film contains the first comedians in their funniest sketches. Compiled from over 2,000 reels, \"The Golden Age of Comedy\" is a montage of outrageous slapstick humour that marked the highest point in film comedy. It remains a milestone in hilarious amusement and is without doubt the most memorable collection of classic comedy sketches. A must for those who enjoy sidesplitting entertainment. Rated: G"
