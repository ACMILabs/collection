        "Until very recently Yugoslavia was a popular tourist destination. This documentary reveals the beauty of the land with its ski resorts, beautiful coastal towns on the Adriatic coast, breath-taking mountain scenery in the Plitvice Lake region and the splendour of structures like the historic Kalamegdan fortress in the heart of Belgrade. The video takes us to Zagreb, Ljubljana, Plitvice, Dubrovnik, Sarajevo, Bled, Mostar and Belgrade."
