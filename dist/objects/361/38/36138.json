        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". This film sets out to prove that spiders are beautiful, fascinating, inventive and versatile. They can build traps with hinged lids, weave nets to snare the unwary, hunt on the surface of water and live in diving bells beneath it. This film, which has been shot by means of the specialist techniques of Oxford Scientific Films, shows the incredibly varied means by which spiders catch their prey, how they court, mate and raise their young. Spiders emerge as overwhelmingly colourful and beautiful. Narrated by Peter Ustinov, the program reveals a number of bizarre and almost unbelievable facts. For example, spiders in Britain every year eat a weight of insects equalling the total weight of the human population. Rated: G"
