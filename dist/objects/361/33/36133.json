        "Episode of Series \"The Nature of things\". Aircraft traces the history, sociology and technology of aircraft from the first flight of the Wright Brothers in 1903, the \"barnstorming\" era, the coming of the first airlines, the transformation of combat in two world wars to highly computerised airlines and jet-fighters. \"Jellyfish of the sky\" also known as balloons and airships, were the first flying machines. In 1783, the first hot air balloon was flown. Two weeks later, the hydrogen balloon took to the air. This program explains the importance of these events."
