        "South America is a continent of violent extremes, dominated by the world's largest and most spectacular mountain chain, the Andes. It is a land of ice and fire where a glacier thundering into the ocean is surrounded by dense forest alive with humming-birds. From a condor's eye view a landscape of stunning beauty and contrast is revealed and at ground level we can observe the remarkably varied animal population whose lives are shaped by their magnificent surroundings."
