        "Phillip Island, with its rugged coastline, windswept beaches and sparkling water, attracts over a million visitors a year. From all over the world people come to witness Australia's famous Penguin Parade. Peter Hosking is your guide to Phillip Island, a haven for over 200 species of birds and wildlife, including koalas, kangaroos, wallabies, wombats and fur seals. As the sun goes below the horizon, the world's smallest penguins gather off-shore in large groups, waiting for the safety of darkness. The stage is set. The first come ashore and the parade of the little penguins begins! Rated: G"
