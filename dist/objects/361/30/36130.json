        "Puss in Boots, \"The Ugly Duckling\", \"Rapunzel\", \"The Four Musicians\", \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", and \"The Princess and the Pea\". Six of the finest tales from the great fairy story tellers - Hans Christian Anderson, The Brothers Grimm and Charles Perrault. Each story is presented in a new, colourful and lively style but yet retains the best of traditional story telling. The stories are funny, tender, exciting and sometimes a little scary - tales which children will want to see and hear again and again. Rated: G"
