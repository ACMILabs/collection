        "Episode of Series \"Creative Spirits Series\". This documentary follows Tom Keneally as he retraces the journey made when he researched the novel \"Towards Amsara\" two years ago. The novel is set in a war-zone amongst the Eritrean people as they struggle to regain the independence taken from them by the Ethiopians twenty five years ago. Keneally reveals a remarkable society comprised of camouflaged schools and hospitals, factories hidden in deep caves, great food distribution dumps and ravaged biblical towns. He encounters again the real people he turned into fictional characters in his book."
