        "Ambush at Masai Mara - The wildebeest are coming and the hunt is on! It is the time of plenty for the lions of the Musiara marsh. Nothing quite matches the awesome spectacle of the annual wildebeest migration as the vast herds brave the treacherous waters of the fast flowing Mara River and run the gauntlet of the marsh lions. \"Leopard: a Darkness in the Grass\" - Survival on the hot plains of Africa is a tightrope between life and death, even for the big cats. The leopard is a shy and elusive prowler and this intimate film follows the extraordinary and hazardous events in the daily life of one particular leopard and her cubs in Masai Mara. Narrated by David Attenborough. Rated: G"
