        "Like all young kids, Orville Ryan is desperate to be part of a group. Unfortunately, the one he tries to gain acceptance from, is the local gang of neighbourhood bullies! And \"this little dag\" just doesn't belong with them. So he is picked on, chased and battered. But through all this unfairness he happens upon an eccentric old man, who is given a hard time by the same boys. The two of them strike up a relationship based on their similar love for the freedom of flight and a broken down Tiger Moth. Orville persuades the recluse to rebuild the Moth - and Orville's life takes off with it!"
