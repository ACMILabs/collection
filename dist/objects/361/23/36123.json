        "Episode of Series \"Creative Spirits Series\". Acclaimed Tasmanian born, Sydney based composer, Peter Sculthorpe, began composing at the family piano at the age of eight. Many of his early pieces are included in the documentary, along with his major compositions, milestones in a body of work that now see him as Australia's foremost composer of serious music. Sculthorpe talks about his childhood, friendships and love of his country - influences that were instrumental in him composing music unique to Australia. At 60 he is enjoying the busiest and most successful time of his career. Robert Helpmann used Sculthorpe's \"Sun Music\" in his Sun Music ballet which tours the world. America's Kronos Quartet has brought the Australian's works to Europe and America. The finest musicians in the world await Peter Sculthorpe's latest work."
