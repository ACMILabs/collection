        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". Depicted as a symbol of evil since the time of Adam and Eve, the snake is one of the most feared creatures on earth. But it is also a creature of great beauty. Lethal and frightening it may be but the snake is also versatile, intelligent and fascinating. Shot in the exotic wilds of Arizona, Kenya, the Amazon Basin and the Great Barrier Reef, the snake is filmed here in its natural habitat. From the safety of the other side of the screen, you can take a close look at the most venomous snakes in the world, and watch a giant anaconda constricting a four-foot cayman. Other specialy created scenes show how a snake can eat a meal five times as big as its own head and how some snakes use infra-red heat detectors to locate their prey."
