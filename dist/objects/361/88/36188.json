        "Episode of Series \"A Travellers' guide to the Orient\". Delhi, capital of India, and steeped in history, is the perfect start to any trip to India, the land of fascinating contrasts. Visit the bustling bazaars, the Red Fort, former citadel of the Moghul emperors...and New Delhi with its stately structures and underground markets, dungeons and sprawling ruins. Agra home of the Taj Mahal. Stroll down Agra's exotic streets and marvel at its attractions...the forts, palaces and tombs of past emperors. Rajasthan and Kashmir - enchanting palaces, impregnable forts, uncompromising deserts and tranquil lakes. Kashmir - overlooked by the mighty Himalayas. Its wonderful mountain streams, forests and beautiful lakes with their famous houseboats. Moghul gardens and romantic architecture, make Kashmir the Jewel in the Crown of India."
