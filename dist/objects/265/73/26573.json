        "Classic British documentary recounting the journey of the 'Postal Special' train from London to Glasgow. Carrying no passengers, the postal staff sort mail on board and receive and despatch mailbags 'en route'. The non professional cast performed scripted scenes, giving a human dimension to the mechanics of mail delivery. Along with a dry factual voice-over, the soundtrack offered music by composer Benjamin Britten and verse by W.H. Auden."
