        "Detergents are agents used with water for washing purposes - soap being a common form. Here is explained why a detergent is necessary to effectively remove dirt and grease. New detergents are evolved for special duties and are far more efficient than common soap. Moreover, soap is made from much-needed vegetable oils and fats. These new detergents are made from petroleum wax, so releasing more vegetable oils and natural fats for food. Commentary written by Arthur Calder-Marshall. Music by Lauderic Catous West Indian Orchestra."
