        "Follows a television reporter who becomes for a day and a night one of Melbourne's homeless men. Shows the queue for lodging and food at the Gill Memorial Home, the City Mission, and other hostels and refuges. The reporter talks to some of these men, most of whom are unemployed - many unemployable in their present state. They tell of their daytime wandering of the streets, their difficulty in finding employment and the escape for some that alcohol brings. The problem of rehabilitation is discussed."
