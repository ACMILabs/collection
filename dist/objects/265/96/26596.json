        "Tuition available in Britain for blind children who have additional defects. Several homes, caring for different age groups, are run on the \"family\" system, seven to a family. Affection is given, confidence built up and each child is taught to fend for themselves to the best of their ability. Other subjects, besides classwork, are handwork, nature study, swimming, and independent outings to nearby towns."
