        "The electronic age is revolutionising teaching. Oakland Community College in Michigan worked with Litton Industries to develop an automated system to enable a student to take their course at a time convenient to them. The College provides programmed instruction in a variety of subjects for people of all ages over a period of 14 hours each day. An automated cubicle in an audio-tutorial laboratory replaces the usual classroom."
