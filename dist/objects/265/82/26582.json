        "Tells the simple, enchanting story of Ayot and his friends who live in a Cambodian village. They capture a baby elephant they name Niok and bring him back as a pet. The other boys tire of Niok but Ayot teaches him to manage his own food, baths and follow him. The villagers complain about the elephant's appetite for their grain and Niok is sold; but Ayok pursues the party, retrieves Niok at night from a ship and releases him at the temple where he had first captured him."
