        "Deals with the problem of prejudice against Jewish children. When a six-year-old Jewish girl indicates that she was involved in an antisemitic incident, her parents and their friends discuss the problem. They recall their own childhood experiences of such situations. Different approaches on the problem of protecting children from attacks are suggested. The film promotes discussion of situations involving prejudice."
