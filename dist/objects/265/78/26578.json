        "The film tells the history of coal-mining from the 11th century until the present day. As digging developed, the hazards of flood, fire and poisonous fumes were added to an already dangerous occupation. The means to combat these dangers were only developed gradually. While following these technological developments, the film pays equal attention to the human factor, particularly during the period when women and children were employed in deep mines."
