        "Designs for Australia's six new decimal coins prepared by local designer Stuart Devlin, are presented by the Federal Treasurer, Mr. Harold Holt, and a member of the advisory panel on design Mr. Hal Missingham, who worked closely with the designer and helped solve technical problems. The coins feature seven of Australia's unique fauna- the spiny anteater, lyre-bird, frilled lizard, feather-tailed glider, platypus, kangaroo and emu."
