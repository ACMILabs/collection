        "This DV Public Imaging work explores the graphic street art of stencil painting. This predominantly political form of street communication and resistance has risen in visibility in recent years. Using the streets of Melbourne as the visual basis for this work, the viewer will be afforded the vision of the different visual and textual styles, edited into a work that is, at times, abstract and, at others, forcefully potent in its political delivery."
