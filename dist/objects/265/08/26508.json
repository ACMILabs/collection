        "Episode of Series \"March of Time\". This film surveys the research, both military and civilian, taking place in astrophysical problems. Introduces equipment being used showing the world's largest telescope in operation, and introduces important scientists involved in space research. The findings to date are shown in relation to space distances, showing how much must still be worked out before we can explore space to any degree. Spectacular shots photographed from a rocket sent 75 miles into the atmosphere conclude the film."
