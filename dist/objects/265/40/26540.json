        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Crossroads of the world: a study of North Africa and the Middle East\". In a world where the fortunes of one people crisscross with others, it is to be expected that the voices of Muslim countries will be raised on world issues. At the United Nations and other international gatherings, this film watches and listens to the new leaders of the Islamic world. What you see and hear has much meaning for you, and even more significance for the new African nations among whom Islam is a live and growing force."
