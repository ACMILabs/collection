        "Episode of Series \"The Technique of anaesthesia\". This film shows the working of a typical apparatus designed to deliver a continuous flow on nitrous oxide to the patient. Ether in varied quantities can be added to the mixture of gases as required. One animated diagram sequence in the film deals with the way in which the machine works; another deals with the principle of re-breathing. Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia are demonstrated with emphasis rather on the use of the machine than on general principles."
