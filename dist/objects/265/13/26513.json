        "A report on the work of Montreal's Institute of Cardiology in the battle against heart disease, dramatically presented in the story of Charlie Harris. As it follows his case from the time he is first stricken by an attack to the conclusion of a delicate heart operation, the film reveals the great progress medical science has made in detecting and moderating the effects of the nation's number-one killer and in restoring patients to normal activity."
