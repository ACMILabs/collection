        "A male filmmaker (played by an actor) interviews a female friend who confides to him that she has been raped. She relates problems she has experienced with the police, her doctor, her friends and her own reactions. This short fictional film masquerades as a documentary and raises questions about the relationship between filmmaker and subject as the conversation shades into interview, interrogation and forced confession."
