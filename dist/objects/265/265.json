        "Several short pieces in which individuals or groups of dancers work with the idea of 'minimal choreography', using simple props such as balls, rods and firesticks to create complicated patterns and rhythms from a few basic movements. The result is a quirky hybrid of circus skills and dance, augmented by some image manipulation in the edit suite."
