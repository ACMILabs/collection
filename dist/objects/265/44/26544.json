        "The film shows a series of blind landings, made entirely by an \"Auto-Pilot.\" It is installed in the Trident aircraft, the first to be designed from the outset for automatic landing. From inside the aircraft, the film follows the full operation of automatic landings, and explains how the system works. There are also interviews with a test pilot, an aircraft captain and passengers"
