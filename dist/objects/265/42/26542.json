        "The production of many new types of synthetic fibres is a threat to the future of the Australian wool industry - the chemist is producing new materials more closely resembling the characteristics of wool. This film, showing how the wool industry is meeting this challenge, is an account of the work being done at various research centres throughout the Commonwealth, investigating and improving the production, processing, and use of wool."
