        "Throughout Victoria, vast areas of land are ravaged by soil erosion, costing the community 6 million dollars each year. The film shows how the Soil Conservation Authority combats erosion by developing methods to stabilize blowing sands with cereal crops; by demonstrating to farmers, methods of contour farming and terracing on sloping country; by reclaiming land ruined by tunnel erosion, and by providing protective cover on reclaimed country."
