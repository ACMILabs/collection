        "For centuries the waters of the Nile have brought fertility to Egypt, and served as a vital artery of transportation. Shows the marked contrast between ancient methods of irrigation and more modern developments. Most recent project is the high dam at Aswan which will greatly increase hydroelectric power, control flooding and create a huge area of additional farmland."
