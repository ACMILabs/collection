        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". Explains chemical bonding in terms of electric interactions that cause the bonding in the hydrogen molecule. The release of energy when H atoms combine to form H2 on a platinum surface is shown. This energy change is related to the similtaneous attraction of electrons by two or more nuclei, opposed by electron-electron repulsions. Through animation the quantum mechanical view of electron distribution is portrayed. The bonding interaction between two hydrogen atoms is contrasted to the very weak, non-bonding interaction between two melium atoms. Suitable for upper secondary level."
