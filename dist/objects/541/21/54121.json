        "Describes the Master Plan intended to cope with Melbourne's traffic situation in 1985. Intense survey work has been carried out, the information analysed in computers and the appropriate plans made, mainly in the form of overpasses and freeways. Stresses the need for a revitalised public transport system as well as roads. Underground railways and streamlined trains and buses are needed. Includes plans for St Kilda Junction, Westgate Bridge and the Melbourne Loop system. Narrated by Leonard Teale."
