        "Today only remnants remains of the great ice sheets that once covered North America, but the glaciers found in the Canadian Artic and mountain regions are still one of the most unusual elements of our natural environment and an amazing repository of geological history. This colour film, suitable for the classroom, shows the surprising life and activity of glaciers"
