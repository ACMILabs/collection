        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". Emphasises that catalysts are typical chemical reactants, being unique only in that catalysts are regenerated during the reaction. Demonstrates, using animation, and interprets three simple catalyzed reactions: the decomposition of formic acid, using sulphuric acid as catalyst; the reactions between hydrogen and oxygen, using pure platinum as catalyst; and the reaction between acidified benzidine and hydrogen peroxide using peroxidase in the human blood as a catalyst."
