        "Directors of photography are members of the American Society of Cinematography. Produecrs and directors rely on them to integrate costumes, make-up, sets, and all production operations. Besides knowing how to operate cameras, lenses, dollies and lighting equipment, cinematographers must be artists in using light in ways most appropriate to the subject. The film includes several illustrative scenes, mostly concerned with lighting problems, from \"Picture of Dorian Gray\" and \"Great Expectations\"."
