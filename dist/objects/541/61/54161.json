        "This film tells of the mining of bauxite deposits at Weipa in the far north of Australia - the York Peninsula. The product of this vast mining venture is then transported to Tasmania where it is processed into ingots at the Bell Bay Refinery. From ingots through the rolling mills it is processed into suitable form for the making of a variety of finished products for industry, the home and for commercial buildings. The enormous possibilities of the use of this light, versatile twentieth century metal are shown."
