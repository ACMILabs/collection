        "Australia's Snowy Mountains Scheme is one of the world's greatest engineering feats. The project to bring water to the dry west was built between 1949 and 1974, employing 100,000 people, many of them migrants who brought with them changes that have shaped Australia. This film documents Australia's ambitious project using interviews and historical film. Based on the book \"The Snowy : the People Behind the Power\" by Siobhan McHugh."
