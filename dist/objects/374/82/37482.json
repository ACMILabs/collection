        "John Waiko is the first Papua New Guinean to reach the status of professor. After receiving his doctorate from the Australian National University he travelled back to his village on the Gira River to celebrate, taking with him a film crew and Hank Nelson, his academic supervisor. The film documents his struggle to perform the required ritual correctly."
