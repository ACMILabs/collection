        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". A dramatised story of a young Vietnamese doctor who has come to Australia with his wife and child, only to find his medical qualifications are unrecognised here. He therefore enrols in a requalification course a long way from his family. As well as exploring the issue of recognition of overseas qualifications the video also focuses on the young man's feelings of isolation, frustration, deprivation and development of a sense of community. As well as building on the social issues raised by the video, the accompanying Teacher's notes also show how the video can be used in drama production."
