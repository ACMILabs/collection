        "The fourth part of a forty episode video program designed to introduce a beginner to the necessary vocabulary and phrases needed for \"daily survival\" in Japan. The programs introduce us to David, a young English businessman, as he learns his way around Japanese society. Exuberant techno-graphics are used as a visual aid in introducing David, and the viewer, to the language. The videos offer information on transport, shopping, finding a hotel, as well as important advice on working and living in Japan."
