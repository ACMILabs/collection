        "Episode number 11 of Series \"A World of Festivals\". The Royal National Eisteddfod is an annual celebration of the Welsh language and culture, particularly as expressed in mass choirs and poetry. The miserable weather conditions of this particular Eisteddfod do little to dampen the enthusiasm of the participants as they gather to elect the prize-winning bard of the year."
