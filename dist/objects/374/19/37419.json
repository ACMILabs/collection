        "Scottish psychiatrist, R.D. Laing, who died in 1989 shortly after this film was made, gained a reputation for his radical objection to conventional psychiatry. He opened the discipline to question in his books, \"The Divided Self\" and \"Politics of Experience\". This video is a compilation of a series of public lectures and private conversations made by Laing shortly after his sixtieth birthday. He is revealed to be a charismatic and consummate storyteller who draws on his thirty-five years of pondering the fundamental issues of living, loving, suffering and healing."
