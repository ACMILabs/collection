        "Each year the final students at Sydney's design colleges compete for a fashion design award. In 1991 the theme was for an evening dress which reflected the multicultural heritage of Australia. The judges, students and teachers comment on the designs themselves, the state of the fashion industry in Australia and their own personal hopes and dreams."
