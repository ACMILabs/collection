        "Episode number 2 of Series \"A World of Festivals\". For three days and nights in winter the ancient Swiss city of Basel celebrates Fassnacht. Preparations are elaborate and take many months to complete. Groups and individuals choose a theme, often a satirical one related to present day politics, and prepare huge lanterns and masked costumes which are paraded through town at night to the accompaniment of drum and fife bands."
