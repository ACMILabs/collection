        "In the red glow of the outback an Aboriginal woman nurses her ill white mother. As we watch the old woman dying her daughter confronts the finality of death; the bitterness of memory. Shot entirely in a studio \"Night cries\" uses a stark set-design, a palette of colours as from a dream, and a haunting soundtrack: of bush noises, gasping breath, the wail of a dingo, to suggest a world that combines the frightening distortion of a nightmare and the painful isolation of human loss. Subtitled \"a rural tragedy\" the film's portrayal of a personal agony illuminates and exposes the general horror of Australia's race history. With Marcia Langton, Agnes Hardwick and Jimmy Little."
