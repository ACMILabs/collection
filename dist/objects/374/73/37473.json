        "Grace and Billy Tao are Australian parents of three extremely gifted sons. Terry (14) is a Maths whiz who began university studies at age 9. His younger brother, Trevor (12), was born autistic but as a young child revealed an exceptional talent as a musician. The youngest, Nigel (10) is an all rounder but his IQ is still far higher than the national average. The Tao boys are shown at home and school and discuss how being recognised as a \"gifted child\" affects their lives. Includes interviews with their parents and teachers."
