        "The haunting story of Laura - an elegant young woman viciously murdered, is told in a series of flashbacks from the perspective of acidic newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb). Dana Andrews plays the detective who is investigating the murder and who finds himself becoming obsessed, and eventually falling in love with a portrait of the \"dead\" woman. Preminger's direction is masterful and the cinematography deservedly won an Academy Award in 1944. The cast includes Judith Anderson, Vincent Price and most notably Gene Tierney as the mysterious and very beautiful Laura. Based on the novel by Vera Caspary."
