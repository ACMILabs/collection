        "When the Enormous Crocodile boasts that he is going to eat a child for his lunch the other jungle animals decide to foil his dastardly plot. Children will delight in the exploits of Humpy Rumpy, Muggle Wump and the Roly-Poly bird. The animation is based on the original illustrations of Quentin Blake for another of Roald Dahl's entertaining moral tales."
