        "Freely adapted from \"The story of my Life\" by Giacomo Casanova, Fellini directs, in his own highly original style, the most detailed account of Casanova's life yet put on the screen. The magnificent camerawork of Guiseppe Rotunno and art design of Danilo Donato combine with the music of Nino Rota and the acting talent of Donald Sutherland to produce one of the most unusual films of the 70's, a sprawling, erotic and often moving masterpiece. Anthony Burgess acted as dialogue consultant for this English version."
