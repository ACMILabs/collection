        "Episode of Series \"Mini Dragons\". Although Taiwan is in many ways an exemplary example of an Asian country which has boomed economically whilst diminishing the gap between the rich and the poor, it suffers from political power being held undemocratically by the ruling KMT party, a historical legacy, uncontrolled pollution and the influence of Japan. South Korea, on the other hand, has the largest gap between the rich and poor causing political unrest and violent protest, which along with increased competition from other rising economic powers in Asia may end South Korea's era of economic success."
