        "The inner-city Sydney suburb of Marrickville is the most ethnically diverse locality in Australia. The suburb's heavy industry goes back to the mid-19th century and successive generations of migrants have settled and worked in the area. The video celebrates the contribution of Greeks, Yugoslavs and Turks to Sydney, from the post-WWII years to the present, as well as looking at the experiences of more recent migrants from war-torn Lebanon and Vietnam. Through the poetry and prose of migrant Australians and that of their children we hear of the cultural dislocation experienced by residents of Marrickville."
