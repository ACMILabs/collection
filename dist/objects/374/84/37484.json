        "This film takes its title from the judgement handed down by Lionel Murphy in favour of a Queensland Aboriginal activist. Judge Lionel Murphy (1922-1986), noted for legal reforms such as the Family Law Act and Trade Practices Act, was the most senior judicial figure in the modern history of the Commonwealth to be charged with a criminal offence. The film examines the events surrounding this controversial case with Murphy battling to retain his position on the High Court during the last years of his life. In a wider sense, the film considers some of the more fundamental issues about Australian law, the role of the police and security and surveillance in Australia."
