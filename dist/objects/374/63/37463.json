        "A graphically terse indictment of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The film uses archival footage, newsclips and interviews to present both a background history to the war and a condemnation of the foreign policy of the U.S. towards South-East Asia. Features footage and interviews of J. F. Kennedy, Eisenhower, Nixon and L. B. Johnson as well as the commentary of soldiers, activists and journalists. The film had a considerable impact and effect on the Australian anti-war movement."
