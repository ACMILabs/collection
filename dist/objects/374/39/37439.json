        "In 1974 the Turkish army invaded and occupied the northern half of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. The Greek-Cypriots who formed 80% of the island's population became refugees and the territories remain occupied by Turkey to this day. The video focuses on the experiences of Greek-Cypriot refugees who were forced to flee the northern zone in 1974. The second part of the video looks at the achievements of the Women's Walk Home movement in 1986 in which thousands of Greek-Cypriot women, supported by international women's groups, illegally crossed over into the northern zone to protest the Turkish occupation."
