        "Elliott Gould brilliantly follows, among others, Humphrey Bogart, to play the screen's most famous private detective Phillip Marlowe and gives one of his best performances in this very enjoyable film which The Guardian described as \"Bold and often beautifully made ... a marvellously off-beat and eccentric thriller\". The witty and sophisticated screenplay is adapted from Raymond Chandler's novel and is directed by Robert Altman with great flair and ingenuity as he skilfully combines suspense and comedy. Gould is supported by fine performances from Nina van Pallandt, Sterling Hayden, Mark Rydell and Henry Gibson."
