        "Why do boys receive more attention in the classroom than girls do? This video examines a gender equity program operating in primary schools to encourage girls to develop an awareness of the range of career and educational options available to them, in particular, in the fields of maths and science. Some classes in a co-educational primary school are conducted as single-sex classes to develop the confidence of the girls."
