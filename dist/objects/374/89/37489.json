        "Episode of Series \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". In the magical lands of Narnia a new quest begins for Edmund and Lucy, who, with their horrible cousin Eustace, join King Caspian on a voyage to find seven missing Lords of Narnia. The quest becomes a test of bravery for them all as they are led into encounters with sea serpents, dragons and invisible enemies, onto islands where dreams come true and magicians weave spells of mystery. But can they end the quest and break the final enchantment on their greatest, and perhaps their last, adventure of all?"
