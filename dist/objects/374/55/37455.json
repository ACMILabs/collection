        "The migrating vine describes how the production of wine was taken south of the equator to South Africa by the Dutch and then to Australia which has developed into the France of the southern hemisphere in terms of wine production. \"The grape goes west\" details the history of wine production in California from the Franciscan monks of the seventeenth century to the days of Prohibition. 'Vin Nouveau\" looks at how technology and marketing techniques are influencing what we drink and expanding the climatic limits to the cultivation of the vine."
