        "An examination of the opportunities for further education, training and employment for mature-age Aboriginal women. The first part of the program focuses on four women in the Northern Territory, three of whom work as rangers in Kakadu National Park. The program then turns to Sydney to the Murawina Multi-Purpose Aboriginal Education Centre, entirely owned and conducted by Aboriginal women, and dedicated to fostering the further education of Aboriginal women and girls by providing full hostel accommodation and childcare for its students."
