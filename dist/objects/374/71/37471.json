        "Episode of Series \"Dance Magic\". Instructional program to teach the Mambo. The Mambo combines American Jazz with an Afro-Cuban beat and became the rage when Americans became fascinated with Latin American rhythms in the late 40's and early 50's. The Mambo has been revitalised in the 90's through movies like \"Dirty dancing\" and \"Mambo kings\". Hosted by Terry Leone and featuring the dancing of David and Carrie Kloss."
