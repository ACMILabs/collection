        "Sipping stars recounts the history of champagne, from its invention by Dom Perignon during the reign of Louis XIV, the addition of the bubbles by the British during the reign of Charles II and the introduction of mass production methods by La Veuve Clicquot which led to its international success. \"Wine and war\" shows how the sweet fortified wines, particularly Madeira and Port were embraced by the British and Americans when French and German wines became unobtainable during the Napoleonic wars."
