        "An informative program, made by women, addressing the detection and range of treatments for cervical cancer. Includes interviews with cytologists, doctors and women who have received positive results from their \"pap\" smear, a test developed by Dr. George Papanicolaou to detect the difference between normal, cancerous and cancer-prone cells. Highlights the inadequacy of information delivered by the medical profession to women patients and the need for screening programs."
