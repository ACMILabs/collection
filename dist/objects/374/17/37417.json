        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Visual instincts : Australian contemporary photographers\". Two half hour episodes: 1. Marrickville photographer, Emmanuel Angelicas, talks on the sources and themes of his photography - sex, violence, television and religion. He enforces his style through his sense of composition, Greek tradition and a particular detachment from his surroundings. 2. Jon Lewis, Sydney photographer, is a paparazzi with a human face. It is his scrutiny of the bright lights and big city of Sydney that singles him out as an outstanding chronicler of public Australia."
