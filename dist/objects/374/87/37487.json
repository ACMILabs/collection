        "Episode of Series \"Mini Dragons\". The future of Hong Kong rests on what will happen in 1997 when it is returned to the rule of China. The program begins with an optimistic outlook, but after the Tienanmen Square massacre the pessimists begin to hold sway. Singapore enjoys a per capita income second only to Japan in Asia and gives an impression of racial harmony and excellent living conditions. However this success has been gained at the expense of many personal freedoms the rest of the world takes for granted, with the national propaganda machine hiding real inequities and threats from neighbouring and poorer Moslem countries."
