        "Episode number 9 of Series \"A World of Festivals\". Christmas festivities in the small Austrian town of Altenmarkt begin early in December as St. Nicholas visits all the children in the town, accompanied by the Grumpus, the evil spirits of winter and the dark. The celebrations culminate in a parade through the town during which the mischief making Grumpus are driven out by the Perchtens, good spirits who announce the coming of spring."
