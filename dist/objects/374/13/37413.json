        "Mexican artist, Diego Rivera, was a larger-than-life figure and one of the most colourful and controversial characters of 20th Century art. Trained in Mexico and Paris, he returned to Mexico in the '20s and by the '30s his fame as a mural artist specialising in socio-political themes had spread to the US. In 1929, he married Frida Kahlo and their stormy union was to continue until Kahlo's death in 1954."
