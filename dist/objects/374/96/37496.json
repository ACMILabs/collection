        "A history of the campaign for equal pay for women in Australia. The film focuses on the ACTU test case, using the nursing profession, for equal pay for work of \"comparable value\". It features ACTU unionist, Jenny Acton, nurse, Alex Anderson, and feminist Zelda D'Aprano who created news in Melbourne in 1972 by chaining herself to the door of the Commonwealth Government offices as a protest against unequal pay rates. A combination of interviews and archival footage."
