        "The Tour de France is the world's premier cycle race. In 1991 it was held over 23 days and travelled through 3,940 kms of the most spectacular French countryside culminating in the traditional last stage ride into Paris. The two videos contain the highlights of the race, interviews with top participants, descriptions of each stage of the race, a stage by stage update on the leadership table and comments by some of the fifteen million spectators."
