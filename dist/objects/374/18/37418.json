        "The lights fail in a local cinema and the angry audience harass the young woman in the ticket box. Her husband, the cinema manager, will soon become the focus of an investigation into political sabotage on a grand scale - a plan to rob the entire city of electricity. This early Hitchcock classic, based on Joseph Conrad's \"The secret agent\", stars Sylvia Sydney, Oscar Homolka and Jon Loder. The video also includes outtakes from Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", the shower scene, which Hitchcock explains."
