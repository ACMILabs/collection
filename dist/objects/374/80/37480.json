        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Changing Australia\". Jacques Reymond, chef extraordinaire, came to Australia at the invitation of James Halliday and was so impressed by the quality of our produce and lifestyle that he has become an Australian. As the winner of a competition between Australia's top chefs he was asked to prepare a meal using all Australian produce for an international competition in London. As he prepares for this event he visits the producers of his ingredients and talks about trends in Australian food. \"Foodies\" Rita Ehrlich, Terry Durack, Jill Dupleix and Kevin Donovan also participate."
