        "In 1940, all male Germans, Austrians and Italians between 16 and 60, living in Britain, were arrested and interned as \"enemy aliens\". Of these, 2542 were shipped off to Australia on the \"H.M.T. Dunera\", travelling under extremely harsh conditions, their possessions and papers confiscated. Most were Jewish refugees from Hitler's Germany and over 900 chose to stay on in Australia following their release from the internment camps in Hay and Tatura. This fascinating program focuses on the reunion of the \"Dunera Boys\" in Hay in 1990 where the men recall their experiences and the effect their internment had on their lives."
