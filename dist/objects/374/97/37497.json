        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". In 1988 a group of students from Murdoch University under the leadership of David George and Serge Tampalini staged a production of Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" in Bali during the monsoon. The program documents the various bureaucratic problems they encountered and the assimilation of Balinese dance, music and shadow puppets into the production."
