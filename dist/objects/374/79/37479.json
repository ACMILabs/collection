        "In New York in 1953 four 20th century icons are dropped into a melting pot of the sexual and the cerebral. An actress demonstrates the theory of relativity. A professor shows off his legs. A senator's sweaty impotence is shoved up against a ballplayer's psychotic tenderness. But locked inside them all are memories, childhood and compromise, bubblegum heroes and profound fears. A screen adaptation of Terry Johnson's play this thought-provoking movie stars Theresa Russell, Tony Curtis, Gary Busey and Michael Emil."
