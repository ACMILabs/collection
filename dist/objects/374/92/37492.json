        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Race to save the planet\". This introductory episode examines the two major revolutions that have changed how human societies use resources - the agricultural and industrial revolutions. It then suggests that a third revolution - a global awareness of human impacts - is beginning to cause equally far-reaching changes in society. Teacher's notes accompany the video."
