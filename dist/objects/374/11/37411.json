        "A skilfully compiled documentary of Sir Robert Helpmann that combines lavish film extracts, rare black and white film, noteworthy photographic stills from shows and interviews with the stars that knew him. Protege of Pavlova and Fonteyn's first partner, Helpmann was the most versatile theatrical talent of his time as he traversed careers in dance, acting, choreography, theatre directing and film performance."
