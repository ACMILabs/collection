        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Warriors\". A program on women in war. Six Australian women discuss their experiences in, and consequent attitudes to, war. The first half of the program focuses on World War II and features Polish ex-Army officer, Anna Kosinski, who was imprisoned by the Nazis in Warsaw; Ruby Boye-Jones, ex-WRAN coast-watcher on the Solomon Islands and Gwen Campbell, ex-WAAF Wing Commander who served in Australia. The second half of the program turns to three women in war-torn Third World countries - ABC political journalist, Mary Delahunty, in El Salvador in 1982; political filmmaker, Fionna Douglas, in Eritrea and Mozambique; and horticulturalist, Ruth Beilin, working on an agricultural development project in Mozambique."
