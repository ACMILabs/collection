        "Adapted from William Wharton's novel the film is the haunting story of one man's obsession and another's stubborn loyalty and support. A young man (Matthew Modine), brought up in poverty, scarred on the battlefield takes refuge in the fantasy of flight. Roaming freely through dreams and reality, against vivid backdrops of back-street Philadelphia and front-line Vietnam, the beautiful, startling photography, atmospheric music by Peter Gabriel and masterful direction of Alan Parker combine to produce an unforgettable and powerful drama that won the Special Jury Grand Prix at Cannes. Also stars Nicholas Cage."
