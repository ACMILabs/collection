        "Female circumcision, a euphemism for genital mutilation, is inflicted on an estimated 75-85 million women across the world. It is most widely practised in 26 African countries, the Middle East, Malaysia, Indonesia and some parts of South America. This program confronts the taboos surrounding such mutilations which serve mainly to control the sexual freedom of women. It includes interviews with victims of these painful practices and women attempting to change the custom."
