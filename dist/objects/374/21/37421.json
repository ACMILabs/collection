        "For 19 years, from 1952 when he was outcast from mainstream journalism because of his opposition to the McCarthy witchhunts, investigative reporter, I. F. Stone, produced a weekly newsletter dedicated to unearthing the true facts behind the double-speak and misinformation fed to the media by US Federal politicians. In this documentary made between 1970 and 1973, on the eve of Stone's retirement, he is shown as an eccentric and entertaining man who, despite his age, energetically pursues the truth behind the American involvement in Vietnam."
