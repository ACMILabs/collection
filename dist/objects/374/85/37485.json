        "A young man is savagely bashed when he visits a toilet beat for sex. The assault forces a reassessment of the relationship he has with his boyfriend, as well as resulting in a self-examination of his own needs and desires. \"Night out\" is an intense Australian short that is as much about the intricacies and uncertainties of contemporary sexual relationships as it is about the violation and humiliation of physical assault. Official entry in the \"Un Certain Regard\" section of the 1990 Cannes Film Festival."
