        "A tense and brilliantly directed drama focusing on twelve men in a jury who are considering a verdict on a case of a young Puerto Rican youth charged with murder. Henry Fonda plays the impassioned man of reason, not convinced of the guilt of the accused and battling against his eleven co-jurors who all want to convict the teenager and leave the hot and sweaty jury room. The film is famous for its condemnation of capital punishment. Also stars Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden and Jack Klugman."
