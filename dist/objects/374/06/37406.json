        "Episode number 5 of Series \"A World of Festivals\". Once a year the gondoliers of Venice compete for the honour of being the fastest gondolier. This video looks at all of the pageantry which accompanies this event as well as touring Venice itself, describing a little of its history and crafts, including the construction of the gondolas themselves, and what it is like to live there."
