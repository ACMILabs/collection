        "Fassbinder's final film is a stylised attempt to bring Jean Genet's novel Querelle of Brest\" to the screen. Filmed in rich reds and oranges, \"Querelle is set in a hallucinatory world. The sailor Querelle is adored and loved by his Lieutenant, by the brothel-owner Lucienne and by her husband, Nono but it isn't until Querelle kills a man that he himself becomes ready to love. He chooses for his lover the murderer Gilles: a love which leads to a complex game of sexual betrayal and, ironically, both to tragedy and redemption. \"Querelle\" is like watching love unfold in the middle of a wet dream. Stars Brad Davis, Jeanne Moreau and Franco Nero. In German with English subtitles."
