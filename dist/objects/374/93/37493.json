        "In this illuminating documentary, Melbourne psychologist and peace activist, Dr. Di Bretherton, reveals the untold story of the women in the Vietnam War. Few people are aware that women made up a large proportion of the Vietnamese forces. As she travels through the Vietnam of the 90's, Di Bretherton introduces us to the women who fought for their country, living with their families in complex tunnel systems, as their country was bombed and defoliated. The film also covers the long-term effects of the war caused by chemicals such as Agent Orange."
