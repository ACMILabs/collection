        "The wood-boring wasp sirex noctilio lays its eggs in pine sapwood and infects the tree with a destructive fungus. The pest is established in Tasmania and has been found in Victoria since 1961. Control measures are shown, such as quarantine, burning infected trees and inspection. Research is in progress on the possibility of breeding resistant strains of trees, and on biological control by imported predatory wasps."
