        "A fascinating story of life inside the wild bees' hive, revealing details which only the camera can show of the organisation and care of the hive and the queen. \"The Story of the bees\" is a shortened version of a film entitled \"Sunny tribe\" which was designed to show that bees are guided by instinct, not by reason. \"Sunny tribe\" won an award at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1946."
