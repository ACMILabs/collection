        "The film has been produced to demonstrate how a teacher approaches the controversial issue of the use of corporal punishment in schools. It includes class discussions with the boys in a high school in New South Wales, role playing and discussions with other teachers and with people outside the school. The boys also raise issues such as the communication barriers existing between teachers and students, the repressive aspects of school life, and the possibility of change."
