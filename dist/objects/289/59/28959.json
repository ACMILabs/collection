        "The escapades of a five-year-old in a Japanese family. Based on a story by a well-known Japanese juvenile writer and financed by a women's group interested in producing good films for children. Little Tattian plays pranks on his brother and sister, presents his grandmother with his box of `treasures' (bees' wings, buttons and the likes), leaves his brother at the market and hides at home while others frantically search for him, and indulges in elaborate fantasies of bogeymen. Cast: Takahide Funazu, Yoshonori Tanaka, Yukiko Ibuki, Kumeke Urabe, Tony Tani, Setsuko Sinobu."
