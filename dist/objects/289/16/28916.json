        "This film tells the story of a young woman who suffers a mental breakdown, recovers fully in a mental hospital and returns home. Instead of the understanding and support she most needs from her friends and associates, she is virtually ostracized. The film makes a plea for a change in the sort of public thinking that places a stigma upon people who have suffered from an illness of the mind rather than of the body. Cast includes Martha Choquette, Mickey Martin, Stanley Mellough, Marie-Louisa Holtz, Monique Chabot, Benoit Gerard."
