        "Presents a compelling documentary of the historical events that led to and included the destruction of Dresden, Germany, in February 1945. The events of the war between Germany and the Allies are followed from the early days of German victories to the eve of the bombing. The film shows the total devastation of Germany's morale and strength. It is comprised of the actual sights and sounds of the events taken from archive footage and recordings. The culminating destruction is one of history's terrible commentaries of the consequences and tragedy of total war."
