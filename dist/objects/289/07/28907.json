        "The Trans-Australia railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie stretches 1109 miles across the continent. Completed in 1917, the railway took 3500 men four and a half years to complete. Twenty year later, it was extended to Port Pirie. The film shows behind-the-scene servicing of the train and constant checking and maintenance of the entire length of track with specialised machinery designed for that purpose."
