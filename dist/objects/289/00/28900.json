        "Impressions, without commentary, of the city of Rotterdam, which was devastated in 1940. The city is a living organism whose heart was torn away by the brute force of war. Among the ruins a new life has started up - in the docks, among the bombed-out ruins men are at work. In a mighty symphony of labour, the new city arises from the bomb sites and the dark ruins of old Rotterdam."
