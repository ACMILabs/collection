        "The film follows the Takaoka Maru, an enormous super-tanker carrying 1.5 million barrels of oil, as it ponderously winds its way through the Canso Strait to the oil refinery at Chedabucto Bay. It captures the intricate drama of docking and unloading the amount of oil Canada consumes in one day. Through an artful mixture of special sound effects, expressive photography, music and commentary, the film speaks both in awe, and in fear, of this creature of man's making. A powerful documentary of a most unusual sort. Photographed by Les Krizsan and Barry Perles. Edited by Jy Chiperzak and Bruce Mackay. Sound by Raymond Marcoux and Bernie Bordeleau"
