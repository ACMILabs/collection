        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Commonwealth of Nations\". Tracing the history of the economic development of colonial territories, this film points out the shift in emphasis from the primary motives of discovery and the transfer of luxury goods to the establishment of permanent industries. The benefits of modern developments are weighed against exploitation, of which colonialism is never free. Narrated by Edgar McInnis."
