        "Episode of Series \"Personnel or People\". A new typist is asked to do a job for the manager instead of the senior typist, who is not present. Afterwards the senior typist voices her resentment, causing the new girl to feel unhappy. Another typist informs the new typist that the attitude of the senior typist is not new and has caused many resignations. What is the answer to internal warfare in the typing pool? Suitable for upper secondary level."
