        "Episode number 4 of Series \"How to Drive\". Having got the feel of the car by practising starting and moving off procedures, the driver is now ready to increase speed. To attain this, demonstrates a system of steering, together with gear changing and braking techniques. While confidence and skill will grow, so too must the realisation that the safety of others is becoming increasingly dependent upon our actions and attitudes."
