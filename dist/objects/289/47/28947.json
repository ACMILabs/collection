        "This film shows how a violin is made in story form. When Bill's violin gets broken in a tussle, it is the beginning of a fascinating experience for him and his friends. They discover how a violin-maker cuts and fits, sandpapers and polishes, until, three months after he began the work, a new, glossy violin is ready for Bill to apply his bow and draw out a tune. Covers the types of wood used and their origins, the tools required and list the main sections and components of a violin. Includes a violin assemblage sequence animated by Norman McLaren and Evelyn Lambart. Photography by Harold Berk. Editing and sound by Eugene Kash."
