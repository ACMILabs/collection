        "this film recounts the gradual development of the British mail service from the fifteenth century, reconstructed with period costumes, museum pieces, and old stamps. Early use of messengers and Henry VIII's service expanded for public use by Charles I; 1660 Act of Parliament; Ralph Allan's reforms; the Industrial Revolution; improved roads and the mail coach; Rowland Hill's penny post and modern mechanical methods."
