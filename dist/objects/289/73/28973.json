        "This classroom film sets out to describe how the white sugar we use every day at mealtimes reaches us in the form we know it best - as white crystals. Although the film deals exclusively with cane sugar, and does not mention the production of sugar from sugar-beet, the films gives a fairly clear picture of the production of sugar in the canefields of northern Australia, and the refining processes carried out in the cities further south."
