        "Uses fossil remains and other prehistoric records to make the point that communities of plants and animals have existed on earth only to be replaced by others when they have failed to adjust themselves to changes in their environment. The growth and development of the climax forest is shown in detail to emphasise the meaning and significance of a state of balance in nature."
