        "Summarises the theories of 19th century architect Alexander Thomson, who designed many of Glasgow's Victorian era structures - structures now being demolished in the name of progress. An actor playing Thomson quotes his theories of the need for eclecticism in architecture - he himself melded together classical Greek and ancient Egyptian styles, among others. We see footage of such Thomson designed buildings as the Caledonia Road Church (1856) and the St Vincent's Road Church (1858)."
