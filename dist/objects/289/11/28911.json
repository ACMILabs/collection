        "Two children hear their parents arguing. The mother, an alcoholic, will not admit that she has a problem. Eventually her husband goes to a doctor who suggests possible ways of tackling the illness. The first attempt at rehabilitation fails, but finally, after admitting that she is ill, she appears to be on the way to controlling her disease."
