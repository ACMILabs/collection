        "This film was made as an outgrowth of Disney's contract work with the armed forces during World War II. \"The Story of menstruation\" was probably the first American educational film with a woman narrator. The first half of the film discusses the natural process of menstruation through colourful yet simple diagrams, whilst the second half gives instruction on coping with behavioural changes and reinforcing gender roles, with a marriage scene followed by a picture of a young woman with her baby, suggesting \"the natural course of life\". When this film was screened in schools, girls received a copy of a booklet, \"Very Personally Yours\", which pushed Kotex products."
