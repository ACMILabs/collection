        "A story of a boy, a fishing schooner, and an adventure at sea. A thirteen-year-old boy stows away on his father's schooner and learns all about deep-sea fishing when the vessel reaches the famous Grand Banks fishing grounds off the coast of Newfoundland. The graceful \"Jean Frances\" is one of the few remaining Bluenose vessels that still put to sea from their home ports of Riverport and Lunenberg."
