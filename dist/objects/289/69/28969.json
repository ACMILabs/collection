        "Shows the place that silver has held in the past, by reference to documents and art works. Presents craftsmen of earlier times making silverware for use by churches and for the homes of great men. Demonstrates the part played by Georg Jensen, silversmithy, in the development of simpler designs more familiar today as the complex detail is omitted and the line becomes all important."
