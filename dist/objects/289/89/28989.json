        "Part animated film dramatising man's attempts over the centuries to measure time. Sun worshippers measured the hours by the shades of obelisk and sun-dial; the first clocks were worked by the elements - such as the sand glass, the Chinese fire clock, and the Persian water clock. The mechanical clocks and pocket watches of the last two centuries are symbolised by a ballet of pendulums, leading to the precision instruments that are the clocks and watches of the present day, measuring time with great accuracy."
