        "At all levels, work and efficiency depends upon supervision. The supervisors' efficiency always determines the efficiency of his section. Shows how a supervisor, although competent in their own field, may lack the qualities of a good supervisor. Emphasises that a supervisor should ask the following questions: WHAT does my section do?, WHY does my section do this work? and HOW does my section perform this work?"
