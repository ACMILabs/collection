        "A desperate Peter Plunkett (Peter O'Toole) endeavours to save his crumbling Irish ancestral castle threatened with foreclosure by turning it into a hotel with a difference. Peter and his loyal staff create a supernatural fantasy to lure American tourists. All hell breaks loose when Jack (Steve Guttenberg), a married American, falls in love with Mary (Daryl Hannah), a gorgeous ghost. This prompts the real ghosts of Plunkett castle to wreak havoc. An hilarious, ghoulish, supernatural farce with collapsing sets and wind machine action. Cast members complained that the producers crudely altered the original whimsical intentions of writer-director Neil Jordan. Cast includes Beverley D'Angelo, Liam Neeson, Peter Gallagher, Jennifer Tilly, Ray McAnally, Martin Ferrero, Donal McCann, Connie Booth, Liz Smith and Mary Coughlan."
