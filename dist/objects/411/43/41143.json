        "Presents a rationale for service delivery to the intellectually disabled, defines developmental disabilities, distinguishes between the terms impairment, disability and handicap, examines developmental disabilites from a social perspective, examines effects upon lifestyle, constructs the interventions that flow from the medical, behavioural and social models, and examines possible future service directions. Accompanied by 41p. in-service training manual. The video content does not parallel the information presented in the training manual. The program is more an overview of the integration of the developmentally disabled into the community."
