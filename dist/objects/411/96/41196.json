        "The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Choir has a repertoire which ranges from Gershwin to madrigals, spirituals to ABBA. The choir represents a positive force within the community; not just on the gay scene but across contemporary Australia. This documentary focuses on the choir's defence of their National Choral Championship and is an uplifting and moving experience."
