        "A young priest tests his faith and vocation when assigned to a working class Parish in Liverpool. When a teenage girl confesses of her father's incestuous advances, he is torn by the rituals of a Church which swears him to silence and to which he owes obedience, and his innate sense of justice. This conflict is compounded by his struggle with his own desires and sexuality as he enters into an illicit homosexual relationship. Linus Roache is excellent and well supported by a cast including Tom Wilkinson, Cathy Tyson and Robert Carlyle. \"Priest\" does not seek to attack organised religion; instead it offers a window into the heart and mind of a believer who struggles daily with his faith and vocation to find a true path."
