        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Bush tucker man series\". Les Hiddins relates survival stories in four episodes. 'The \"Coffee Royal\" affair' set in Western Australia traces the story of Charles Kingsford Smith whose reputation was damaged by one of Australia's earliest aviation disasters. 'The Cannibal convict' tells of one of the earliest convict escapees, Alexander Pierce in the wilds of south-west Tasmania. The footsteps of determined explorer John McDouall Stuart is retraced in 'The Best of them all.' 'The Dutch settlement' follows clues across Australia to investigate a report made last century about a Dutch colony established in Central Australia following a shipwreck."
