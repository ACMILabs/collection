        "Growing up in the East End of London during World War 2, the Kray twins became the heads of London's gangster underworld in the 1960's. After their release from prison during their teens, the Krays consolidated their underworld connections and \"The Firm\" was born. Ruling through fear, extortion and violence, the Kray's empire dominated the crime world for years. Finally in 1969, they were convicted of murder and separated in prison. At their beloved mother's death in 1982, they were briefly reunited before returning to prison. A compelling film biography."
