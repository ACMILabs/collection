        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Greece is a land rich in natural beauty, history and tradition; its sun-drenched islands surrounded by sparkling water. Travelling through the countryside exposes the tourist to a wealth of history and and myth; whether it be at the Acropolis, the home of the Gods in Athens or in Crete where the ruins of Knossos and the legendary palace of King Midas can be found. Visit the Plaka where the locals sip Greek coffee and discuss politics and life, see the magnificent windmills of Mykonos and admire some of the finest ancient classical architecture ever constructed."
