        "An hilarious, fast-paced comedy about a tiny and remote Hebridean island, Todday which is plunged into the depths of despair. Spirits are at zero for Todday is without whisky. Then a World War II ship founders on the rocks and the Scottish islanders guide the crew to safety. The ship's captain and mate reveal that the cargo was 40,000 cases of whisky bound for America. Delayed for a day because of the Sabbath, the islanders eventually succeed in removing a considerable amount of the cargo and the dawn breaks with a rosy glow on a brighter, happier island, but the whisky does not last forever. Starring Basil Radford and Joan Greenwood. Co-starring James Robertson Justice, Gordon Jackson, Wylie Watson, Catherine Lacey and Jean Cadell. Based on the novel by Compton Mackenzie who has a small role as Captain Buncher. This film was released in the U.S. under the titles \"Tight Little Island\" and \"Mad Little Island.\""
