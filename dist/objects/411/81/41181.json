        "Robert Stroud was sentenced to serve 40 years in solitary confinement in Alcatraz. Nevertheless, he became one of the foremost authorities on birds and their diseases. His fascination and love for birds began when he nursed a sick and injured sparrow back to health. Encouraged in prison by a guard, Stroud developed his interest in birds which was strangely at odds with the harshness of the prison environment. Burt Lancaster gives an excellent performance as Stroud, Karl Malden plays the Warden, Telly Savalas is Stroud's prison mate, Neville Brand is the prison guard and Thelma Ritter is outstanding as Stroud's domineering mother."
