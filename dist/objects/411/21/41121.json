        "Four programs examine ways small communities have created employment. Program 1: Profiles the Beechworth Bakery as an example of a booming small business and tries to identify the factors which have made it successful. Program 2: Examines ecotourism in Kaikoura, New Zealand where the recognition of a natural feature has turned the town economy around. Program 3: Overviews Ouyen's signage and streetscape projects which put the town on the tourist map. Program 4: Highlights Oamaru, New Zealand where the conservation of heritage buidings provided employment and attracted tourist dollars."
