        "Narrated by Ruth Cracknell and superbly animated, thirteen short segments focus on the survival of endangered creatures in their fragile habitats. The emphasis is on highlighting the plight of the animals and to foster greater community respect. Preservation of wildlife and their habitats are crucial environmental issues, and this program of short films promotes this message simply and persuasively. The Panda, Wolf, Bandicoot, Cheetah, Shark, Rhinoceros, Falcon, Rattlesnake, Spider, Seal, Gorilla, Frog and Homo Sapiens are the animals featured. Suitable for Upper Primary students and for lovers of quality animation and wildlife."
