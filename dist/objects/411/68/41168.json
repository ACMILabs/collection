        "Episode of Series \"Forever Ealing\". While reading a hair-rasing serial in the magazine \"The Trump\", 15 year-old Joe Kirby finds that his over-active imagination has exceeded itself and he lands right in the middle of the story. Joe convinces himself and friends that the magazine installments are being used as a means of secret communication by a masterly gang of criminals. Starring Alastair Sim, Jack Warner, Valerie White and Jack Lambert."
