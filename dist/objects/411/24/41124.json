        "Gerard Depardieu, Josiane Balasko and Carole Boquet feature in this romantic menage. Depardieu is a car salesman whose heart is touched by his secretary who is the very antithesis of his beautiful and poised wife. Her presence does more than disturb his equilibrium; it exposes a need to find the genuine love and affection his life has hitherto lacked. Depardieu brings his vast and versatile talent to the role of Bernard, an ordinary man. Josaine Balasko is superb as the secretary Colette and touches the heart, while Carole Bouqet, as the beautiful but empty wife Florence must learn to accept that beauty is not enough."
