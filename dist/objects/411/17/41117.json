        "Fay Weldon's screenplay is outstanding in this production of the much loved Jane Austen novel. Elizabeth Bennett takes an immediate dislike to the haughty but wealthy and handsome Mr. Darcy. Her prejudice blinds her to his true character, while his pride and belief in his own superiority, alienates him from most of society. Their path to love and happiness leads them to not only discovering each other, but to a better understanding of their own natures, faults and strengths. Stars Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul as Elizabeth and Darcy."
