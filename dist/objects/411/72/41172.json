        "Professor Julius F. Kelp (Jerry Lewis), is a chemistry teacher in a large university. Tired of being pushed around and humiliated, he dedicates himself to finding a scientific solution to his problem and discovers a chemical formula that transforms him from a clumsy, shy weakling into an irresistable, dynamic individual, called Buddy Love. However the potion often wears off at inappropriate times with embarrassing and hilarious results. Julius finds himself juggling a hectic doublelife, meek chemistry professor by day, local celebrity and heart throb by night. Inevitably these two worlds collide. Written and directed by Jerry Lewis, this madcap comedy is a swinging combination of farce, slapstick and romance."
