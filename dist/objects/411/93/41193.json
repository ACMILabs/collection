        "Episode of Series \"See how they grow\". Another interesting episode in this instructional series on animals designed for young children. This program focuses on four sea creatures from infancy to adulthood. The animals featured are the Ray, a cousin of the shark; the Pipe-Fish, a fascinating eel-like fish; the Cuttlefish whose skeleton is a familiar sight on the beach and the Hermit Crab which hides in a shell to preserve its privacy."
