        "This controversial movie is an exploration of a group of skinheads in the Melbourne inner-city suburb of Footscray who are angry at the Asian-Australians who live amongst them. The film's evasions are obvious: the narrative it explores belongs as much to the outer suburbs as it does to the multi-ethnic inner suburbs. The director's scripting and characterization is firmly and deliberately humanistic and sentimental; however the representation of some of the characters appears one dimensional and limited. Despite these shortcomings, \"Romper Stomper\" is an important Australian film in that it raises complicated issues of class, ethnicity, identity and nationalism. Its reception in the rest of the world was much more critical than its reception in Australia. With excellent performances by Russell Crowe, Daniel Pollock and Jacqueline McKenzie."
