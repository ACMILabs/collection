        "This is a compelling and moving documentary about the Kokoda campaign in New Guinea during World War II from the perspectives of Australian and Japanese soldiers who fought at that time. Soldiers from both sides of the campaign described it as \"an intensly personal war\", involving man to man fighting. The rugged and hostile terrain contributed to heavy losses and casualties, and the bravery of the indigenous stretcher bearers, nicknamed the \"Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels\", saved the lives of many Australian soldiers. Features actual footage of the campaign and includes interviews with Australian and Japanese veterans."
