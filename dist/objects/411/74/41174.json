        "Billy Fisher lives in the rich and escapist world of his wild imagination. An irresponsible clerk in a north country town, Billy is unable to tell the truth even for two minutes. In his fantasies, Billy is a successful man of the world; in reality he gets into one scrape after another. Unable to communicate with his parents, engaged to two girls at the same time and dreaming of being a writer, Billy's life becomes almost unbearable. Into this picture enters Liz. Her free spirit and appreciation of the creativity behind the day-dreams, offers Billy the possibility of escape. Tom Courtenay is Billy and Julie Christie is Liz in what is recognised as one of the landmark films of its decade."
