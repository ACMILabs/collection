Mozart's genius blossomed there, while Strauss waltzes capture the spirit of this elegant city. This travelogue focuses on the sights and sounds of this wonderful Baroque city with its grand architecture and variety of cultural activities such as the splendid Lipizzaner horses at the Spanish Riding Academy and the Vienna Boys Choir."
