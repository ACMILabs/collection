        "A spell binding occult thriller by writer Anthony Shaffer. A policeman goes to a remote Scottish Island to investigate the disappearance of a local girl and discovers a society of modern pagans worshipping the ancient gods of Earth, Rain and Sun. They are led by a sinister overlord in erotic rituals and savage ceremonies of human sacrifice and weave a web of hedonistic pleasure and terror around the puritanical, holier-than-thou policeman. When he finally discovers what happened to the girl, his nightmare is only just beginning!"
