        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Elizabeth R.\". Shadow in the sun: Elizabeth encourages the attentions of Catherine De Medici's son Francis, the Duke of Alencon. The intended union of the England's great Protestant Queen to a French Catholic casts a shadow over England as Elizabeth plays a dangerous game with the affections of her suitor and her people. Mary Queen of Scots, exiled from France sees herself as the rightful Queen of England. \"Horrible conspiracies\": the plots to kill Elizabeth and replace her with Mary abound. Yet Elizabeth is reluctant to execute Mary who is a Queen in her own right. Although the two cousins never met, their lives were entwined by destiny; Mary was finally executed as a traitor and Elizabeths' throne became secure at last."
