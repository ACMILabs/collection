        "Something weird is happening in suburban Pebbles Court, Homesville. The residents are unknowingly part of a diabolical experiment with a radical '90's body drug. Some will survive but most will not! The first phase is hallucinogenic, the second phase is glandular and the third phase is Body Melt! \"An inventive and laudably tasteless journey into the surreal\" Sight & Sound (UK). \"Packs more mucous, phlegm, puke, snot, slime and spit than you ever thought possible\" Starburst (UK). If you enjoyed \"Salt, saliva, sweat and sperm\" in the '80's by the same producers and director, then this is the '90'S experience you have been craving! Based on four short stories by Philip Brophy. Starring Gerard Kennedy, Ian Smith, Andrew Daddo, Lisa McCune, Brett Climo, Vince Gil and William McInnes."
