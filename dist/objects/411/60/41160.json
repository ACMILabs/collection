        "Two brothers are searching for their terrorist father who has escaped from goal. The trail leads them to a small town on Long Island where they meet a community of people who give them a refreshingly different view of their father. The ensuing complications between the brothers, as they battle to discover the truth of their family history, results in their confiding and falling in love with two very independent women. In order to defend their father's honour, they all become involved in a battle with the police that leads to a surprising resolution. From this simple plot Hartley creates an eccentric film about history and relationships that challenges the viewer's stereotypes of heterosexual romance. As is typical in Hartley's work, the ensemble cast is universally excellent, including Martin Donovan, Robert Burke and Bill Sage. Special mention must go to Elina Lowensohn who plays a Romanian immigrant who falls in love with one of the brothers. The Godardian scene in which she leads a dance to Sonic Youth's song \"Cool Thing\" is one of the film's highlights. The musical score is excellent."
