        "A man is killed by the Mafia and his body dumped into a lagoon. When a radioactive meteorite plummets into the lagoon, strange and terrible things happen. The corpse suddenly comes to life as a mutant monster! This pseudo-alien goes on a rampage of revenge, devouring members of the Mafia. Glowing fragments of rock are the only clues and while these baffle the FBI, an astute Professor at a college campus discovers the cause. A sci-fi cult movie."
