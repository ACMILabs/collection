        "Episode of Series \"Forever Ealing\". George the Ist of England came from the small independent German state of Hanover and when he succeeded to the throne of England, he left behind a prisoner in the Castle of Ahlden, Princess Sophia Dorothea, his wife. She married George Louis against her will and this is a tragic tale full of melodrama, intrigue and spectacle. The costumes and settings alike will delight. Stewart Granger, Joan Greenwood, Francoise Rosay, Flora Robson, Anthony Quayle and Michael Gough star in this period drama based on a novel by Helen Simpson."
