        "Parrots are exotic, and colourful with amazing character and ability. Birds like the Macaws with their stunning plumage in brilliant blues, reds, greens and yellows, are like living jewels, yet in the wild they become invisible. Cockatoos en masse cause unimaginable destruction to crops. Parrots can be trained to learn tricks, to talk and are incredibly loyal and affectionate pets. This wonderful natural history documentary focuses on parrots in their variety and will astound and amaze."
