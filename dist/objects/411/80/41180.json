        "Perspectives on Pride and Prejudice explores the meaning, language, relationships and social milieu of Jane Austen's much-loved 1813 novel, within an educational context. In 1996 the BBC produced a 6-part miniseries of \"Pride and prejudice\", starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy as the lovers-to-be, which was extremely well received. This multi-media kit contains an 85-minute video, 75-minute audiocassette and a booklet of suggested activities to accompany both the novel and the film text. The actors who feature in that production discuss their views on the characters they portray. Academics from various streams join in panel discussion about the characters and the layers of meaning detectable within Austen's prose. Divided into sections, the kit offers teachers, students and lovers of Jane Austen a chance to develop their experience and responses to the text both as a novel and as a screen work."
