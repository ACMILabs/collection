        "Dowdy housewife Evelyn Cooch meets an elderly lady, Ninny Threadgoode, who transports Evelyn back to the 1930's by weaving a magical tale about two women, gentle Ruth, and headstrong Idgie, who ran the Whistle Stop Cafe during the Depression. Idgie's and Ruth's friendship defied all odds, and remained strong even when the scandal of murder threatened to separate them. Academy Award winners Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates play Ninny and Evelyn, while Mary-Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterton give excellent performances as the friends Ruth and Idgie. Based upon the novel by Fannie Flagg who also wrote the screenplay."
