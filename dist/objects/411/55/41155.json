        "Bette Davis is mesmerizing as a seemingly devoted, long-suffering Nanny. Ten year old Joey (William Dix) is accused of drowning his younger sister in the bath and is institutionalised for therapy despite claiming that the Nanny was responsible. When he returns home suspicion is aroused when his mother (Wendy Craig) is poisoned and his Aunt suddenly dies. Joey continues to insist the Nanny is responsible and life turns into a deft cat-and-mouse game between the shady woman and her young charge. Co-starring Jill Bennett, James Villiers and Pamela Franklin. Based on the novel \"The Nanny\" by Evelyn Piper."
