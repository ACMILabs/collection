        "This dramatic documentary focuses on the fragile community of mountain gorillas in the heart of equatorial Africa. Only 400 in number, we see how the gorillas live: their feeding, breeding and socialising habits. A dedicated group of scientists are continuing the years of research begun by George Schaller and Dian Fossey in order to save the gorilla from extinction. Peanuts, named by Dian Fossey, was the first gorilla to touch a human and his death is a moving reminder of the powerful impact of the human race upon the environment."
