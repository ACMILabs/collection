        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Elizabeth R.\". The Lion's cub deals with the events that led to Elizabeth's ascension to the throne of England. Narrowly avoiding implication in the attempted abduction of her brother King Edward VI, Elizabeth's life was in deadly peril during the Catholic reign of her sister Mary. When she became Queen she vowed to serve her people without the \"impediment\" of a husband. \"The Marriage game\" focuses on the attempts of Elizabeth's Council to persuade her to marry. The young 25 year old Queen remains obstinate even after an attack of smallpox threatens to leave the realm without monarch and successor. With Catholic Mary Queen of Scots threatening the succession, Elizabeth's marriage is vital. Her long-time friend and love Robert Dudley waits in the wings for the outcome of this political game. Starring Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth with Ronald Hines, Vivian Pickles and Robert Hardy."
