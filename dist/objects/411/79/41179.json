        "The extraordinary story of the passionate, all-consuming and finally, destructive love between T.S. Eliot, one of the greatest poets of the 20th Century, and his first wife, Vivienne, a vivacious yet disturbed society beauty. History has long forgotten the woman who had such a lasting impact on Eliot's life and whose mental deterioration had such a lasting influence on his writing. With honesty, compassion and daring, Willem Dafoe and Miranda Richardson bring to the screen the lives of two people whose destinies would be linked forever but whose love was doomed. Co-starring Rosemary Harris, Tim Dutton and Nickolas Grace. Based on the play by Michael Hastings."
