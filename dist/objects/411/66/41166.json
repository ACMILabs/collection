        "This superb adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's poignant masterpiece, set on the high seas stars Spencer Tracy as Manuel, the Portugese fisherman who teaches human values to a spoilt millionaire's son, won him the Best Actor Oscar. The impressive cast also includes Mickey Rooney, Lionel Barrymore and Melvyn Douglas. Twelve year old Harvey Cheyne (Freddie Bartholomew) is travelling with his father aboard an ocean liner bound for Europe when he falls overboard and is rescued by Manuel who takes him aboard a New England fishing schooner captained by Disko. He is immediately put to work alongside the Captains' son, Dan. The challenges that he faces and his slow and difficult mastery of new skills changes the boy from a brat into a gallant and brave apprentice."
