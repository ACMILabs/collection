        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Elizabeth R.\". Phillip of Spain urges an unprepared fleet to sail to England to rid her of her Protestant Queen. \"The Enterprise of England\" deals with the historical events which lead to the defeat of the Spanish Armada by Drake and the Navy. In \"Sweet England's pride\", the aging Elizabeth is besotted by the stepson of Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex. However, Essex is not wise and plans to take the throne for himself. The aging Queen must meet the final challenge of her reign and as her life draws to an end, the question of the succession hangs in the balance."
