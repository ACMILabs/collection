An excellent resource for Occupational Health and Safety Officers which demonstrates in clear and concise steps, the correct procedures for cardiopulmonary resuscitation on an adult. There is a simulated workplace accident which highlights the importance of following correct procedures. Many of the techniques are demonstrated by the use of a resuscitation dummy."
