        "Medieval epic set in 13th Century Scotland. \"Braveheart\" follows the fortunes of the legendary Sir William Wallace, the Scottish Highlander who led his people in rebellion against Edward Ist. of England. Gibson's film made its mark on the 1995 Academy Awards, being an epic in the old style, filled with gigantic battle scenes and larger than life characters. Starring Mel Gibson as William Wallace, Sophie Marceau and Patrick McGoohan. A tale about oppression and the courage to oppose it."
