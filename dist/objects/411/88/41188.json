        "Since beginning as a serial,\"Tales of the City\", in the San Francisco Chronicle, Armistead Maupin's charming and very funny books about a group of people living in a block of flats in '70's San Francisco has entertained people worldwide. This joint UK/USA production follows the story of Mary Ann Singleton, a young girl from the mid-west who moves into a flat owned by the wonderful Mrs Madrigal (Olympia Dukakis), a landlady who always has a willing shoulder to cry on and an endless supply of joints. Mary Ann becomes best friends with the handsome Mouse, a young man looking for Mr. Right. In this mad, exuberant world of disco, fast sex and good drugs, we follow the adventures of Mouse, Mary Ann and their fellow tenants as they fall in and out of love, party, and pick up strangers in laundromats. This excellent series is a glorious, comic tribute to a time when hedonism was innocent and when sex was safe. Co-starring Chloe Webb, Donald Moffat and Laura Linney. Screenplay by Richard Kramer."
