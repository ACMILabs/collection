        "A cult classic, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" has it all. A musical score by Richard O'Brien, who also stars as the butler Riff Raff, high energy dancing and excellent performances by Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon as preppie couple Brad and Janet; Tim Curry as Doctor Frank'n'furter, the 'Sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania', and a host of others. This collector's edition celebrates the film's 21st birthday and includes an hour of extra footage of deleted scenes, outtakes and the Rocky Horror phenomena."
