        "The film 'Jurassic Park' captured the minds and imaginations of movie-goers worldwide. This compelling documentary investigates the scientific possibilities of recreating dinosaurs from stored genetic material. Discusses ethical and logistical issues such as food supply for creatures like Tyrannosaurus Rex which could consume the equivalent of a modern day elephant on a daily basis. Features expert commentary from some of the world's leading palaentologists and will stimulate discussion on the critical issues associated with genetic engineering. Should we let sleeping dinosaurs lie?"
