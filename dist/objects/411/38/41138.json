Crooks try to steal a French plane called Genevieve and Budgie saves the day. A catch of lobsters almost gets the best of Budgie in \"Budgie takes a catch\". Budgie gets to spend a night on an aircraft destroyer in \"All at sea\". The final story \"Boats, boots and Budgie\" sees the intrepid helicopter rescue a cow during bad floods."
