        "Adapted from a short story by Damon Runyan about a pair of ne'er to do gamblers trying to snare a jackpot amidst the clutter of Times Square as well as the affections of two women. The excellent score by Frank Loesser includes \"Luck be a lady\", \"If I were a bell\" and Stubby Kaye's show stopper \"Sitdown, you're rocking the boat.\" Choreographer Michale Kidd brought the dances full of flash and vitality to the screen. Starring Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine."
