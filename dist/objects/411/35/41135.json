        "A haunting tale of magic and mysticism set in an age of enchantment and adventure. Navarre (Rutger Hauer) and Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) are two lovers, condemned to spend eternity together - yet never touch, transformed by the spell of the corrupt Bishop Aquila. Aided by the young renegade thief, \"Phillipe the mouse\" (Matthew Broderick) and defrocked priest, Imperius (Leo McKern), they must find a moment in time when night and day are one - and evil consumes itself to break the spell."
