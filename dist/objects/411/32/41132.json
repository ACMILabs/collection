        "Brilliant, enigmatic, beloved, Charlie Chaplin made more people laugh than anyone else in history. His story and the story of filmmaking are inextricably linked and brought to the screen in Richard Attenborough's modern masterpiece. This truly magnificent film features one of the finest casts from the world of film and includes: Dan Aykroyd, Geraldine Chaplin, Anthony Hopkins, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Kline and James Woods. This is the story of how this master entertainer survived a deprived and tragic childhood and then transformed such poverty into humour cherished by all."
