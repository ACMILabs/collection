        "Chen Kiage's spellbinding tale of betrayal is as sprawling and colourful as China itself. This awe-inspiring drama centres on the incredible lives of two stars from the Peking opera who find themselves hopelessly entwined in the turbulence of 20th Century China. Twice banned from Chinese cinemas because of the controversial content, this visually stunning film leaves no stone unturned to create a rich and emotionally powerful screen epic. Nominated for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award. Mandarin dialogue with English subtitles."
