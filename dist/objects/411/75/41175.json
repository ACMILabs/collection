        "Gary Cooper stars as 13th Century explorer and adventurer Marco Polo, the Venetian who opened the trade route from Europe to China. At the court of the great Kublai Khan, ruler of the Mongol Empire, Marco battles the intrigue of the court to win the admiration of the great Khan and the love of a beautiful Princess (Sigrid Guthrie). A classic historical drama filled with spectacular battle scenes, panoramas, opulent sets and costumes. Co-starring Basil Rathbone."
