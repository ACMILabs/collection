        "Researching Women's Suffrage leads Maddy and Josh to the State History Centre in Old Parliament House in Adelaide. There they learn about Mary Lee, one of the founders of the Women's Suffrage League in 1888. Through their research, Maddy begins to identify with the issues and struggle against discriminatory attitudes which Mary Lee faced. Dealing with the themes of power, control, respect and equality, a clever use of puppets and animation make this presentation entertaining and informative."
