        "This is the story of an unprejudiced heart and how it changed our valley forever. So begins Babe, the critically acclaimed, oscar-nominated film where the animals are the true stars. It is the tale of Hoggett's farm where every creature has a purpose until the orphaned piglet Babe arrives and turns everything upside down. Cared for by Fly, the sheepdog he soon comes to think of himself as a dog. Farmer Hoggett senses something special in Babe and though everyone thinks he is crazy, enters him in the National Sheepdog Championships. This is a truly heartwarming tale about having faith in your abilities and being true to your heart."
