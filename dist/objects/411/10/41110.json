        "Episode of Series \"Passport travellers' guides\". For many years, Tibet was a land shrouded in mystery, shadowed by the mighty Himalayas and closed to western travellers. This travelogue takes the viewer into the heart of Tibet and its people. From the wonderous Potola, once home to the Tibetan spirtual leader, the Dalai Lama, to the mountain herders and their yaks, to carpet factories where weavers work for months on elaborate designs, this is an incredible journey through a rugged landscape. The intensly spiritual nature of Tibetans and the incredibly beautiful monastaries and elaborate rituals which celebrate their faith are testimony to the country's strong commitment to Buddhist principles."
