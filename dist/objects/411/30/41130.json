        "Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe star in this adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's classic tale of a white man raised by Mohicans and who becomes embroiled in a clash between two strong and rival nations. Set in the American colonies during the bitter Anglo-French war of 1757, Daniel Day-Lewis as Hawkeye brings strength and passion to the role. This film is typical of the epic romantic sagas with its fast action, breathtaking scenery, spectacular battle scenes and a superb cast."
