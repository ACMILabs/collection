        "For centuries mankind has admired the soaring eagle and the effortless flight of the gull. While some aeronautical engineers perfect jumbo-jets and space probes, others continue to improve gliders for the sport of soaring. There is no cheaper form of flying. The fuel is solar energy, the motive forces are the thermal air currents triggered by the sun's rays. Call it sport, or just plain enjoyment, it is an emulation of the bird. This is a celebration of soaring from the viewpoint of real people who are involved in the sport. Narrated by Ian Roache."
