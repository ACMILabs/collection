        "From the makers of the \"Comic strip\" and the \"Young Ones\", this black and often tasteless comedy is certain to startle. Alex, a black waiter at a celebrated restaurant for the rich called \"Bastards\", is sacked. Determined to wreak revenge, he organises a people's take over and captures the restaurant. Renaming it \"Eat the Rich\", Alex and his friends serve up their own special brand of millionaires mince. Not for the faint-hearted and with a heavy metal soundtrack by Motorhead."
