        "This film shows without commentary how hunting is the traditional means of livelihood for the Eskimos in the barren Canadian northland. It also indicates how the less hostile environment of the low Arctic permits the Lapps to engage in husbandry and fishing. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
