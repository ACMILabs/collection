        "This film shows the wool-store operations associated with sale by sample. All operations are clearly shown from receival, the sampling line, and cataloguing to the auction sale. The \"close-ups\" of the sampling line and the mechanical handling in a single-level wool-store are extremely informative. The commentary is very clear and adequately describes the salient points. The film is recommended for wool-classing at an advanced level. No credits available."
