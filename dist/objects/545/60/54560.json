        "Visual awareness can be learned or acquired. Film is an ideal medium with which to explore the many ways of seeing. Some modes of seeing are important to life and survival; some enrich and expand our emotional and aesthetic lives. The educated eye is a creative eye. Each day can be an adventure in seeing - sometimes practical, often curious, exploring inner imagination, discovering beauty. Note: Contains some interesting images which now have a certain quality due to their age, eg American machinery and amusement park sequences in poster paint colors, reminiscent of Antonioni's Zabriski Point."
