        "Two years prior to the making of this documentary film, the Gordon family migrated from Great Britain to Australia. In the film titled \"If we don't go, we'll never know, will we?\" (Title Code 503633), the ABC's \"Chequerboard\" series looked at the family before they migrated and at their arrival and settline-in period in Australia. In this film, we now take a look at the family after nearly two years in the country. Do theyknow now? Has their dream of Australia been realised? In fact, did they make the right decision? The film tries to find the answers. Reported by Richard Oxenburgh."
