        "This film is a view of the life and career of the former Governor-General of Australia, Lord Casey. It is the first film about Lord Casey and covers the span of years from his birth in Brisbane in 1890 to his installation as a Knight of Garter at Windsor Castle nearly eighty years later. Following on from his political career which included such appointments as Treasurer in the Lyons government, Minister of Supply and Development in the first Menzies government, six years of World War II as the first Australian Minister to the United States and eventually Minister for External Affairs, Lord Casey finally became Governor-General of Australia in 1966. Photographers: Les Wesley, John Atkinson, Ron Bollman, David Brill."
