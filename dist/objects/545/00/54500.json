        "Animated satire on present-day commercial life. Depicts a mermaid in the harbour of a modern city who is charmed by a young man playing a flute and attempts to flee with him, but the machines which surround the harbour destroy her. Interesting use of sound (contrast between the harshness of mechanical sounds, and the beauty of flute music), and the animation has a surreal quality that is quite effective."
