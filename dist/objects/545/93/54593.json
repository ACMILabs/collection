        "Examines, without commentary, the physical characteristics and behavior of African animals in their natural environment, including the fleeting cheetah in action on the Serengeti Plains of Tanzania as it hunts its favourite prey, the Thompson's gazelle. Develops skills of self expression and encourages independent thought in relating visual experiences to creative activities. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
