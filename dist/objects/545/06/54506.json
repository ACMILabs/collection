        "This film is a study of life in a hot rainforest region of South-East Asia. Three families representing the three most numerous races of Sarawak, are presented in the form of sample studies. The first family is Chinese, the second Malay, and the third is Sea Dyak or Iban, as they are also called. Domestic life is shown in considerable detail including cooking, eating habits, growing of crops, the tapping of rubber-trees, life in the home and the religious practices in the case of the Malays who are Moslems. The problems of travel in a region where rivers are almost the only highways are also shown."
