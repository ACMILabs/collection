        "The mountains of Manchuria are dotted with rural communes - farm villages operating as production teams, working the land on a collective basis. While many of the farming techniques are primitive, the people are building towards an efficient tomorrow by operating small basic industries. Some are constructing their own chemical fertiliser plants and agricultural colleges. Their spirit of self-sufficiency and co-operation has its parallel in the urban industrial centres, where factory workers often build their own essential manufacturing equipment, and all major decisions in the plant are made by a committee of workers, technicians, and management officers. At harvest time, thousands of teachers, students and workers leave the cities to work beside their countrymen in the fields. Later, on National Liberation Day, these two life-styles merge again in celebration of their growing nation."
