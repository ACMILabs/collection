        "Norman McLaren takes a look at the choreography of ballet, with cinema effects that are all you would expect from this master of improvisation in music and illustration. By exposing the same frames as many as ten times, the artist creates a multiple image of the ballerina and her partner (Margaret Mercier and Vincent Warren). A bare, black stage and back-lit figures, plus the remote, airy music of panpipes, produce a quiet and detachment similar to that of another McLaren film, \"Lines\". Music by The United Folk Orchestra of Romania. (Seventeen awards, including Toronto; London; New York; Melbourne; Oscar nomination, Hollywood)."
