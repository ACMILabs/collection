        "Like the horse it resembles, the zebra travels in large herds following the edible grasses and available water. Chief among the zebra's physical traits are the striped markings that help camouflage it in the uneven light of dawn and dusk when it is most often hunted by lions. Shows scenes of zebras playing and socialising. Filmed in the national parks of Tanzania, East Africa."
