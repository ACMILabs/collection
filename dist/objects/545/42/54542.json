        "A lighthearted look at Australia in 1973 - its history, industry and tourist attractions. Commments upon the high degree of urbanisation, the enormous mineral reserves and industrial growth and the opportunities which exist for vacationers in both rural and coastal areas. Also looks at the breakdown of isolation through instant electronic communications and air travel. No other credits available."
