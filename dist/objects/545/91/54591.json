        "This film explores the work of Australian and European artists (such as Tadek Butlich from Britain and Isobel Foster from Australia) in the field of fabric sculpture, embroidery, and wall hangings. Detailed observation reveals wide variety in the use of textures, colors and fabrics. The film is not narrated; an electronic score complements the images. This film is suitable for upper primary and secondary levels."
