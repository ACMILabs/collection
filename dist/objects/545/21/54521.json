        "This film during the first few minutes shows the sale of wool and the post-sale testing of wool when sold by traditional methods. It then examines new testing systems being developed by the CSIRO for the more efficient objective measurement of wool. Appraisal trails carried out by the Australian Objective measurement Project to determine the feasibility of sale by sample are also examined. During these examinations, the \"grab sampler\" and the core sampler are featured."
