        "In 1965 and in 1967 the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies sponsored a film trip, but eh Australian Commonwealth Film Unit, to the Western Desert Region of Australia. The object of the trip was to film the daily life of nomadic Aborigines of the area. An attempt was made to locate groups still living in the desert. 63,000 feet of film were shot and in this record, or archival version of the material, every shot having ethnographic value is included. Film grammar has, in every case, taken second place. The film is divided into nineteen parts, seventeen of which were purchased for inclusion in the Film Library. Parts 3 and 11 were not purchased as they contain sacred material and , as such, are not suitable for use in schools. The seventeen parts which are in the library are more suited for used in secondary schools than in primary schools. However, titles will be recommended by Curriculum and Research Branch for use with the new Primary Social Studies Course. For general screenings, a condensed version has been made under the title of \"Desert People\", catalogue number 2790. 3604. Part 1, 21 min, b&w. Seed-cake making and general camp activity. 3602. part 2, 19 min b&w. Gum preparation, stone flaking, Djagamara leave Badjar."
