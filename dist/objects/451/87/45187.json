        "This film is one of a string of romantic melodramas involving three of the most influential people in the Indonesian film industry. Director Teguh Karya teamed Christine Hakim and Slamet Rahardjo (who were then both members of Teguh's theatre group, 'Teater Populer') as husband and wife, Hasan and Lela. Hasan, unable to meet the expectations of his father-in-law whom the married couple is staying with, is fast losing his self-esteem. Forced to work as a taxi driver after losing his job, he develops an ambiguous relationship with another woman when the situation at home becomes intolerable. Winner of 6 Citra Awards at the 1983 FFI. Music by Eros Djarot, screenwriter Slamet Rahardjo. Cast includes Christine Hakim, Slamet Rahardjo and Nungky Kusumastuti.
