        "Mushroom Records - founded by the charismatic Michael Gudinski, has proven to be one of the most influential independent Australian record labels. \"Counting the beat\" is a fascinating history of 25 years of Australian rock and roll, as well as tracing the label's evolution - its birth with such seminal figures as Billy Thorpe and Chain, through the glitz and glamour of Skyhooks, the pop glory days of soap stars Kylie and Jason, the breakthrough of Paul Kelly, and international success with Nick Cave, Peter Andre and Garbage. Australian performers such as Kylie Minogue, Jimmy Barnes, Deborah Conway and Paul Kelly take this opportunity to discuss the evolution of their careers, their ups and downs through these intimate interviews are enlightening, as well as being interspersed with studio footage from their performances."
