        "Tape 1 - Private Lives. On the first night of her honeymoon Amanda (Penelope Keith) feels that everything is perfect. The hotel room has a spectacular view, the cocktails are on the way and close by someone is singing a love song. To her horror she discovers that 'someone' is actually her ex-husband, also on honeymoon in a neighbouring hotel room. Noel Coward's script is as relevant today as when it was first written in 1930 when he also played the lead role. The dialogue is quickly paced and full of wit and insightful observations. Tape 2 - Noel Coward: A Private Life. This is a biographical documentary about the life and early success of Noel Coward as a child actor and then as a playwright and performer in the 1920s and '30s through to the post war years. The documentary contains footage from his performances as well as interviews with those who knew him providing a revealing insight into Coward's discrete private life that was significantly separate from his public image."
