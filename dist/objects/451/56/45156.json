        "Two parking cops (Jacqueline McKenzie and Kris McQuade) journey into the night with the reality of their work weighing heavy whilst they dream of love. Enter Brian (David Wenham) who thinks it is even tougher being a flower seller and the last thing he needs is a parking ticket. This is a delightful comedy that evokes the banalities, difficulties and romance in everyday life."
