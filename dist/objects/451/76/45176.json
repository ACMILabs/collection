        "This is the fourth, and without a doubt the best in the controversial 'Child's play' series. In the latest instalment Chucky (voiced supplied by Brad Dourif), the benevolent child's toy is bought back to life in this inventive and witty sequel which plays more like a demented homage to 'Bride of Frankenstein'. The sinister looking doll which is possessed by the evil spirit of a serial killer is resurrected from the dead by his unbalanced goth girlfriend (played with relish by Jennifer Tilly), who has wedding bells on her mind. However Chucky has more sinister intentions than marriage, when he and his trailer trash bride stow away with two runaway teens wrongly accused of murder. Hong Kong director Ronny Yu ('Bride with the white hair'), and writer Don Mancini have fashioned a wonderfully irresponsible film which proudly wears it's horror film references on its sleeve, giving the series some surreal, clever twists and turns. Cast also includes John Ritter, Alexis Arquette and Katherine Heigl."
