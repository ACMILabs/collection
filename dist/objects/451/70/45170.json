        "When four small time London cons pool their savings for a high-rolling illegal card game with local crime boss Hatchet Harry, things don't quite go as confidently anticipated. The four friends end up owing him half a million pounds with only a week to pay it off under threat of systematic loss of fingers if they fail to do so. As they engage in robbery, deception and double crossing involving their criminal next door neighbours, powerful drug barons and Harry himself to get the money, circumstances spiral surrealistically out of their control. The situation is further complicated by confusion over two valuable antique guns that Hatchet Harry has purchased, and which are mistakenly directed for use in pulling a 'job'. The four hapless friends muddle through the seedy underside of London and an unwittingly created gang war in a collection of comic moments and misunderstandings balanced seamlessly with more serious elements. This is a tightly structured film with a cleverly twisted plot and striking rhythmic visuals and editing that, combined with the soundtrack, can be likened to the best of music videos. Cast includes Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason Stratham and Steven Mackintosh."
