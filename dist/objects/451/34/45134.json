    "description": [
        "A compilation of British avant-garde and experimental documentary films from the thirties. The thirties in Britain was a period characterised by the slump, hunger marches and the rise of Fascism in Europe. These shifts led to a social idealism that is reflected in the ongoing flourishing of the avant-garde filmmaking that began in the twenties, and the founding of British realism under the auspices of the Empire Marketing Board and the GPO Film Unit. The diversity of filmmaking that characterises this era can be clearly seen in this compilation where different styles and genres jostle each other as do quite distinct voices, attitudes and political ideologies."
