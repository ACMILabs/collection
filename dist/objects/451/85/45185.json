        "Russian-trained director Sjuman Djaya depicts a story of the social stigma faced by a young widow in middle-class Jakarta. Jenny Rachman plays the pretty wife who is left widowed when her pilot husband dies suddenly. After being taunted by several other men she takes a liking to Dimas, her late husband's younger brother, who bears a striking resemblance to him. Dimas starts to replace his brother as the young children mistake him for their dead father. The children's mother however resists Dimas' marriage proposal for fear that it is not true love that has brought them together. Winner of 4 Citra Awards at the 1990 FFI. Cast includes Jenny Rachman, Roy Marten and Joice Erna. In Indonesion with English subtitles that are sometimes difficult to read."
