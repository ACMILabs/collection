        "What kind of place will Australia be in the future? Join Aunty M the River Red Gum and a whole host of fascinating characters on an interactive mission to maintain some of Australia's uniquely beautiful environments and preserve its distinctive flora and fauna. Enter the simulator and journey to the coast, an estuary, an arid rangeland, or even the city where you will encounter environmental problems, and be offered a wide range of suggestions to solve them, but keep in mind every action wins a score. Some solutions might not rate in terms of human prosperity, but will drastically improve the environment. Alternatively, some solutions will benefit humans, but impact negatively on our surroundings. Your mission is to find a logical balance between profit and preservation before it's too late. Beautiful graphics, easy to install and very user-friendly. Teacher's notes and class activity sheets can be downloaded from the CD. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: For Windows, 486 DX2/66 or better (Pentium recommended) running Windows 95/Windows 3.1, 16 megabytes or more of RAM. Double speed or faster CD-ROM drive (Quad speed recommended). Sound card (stereo 16-bit recommened), and 640X480 Super VGA display (256 colour or better). For Macintosh, 68040 or better (Power PC recommended) running Mac OS System 7.5 or later, 8 megabytes of free RAM. Double-speed or faster CD-ROM drive (Quad speed recommended), 640X480 display (256 colour or better)."
