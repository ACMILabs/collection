        "A collaboration by four budding Indonesian filmmmakers, 'Kuldesak' intercuts the stories of four young urbanites, exploring problems and dilemmas in contemporary Jakarta. Aksan is an aspiring filmmaker in need of money to finance his first film; Andre, a lonely teen on his birthday who somewhat identifies with Kurt Cobain; Dina, the box office attendant is preoccupied with her television star idol who often comes to the theatre she works at; and Lina, the office girl is taken hostage by her own boss. The film took three years to complete, commencing pre-production in 1996 during the Suharto rule and was released five months after his resignation. Fresh by Indonesian standards, the film showcases the country's young talents and potential. It is also an illustration of Western influence both on youth culture in Indonesia and filmmaking itself. The cast, as well as musicians appearing on the soundtrack, reads like the who's who of current Indonesian pop culture. In Indonesian with English subtitles. Not suitable for young teenagers- contains youth suicide and moderate to high levels of violence."
