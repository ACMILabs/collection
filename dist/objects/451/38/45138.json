        "Laura's pregnant! follows 16 year old Laura as she discovers she is pregnant and reflects back on how it all happened, the myths her pregnancy refutes and how she and the baby's father deal with the situation emotionally and the dilemmas they face. The program briefly explores her options of termination, adoption, marriage and single parenting, without revealing which decision she chooses. A teacher's guide accompanies the video and provides activities around each section of the tape as well as an extensive bibliography. Suitable for lower and middle secondary school students."
