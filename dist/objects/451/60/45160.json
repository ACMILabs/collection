        "This hilarious adventure centres around two boy scouts, who, while on \"bob-a-job\" stumble on a spooky old house. Instead of earning the odd job money they were hoping to obtain, they are soon challenged to a battle of wits with the evil owner. However, times have changed and little boys are not quite so easy to scare as they used to be, much to the evil man's horror."
