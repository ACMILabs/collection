        "The Who! What's in a name you say? everything, especially when you talk about the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band, a name bestowed upon this group of 4 English musicians in the mid '70's. The Who, formed in 1964 and consisting of Keith Moon on drums, John Entwhistle on bass guitar and vocals, Pete Townshend - lead guitar, vocals and major lyricist for the group and Roger Daltry - main vocals. All of the tracks included on the tape come from the album \"Who's Better, Who's Best\" (made in 1980), although this video does take you on a journey from 1966 through to 1978. Moon died tragically in August of that year. Keith Moon's distinct style of drumming is evident in all the film clips except for \"You Better, You Bet\" with Kenny Jones on drums. The song \"Pinball Wizard\" from the Rock Opera \"Tommy\" - considered by many as the definitive rock album, is only one of the many hits contained on the tape. As is \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", filmed at the Shepparton Studios in July 1978 and became the group's signature song. Song on the tape include: \"My Generation\"; \"I can't explain\"; \"Substitute\"; \"The kids are alright\"; \"I'm a boy\"; \"Happy Jack\"; \"Pictures of Lily\"; \"You better, you bet\"; \"I can see for miles\"; \"Magic bus\"; \"Pinball wizard\"; \"I'm free\"; \"See me, feel me\"; \"Join together\"; \"Who are you\" and \"Won't get fooled again\"."
