        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Animal shelf\". Five stories are contained on this tape comprising LITTLE MUT GOES FLYING, BABYSITTING FOR MRS MOLE, TIMOTHY'S PET BALLOON, THE TRAIL and THE MODEL MONSTER. LITTLE MUT GOES FLYING: The animals decide to build a see saw- motivated by a trip to the playground. Woeful decides that's boring and sets off to Bluebell Wood to build a swing. BABYSITTING FOR MRS MOLE: Stripey and Getup babysit the baby moles whilst Mrs Mole is visiting her sick sister. They have their hands full when the babies escape from the summer house. TIMOTHY'S PET BALLOON: The animals start to worry that Timothy doesn't love them anymore when he tells them that he's buying a rabbit. An unexpected visitor arrives on the shelf and the animals decide to move into the rabbit hutch. THE TRAIL: The animals become interested in exploration after Timothy reads them a book about explorers. Timothy decides it would be fun if he laid a trail of his own and the animals get a chance to be explorers as they follow the clues Timothy has left them. THE MODEL MONSTER: The animals try their hand at model making after seeing Timothy make a model ship from some old pieces of cardboard and egg boxes."
