        "This hand-painted animation has no narration, but the story is simply and beautifully told through the use of images. It is the tale of a travelling circus, whose only performer is a brown bear, which is badly treated by it's cruel master. Due to waning interest in the performance of the star act, the circus master closes the circus and sells the bear to three men who, unbeknownst to him, wish to set the bear free, only to hunt it down. The bear eludes his would-be killers, finds a deserted tricycle and escapes to freedom using his talents. The film provides a beautiful metaphor for the triumph of the human spirit under the weight of great oppression, if we rely on our wits and use our skills and talents to provide the strength and opportunity required to escape our bonds, anything is possible."
