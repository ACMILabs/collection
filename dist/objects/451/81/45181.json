        "One of Arifin C. Noer's well-known works, 'Taksi' is a social commentary about going against the establishment. Guyon, a philosophy graduate, decides to leave the comfort of his rich uncle's house to become a taxi driver after two years of being unemployed. During one of his rounds, Guyon picks up an unwed mother on her way to a singing audition. She entrusts the baby with him and the two develop a friendship; she succeeds in the entertainment business but is drawn into a web of lies and posturing. The film swept all the major awards at the 1990 Citra Awards including Best Actor - Rano Karno. This, his first Citra Award, propelled Karno into mega-stardom in Indonesia. Cast also includes Meriam Bellina. In Indonesian with English subtitles that are sometimes hard to read."
