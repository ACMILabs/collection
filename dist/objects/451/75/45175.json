        "Mainly working within the parameters of the horror genre, few director's have the popularity and cult status to warrant their name in the films title, however John Carpenter (\"Halloween\", \"The Thing\", \"Escape from New York\", \"Assault on Precinct 13\") has the body of work and the loyal followers to back it up. Based on John Steakley's novel, \"Vampires\" stars James Woods as Jack Crow, a sadistic vampire slayer working for the Vatican and searching for the 600 year old originator of the blood curse. Crow and his crew of vampire hunters end up in a small town in New Mexico where they uncover a 'nest' of the undead. As bait they use a newly bitten prostitute (Sheryl Lee) who now has telepathic links to the master, in an effort to trap the head bloodsucker. Cast also includes Daniel Baldwin, Thomas Ian Griffith, Maximillian Schell, and Tim Guinee. Music by John Carpenter."
