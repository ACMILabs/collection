        "'Computer games' is a light-hearted drama about clashing personalities and computer crime in the corporate world. The director's intention was to create a good, fun, entertaining film with a number of twists and surprises. The setting of the film is a high technology office environment where employee Raymond Edwards (David Whiteley) has one basic problem. For many years he has endured the company of Tony Simmons, a naive and aggravating workmate. Raymond's experience is one to which many people can relate. He is frustrated by the constant annoying presence of a workmate who has followed him like a shadow through his career. Desperate to prevent Tony being considered for a promotion, Raymond frames him for embezzlement."
