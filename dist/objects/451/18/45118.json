        "On the threshold of year 12 Morgan Preston seems to have everything under control. She has a best friend, is familiar with the teachers, and is keeping on top of the ever increasing amount of homework. Morgan's stability is threatened with the arrival of a new history teacher, Jack Hamilton. Jack and Morgan develop an unusual relationship that challenges the boundaries of conformity and forces both of them into a moral dilemma. Cast includes Alison Gordon, Luke Dean, Georgina McClure and Maureen Sherlock."
