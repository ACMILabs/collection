        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Animal shelf\". Five stories are contained on this tape comprising THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR, THE WORLD IN THE WOOD, WOEFUL FLIES TO THE MOON, CAPTAIN GUMPA and THE ALARM CLOCK. THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR: There is a prize to be won for the animals who can come up with the best way of keeping cool on the hottest day of the year. When all their efforts fail, Timothy brings home the winning idea. THE WORLD IN THE WOOD: The animals build themselves houses to protect themselves from wolves after hearing the story of the Three Little Pigs. Woeful has his own plans, plans which backfire when they discover a puppy has escaped from the funfair. WOEFUL FLIES TO THE MOON: The animals become fascinated by the moon and decided they would like to visit it in a space rocket. Woeful claims to have been there and brought back a souvenir- or has he? CAPTAIN GUMPA: Timothy throws a party for Gumpa, the oldest animal on the shelf. Upset at being thought of as an old bear, Gumpa plans to build a boat and sail away. THE ALARM CLOCK: Timothy is given an alarm clock by his mother when he can't get out of bed in the morning for school. After the alarm keeps going off in the middle of the night the animals hide it, however the clock keeps mysteriously reappearing."
