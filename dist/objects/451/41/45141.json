        "'Hana-bi' might of launched director and star Takeshi Kitano onto the international film scene but the prolific film maker (who also goes by the name 'Beat' Takeshi) was already a star in his home country where he wears many creative hats. Besides feature films he works extensively in television, is also known as a comedian and has now added painter to his impressive resume. (Kitano's artwork is on display throughout Hana-bi) Kitano's genius lies in the radically contrasting rhythm of narrative and style. One minute a poignant and understated drama about a cop (Kitano) and his terminally ill wife (Kayoko Kishimoto), the next an excessively violent police film, punctuated by bloody scenes of mayhem. The two radically different strands are seamlessly bought together by Kitano's restrained direction, the mosaic editing style, quirky characterisations and the fine musical score by Joe Hisaishi. In Japanese with English subtitles Cast also includes Ren Osugi and Susumu Terajima. (Awards: Golden Lion 1997 Venice Film Festival)"
