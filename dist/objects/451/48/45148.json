        "Haunted by the dogs of his childhood, Dennis Tupicoff tries to explain his feelings about dogs to his young daughter. With the use of a strong animation style Tupicoff tells the story of his youth in Darra, then an industrial suburb of Brisbane, where every household seemed to have a dog. Some dogs were friends that shared their lives and then sadly disappeared or were victims of early deaths as a result of disease or cars. Others were huge and savage and seemed to stalk through their days spreading fear as they lived long and dangerous lives. This is a memorial film to the terrors of childhood, the insecurities, the sadness of death and loss, and to the dogs themselves."
