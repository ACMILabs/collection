        "Discusses industries and the pattern of life in Alaska. The aeroplane has played an important part in the development of this rugged and sparsely-populated country by carrying supplies and goods from city to city and enabling posts in the outback to be established. Fishing is the largest industry, but lumbering and gold mining are important. Eskimos are employed in selling furs and artistic ornaments to tourists. Many visitors come to the country to hunt big game, fish and observe the beauties of snow and ice."
