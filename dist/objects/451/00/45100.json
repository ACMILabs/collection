        "Agnieszka Holland's ('Europa, Europa') excessive tale about the destructive and passionate affair between French poets Arthur Rimbaud (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis) is an intense study of genius and the sometimes maddening nature of creativity. Written by Christopher Hampton ('Dangerous Liaisons'), 'Total eclipse' portrays the two men as being narcissistic sadists, who only take time out from torturing each other in order to torment Verlaine's timid and unfortunate wife (Romane Bohringer). Cast also includes Dominique Blanc."
