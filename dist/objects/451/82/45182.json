        "A young Lydia Kandou plays Johanna, a Dutchman's daughter living during the Dutch occupation of Indonesia. Johanna is kidnapped by Pengkuh, a local rebel whose girlfriend is killed by a Dutch soldier, and taken to the jungle. What develops between the Dutch girl and Pengkuh is a 'Blue Lagoon' type inter-racial romance set against the lush, green backdrop of the Javanese forest. The film features rare explicit on-screen kisses, which would otherwise only be seen in the genre of cheap 'sex-themed' Indonesian films. Cast includes Lydia Kandou and Atek Sudharmo. In Indonesian with English subtitles."
