        "Nineteenth century Dutch Batavia serves as a backdrop to influential Indonesian director Teguh Karya's first feature. 'Ballad of a Young Man' is about Amallo, a local of Portuguese descent, and his troubled relationship with his womanising father. His father is an important man in the village who works for the Dutch, keeping watch over their horses. Amallo, on the other hand, is a rebel who steals ammunition and horses from the Dutch soldiers. When Amallo returns to his village after spending some time in the city, he is betrayed by his best friend who is consumed with jealousy. Meanwhile, Amallo's father has been promoted by the Dutch for recovering stolen horses. The film is told in flashback, a favourite storytelling technique of the director (see also 'Bitter Coffee'). Slamet Rahardjo - protege of Teguh Karya - now Head of the Film Council and a prominent figure in Indonesia, makes his acting debut as Amallo. Cast also includes W.D. Mochtar and Rima Melati. In Indonesian with English subtitles."
