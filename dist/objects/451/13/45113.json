        "Featuring marionettes from Germany's Augsburger Puppet Theatre, this is a love story with a difference, where the action is below the city streets and the star crossed lovers are rodents. The story is a combination of the children's book by Tor Seidler and illustrated by Fred Marcellino, and an elaboration on a short story pilot by Monty Spinnerratz. Isabella Noble-Rat is swept off her feet by Monty Mad-Rat Jnr. after an impressive tour of New York's underground sewers. Her parents are against their daughter's union with someone beneath their station, much to Isabella's chagrin. There are bigger issues at hand however as the rat community is threatened by rising drain waters and a proposed mass extermination of the rodent community. Perhaps Isabella's beau can save the day and impress her snooty parents at the same time. Cast includes Beverly D'Angelo, Jerry Stiller, Josef Ostendorf and Lauren Hutton, and featuring the voices of Lynsey Bartilson, Ray Guth, Scott MacDonald and Donald Arthur."
