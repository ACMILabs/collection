        "A wild, surreal, multimedia ride through five decades of Australian rock music, focusing on seven major eras. Stroll to the milkbar to experience the music of 1956-63. Sneak into a girl's bedroom to find out what was happening there between 1964-68. Take a trip to the hippie's house to discover the meaning of music during 1969-73. Front up to the TV studio to study the impact of what unfolded between 1974-77. Circle the perimeter of the room at the Hotel to get the low-down on the happenings of 1978-83. Gatecrash the nightclub to observe interesting phenomena occurring between 1984-89, until finally hauling your tired body into a deck chair in the 1990's garage to conclude the exploration. Fabulously presented, with informative snippets of information, excellent graphics and soundtrack, as well as cameos by some of Australia's most well known (and often notorious) identities.
