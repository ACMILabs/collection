        "In this sequel to \"Superman: the movie\", the Man of Steel's romance with Lois Lane begins to blossom just as three villains from Krypton - who all have powers to match Superman's - arrive on Earth with the intention of destroying the planet. With the help of arch-criminal Lex Luthor, the three locate Superman and when the truth is uncovered about Superman's past - he being the son of their jailer - they seek to avenge Jor-El by killing his only son. The battle between Good and Evil culminates in a spectacular duel above Metropolis, and ends back at Superman's home, where with a tricky manoeuvre, Superman restores order and peace on Earth. Cast includes: Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman and Terrence Stamp."
