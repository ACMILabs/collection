        "The origin and growth of the Islets making up the Florida Keys is explained. Mangrove bushes grow with amazing rapidity providing shelter to sea-birds, and assisting in the formation of marine life such as crabs, lobsters, and shell fish, all of which play their part in stabilising the growing islet. Rain helps reduce the salty content of the substratum until it is able to support other forms of plant life besides mangroves. Eventually insects and reptiles are soon represented and the ecological history of the island is complete."
