        "'Forest Gump' won audiences over with it's universal theme of the underdog who triumphs in the face of adversity, carefully intercut with definitive moments in American history. This program provides a behind the scenes look at how director Robert Zemeckis and his team of special effects artist created the illusion of past and present meeting - such as when Forest meets several U.S. presidents, as well as the special effects involved in recreating the anti-war demonstration, the ping pong game, Lt. Dan's amputated body and the hurricane. Interviews are provided with cast members Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field and Michael Humphreys."
