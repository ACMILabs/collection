        "A hilarious spoof where teenagers Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) take on a sleazy TV executive (Rob Lowe) after his offer of a huge contract to tape their late night cable access show. After starting at the network it quickly becomes apparent that the road to the big time is hardly what it seems. At first a cause for celebration, Wayne and Garth's progress to public success soon threatens the philosophy of genuine fun and enjoyment the two promote, and threatens Wayne's attempts to win over rock musician Cassandra (Tia Carrerre). A non-stop comedy with a sincere twist, this film is tightly scripted by Myers and Bonnie and Terry Turner and can be well appreciated at many levels."
