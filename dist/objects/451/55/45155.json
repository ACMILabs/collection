        "When Fabian, a reclusive young man who lives and works in a laundrette, meets Lolita, there is only one obstacle to his new found love - his mother who lives upstairs. Gradually he conquers her jealousy and wrath as well as his own insecurities as Lolita teaches him more about himself and his relations with others. Lolita collapses stereotypes and frees him from the suffocating influence of his mother. This is a light hearted and comical film with none the less powerful messages."
