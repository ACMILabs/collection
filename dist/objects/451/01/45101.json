        "From the dawn of time there has been the immortals, destined to live forever and compete for the ultimate prize, duelling against one another until there is only one left with power beyond imagination. Only decapitation can end their immortality. Set in contemporary Manhatten, this fantasy saga follows Highlander Connor Macleod (Christopher Lambert) in a battle against his eternal enemy and main contender for the prize, The Kurgan (Clancy Brown). After being arrested by the police for a fracas in an underground carpark which results in a headless body, Connor must also contend with the inundation of questions, and challenge the notion that immortals cannot fall in love. Connor discovers he is one of the immortals when he is \"killed\" during a battle in the Scottish highlands by The Kurgan, but miraculously does not die. He learns of his status by fellow immortal Ramirez (Sean Connery), who must cede his immortality by decapitation to make way for a superior contender to battle for the prize. This cult classic makes effective use of flashbacks between past and present and spawned many less superior sequels. Cast includes also Roxanne Hart, Beatie Edney and Alan North. Soundtrack by Queen."
