        "Australia provides the backdrop for this loose retelling of the eternal story of biblical hero Noah (Jon Voight), the great flood that destroyed the world, and the ark that was built by Noah and his family and housed two of every animal species. This made for television movie was not well received by critics, despite its international cast of Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen and F. Murray Abraham."
