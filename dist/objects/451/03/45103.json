        "Set in the 1950's, this live action film is based on plot elements found in several of Ludwig Bemelmans much loved novels about the adventures of the orphan Madeline and her friends. In this film Madeline's French boarding school is threatened with closure when Lord Covington (Nigel Hawthorn) decides to sell the property, leaving the girls and schoolmistress Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand), homeless. The plucky Madeline takes it upon herself to save her home and that of her 11 friends, thus facilitating some interesting adventures, including falling into the Seine and being saved by a dog whom she befriends and names Genevieve. In her plot to save the school she remembers an advantageous relationship she made when she was in hospital for an appendectomy when she met Lord Covington's dying wife. There are other forces at bay too to help Madeline, next door neighbour Pepito is creating some distracting noise pollution by whizzing around on his Vespa; deterring any interested buyers. It quickly becomes apparent that Pepito is is also in need of Madeline's help when she discovers a plot by the circus performers, Idiots Popopov to kidnap him. With combined efforts they might be able to save the day. Cast includes Hatty Jones (Madeline), Frances McDormand, Nigel Hawthorn, Ben Daniels and Arturo Venegas."
