        "A fascinating introduction to the history and practice of Astrology. Includes interviews with astrologers talking about astrology and the history of astrology. By looking at the astrological charts of famous people (such as J.F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan) we see how astrologers put together a chart then interpret it to give people valuable information about patterns in their life or behaviour. Explains how a the planets influence human life on Earth and how people have consulted with astrologers for over seven thousand years. Also considers the debate between traditional scientists and astrologers over the validity of Astrology as a science. Narrated by Christopher Lee."
