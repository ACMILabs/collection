        "A series of lessons in the language of love which traces a relationship from go, to the inevitable whoa. Two people meet (Richard Roxburgh and Anni Finsterer), they connect, one disconnects, the other can't and then it's over. By the end of the film you may decide the language of love is much too hard to learn- but that may be the most important lesson of all."
