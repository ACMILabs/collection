        "This movie has all the classic elements usually found in westerns of the 1930's - 1950's. The dashing hero, the fair damsel in need of rescuing, the despised villain, singing, dancing, and the big chase scene. It's all here. The one thing that separates this movie from any other western is the cast. 100% midgets, the entire movie is cast with actors under the height of 4 feet 8 inches, with a couple of fellas who just might make three feet. You haven't seen a true chase scene until you see a group of guys chasing each other on Shetland ponies."
