        "Raul Julia stars in this story of a trio of performers who play, sing and dance at the \"Tango Bar\" in Buenos Aires. The trio are split apart by a revolution in Argentina and reunited after 10 years of exile. Whilst the plot of \"Tango Bar\" revolves around the story of Pedro (Raul Julia), Elena (Valeria Lynch) and Antonio (Ruben Jaurez), it is primarily a tribute to Tango in Argentina. As they perform their show at the Tango Bar - singing, dancing tango and talking about its history and politics, the film flashes to dance sequences of tango performed at various times in the history of the dance form. In Spanish with English subtitles."
