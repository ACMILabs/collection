        "This affectionate tribute to the ordinary man is a panoramic story of the life of a London family during the two World Wars. Based on Noel Coward's successful play (he also wrote the musical score), the film chronicles the Gibbons family from 1919 to 1939, and was released during the Second World War as part of the British film industry's war effort. Robert Newton and Celia Johnson are Frank and Ethel Gibbons who, with their daughters Queenie (Kay Walsh) and Phyllis (Betty Fleetwood), face the day to day crises of ordinary life to survive as both individuals and as a family. Stanley Holloway and a very young John Mills star in this production along with narrator Laurence Olivier."
