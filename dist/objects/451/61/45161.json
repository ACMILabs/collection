        "It is Lily's 15th birthday and she is faced with spending the day with her ridiculous and unbearable family. Until her party she escapes into her dreams of \"football star\", Tony Young - the latest object of her romantic imagination. At the same time Old Hob, a permanent resident in the family hotel, is set upon finding the 'big stream', enlisting a skateboarding gang to form a team of water diviners which includes Jeff, who has a crush on Lily. At the climax of her day circumstances go embarrassingly and disastrously awry as Lily is trying to deal with her family and her hopeful yet unrequited love for Tony. Yet, with the help of a little magic, even under the reign of absolute chaos, something might just turn out alright for Lily."
