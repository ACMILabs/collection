        "In the tradition of previous work of Palin's that includes \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" and \"Pole to Pole\", this is a beautifully filmed and cleverly narrated documentary which traces Palin's journey in the footsteps of American writer Ernest Hemingway. In his attempts to experience Hemingway's adventures things don't always work quite as planned, but the result is always humourous and insightful both on the contradictory literary giant and the impact of the diversity of sights Palin visits. His tour includes such attractions as the fireworks of Valencia, the streets of Paris, the outback of Uganda and the snows of Kilimanjaro that feature in Hemingway's work. Palin's mastery of narrational comedy and Nigel Meakin's skilled camerawork makes this a highly energetic travelogue."
