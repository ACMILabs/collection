        "An animated musical film which tells the story of Moses, based on the book of Exodus in the Old Testament. Follows Moses from the moment his mother sends him out onto the River Nile in a basket of reeds, to his triumphant leading of his people out of slavery in Egypt. In \"Prince of Egypt\" Dreamworks Pictures attempts to make an animated film on the scale of an epic film. It combines the cute cornball of animated characters and musical numbers with lavish biblical backdrops, such as the magnificently realised parting of the red sea. The cast of voices includes a who's who of Hollywood stars. (Awards: Winner of 1998 Academy Award for Best Original Song - \"When You Believe\")"
