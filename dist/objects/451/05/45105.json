        "Superman: the movie is an immensely entertaining recount of the origin of the famous comic book character. Opening on Krypton (where Marlon Brando plays Superman's father), the film follows the Man of Steel as he's sent to Earth where he develops his alter-ego, Clark Kent, and is raised by a Midwestern rural family. At the age of 30, Clark loses his earthly father and moves to the city, getting a job as news reporter at the Daily Planet. It's here that he falls in love with Lois Lane, who is already in love with Superman. The love story is quickly sidetracked once the infamous and villainous Lex Luthor launches a diabolical plan to conquer the world and kill Superman. Includes film story by Mario Puzo. Cast includes Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Glenn Ford and Susannah York."
