    "description": [
        "In Tracey Moffatt's re-imaging of the pivotal Australian film \"Jedda\", a middle-aged Aboriginal woman returns to her outback home to nurse her dying white mother. Filmed against lushly coloured sets that recall the technicolour glories of the past, and utilising a harsh discordant soundscape, \"Night Cries\" occupies the landscape of dreams and the classic mythic terrain of familial violence and betrayal. This short film does more than simply reconfigure and re-imagine past narratives. It inaugurated a clear and permament break with previous moving image representations of the \"outback\": no longer the pretence that it is a place outside language and history."
