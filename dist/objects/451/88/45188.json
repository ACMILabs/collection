        "A melodrama about the oppression of women during the Japanese occupation in Southeast Asia. Leaving for Singapore thinking she is being sent to medical school by the Japanese, Kadarwati arrives only to find she has been picked to serve the Japanese soldiers stationed there. When she finally meets a Japanese officer who is kind to her and with whom she falls in love, he leaves her behind by committing harakiri. After being subject to abuses and torture by Japanese soldiers, she is brought back home to Java where she plots revenge - changing her name and becoming a prostitute at Japanese headquarters. Directed by Sophan Sophiaan, who became a politician and member of Megawati Sukarnoputri's PDI-P. In Indonesian with English subtitles."
