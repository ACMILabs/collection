        "This film is about something that many of us can relate to - the lack of communication between neighbours, which in this case reaches crisis point when a minor incident magnifies existing troubles. A young woman minding her own business within the confines of her terrace house is hit in the face by a tennis ball which flies through the window - courtesy of the next door neighbour's kids. When she refuses to give the ball back the hostility between her and the neighbours escalates and the police are called to intervene. Through a series of humiliating incidents the two neighbours actually start talking to each other and animosities melt away. Cast includes Monica Trapaga, Deborah Kennedy and Paul Eperjesi. (Awards: Winner, Best Short Film, AFI Awards, 1991)"
