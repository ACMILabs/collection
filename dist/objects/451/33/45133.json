        "Three beautiful sisters are really Chinese \"fox fairies\" who have been granted mortal form in return for doing good deeds. If they resist the temptations of the mortal world, they can eventually achieve immortality. One by one, they each meet a mysterious handsome scholar and make wild, abandoned love with him (and occasionally with each other). Each of the sisters deceives the others about their activities, but eventually they all suspect each other. And when fox hair begins to grow on their bodies, the truth is out. They go to confront the scholar, only to find that he is the god of Carnal Desire, Wu Tung. Basically a soft-porn comedy that also features lush cinematography and costumes, and impressive fight sequences. Cast includes Amy Yip, Man Siu, Pal Sin and Kamimura Kyoko. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
