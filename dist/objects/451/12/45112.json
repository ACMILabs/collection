        "This debut from director Martine Dugowson is a poignant study of friendship as it stands the test of time. Two French Jewish girls - Ethel and Mina, are begrudgingly thrown together by their mutual lack of ascribing to social conventions in Paris in the late 1960's. As they move into adolescence their friendship blossoms, becomes the only source of happiness, and sometimes a source of conflict as they move away from their peer groups and family. The film chronicles 25 years of the lives and loves of two best friends who share a love/hate relationship. Cast includes Romane Bohringer, Elsa Zylberstein, Florence Thomassin and Nils Tavernier. In French with English subtitles."
