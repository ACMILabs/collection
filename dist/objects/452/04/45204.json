        "Each year, great damage is done to the Australian wool clip by branding fluids. At wool sales, the price for marked wool decreases and in scouring and milling processes later, it is impossible to remove all the dirty wool, resulting in the needless waste of finished woollen goods. The CSIRO has developed an accurable and permanent branding fluid, \"Si-Ro-Mark\" and its wide-spread use to replace tar, sump-oil and other unsatisfactory fluids is advocated, not only in the interests of the grower but also the Australian wool and woollen textile industry as a whole."
