        "A video training package (with facilitator's manual) designed to assist managers and supervisors in their vital role of achieving effective management of critical incidents in the workplace. A critical incident is a traumatic event or situation, such as an attack, accident or natural disaster that could have long-term negative effects on those involved. This video package demonstrates how sensitive responses and appropriate interventions from management, both in the immediate aftermath of the incident and in the weeks to follow, can accelerate recovery time and enhance staff morale. See also 'Critical incidents and trauma: response and recovery for staff' (310860)."
