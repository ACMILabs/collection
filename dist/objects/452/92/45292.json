        "Silent footage of parts of Victoria and its people from the 1950s produced to promote Victoria. \"The Rip\" is the first sequence lasting approximately three minutes, where a family park the car to take in the view. They watch large cargo ships traverse the narrow entrance to Port Phillip Bay known as The Rip. Point Lonsdale is shown - the main street (full of fabulous cars from the era) and the lighthouse. Family beach fun is shown as children play in the shallows, people sunbake or rest in the shade of an umbrella, knit, go camping, wash baby in a big plastic tub, walk over the dunes, go surfing or play ballgames. \"The Rose Chapel of St Helena\" is a sequence approximately two minutes long about a small church in the Eltham/Greensborough area but before getting to that area there are a couple of shots of the City of Melbourne. The Chapel is shown, as are the gravestones from the 1850s that surround the chapel of this small Church of England. Some patrons and a clergyman are also in attendance. \"Yarra Bridges\" is the final sequence lasting about three minutes and it has some wonderful views of Melbourne and the Bridges that cross the Yarra River. St Pauls Cathedral over Princes Bridge, a view of the Governor's Residence, cars, trains and assorted automobiles, a white helmeted policeman directing traffic, construction of pillars for a new bridge, the swing bridge at Yarra Bend and a Yarra River Boat Cruise are all shown."
