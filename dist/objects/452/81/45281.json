        "Episode of Series \"The Designers\". This episode of \"The Designers\" series focuses on Gianni Versace and Hubert de Givenchy, two fashion designers who have had untold influence on fashion design in the twentieth century. Their designs affected not only the rich and famous who wore their creations but also the general public who were undoubtedly influenced by their sense of style. \"Gianni Versace: Tragedy and Triumph\" was made not long after Versace's death in Miami. It includes interviews with Versace as well as comments from other designers, fashion industry people and celebrities who wore his clothes. The episode also looks at the retrospective exhibition of Versace's creations at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, organised after Versace's death by Donatella Versace and the museum. \"Givenchy: Timeless Elegance\" looks at Givenchy's career which has spanned more than four decades. In particular it shows how the combination of Givenchy's elegant designs and the charm of his muse/model Audrey Hepburn entranced the world. Includes interviews with Givenchy, Hepburn and fashion industry people as well as admirers of Givenchy's clothes."
