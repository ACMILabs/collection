        "Beni Abbes is a Scientific Research Centre, set up in the Sahara by the French. This film shows some of he work being done, in an effort to make the desert fertile once more. Test growing of plants, the use of wind to drive pumps which draw water from below the sand, and an experimental station which aims to harness the sun's heat to produce power are some of the activities shown."
