        "An account of Britain's vast nuclear power program for a new industrial era, and of progress to date. Operational centres visited by the film include Calder Hall, the first full-scale nuclear power station; the great atomic research centre at Harwell; the atomic factories at Springfields, Capenhurst and Windscale; and the \"fast breeder-reactor\" under construction at Dounreay. Animated diagrams explain the working of a nuclear reactor."
