        "Reality Bites is Ben Stiller's directorial debut, and one of the more mainstream offerings in the array of films that emphasized the \"Generation X\" phenomenon. Lelaina is a recent college graduate out on her own and independent from her supportive, but out-of-touch parents, facing the realities of careers and relationships in the adult world. She can't stand her internship under a local television personality, and is forced to choose between Michael, a well-intentioned music-video network executive, and Troy, a brooding, sensitive slacker. Meanwhile, she must also protect the artistic integrity of her video documentary that depicts the everyday lives of her friends and herself. Cast includes: Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo and Steve Zahn."
