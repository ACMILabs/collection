        "Episode of Series \"The Researchers\". Graziers have claimed for years that the dingo is responsible for heavy stock losses, specially among sheep. The Australian Meat Research Committee responded by earmarking funds for a scientific study of the dog. A team from the CSIRO's Division of Wildlife Research in Canberra was mobilised in 1966 to carry out the study. Across Central Australia and the East Coast, the dogs were observed, tracked and examined in their own domain for thousands of hours. The difficulty it seems is that there is no one answer for dingo management in the scientific sense for any place in Australia and any one answer therefore for all of Australia. Management will have to be much more flexible, changing from place to place and from time to time."
