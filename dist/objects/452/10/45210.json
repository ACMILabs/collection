        "Episode of Series \"This is the United Nations\" Cinemagazine items: 1. UN at work on world wide system of road signs - An amusing allegory with cartoons by Steinburg. Explains how the two different systems used in Europe and America make it difficult for a travelling motorist to find their way outside their own country. 2. Eritrea federated to Ethiopia - Explains how United Nations investigated political problems posed by Eritrea, a former Italian colony on the Red Sea. The population was divided in race and religion; the land poor; political opinions strongly divided; some sought independence; some wanted union with Ethiopia. After the report by a UN Commission, the General Assembly decided to federate the country to Ethiopia within two years."
