        "The construction of the oil harbour at Little Aden built to work in conjunction with the nearby refinery. A large area of land was reclaimed from the sea, and a breakwater and four large jetties were built for this project within a very short contract period. Diagram sequences help to explain the plan and progress of the operation."
