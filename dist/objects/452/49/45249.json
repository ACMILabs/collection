        "Introduced by Ruth Cracknell, this program interviews five older Australians who are prime examples of how life can be exciting and fulfilling - even if you happen to be frail. They each have their own life experiences to recount, but they are united by their ability to set achievable goals for activity levels; focus on capabilities rather than the things they can't do; and a willingness to seek help for everyday activities if they can't perform them independently. Produced by ABC Television (Queensland) in collaboration with the Office of Ageing in the Department of Families, Youth and Community Care, Queensland."
