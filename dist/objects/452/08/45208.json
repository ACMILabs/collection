        "Episode of Series \"Vassar studies: studies of normal personality development\" This film traces the development of an aggressive, \"difficult\" yet thoroughly appealing child from his early nursery days to his first year at a public school. Clumsy, blundering, confused by varied adult pressures, Robert's violent and haphazard aggression is seen as a strong, defensive counter-attack on the whole world. His mother's steadying support and his teachers' firm consistent and affectionate treatment bring him safely through the first adolescence of the pre-school years to an outwardly smooth adjustment in public school, without his earlier inflammable outbursts."
