        "An impressive demonstration of a prefabricated steel construction building technique, seen in use during the erection of a large school in Britain. The film shows how the prefabricated structures can be quickly, yet securely, assempbled on the building sit, with minimum building cost. The film emphasizes that this method is being used extensively in a varied range of public buildings including office blocks and libraries."
