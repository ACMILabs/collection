        "Episode of Series \"This Modern Age\" At the end of WWII, the British aircraft industry was faced with the problems of making a swift changeover from wartime to peacetime aircraft production. Since the end of the war, the British aviation and aircraft industry has attempted to take the lead in the production of fast planes, particularly jet planes, large freight planes, and passenger planes (eg the Brabazon, still in the process of being built when this film was made), and in the general problems of aeronautics and aviation research."
