        "A video training package (with facilitator's manual) designed to inform employees who may be exposed to critical events in the course of their work. A critical incident is a traumatic event or situation, such as an attack, accident or natural disaster that could have long-term negative effects on those involved. This training package, specifically aimed at staff, provides an understanding of critical incidents, their effects, strategies to promote personal recovery, as well as an overview of responses and interventions used by a broad range of organisations. See also 'Critical incidents and trauma: promoting recovery through effective management (for managers)' (310862)."
