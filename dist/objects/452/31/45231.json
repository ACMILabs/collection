        "During 1956, a squadron of Australian built Canberra Jet Bombers visited the United States on a good-will mission. In the United States the airmen took part in the armed forces day parade in Washington, saw a demonstration of American aircraft, including the latest highspeed planes and jet bombers; visited Randolph Field, the USAF Medical Center, and took part in an annual ceremony commemorating the first flight across the Pacific by Kingsford-Smith and Ulm."
