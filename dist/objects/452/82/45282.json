        "Episode of Series \"The Designers\". Betsey Johnson has been rocking the fashion industry for over thirty one years with her over-the-top creations, largely inspired by her love of dance and costumes. Entering the scene after winning Mademoiselle magazine's \"Guest Editor Contest\", she began designing for others, only to launch her own label in 1972. Of her designs, Johnson says, \"Like red lipstick on the mouth, my clothes wake up and brighten and bring the wearer to life...drawing attention to her beauty and specialness...\" Servicing a diverse celebrity clientele, Betsey Johnson's embellished, provocative designs continue to steal the show. Providing a contrast to this are the designs of Roy Halston Frowick, one of America's greatest designers and possibly the first major fashion celebrity. Halston began his career as a milliner, eventually expanding into clothing and licensing deals, where he dressed some of the most famous women in the world, including Jackie Kennedy, Princess Grace Kelly, and Elizabeth Taylor, plus providing theatrical costumes for Liza Minelli and the Martha Graham Dance Company. Despite his turbulent career, his designs are renouned for their consistently chic elegance and are as popular today as when he was alive."
