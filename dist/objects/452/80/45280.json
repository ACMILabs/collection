        "Episode of Series \"The Designers\". Donna Karan: U.S. designer Donna Karan discusses the trademarks of her signature brand and DKNY - luxury, comfort, sensuality, strength and femininity to create a timeless look that transcends any fashion trends - defined by the narrator as a combination of modern luxury and American sensibility. Karan's history as a designer is covered, as well as interviews with fashion magazine editors, models, fans and photographers. \"Vivienne Westwood\": Britain's most controversial designer is undoubtedly Vivienne Westwood, a designer who attracts responses such as innovative, controversial, sexy and unorthodox. Westwood - normally reticent about discussing issues such as fashion talks about her relationship with Malcolm MacLaren in the 70's, the breakup and change in focus to the deconstruction of garments, and her passion for the 17-19th centuries. Like the section on Donna Karan, the narrator attempts to capture the tenets of Westwood's design and looks at areas such as the corset, platform shoes, distorting the female form and symbols of bondage. Both feature plenty of catwalk footage of the designs in action."
