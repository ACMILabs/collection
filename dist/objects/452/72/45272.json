        "This feature film is an exotic romp through the '60s in song and dance. A fantasy that pokes fun not only at some hallowed institutions but at itself as well. The friendship between an old lady and a young man sets off a chain of events that involves a number of well-intentioned middle-aged individuals in some outrageously bizarre situations. A parodic exposition of 1960's social mores. While the film benefits from its elaborate arsenal of experimental cinematic techniques - split screen images, freeze frames, solarisation and multiple exposures, rapid edits - the narrative is disrupted by a succession of musical numbers. Unlike to so much else in the film, the music and acting styles are somewhat conventional, and detract from what might otherwise be the Canadian counterpart to Vera Chytilova's \"Daisies\"."
