        "Episode of Series \"The Designers\". A fascinating documentary focusing on two of fashions most sought-after designers. Giorgio Armani is regarded as one of fashion's master tailors, and was also one of the first designers to actively seek patronage from Hollywood, coming to prominence after Richard Gere wore an Armani blazer in the film American Gigolo. As a result, the name Armani is synonymous with wealth, elegance and prestige. Calvin Klein, on the other hand, is more famous as a brand name and an image. Klein became a household name after launching a brand of designer jeans, with a controversial advertising campaign featuring a young Brooke Shields. His simple yet appealing designs and lack of interest in adopting seasonal trends have helped him to build a successful billion dollar business."
