        "Returning from her adopted home in London, to attend the funeral of her sister, an Aboriginal woman finds herself isolated from both kin and culture. This emotionally mature and complex work moves beyond didactism and easily digestable polemics to suggest that cultural dislocation is written as much in the body, in language and the psyche as it is in economics and politics. By suggesting that the effects for the \"stolen generation\" were as destructive for inter-Aboriginal relationships as they were for black and white relations in this country, \"Grace\" is a devastating and confronting exploration of what it means to have been \"stolen\"."
