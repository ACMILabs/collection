        "Eritrea, situated on the African continent and long known as an Italian colony, has become self-governing and has federated with Ethiopia. Through the work of the United Nationa, Eritrea's future has been decided, for the first time in her history, by peaceful negotiations. Since the ending of colonial rule, Eritrea was guided by British adminstration, which organised an indigenous police force, established a new public school system and gave Eritreans a chance to administer justice in their local courts."
