        "Acclaimed \"Trainspotting\" trio (director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew Macdonald, and screenwriter John Hodge) re-unite for this wacky romantic comedy. Two angels, O'Reilly (Holly Hunter) and Jackson (Delroy Lindo) are assigned to make two people fall in love. If they fail the angels will be stuck on earth forever. The targets of this matchmaking mission are Celine (Cameron Diaz), a heartless, rich woman with a penchant for guns, and Robert (Ewan McGregor), an aspiring pulp novelist who works as a janitor in the corporation owned by Celine's father (Ian Holm). When Robert is sacked and replaced by a robot a chain of events begins which brings the two together. Robert attempts to kidnap Celine and get his job back, and Celine attempts to make Robert extort money from her father. Meanwhile angels O'Reilly and Jackson are working overtime to get Robert and Celine to fall in love, which isn't easy seeing as the two mismatched kidnappers create chaos wherever they go. A quirky adventure romance, \"A Life less ordinary\" races along with a great soundtrack and moments of pure madness and fantasy (look out for the song and dance routine between Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz)."
