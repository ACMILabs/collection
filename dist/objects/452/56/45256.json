        "An unintentionally hilarious promotional film becomes an involuntary instrument of social critism. Produced to promote the virtues of British design, the film chronicles a catalogue of constructed environmental features which all manifest a brutalising austerity. Park-O-Matics, Mini-Mokes and nuclear reactors become the indices of the sterile, proto-human coherance of consumer society. No narration; instead the film employs a great and swinging cocktail jazz score by UK session man, Johnny Scott."
