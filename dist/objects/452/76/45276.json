        "Episode of Series \"The Designers\". The Greatest Designers: Paris focusses on the work and influence of a selection of French fashion designers, including Chanel, Paul Poiret, Jacques Firth, Elsa Schiaparelli, Cristobal Balenciaga, Hubert de Givenchy, Emanuel Ungaro, Andre Courreges, Pierre Cardin, and Thierry Mugler. Karl Lagerfeld, considered one of the most prolific designers of the twentieth century, is renouned for both his highly-priced ready-to-wear fashion and his philosophical quotes on the business of fashion designing. His designs, capable of turning any woman into a star, are mostly light and fluid in their construction. He worked in couture as an assistant for several years before becoming a freelance designer, which ultimately led him to developing his own signature line, as well as designing for Fendi, Chloe, and Chanel. In the 1980's, Lagerfeld was responsible for rejuvenating the Chanel label by adapting the Chanel suit and re-working it in weird and wonderful ways."
