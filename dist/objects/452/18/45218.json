        "Claude-Armand Sheppard, a Montreal lawyer, discusses citizens' rights in dealings with the police. He uses an authentic case where trumped-up charges were twice laid against a citizen. He went to court, was acquitted and then sued for damages. Failure to do so would eventually lead to the erosion of civil rights. Animated drawings lend visual impact to the lawyer's words. This film is a must for everyone."
