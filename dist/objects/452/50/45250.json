        "This frank and insightful documentary focuses on the work of Australian photographic artist and filmmaker, Tracey Moffat. The film has Moffat discussing her work in her exhibition - Up In The Sky, on the eve of its opening at the prestigious gallery Dia Centre for the Arts, New York, (Oct. 1997) as the first Australian artist to be represented in the gallery. The exhibition housed four bodies of work; Night Cries: A rural tragedy (90), Guapa (95), Heaven (97) and Up In The Sky (97). Other works discussed are; Something More (89) and Scarred for Life (94). The artist provides an understanding to her motivations and techniques employed in the construction of her work."
