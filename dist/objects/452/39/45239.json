        "Demonstrates how girl scouting and guiding opens the door to lasting friendships between girls of different countries focusing attention on girls from Ceylon, Denmark and Peru who are attending an annual Juliette Low gathering at 'Our Cabana' in Cuernavaca Mexico. Shows the girls in their homelands: in Peru making pottery, nursing, teaching native dances; in Denmark cycling and camping; in Ceylon doing social service work in a poverty stricken village. Narrated by Alan Stern. Photographed by Wheaton Galentine."
