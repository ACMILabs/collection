        "Outlandishly loopy cartoon from this pioneering american animator. Quixote's world is transfigured by his own unchecked imagination - he navigates an enchanted vista of fairy-tale cliches. Whimsical questing for gallant ideals ends in fevered retreat to the sanctuary of Ye Olde Bughouse. Disarmingly innocent and frenetically paced, this is among Iwerk's best works."
