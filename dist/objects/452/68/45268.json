        "The people of Bristol tell of their city, long since called the Maritime Capital of the West of England; a city with whose history many pioneers, adventurers and navigators, and many great moral and spiritual leaders have been associated. With its bustling life and half a million citizens, the city's efficiency is still symbolised by the old phrase \"shipshape and Bristol fashion\"."
