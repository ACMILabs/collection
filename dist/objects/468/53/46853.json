        "Todd Phillips uncompromising documentary chronicles the extreme life, music and tragic death of cult hardcore rocker G.G. Allin. Along with his back up band the Murder junkies, Allin wrote and performed nihilistic anthems such as \"Bite it you scum\", \"I wanna kill you\" and \"Fuck authority\". Filmed during one of the bands notorious tours, Phillips unflinchingly captures Allin's violent, self destructive stage performances which involve among other things, self mutilation, public masturbation and defecation on stage. Featured also are Allin's die hard fans who at times go to disturbing lengths to please their number one rock hero, all the while egging Allin on to fulfil his death wish of suiciding on stage. Allin's anti-social behavior aside, \"Hated\" ultimately offers a radically alternative version of the sanitized fantasy of the rock n roll rebel, instead presenting a tragic loner on the outer margins of popular culture."
