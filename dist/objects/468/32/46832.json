        "A documentary on international co-operation in Antarctica among twelve nations - signatories to the Antarctica treaty, which has \"frozen\" all territorial claims in the continent leaving it a vast laboratory for peaceful exploration and research. The tour includes travelling with the US convoy through pack ice en route to McMurdo station; visiting the Russian base at Mirny and the US base at the South Pole; scientists of many lands working on upper atmosphere research and exploring caves; New Zealand explorers with dog-sledges, Americans in sno-cats, and finally historic films of early explorers Shackleton, Mawson and Byrd."
