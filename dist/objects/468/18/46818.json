        "Rainmaking up to recent times has been a mixture of speculation and superstition. From 1946, research and practical experiment have shown that man can induce rain. Shows the \"cloud machine\" in the CSIRO laboratories, and the first successful, though uneconomical method of seeding cloud with dry ice. The latest method, using silver iodide, is explained, and flights over the Snowy Mountains and Dividing Range, using this chemical, are made with good result."
