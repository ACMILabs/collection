        "Eddie Willis is an unemployed newspaperman who sells his soul when he takes on the job of press agent for corrupt boxing promoter, Nick Benko. Willis takes on the task of stirring up publicity for Benko's newest protege, the clumsy, seven-foot giant, Toro Moreno, who can't box to save himself. Toro quickly rises to the top through a series of fixed fights, and believes himself a killer not recognising the scam. Willis regains some integrity, however, when he learns that Benko has no intention of paying Toro his share of winnings. He sends Toro home with his own share, and decides to expose the scandal through a series of articles. Cast includes: Humphrey Bogart, Rod Steiger, Jan Stirling, Mike Lane and Max Baer."
