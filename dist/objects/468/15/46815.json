        "During the Spanish Civil War, Fernando (Jorge Sanz), an army deserter, wanders into the sprawling property inhabited by a painter (Fernando Fernan Gomez) and his four free-spirited daughters (Penelope Cruz, Ariadna Gil, Miriam Diaz-Aroca, Maribel Verdu). Delighted to have found a brother in pacifism, Manolo invites the young man to stay on. His sojourn will be a succession of sunny days, shared friendships, and games of seduction as Manolo's four daughters all vie for Fernando's attention. This sexy film, a celebration of all the pleasures life has to offer, is illuminated by the beauty of the four lead actresses and a sensual photography. (Awards: Winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1994) In Spanish with English subtitles."
