        "This Japanese-American co-production can be regarded as Kurosawa's last personal philosophic and cinematic testament as he explores in eight vignettes the cost of war, the perils of nuclear warfare, and above all man's need to harmonise with nature. It is Kurosawa's belief that, 'Man is genius when he dreams', and his visions are here, superbly realised in Takao Sato and Masaharu Ueda's sunny cinematography. In Japanese with English subtitles. Cast includes Martin Scorsese and Akire Terao."
