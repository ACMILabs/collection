        "Shows the introduction of higher education to West Africa, Nigeria and the Gold Coast in the early part of the 20th century with the establishment of Achimota College, Gold Cast. Emphasises the need for preserving valuable elements of the African culture. Conversely however, ends up reinforcing the dominance of the western way of life over Africans under colonial rule. Commentary by Dr Julian Huxley."
