        "Confident, prosperous Canada, expanding in all directions; then the stock market crash of 1929, its sequel the Great Depression, and a nation staggering with poverty and unemployment. But with it all, an optimistic outlook: bargains by mail order; extremes in women's fashions; political see-sawing; hockey broadcasts by a very youthful Foster Hewitt; the word \"quintuplets\" in every headline."
