        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Muhammad Ali: the whole story\". An in depth, six-part chronological document on one of the twentieth century's greatest sportspersons, Muhammad Ali. This episode starts in March, 1967, and critics are starting to call Ali one of the greatest boxers of all time. As his fame grows, so does his extraordinary glib manner culminating in his famous quote: \"I aint got no quarrel with the Viet Cong.\" Ali becomes a conscientious objector and from avoiding the draft because of his religious beliefs, he is stripped of his title and coined an outlaw in the Spring of '67. Includes interviews with friends, foes and those that worked closely with him. Muhammad Ali himself, was a consultant for this series. Written by Gary Cohen. Narrated by Don Maseng."
