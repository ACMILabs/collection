        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Muhammad Ali: the whole story\". An in depth, six-part chronological document on one of the twentieth century's greatest sportspersons, Muhammad Ali. This episode begins in 1970. Ali is the most loved and the most despised athlete in the world. He is in his prime, the fasted heavyweight boxer in the world. He is at a time when all other great and powerful boxers don't even come close. He has never lost a fight. All but two of his long list of bouts were by knockout - until he fights Joe Frazier. Includes interviews with friends, foes and those that worked closely with him. Muhammad Ali himself, was a consultant for this series. Written by Gary Cohen. Narrated by Don Maseng."
