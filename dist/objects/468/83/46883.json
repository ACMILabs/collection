        "In late 1944, at great cost while Germany was losing the war, Hitler brought the Holocaust to Hungary. In one of the last centers of Jewish culture, the Nazis deported and killed 425,000 people in just sixty days. This documentary is a moving and compelling account of five Hungarian survivors, tracing their lives from the present, back to the \"cleansing\" of Hungary and the devastation of the concentration camps. It is an outgrowth of the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. Created by Steven Spielberg in 1994 after he filmed 'Schindler's List', the organization is dedicated to recording the oral histories of as many Holocaust survivors as possible before they die. Music by Hans Zimmer."
