        "In what is considered by many fans to be her best performance, Ava Gardner stars as the half-caste heroine Victoria Jones, a woman forced to make some painful life decisions in post Colonial India. Her relationship with three men; Colonel Savage (Stewart Granger) a British military man in charge of protecting trains crossing Bhowani Junction, fellow Anglo-Indian Patrick Taylor (Bill Travers), and Sikh communist Peter Illing who befriends Victoria after she kills a potential rapist in self defence - challenging her to assess where her loyalties and ethnicity lie. Adapted from the novel by John Masters."
