        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Muhammad Ali: the whole story\". An in depth, six-part chronological document on one of the twentieth century's greatest sportspersons, Muhammad Ali. At 33 years of age, Ali is at a crossroads. From being unbeatable to losing two straight bouts - first with Joe Frazier, who took the title, and then with Ken Norton who left Muhammad Ali badly beaten and with a broken jaw. His struggle to regain the title from Joe Frazier becomes an obsession but his critics grow ever more doubtful. On top of that, Ali receives the news that a new player is in town: Joe Frazier is brutally beaten by newcomer, George Foreman, the hardest hitting boxer of all time. Promoter Don King persuades Ali to fight Forman in Zaire for 5 million dollars. Includes interviews with friends, foes and those that worked closely with him. Muhammad Ali himself, was a consultant for this series. Written by Gary Cohen. Narrated by Don Maseng."
