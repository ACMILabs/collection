        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Muhammad Ali: the whole story\". An in depth, six-part chronological document on one of the twentieth century's greatest sportspersons, Muhammad Ali. Episode Six. It is 1975, Ali is 33 years old and at the height of his international popularity. After defeating George Foreman, he focuses his sights back on Joe Frazier and helped by the flare of promoter Don King, the famous rematch takes place in Manila. Ali is no longer the fancy footworking speedster of the sixties - his style is now in defence and is virtually a completely different boxer, yet he still manages to be the one of the best in his class. Includes interviews with friends, foes and those that worked closely with him. Muhammad Ali himself, was a consultant for this series. Written by Gary Cohen. Narrated by Don Maseng."
