        "A 6 part series on the history of the Australian Racing Industry from the different points of view of the jockeys, trainers, bookies, callers, punters and politicians. Horse racing started in the 1700's to give the developing colony something social and sporting to go to, and was a popular pastime, despite the ban on swearing, fighting, gambling and drinking, and has since developed into a huge industry. Each episode covers a period of time in racing history from 1788 to current racing, and includes interviews with trainers, jockeys and callers of the past. Footage of famous horses includes Phar Lap and Bernborough. Narrated by Tiriel Mora."
