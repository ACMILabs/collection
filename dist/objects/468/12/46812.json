        "Joe Barrett (Humphery Bogart) returns to Japan after World War II in the hope of piecing his life back together. Joe was told his wife, Trina (Florence Marly), died during her internment in Japan. However, on arrival he learns that she is alive and married to lawyer Mark Landis (Alexander Knox) and that the child they are raising could be his. Joe, still in love with Trina vows to get her back. In order to stay in Japan, he applies for an airline franchise. He is introduced to Baron Kimura (Sessue Hayakawa) who agrees to assist with the application in return for a partnership in the business. Soon, Kimura is blackmailing Joe into smuggling war criminal back into Japan, otherwise he will reveal that Trina participated in anti-American broadcasts on Japanese radio during the war. Produced by Bogart's company, Santana Pictures, 'Tokyo Joe' was the first film to be granted permission by the Army authorities to be shot in US-occupied Japan. This production marks the return of actor Sessue Hayakawa to the American screen after a 20 year interruption."
