        "George O'Brien and boy, Ian Timms, set out to climb Sugarloaf Peak near Buxton, north-east Victoria. Using his knowledge of bushcraft, the boy leads the climb with the man as a back-up to correct his mistakes. The man leads on the way down - the most difficult for finding the correct way to not get lost. George O'Brien is convenor of the Search & Rescue section of the Federation of Victorian Walking Clubs."
