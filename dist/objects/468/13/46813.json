        "Harry Smith (Humphrey Bogart) is a casino operator and underground gun runner supplying Arab insurrectionists with guns against the French in 1925 Damascus. His life is about to become even more complicated when he is arrested by the French, then approached by Colonel Feroud (Lee J. Cobb) for secret miliatary information - the reward, liberation from war-torn Damascus. Feroud and Smith become rivals when Smith becomes involved with the frenchman's mistress, Violette (Marta Toren). The betrayal and violence that ensues causes Smith to question the morality of his actions and his life in Damascus."
