        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Muhammad Ali: the whole story\". An in depth, six-part chronological document on one of the twentieth century's greatest sportspersons, Muhammad Ali. In this episode Cassius Clay wins the title from Sonny Liston and becomes the youngest heavyweight champion in the world, something that surprised even his most confident supporters - an amazing and occurrent theme throughout his career. It is 1965 and U.S. conflicts within and without swell the rest of the globe. Clay becomes a surprising player in news, religion, politics and culture and in two years \"Cassius Clay\" will no longer exist. Includes interviews with friends, foes and those that worked closely with him. Muhammad Ali himself, was a consultant for this series. Written by Gary Cohen. Narrated by Don Maseng."
