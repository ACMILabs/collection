        "Five British soldiers, all accused of crimes during wartime, are introduced to a prison war camp in Northern Africa during World War II. Run by a tyrannical and old-fashioned Seargent Major (Harry Andrews), the centre of the prison is a man-made \"hill\" on which the prisoners are routinely punished and tortured. The five new men all represent a cross-section of British society; all find themselves victimised by a sadistic prison guard (played by Ian Hendry) who uses the rhetoric of Empire and Victorian authority to brutalise the men physically and spiritually. When his victimisation goes one step too far, the prisoners must choose between staying silent and winning their freedom, or choosing to support Joe Robert (Sean Connery) who wants to see justice being served. Lumet directs this film with vicious energy, and it is an unrelenting and powerful indictment of the damage that a harsh hierarchical institution can do to men. It's tough-mindedness and gruelling scenes of punishment and exploitation make it now seem a movie far ahead of its time. Cast also includes Sir Michael Redgrave. Based on a play by Ray Rigby."
