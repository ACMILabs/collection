        "This psychological wartime drama set in Burma was based on the novel by H.E. Bates. A Canadian pilot (Gregory Peck) and two comrades-in-arms crash in the Burmese wilds. The three men are forced to hack their way through the jungle to safety, surrounded on all sides by the Japanese. The pilot's subordinates don't completely trust their leader, and not without reason - his nerves have been at breaking point for months. Faced with this severe test of courage and endurance, he must muster the physical and mental resources to lead his men to safety. Cast includes Maurice Denham, Win Min Than, Lyndon Brook, Anthony Bushell and Josephone Griffin."
