Walking home one night they are mugged and as a result Sam is murdered. The film then takes a fantastic turn as Sam wanders the spirit world trying to understand why he was killed. He discovers his murder was plotted by one of his associates and through psychic Oda Mae (Whoopie Goldberg) tries to contact Molly and protect her from meeting the same fate as him."
