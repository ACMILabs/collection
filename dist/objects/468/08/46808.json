        "Set in a film studio, this slapstick comedy features Charles Chaplin as David, a stage hand, in constant trouble with Goliath, played by Eric Campbell, his boss. The film ends with a pie-slinging contest in which Chaplin never gets hit. Also features Edna Purviance, Albert Austin, Lloyd Bacon and Harry Bergman. Silent film."
