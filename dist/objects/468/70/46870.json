        "Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte), a wealthy publisher, yuppie and art collector is into competitions of a completely different nature. The challenge between he and his friends is to bring an \"idiot\" to their regular Wednesday dinner, for an evening of culinary delights and amusing conversation at the cost of these supposedly intellectually inferior diners. Pierre's friend thinks he is onto a winner with a boomerang salesman; Pierre thinks he is in with a good chance with Finance Ministry accountant, Francois Pignon (Jacques Villeret), a matchstick construction enthusiast. The viewer is never privy to seeing one of these dinner farces in action, instead Pierre finds himself spending time in his apartment with Francois, who kindly offers to help his new friend whose wife has just left him, and who is also now incapacitated by an injured back courtesy of a dodgy golf swing. In the space of a few short hours Pierre has a dinner party for two, with he being the sole witness to Francois' stupidity and bearing the brunt of his actions as meddling with \"idiots\" moves into a different realm. Cast also includes Francis Huster, Alexandra Vandernoot and Daniel Prevost. In French with English subtitles."
