        "Episode number 14 of Series \"This Modern Age\". A discussion on problems which confront Jamaica in the modern world. The economy of the island is dependent on sugar, bananas and rum - if the crops fail, heavy unemployment is the result. Population, which has doubled in 25 years, is also a problem. The film suggests irrigation, research on diseases, education and sound political leadership, afforestation and diversification of industries as solutions to the economic and social problems of the troubled island."
