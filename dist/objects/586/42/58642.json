        "One of the most popular US series, the Hardy family first appeared in \"A Family Affair\" 1937 with Lionel Barrymore and Mickey Rooney as father and son. In 1938 \"You're Only Young Once\" began the official series in the town of Carvel, with Rooney as Andy Hardy, typical American teenager, interested in girls and fast cars, Lewis Stone as James Judge Hardy, a stern but understanding father, Fay Holden as his \"swell\" mother, Cecilia Parker as Marian, his older sister striving to be a young lady, Sara Haden as Aunt Millie and Ann Rutherford as Polly, the girlfriend who was often neglected for other prospects but to whom Andy always returned. George B. Seitz directed most of the series. A testament to the series' great appeal was the special Oscar given MGM \"for its achievement in representing the American Way of Life.\" MGM used the films to springboard young starlets such as Judy Garland, Lana Turner, Esther Williams, Kathryn Grayson and Donna Reed. The Hardy films serve as a reminder of an era in Hollywood and America that is long gone."
