        "Imagine if you could witness a Cretaceous sunset, watch as insectivorous pterosaurs chase moths in the evening, and bull triceratops lock horns over a young female. This is no longer a dream. \"Walking with dinosaurs\" is a six episode series that transports the viewer back to prehistoric times when dinosaurs ruled the earth. Using CGI animation, all the major eras- Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous, are faithfully recreated with stunning authenticity as classic natural history techniques meld with state of the art computer graphics. Filmed against spectacular natural backdrops in Chile, Tasmania and New Zealand and narrated by Kenneth Branagh, this series sets new standards for TV production and striked a perfect balance betweeen information and entertainment. In addition to the six, 30 minute episodes is a behind the scenes look at the technological and labour intesive work that went into place to make the series possible. Individual episodes include; \"New blood\", \"A Time of titans\", \"Cruel sea\", \"Giant of the skies\", \"Spirits of the ice forest\" and \"Death of a dynasty\". Also available on DVD [318965]."
