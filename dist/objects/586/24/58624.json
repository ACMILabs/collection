        "Glenda Jackson received world-wide acclaim for her brilliant portrayal of Queen Elizabeth the Ist. The series begins just prior to Elizabeth's ascension to the throne and continues to her death in 1603. The episodes deal with historical events such as the Armada, Mary Queen of Scots, the beheading of Essex, the plight over the Succession and her decision to remain unmarried. The series is well scripted, costumed and has an excellent cast."
