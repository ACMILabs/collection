        "Set among the red dirt, campfires, rock music and dreaming stories of an Aboriginal community in Central Australia, these programs were produced to help local children learn literacy and maths in their own language, Warlpiri. Scenes around the community, animation, puppet and magic characters are used to introduce letters, syllables, numbers and other maths concepts, and to illustrate story books. Traditional skills and activities are featured in segments on hunting and gathering bush foods, fire-making, traditional ceremonies and painting, and dreamtime stories about the landscape. An Aboriginal \"Sesame Street\", this series of programs is suitable for use as a teaching/study resource for Primary, Secondary and Tertiary level students. In Warlpiri language with English subtitles."
