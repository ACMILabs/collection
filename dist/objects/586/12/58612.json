        "A series of four dramas for 7-12 year olds intended to promote discussion on the issues of racism, respect and equality for children. Each episode revolves around a conflict where a child is taunted and discriminated against because they are a member of a minority group. The situations are credible and expose the impact of such behaviour on children."
