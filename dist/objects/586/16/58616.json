        "A three part series examining the history of Stalinism in the former Soviet UnioN focusing on oral histories of people who lived through the turbulent and totalitarian Communist regime of the late 1930s. As they relive memories of collectivisation, the purges and the Gulags, the series becomes an almost unbearable testament to the brutality of power. However, by talking to peasants, intellectuals, former KGB and dissenters, the series avoids histrionics and controversy and allows the dignity of people's voices to tell their own stories."
