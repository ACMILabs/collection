        "Absolutely fabulous is one of the most successful British comedy shows; an hilarious situation comedy that plays with elements of the absurd and high camp. Edwina (Jennifer Saunders) is a baby-boomer mother, fashion victim extraordinaire. Her best friend is the cocaine-snorting nymphomaniac Patsy (Joanna Lumley). Part of the show's success comes from its reversal of roles. It is the practical long-suffering Saffie, Edwina's daughter, who sweeps up after her mother, and the in-your-face portrayal of drug-taking, sex-loving, materialistic women who are spoilt, selfish, vacuous but undeniably good fun. Always colourful, often brilliant, \"Absolutely fabulous\" confirmed Saunders and co-writer Dawn French as two of the best comedians of their generation."
