        "A summer's day in Ten Town. Young Gary (Gary Grey) is feeling dejected and neglected by his friends and decides to go for a walk. He comes across a billabong in the bush and meets a swagman (Ken Goodlet). Suddenly he is transported back in time to the 1860's. With his record player in hand and with the help of the song Waltzing Matilda, the swagman's life is changed."
