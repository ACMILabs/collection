        "Made for exhibition in Germany to displaced persons to show the experiences of Europeans migrating to Australia. The film, with commentary in German, explains the system of providing community centres, education, work and recreational amenities at migrant camps to enable newcomers to become accustomed to the strangeness of the new country. The film was photographed at the Bonegilla Migrant Camp, Victoria."
