        "Episode of Series \"For the juniors\". Narrated by Eileen Darley, this program aimed at younger children looks at the celebrations surrounding New Year. It explores why people gather on December 31st and outlines characteristics of the event such as the countdown, singing Auld Lang Syne, and making resolutions. As a point of comparison the program then looks at how people in the Jewish tradition celebrate new year, and the celebrations surrounding Chinese New Year, revealing that food plays a major role in both. Suitable for children 4-8."
