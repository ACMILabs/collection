        "Aired approximately 100 years after Jack the Ripper terrified London by killing 5 women, this British production made for television states it has discovered the real identity of the Ripper through extensive research by the director - namely based on top secret files from the Home Office, and interviews with leading criminologist and Scotland Yard officials. Heading the investigation is recovering alcoholic Inspector Frank Abberline (Michael Caine in a Golden Globe award winning performance), ably assisted by Sergeant Godley (Lewis Collins), and with a psychological profile provided by Sir William Gull, an authority on madness, and one of the Queen's advisors. Heading the list of suspects is American stage actor Richard Mansfield (Armand Assante), the forensic medical examiner Doctor Llewellyn (Michael Hughes), Mr Lees (Ken Bones) - the Queen's psychic adviser, Sir William's son-in-law, Doctor Acland (Richard Morant), and social agitator George Lusk (Michael Gothard). Beginning with the first murder of Mary Anne Nicholls in Whitechapel, Abberline breaks through the resistance of the powers that be to try and unmask the Ripper and administer justice. Cast also includes Ray McAnally and Jane Seymour."
