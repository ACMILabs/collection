        "This video contains four episodes from series two of the outstanding ABC series \"The Games\", a satirical (but often painfully close to the truth) mock documentary of SOCOG and their preparations for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The episodes included cover the following issues: an in-depth look at the lives of some of the main players behind the scenes of the Committee; what happens when everything is running according to schedule; the life story of one (or perhaps two) of the many thousands of international guests who will come to see the Games; the use of inquiries to ensure that the accidental misuse of process by Committee members is quickly exposed and rectified."
