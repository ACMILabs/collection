        "In this culture-clash drama, the first American production to be shot in mainland China, Fang, a San Francisco computer engineer decides to return with his family to his home country of China in search of his \"roots\". From the moment they arrive, they're engulfed by basic differences in values, priorities and manners. For the first time in his life, Wang discovers what it is to be Chinese and not merely a hyphenated American, but his wife and children are not so easily assimilated into their new surroundings. Problems arise when the family moves in with their relatives, who are curious (and a little apprehensive) about Western culture. After many conflicts a common ground of mutual understanding and respect is reached."
