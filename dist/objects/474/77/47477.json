        "This film takes a quietly affectionate look at an expatriate community living in San Francisco's Chinatown. Widowed Mrs Tam (Kim Chew) has been advised by a fortune teller that she will die before she is 62, and wishes to put her affairs in order before this time. This includes making one last visit back to China, as well as wishing her daughter Geraldine (Laureen Chew) to be settled and married. Jovial bartender Uncle Tam professes his affection for Mrs Tam, although he is secure in the knowledge that she will not marry him while she has the company of her daughter living at home. Meanwhile, Geraldine wrestles with her obligation to stay and care for her mother. In English and some Cantonese dialogue with English subtitles."
