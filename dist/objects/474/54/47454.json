        "British transport shows its resourcefulness when a 123-ton transformer has to be carried to a remote site in Wales. Specially devised and strictly scheduled plans are put into operation by road and rail services, and safe delivery from factory to power station is accomplished. Remote rural sections of the route pose special problems but also provide views of Wales' lovely countryside. Music by Edward Williams. Commentator Richard Baker."
