        "The imaginative use of camera gives remarkable fluidity to an international collection of photographs exhibited at the Baltimore Museum of Art in January 1968. The photographs emphasise the importance of sport as a common denominator among peoples and as a factor in human development to a fuller, more creative and enjoyable way of life."
