        "Hou's achievement in this film is to find a rare balance between the personal and the political in recovering for the Taiwanese what has been a repressed history: the years of 1945-49, from the end of Japan's colonial rule to the proclamation of Taipei as the 'temporary' capital of China by Chiang Kai-Shek's defeated Kuomintang government. The members of the Lin family represent different aspects of the Taiwanese predicament. Hou maintains a distance from the family melodrama through his long take/fixed angle aesthetic in constructing a panorama of characters and incidents in which no one has privileged status (Reference: Review by Tony Rayns in Monthly Film Bulletin, June 1990). Cast includes Li Tian Lu (Li Tien-Lu), Chen Song Yong (Chen Sung-Yung) and Gao Jie (Kao Chieh). In Mandarin, Hokkein, Shanghaiese, Cantonese and Japanese with English subtitles."
