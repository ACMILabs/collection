        "Based on an incident which occurred during oil exploration in Papua New Guinea. Two Australian geologists were working in an unknown area. After an argument with an old native woman, Boro, one of the natives on the survey fell sick with pneumonia. He believed she had put a curse on him. He had to be taken out of the jungle, by foot, canoe and eventually aircraft, and taken to hospital 300 miles away in Port Moresby."
