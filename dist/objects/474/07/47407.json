        "Episode of Series \"International Zone\". Shows how a combination of industrialisation and agriculture have taken up the economic lag for the thousands of people living in the Paz del Rio in Columbia, and has brought them into the 20th century without taking them away from their traditional ties with the land. The farmers of the valley make up the bulk of the work force at an iron mine and steel mill. When not engaged at the mill they are tilling the soil. With Alistair Cooke."
