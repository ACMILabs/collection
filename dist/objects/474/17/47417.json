        "A British Ministry of Information propaganda short comprised of silent documentary footage of Russian civilians gearing up to fight Nazi invaders, accompanied by patriotic British narration and rousing orchestral score. The chilling centrepiece is a series of still photographs taken by a German soldier of the execution of five Russian villagers from the town of Velish."
