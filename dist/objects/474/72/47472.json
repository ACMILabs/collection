        "Story of the meeting of an Australian man and a migrant girl called Marie from post war Europe. A commentary is given from the man's point of view on their conversations with her recollections of life in Europe, her regret at her mother not seeing her life in Australia, and her lack of taking her life for granted. Takes place on Sydney harbour in a sailboat race setting. Uses the race and her growing love for the harbour as a metaphor for Australia's pro-migration program."
