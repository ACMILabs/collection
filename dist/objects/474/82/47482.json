        "Featuring interviews with Jonathan Miller, Glenda Jackson, Baz Luhrmann, Germaine Greer, Kenneth Branagh, Julie Taymor, Jonathan Bate, Mark Rylance, Harold Bloom and Anthony Holden, Shakespeare afficionados attempt to explain the universal appeal of the playwright and poet, William Shakespeare. The common motif that appears in the interviews is his ability to capture the human condition and the subsequent resonance with society, both at the time of writing, and today. Interspersing classical and more recent interpretations of Shakespeare, as well as oration from plays and sonnets, the documentary confirms the idea that Shakespeare is still relevant today. The video also focuses on the myth of Shakespeare, explaining how he has been deified and turned into a tourist industry. It also discusses the role that cinema has in bringing Shakespeare to the masses and keeping the spirit of his writing, and the personality of the author, alive. Narrated by Melvyn Bragg."
