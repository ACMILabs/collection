        "The local fire chief allows the \"Our Gang\" kids to play in the fire department yeard. Whilst the firemen are on an emergency call, a small fire breaks out in the kitchen of a house nearby. \"Our Gang\" come to the rescue and the kids manage to extinguish the fire in the midst of some comic hijinks. The grateful chief gives all the kids a fire chief badge making them regular members of the fire department."
