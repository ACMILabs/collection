        "Episode of Series \"For the juniors\". Narrated by Eileen Darley, this program aimed at young children looks at the celebrations surrounding Christmas. It follows the signs and symbols that signify Christmas is near, such as shopping, store and street decorations, advent calendars, parades, sending cards, making your own gifts, decorating trees, the importance of being with people you love, and being charitable to those in need. The program also looks at the origins of Christmas trees and cards, and the story of the first Christmas. Delicious traditional Christmas fare from Italy and Germany are also shown. Suitable for children 4-8."
