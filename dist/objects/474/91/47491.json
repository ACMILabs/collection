        "A documentary chronicling a visit to Tasmania by Sir Edmund Hillary. He arrives, meets some dignitaries, surveys some national park areas to the south of Hobart, then joins a bushwalking club to scale Mount Mawson. The film focusses on what a thrill it is for these youngsters to climb alonside the man who scaled Everest. Hillary, the narrator tells us, says Tasmania has some of the greatest tramping country in the world."
