        "There is sometimes danger and excitement, but always a patient follow-up of clues when the R.C.M.P. hunt a killer. This film re-enacts a case from the files of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to show what is involved in modern crime detection. Some clues turn up in the laboratory; the trail of evidence leads from a lonely Alberta road to a British Columbia lumber camp and a final shootout with the murderer."
