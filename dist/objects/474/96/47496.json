        "In 1961, shortly after the construction of the wall, Sophie (Corinna Harfouch/Meret Becker), Konrad (August Zirner/Anian Zollner) and several friends attempt to escape to West Berlin through an underground sewer system. Due to a moment of hesitation, Konrad is left behind in East Berlin. Over the next thirty years they will make attempts at being reunited, but will only succeed in four brief encounters; one of them resulting in the birth of their son. The strength of their feelings is unable to overcome the years of separation, the bureaucratic obstacles and the simple fact that they are living in diametrically opposed worlds. When the wall finally comes down in November 1989, the two countries are reunited geographically, but the two lovers are left pondering their chances of emotional reunification. Also with Eva Mattes and Otto Sander. In German with English subtitles. Reference: The Promise - Interview with Margarethe von Trotta by Pauline Adamek (3/121995). Goethe Institut (Montreal).
