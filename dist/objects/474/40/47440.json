        "This documentary takes up the game of hopscotch - played by girls universally - as a means of discussing the many injustices and hardships that also link the lives of girl children across cultures. Many girls are compelled to take on the responsibilities and concerns of adults caring for younger siblings or working full time to support themselves and their families. This film provides an eclectic portrait of girls' lives from a diverse range of cultural perspectives. From female circumcision to child prostitution and the emotional desolation of a life lived as a virtual domestic slave, many of these girls' life lessons have been harsh ones. Their touch points with childhood are the games they play with friends, in the street, in the school yard, and the back yard. Girls in six countries--India, Thailand, Yemen, Peru, Burkina Faso and Haiti--speak of the ways their childhoods have been disrupted sometime purely because they were born female. A deeply moving documentary that contributes to the struggle to eliminate discrimination against young girls."
