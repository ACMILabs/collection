        "An intensive study of the Jewish comnmunity of the East End of London, in particular with Hessel Street, a centre of Jewry for the past 100 years which is now being pulled down and rebuilt as a slum clearance operation (1961-62). Poses the question: Will the close-knit nature of the community be able to survive under modern housing conditions in large blocks of impersonal flats."
