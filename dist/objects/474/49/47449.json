        "Episode of Series \"March of Time\". Produced during World War II, this film illustrates the special organisation and arrangments made to provide adequate musical entertainment for troops, both at home and abroad. One particular section deals with the successful fight by the American Federation of Musicians led by James C. Petrillo, to have (in part) royalties paid to a union unemployment fund. Includes such performers as Marian Anderson, George Gershwin, Benny Goodman, Mischa Elman, Serge Koussevitsky, Glenn Miller, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington and Perry Como."
