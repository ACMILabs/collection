        "Film trailer on bushfire prevention. Summer always brings the curse of fire. Photographed at a fire-control field day held at Wyong, N.S.W., this short film illustrates how firemen prepare for the threat of fire. They overhaul their organisation, communications equipment and gear; safeguard buildings before the fire season commences; practise in using fire-fighting equipment; construct fire-breaks and practice mopping up after a fire."
