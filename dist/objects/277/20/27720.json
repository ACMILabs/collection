        "From a sun-drenched bathing beach to an awesome \"gamma garden,\" this film explores how heat, radio waves, x-rays and gamma rays affect various forms of life. It takes you to the radiological department of a modern hospital, to Canada's atomic research center at Chalk River, and to the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States, where plant growth is subjected to gamma radiation."
