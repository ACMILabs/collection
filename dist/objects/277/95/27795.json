        "A non-narrated film which first emphasises the potentially great waste in the single product, automobile bumpers, by exploring the piles of twisted discards. It then follows the process of transforming the damaged bumpers into good-as-new ones. Shows the recycling process from the heavy machines used to straighten the major dents and twists through hand-hammering, grinding, polishing and electro-plating. Finally, the transformed bumpers, indistinguishable from newly made ones, are plastic wrapped and stored awaiting use on new cars."
