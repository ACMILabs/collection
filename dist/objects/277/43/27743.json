        "An early experimental film using flat colour silhouettes of dancing figures, based on live photography. Made as a Post Office Savings Bank publicity film, Rainbow Dance's original technique of colour reproduction, together with the later films \"Kaleidoscope\" and \"Tusalava\" foreshadowed some of Norman McLaren's work."
