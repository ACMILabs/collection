        "A young hitchhiker is picked up on her way to work. We then see a devastatingly powerful recreation of how a rapist \"negotiates\" for psychological control, as well as the violent act of rape itself. Subsequent scenes involve two officers of varying sensitivity, as they respond to the emotional needs of the victim before proceeding with the preliminary interview. Includes very realistic rape scenes."
