        "A dramatised story of a typical cancer case. This film is a plea for an early visit to the doctor by anyone having the slightest suspicion of the disease. Shows that with early treatment by improved methods, cancer may often be cured while delay can prove to be fatal. Note: This film had been viewed by medical experts and it is considered that the treatment portrayed in the film is not in accord with actual treatment as available in Victoria."
