        "A humorous trip across Canada from the Atlantic to the Pacific with Buster Keaton riding on a rail \"trike\" which contains everything he needs in the way of food, clothing, tools, bedding, shaving gear, and even a rifle. This is Buster Keaton's last film, made by the National Film Board before he died. It is a travelogue with a difference."
