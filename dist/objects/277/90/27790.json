        "In this film, opthalmologist John T. Flynn MD, describes and demonstrates the clinical procedure necessary to diagnose strabismus, by applying his \"cover test\" to infant, adolescent and adult sufferers. Strabismus, or unco-ordinated binocular vision, is a chronic medical condition which can lead to ambliopia (blindness without pathogenic or biological cause); strabismus may also mask a retinal blastoma or other serious ailment. Early diagnosis - especially for childhood sufferers - is crucial if the condition is to be corrected and/or prevented from becoming worse."
