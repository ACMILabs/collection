        "This film presents a version of Edgar A. Poe's \"The Raven\" complemented by the engravings of Gustave Dore. The intense and emotional black and white engravings that Dore executed to illustrate this poem are washed over with red, blue and green. The colours fade and dissolve with the art work to increase the mystery and fantasy which Poe created with his words."
