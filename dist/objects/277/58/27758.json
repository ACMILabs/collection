        "A study of the wily brown rat, humankind's unwanted companion throughout the world, whose bite on the world's food resources adds to the growing threat of shortage. In a normal, free-ranging environment, the rat is more than a match for its hosts and colonies flourish. Under abnormal conditions of restricted space and limited food, a rat colony loses all \"social\" constraints on behavior. The film has implicit analogies for all animal behavior, including humanity's. Plagues, predators and extermination attempts are among the topics discussed."
