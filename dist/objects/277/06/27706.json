        "An account of the guerilla fighting in South Vietnam and its effect on the lives of the people. The division of Vietnam, the North to the Communists, the South to the Vietnamese, is seen through the eyes of a farming family. They are accustomed to the \"quiet war\" waged by the Viet Cong guerillas and the South Vietnam Government headed by President Ngo Dinh Diem. In a country of steaming jungles infested with guerillas, constant vigilance is necessary, only armed patrols venturing out at night. The safest place is by the river which forms the border, in the international control area. The Seven Year Old Republic is butressed by the free world to stem the flow of Communist domination in South-east Asia. (please note synopsis written 1964)"
