        "Discusses the British standard of living and relates it to productivity and ways in which both may be improved. Reorganising of work is essential, and problems involved are shown. The most important of these is the attitude and, not infrequently, the opposition of workers. There is a greater need for tactful handling of problems on the part of management. Labor must realise that more work, which leads to increased productivity, means higher standard of living and not simply higher profits and dividends. The film concludes with a discussion on these points."
