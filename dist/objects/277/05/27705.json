        "An amusing tale of a man who feels the common urge to escape the city's noise for a weekend of quiet in the hills beyond. Made without words, but with a variety of other sounds, urban and rural, this film tracks our hero to his haven of non-peace. He finds the countryside not as unspoiled and uncrowded as the poets proclaim, nor is the 'bosom of nature' entirely without rocks."
