        "In this film, Dr M.S. Roberts of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, explains the use of the radio line of atomic hydrogen in determining the total hydrogen content of galaxies external to the Milky Way. He then establishes the strong correlation between hydrogen content and galactic shape and raises the question as to whether this correlation can be used as an indicator of galactic evolution."
