        "This extract is from an early part of the biographical film on Douglas Bader. Bader's crash (a result of showing off after being needled by civilians) resulted in the amputation of both his legs in December 1931. He has had a \"peg leg\" and crutches, but now he has met Thelma, who is working as a waitress and is determined to dance with her. The extract is concerned with the situations arising from Bader's loss of legs and with his growing friendship with Thelma, who later becomes his wife. Cast includes Kenneth More, Muriel Pavlow, Sidney Tafler and Jack Walting."
