        "Studies the actions of students at three age levels- 5, 11 and 15 years and shows that in order to learn to read they must first want to read. It proposes that activities related to the teaching of reading should arise from the students own experience and interests, and that students should participate in the decision making concerning these activities. Features Croydon High, Enfield Junior and Gilles Street Primary schools."
