        "Cinemagazine newsreel includes the following: 1. In response to a SEATO request for assistance in Thailand, the 79th Squadron RAAF was based in South-eastern Thailand. Hercules transports flew in all ground personnel and equipment so that the base could be in working order immediately for the Sabre Jets which are equipped with air missiles. 2. Freedom of the city of Wagga was given to members of the RAAF in impressive ceremonies at the air base and in the city of Wagga."
