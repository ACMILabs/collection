        "The life story of the wedge-tailed eagle. Raak was born on the edge of the desert and spent his early years learning to hunt and kill. In his seventh year he went south to find a mate, built a nest in the mountains, where they raised two broods of eaglets. The eaglets are shown growing up, learning to fly and eventually leaving the nest. Photographed and recorded by Peter Bruce and David Corke. Narrated by Ian Neil."
