        "The last steam train crossing the Pennines and an Edwardian concert hall song \"Watching the trains go out\", bring back many memories to Sir John Betjeman. In his own nostalgic verse and prose, he remembers the great trains of old and looks forward to railways for ever as he moves through a photographic exhibition."
