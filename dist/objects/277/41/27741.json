        "Of all the butterflies in the British Isles, the \"Purple Emperor\" is in a class of its own. Apart from the fact that it is so magnificent, most people have never been priviledged to see it in the wild, and collectors regard it as the greatest prize of all. The entire development of this butterfly - the forests it lives in, and its unusual habits were captured on film by a small team who virtually lived with these insects for a year."
