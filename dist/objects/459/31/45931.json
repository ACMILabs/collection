        "At the centre is the noir theme of a man's destructive obsession with a femme fatale. The possibility of redemption is offered by the presence in a pastoral retreat of the safe, undemanding woman. The film's special hallucinatory quality has its bases in Mitchum's restrained playing and narration as the fated hero. Tourneur brings a downbeat, tragic other-worldliness to the complex flashback structure in which the past gradually overtakes the present. Photographer Nicholas Musuraca makes disconcerting use of deep shadow. Cast includes Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, Kirk Douglas, Rhonda Fleming and Richard Webb. Based on the novel \"Build my gallows high\" by Geoffrey Homes."
