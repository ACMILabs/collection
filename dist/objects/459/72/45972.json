        "Episode of Series \"This Modern Age\" Discusses the importance of oil in the world of today. Traces the growth of the oil industry from the beginning of the century, during the first and second world wars and in the post-war era. The Middle East as a source of oil is considered and the need for political stability in these areas emphasised. This stability can only be guaranteed if the rulers of these countries use profits from oil to improve the conditions of the people."
