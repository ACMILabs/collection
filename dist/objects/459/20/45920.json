        "Pandora's Box is an exclusive high class S & M parlour in Manhattan. Mistress Raven - previously a Long Island housewife, became New York's most famous mistress and later retired to become the founder of Pandora's Box. The documentary covers the functions of her parlour and various aspects of S & M; corporal punishment, whipping/slapping, wrestling fetish, rubber fetish, infantilism, slaves, humiliation, mistresses etc. The documentary provides insights into the personal aspirations of Raven's crew of dominatrix (Mistress Natasha, Catherine, and Delilah) with vivid footage of the parlour in operation."
