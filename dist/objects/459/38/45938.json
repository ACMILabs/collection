        "22 year old filmmaker Salvatore Stabile's debut feature owes a lot to Martin Scorsese's gritty urban drama 'Mean Streets'. Like that film, 'Gravesend' evokes a particular Brooklyn neighbourhood, painting a bleak picture of disenfranchised youth, aggressive masculinity and seething violence amongst the Italian American community. The film's straight forward plot revolves around four friends whose usually uneventful Saturday night spins out of control when a member of the group accidentally shoots and kills someone. Their attempts to dispose of the body leads them into a bloody chain of events with inevitable tragic consequences. Cast includes Tony Tucci, Michael Parducci, Thomas Brandise and Tom Malloy."
