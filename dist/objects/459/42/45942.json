        "Based on beat poet and counter culture celebrity Charles Bukowski's booze soaked autobiographical writings \"Erections, ejaculations, exhibitions and general tales of ordinary madness\". Directed with raw candor by Marco Ferreri ('La Grande bouffe', 'The Last woman'), 'Tales of ordinary madness' stars Ben Gazarra as Bukowski's alter ego - Charles Serking, a down and out poet living in Los Angeles, his writing fueled by booze, casual sex and the freedom his life style offers. When he meets Cass (Ornella Muti), a masochistic prostitute into self mutilation, Serking instantly falls for her, embarking on a passionate and self destructive affair. Cast also includes Susan Tyrell, Tania Lopert, Roy Brocksmith, Katia Berger."
