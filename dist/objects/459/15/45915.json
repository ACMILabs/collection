        "Australia's Great Barrier Reef is a visually vibrant documentary about the strange summer mating rituals that have resulted in the formation of one of the most stunning natural wonders of the world. A spectacular and sometimes surreal celebration of coral and reef society in general, focusing on the tactics used to perpetuate the species. Originally screened as \"Sex of the Reef\". Winner of Golden Tripod Award for Wildlife and Nature at 25th Australian International Cinematographers Society Awards, and Gold Award Nature and Wildlife at the US International Film and Video Festival 1993."
