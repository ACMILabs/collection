This film explores the world of fish by demonstrating to students how to set up an aquarium and how to care for goldfish, as well as a practical discussion of the anatomy, perception and breeding behaviour of fish. Students will discover that fish not only make colourful pets but that they also can be used to explore animal behaviour and to teach responsibility. Suitable for Middle-Upper Primary level students.
