        "This video explores the Milky Way from the center to its outer limits using computer enhanced footage from NASA and specially commissioned animation based on information obtained during Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune in 1989. Beginning with the Sun, each of the main features of the planets is described, including the earth and our moon. A description of the ways in which the solar system is investigated, including telescopes and manned and unmanned space travel is also included. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teachers guide included."
