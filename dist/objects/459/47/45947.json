        "Episode number 8 of Series \"From the earth to the moon\". On April 13, 1970, Apollo 13, the 23rd manned flight into space, developed problems that threatened the lives of the astronauts on board. The complacency which had accompanied the launch and the disinterest of the general public throughout the mission until problems occurred were quickly dispelled, as every move was monitored by journalists who fed the story to a hungry audience fast becoming hooked on sensationalism. A divide was growing wider between the traditions of the intellectual press and the fast-feed emotional content of the new tabloid journalism."
