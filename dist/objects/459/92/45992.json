        "This program is presented in an acted format: four young nature enthusiasts met at a favourite tree in the park each Saturday morning. They discover that the tree has been cut down and removed from the park, and missing along with it is a songbird that lived in the tree. They begin to wonder where the bird will live and how important is a tree, which leads them on a journey to search for the missing bird. Their imaginations take them to a rainforest, an old-growth forest, an underwater forest and a pond. They come to appreciate how important trees and forests are to all life on Earth. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teachers guide included."
