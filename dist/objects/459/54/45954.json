        "In March, 1974, the Cree Indian people of the Mistassini area in northern Quebec met to discuss their long-term future. After three hundred years of minimal contact with the white man, they had been offered \"compensation\" by the government of Quebec for the effects of the James Bay power project. But they decided that nothing, neither jobs nor money, meant more to them than their land. The film presents the issues under these headings: The Conflict, The Hunting Culture, The Schools, The Village, The Fight for the Land. Narrated by Walter Massey."
