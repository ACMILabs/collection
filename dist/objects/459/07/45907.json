        "Episode number 2 of Series \"From the earth to the moon\". January 27, 1967. In preparation for the flight of Apollo 1, astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffe undergo a routine test in their space capsule. The test turns into a disaster when a small electrical fire becomes a raging inferno - the lives of three men lost before they even leave the ground. The nation mourns, but the ever-watchful Senate Committee - anxious over the extreme haste and massive expenditure involved in the project thus far - may pull the plug on the entire Apollo project."
