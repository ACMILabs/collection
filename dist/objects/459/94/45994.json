        "Episode of Series \"Families of the world\". Spend a week with twelve-year-old Oswaldo Gaitan who lives in Masaya, Nicaragua, sharing his life and meeting his family and friends. His neighbourhood is typical of many in Central America, it is part of the city but looks like it is in the country. The city Oswaldo and his family live in is the handicraft center of Nicaragua, his father is a shoemaker and his mother a seamstress. Even though both parents work, the family, like most Central Americans, struggle to make ends meet. We can see how the members of his family live and interact, at work and at leisure, as well as hear their language and music. We also see a favorite celebration, a masked festival with traditional dances, costumes and music."
