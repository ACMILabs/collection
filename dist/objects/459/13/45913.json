        "Many scientists believed that the Earth's geology developed in isolation, unaffected by its neighbours in the solar system. Join Dr. Brady Barr as he explains the difference between comets and asteroids, and how these objects may offer clues as to the origins of our solar system. The theories and research of geologist Gene Shoemaker, co-discoverer of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet in 1993, are also explored in detail, particularly his efforts to prove that craters such as Arizona's Barringer Crater and Germany's Ries Basin were the impact sites of objects from space. Includes five assessment questions on the content of the video, plus a brief teacher's guide."
