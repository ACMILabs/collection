        "Big Margie's fair Play game show introduces young viewers to several positive behaviours important in play situations - sharing, helping, co-operating and taking turns. Students will learn to determine what is fair or unfair in a play situation, better perceive and evaluate their own behaviour, and explain how playing together and playing by the rules can be fun and rewarding. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
