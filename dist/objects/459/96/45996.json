This video explains and explores recycling, another way to handle the garbage problem. Follow rubbish from household recycling bins through collection to a separation plant, where the different types of materials get sorted. Students will see examples of how a bag of rubbish can be made useful again. Also investigates the usefulness of composting to help with recycling. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students.
