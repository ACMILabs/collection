        "Invention is as old as the human race and just as there are many different types of inventions, there are also many different types of inventors. This video introduces a variety of inventors - including professionals, amateurs, artists, scientists, adults and teenagers. Also illustrated is the point that inventions don't always have to be useful and can often lead to unpredictable results - but that the same care and attention to detail applies to all inventions, practical or otherwise. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
