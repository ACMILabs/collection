        "This documentary takes a look at some of the threats to North America's water supply and at the actions people are taking to protect the quality and quantity of their freshwater resources. The video begins in the Great Lakes region, where students from Michigan and Ontario test for pollution in rivers that drain into Lake Erie. On the Great Plains, members of the Future Farmers of America are using more efficient irrigation techniques to conserve water stored in the Ogallala aquifer, and they're sealing abandoned wells that can serve as a direct route for pollution to enter the aquifer. In the Southwest, water from the Colorado River supports agriculture, provides drinking water for city dwellers, and generates electricity - but dams and canals have altered the dynamics of the river. Scientists and students team up to study how the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona has affected the balance of life in the Grand Canyon. The video wraps up in south Florida, where the increasing demand for water from agriculture and growing urban areas threatens life in the Everglades. In response to public service announcements and other educational efforts, Floridians are learning how they can help conserve their fresh water - tips that apply to people all around North America. Includes a brief teacher's guide."
