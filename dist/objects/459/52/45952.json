        "This film delves into the multi-faceted and mysterious figure of Hannibal, who time after time escaped from the Roman military machine and was therefore idealised and demonized by his enemies like no other man. Aerial photography, computer animation, interviews with military experts and historians, and an expedition using elephants reveal how Hannibal was able to overcome Rome's natural defensive barrier - the snowy, ice-covered Alps."
