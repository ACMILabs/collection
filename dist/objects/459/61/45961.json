        "Third instalment of the 'Etoiles' language series, 'Le Cafe des Reves' is a five-part drama, similar in style to 'Home and Away' or 'Neighbours'. Adapted from the book by Nigel Hinton, 'Le Cafe des Reves' follows a group a teenagers trying to revive a small cafe in the Northern town of Lille. The cafe is owned by Madame Lambin who is also the guardian of Serge, her 15 year old grand son, whose father is working abroad. The clients are a mix of old neighborhood residents and Serge's friends. When Madame Lambin falls prey to a bag snatcher and is taken to hospital, Serge and his friends attempt to take over the reins of the business and renovate it in order to attract the clientele of the local high school. The programme is as much a language course as an insight into French life, none the less important being its multi-racial make-up. 'Le Cafe des Reves' introduces the viewers to issues of family relationships, peer group behaviour and respect of authority. The programme is recommended for students aged 13 to 15. Includes a study guide with full transcripts and class activities."
