        "Join young Tommy and his friend \"Feelings\" for a challenging day of dealing with emotions - the day of the Little League championships, which is also the day before Tommy's eighth birthday. Feelings helps Tommy recognise what he may be feeling, as well as some of the physical signs of emotions, and Tommy learns that while recognising and expressing your feelings may be difficult, the rewards are many, including an increased sense of control and self esteem. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
