        "Episode of Series \"Totally Gross Anatomy\". Using 3D animation and x-ray footage, this video reveals the network of 206 bones and more than 600 muscles that combine to make up the human musculo-skeletal system. Students will investigate the composition of bones (the spongy inner layer, the compact outer layer and the types of marrow inside bones), and the importance of joints, tendons and muscles in ensuring that the skeleton not only gives the body a flexible framework, but also protects important internal organs. The video concludes with a series of assessment questions and answers designed to ensure that students understand basic concepts related to bones and muscles. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
