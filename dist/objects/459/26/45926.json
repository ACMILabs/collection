        "This video is presented in a dramatised format, where the young investigators in a children's detective agency discover how some of the familiar items that we use or eat or wear in our daily lives are made: paper, pizza and denim jeans. After learning about the raw materials required, how they are processed, and how they are used, students will be better able to inquire about the origins of other everyday objects around their homes and schools. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
