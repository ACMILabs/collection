        "Episode number 5 of Series \"From the earth to the moon\". Before America could land on the moon, it had to devise the lunar module named \"LEM\" or \"Spider\". From an idea on a sketch pad to design and construction; through nine years of rigorous tests, successes and failures. 1969 will witness the first ever docking of two manned vessels in space on Apollo 9, and the first flight of a lunar module in the moon's orbit on Apollo 10. With all systems go, that same year would see the lift-off of Apollo 11."
