        "Episode number 4 of Series \"From the earth to the moon\". In a year marked by anti-Vietnam war prtesets, when Russia seemed ready to send a man to the moon, Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders prepare for the launch of Apollo 8, the first ever manned voyage to the moon. Their aim is to reach the moon and remain in lunar orbit, the greatest risk is that they have a single engine that must break their orbit if it is to bring them home safely."
