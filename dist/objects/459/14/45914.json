        "A detailed documentary on the force and ferocity behind some of the earth's 1,500 potentially dangerous volcanoes, and the threat they pose to those who live within their reach. Elaborates on some of the more famous volcanoes and eruptions, including Galeras (Colombia), Kilauea (Hawaii), Sakurajima and Unzen (Japan), and Pinatubo (Philippines), using archival footage to show the raw power behind these incredible acts of creation. The experiences of vulcanologists Stanley Williams and Maurice and Katia Krafft are also explored, as are the after-effects of an eruption, volcanoes in history, and current methods of detection and evacuation."
