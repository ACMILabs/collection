        "Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and floods - these colossal powers of nature have had dramatic consequences for human kind. Learn how earthquakes create and shape our landscapes, even as they destroy life and property. Discover how rotating updrafts can build into the towering tornadoes, and how cloud disturbances can grow into awesome hurricanes. As massive as these forces are, the stories of human heroism and tragedy are very personal, meet heroes, fighting to save their homes and lives, and meet the scientists as they study the elemental killers, in an effort to predict, prepare and protect ourselves from nature's fury."
