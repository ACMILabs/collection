        "The world has a garbage crisis - and every one of us contributes to it, but we can also be part of the solution. This film examines both the problems causing our garbage glut and some of the ways that industries, communities, and individuals are working to solve these problems. The video illustrates how we can reduce, reuse and recycle to bring our solid waste problem under control. The manufacture of an aluminium can is also illustrated. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
