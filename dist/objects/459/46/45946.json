        "In this award winning Italian film based on the novel by Joseph Roth, Rutger Hauer plays Andreas, an ex-miner jailed for an accidental murder. Released from prison, he is living the life of an alcoholic derelict, under the bridges of Paris until he comes into contact with a stranger, who gives him 200 francs. Andreas is confident of finding work and insists that the money should be a loan only. The stranger asks that he repay the debt to the local parish priest, as soon as he is in a position to do so. Despite Andreas' good intentions, he is continually caught up with events or old acquaintances that part him from his money, yet strangely, the 200 francs keeps reappearing back in his wallet. Cast also includes Anthony Quayle, Sandrine Dumas, Sophie Segalen and Dominique Pinon."
