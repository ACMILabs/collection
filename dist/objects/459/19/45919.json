        "Communication systems help to bind a community through shared information, ideas and entertainment, and systems covered in this video include television, newspapers, computers and the telephone. Go behind the scenes at a TV station to see how a local news team develops a story for telecast. See how a newspaper prepares a story, text and pictures for print. Learn the importance of computers, telephones and satellites in increasing the ease and speed of communication. For a community to function efficiently and safely, all of its citizens must have access to a means of communicating in an emergency, an example of which is the use of a TTY phone for hearing impaired people. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
