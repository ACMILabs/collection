        "Young Antonio is wondering how he will fill in time during his summer vacation, when he finds a pair of headphones in the grass. He puts them on and hears music which takes him on an adventure in his backyard, discovering bugs and the places they live. Students will learn to classify bugs by counting their legs and body parts. They will also be introduced to the functions of basic body parts and the phenomenon of metamorphosis. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
