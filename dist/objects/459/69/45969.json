        "Episode of Series \"Totally Gross Anatomy\". The Heart on this tape explores the Circulatory System, with the focus being on the heart itself. It explains the anatomy of this organ and how it functions, including simple to understand diagrams as well as actual footage of a working heart. \"The Brain\" uses animation, MRI images and other medical footage to reveal the major parts of the brain (cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem), and describes the primary functions of each. The emphasis is on how the brain controls all of the functions of the body. \"The Lungs\" examines the Respiratory System and how two football-sized organs are the key players in supplying the body with oxygen and eliminating the waste products from energy production. Other parts of the Respiratory System include the wind-pipe, epiglottis, bronchi, air sacs, capillaries and diaphragm. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teachers guide included."
