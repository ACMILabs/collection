        "Episode of Series \"Families of the world\". Twelve-year-old Naama Greenfield is a Sabra, a native-born Israeli, whose father is American and mother is from Yemen - a situation not unusual for most Israeli children. As we follow a week in the life of Naama and her family, we learn about the customs and lifestyle of Israelis, as well as the major role which religion and patriotism play in their everyday lives. Especially of interest is the explanation of the Hebrew sabbath, Shabbat. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
