        "This video training package (with accompanying trainer's guide) aims to provide managers and team leaders with the skills to assert a positive influence on their team members. As a leader in any situation in any organisation, it is helpful to gain a better understanding of human nature and why people behave in certain ways. While motivation ultimately comes from within, managers can influence what their staff are motivated to do by providing a positive work environment, building confidence and self esteem, and personal empowerment."
