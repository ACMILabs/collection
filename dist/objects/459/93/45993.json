        "It is the first rule of life in the wild : eat or be eaten. In this video students will learn about some of the ways that marine creatures have adapted to this constant struggle. They will see that an animal's survival in the ocean depends on numerous defensive techniques. Sometimes these defensive strategies work, and sometimes they don't. If an animal's defenses are not adequate, it will be eaten. On the other hand, if a predator is unable to overcome the defenses of it's potential food source, it may starve. The methods used by animals to survive in the sea can be ingenious, unusual and wonderful. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's Guide included."
