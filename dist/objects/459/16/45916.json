        "Aboard the historic trading vessel \"The Faile\", acclaimed explorers and film makers Andrew and Liz Wight accompanied by a group of marine scientists, sail south from the Australian mainland to Dangerous Reef. This area is a breeding ground for Australian sea lions and is renowned as being the home to the most dangerous predator in the ocean, the Great White Shark. With an array of planned experiments, including a mobile shark cage, the Wight's experience and capture on film what is internationally accepted as the most dangerous human interaction with a Great White Shark."
