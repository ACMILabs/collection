        "Take a journey into the Labyrinth, where nothing is as it seems. Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) spends most of her time play-acting scenes from her favourite book, The Labyrinth, or baby-sitting her younger brother, Toby. One night, frustrated with Toby's incessant crying, she begs the goblins to take him away. When Toby actually disappears, Sarah follows him into the world of the wicked Goblin King (David Bowie), where she is given thirteen hours to conquer the Labyrinth, before her baby brother is turned into a goblin forever. An engaging fantasy film, populated by creatures created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, and drawing inspiration from a number of sources, including the works of Brian Froud, Maurice Sendak and M. C. Escher. Includes a special behind-the-scenes featurette detailing the making of Labyrinth."
