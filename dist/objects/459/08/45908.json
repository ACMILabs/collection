        "Episode number 1 of Series \"From the earth to the moon\". On April 12, 1961, Russia launched the first man into space leaving a stunned American Space Program in limbo. A call to arms by President John F. Kennedy revitalises the sleeping giant and the nation is united by one aim: to be the first to land a man on the moon before the decade's end. The Mercury program is launched on May 5th, 1961 when Freedom 7 takes Alan B. Shepard, Jr for a 15 minute, 22 second flight into outer space. However, there's a lot to be learned in a short time before man can actually go the distance. Astronauts like Jim Lovell, Buzz Aldrin, Ed White, Neil Armstrong and more will have to risk their lives before the first Apollo can reach for the skies."
