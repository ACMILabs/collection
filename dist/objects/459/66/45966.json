        "Episode of Series \"On nature's trail\". In this episode our four young nature enthusiasts go in search of the mythical \"hooty monster\". They journey to a swamp, an old-growth forest, and finally to deep, cold ocean waters. Along the way they learn about food chains and food webs, discovering that every living thing feeds something else in order to produce energy and survive. They also learn that even if something as small as acorns are removed from a food chain or web, much more that a single link may be lost. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
