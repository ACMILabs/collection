        "A detailed account of the evolution, adaptation and alarming disappearance of frogs from our rapidly expanding world. The frog, who has outlived the dinosaur and woolly mammoth has started to vanish, causing concern to both the scientists who have studied them, and the people who have taken them for granted. Examines how frogs have become a barometer for environmental sensitivity, and speculates on what could be causing populations and species to decline at such a rapid rate. Includes a brief teacher's guide."
