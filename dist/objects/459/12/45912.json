        "The way a seacreature moves has a lot to do with it's lifestyle. As we travel through the different levels in the ocean - from surface to seafloor - we learn that an animal's habitat helps to determine how they move - predators and prey have adapted to particular needs and locations. For example drifters, such as jellyfish, move with the current and crawlers such as crayfish and sea stars move on the ocean floor. Also investigates the anatomical features of each animal and how they determine the means of locomotion. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
