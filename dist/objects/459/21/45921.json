        "Cranky 80-year-old retired professor Norman Thayer makes his annual pilgrimage with his wife, Ethel, to their New England summer lake-side home. Their solitude is interrupted, however, when their daughter, Chelsea, arrives with her new fiancee and his son, Billy, in tow. The three generations collide, but after persuading Norman and Ethel to mind Billy, Chelsea and fiancee leave for a romantic European holiday. What begins as a stubborn battle of wills between Norman and Billy, slowly turns into the relationship Norman never had with his own daughter. However, it is through this warm and accepting relationship with Billy that both Norman and Chelsea are finally able to display affection towards one another. Cast includes Katharine Hepburn, Henry Fonda, Jane Fonda, Doug McKeon and Dabney Coleman."
