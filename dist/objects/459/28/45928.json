        "In Pasolini's picaresque serio-comic fable-essay-confession on the theme of social justice, a father and son set out to emulate St. Francis of Assissi's mission to convert the birds to Christianity. Wandering the Italian landscape, they encounter a wise talking crow, who follows them along retelling left wing parables. Cast includes Toto and Ninetto Davoli. Musical score by Ennio Morricone."
