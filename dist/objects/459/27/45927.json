        "This video attempts to explain race and dispel some of the misconceptions people have about the subject. Race in humans can be compared to breeds in dogs - different breeds of dogs belong to the same species, but there is great diversity in their characteristics. Students will be introduced to the three principle races, the reasons for differences in skin colours, human characteristics that race does not affect (eg. intelligence and strength), and probable reasons for racial differences. No further credits available. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
