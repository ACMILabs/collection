        "The world of dinosaurs comes alive through animation, based on the expertise of palaeontologists, recent fossil discoveries, skeletal reconstructions, and revealing comparisons with animals who currently reside on Earth. Beginning with the origin of life on Earth to the \"Age of the Dinosaurs\", this video explains how all that we know about these extinct animals, including how they lived, hunted and killed has come from the fossil record. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teachers guide included."
