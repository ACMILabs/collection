        "Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle and his partner, Buddy Russo, are New York City police detectives in the field of narcotics. Piecing bits of evidence together they unravel the workings of one of the largest drug-deals in history, involving the shipment of a large source of heroin from France to the United States. Doyle and Russo tail local New Yorkers Sal Boca and Angie who run a modest, small corner store, yet lead an exuberant and glamorous social life. The policemen slowly figure out this couple's connection to Charnier, the French kingpin who is smuggling a large quantity of heroin into the city. A riveting car-chase sequence plus a textured, inventive soundscape, keeps \"The French connection\" engaging throughout. Most admirable is its fusion of art house stylistics with the genre action pic. Cast includes: Gene Hackman, Roy Scheider, Fernando Rey and Tony Lo Bianco."
