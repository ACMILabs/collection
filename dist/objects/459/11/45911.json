        "There are many million times more bugs in the world than there are people, in fact one spoonful of dirt can be home to many hundreds of bugs! Students will learn the benefits of insects and their relatives to humans. This video explores the link in the food chain between insects and other small animals, the process of pollination, the stages of growth in bugs, how bugs benefit the soil, and provides examples of some of the more common bugs such as mites, ants and millipedes. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teachers guide included."
