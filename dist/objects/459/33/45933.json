        "Director Federico Fellini gently lampoons the world of television show-business in this film. Amelia and Pippo are a pair of aging celebrity impersonators who were a successful cabaret act imitating Ginger Rogers and Fred Astair. Neither one has been successful in other endeavours, and they jump at the chance of recreating their performance on a popular TV show. In the studio they find themselves surrounded by grotesque characters and treated contemptuously. Despite these disappointments however, they recall their once familiar routine and enjoy a brief moment of fame and triumph. In Italian with English subtitles. Cast includes Giulietta Masina and Marcello Mastroianni."
