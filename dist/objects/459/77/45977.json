        "A British melodrama set around a Paris dance troupe and the main performers, Tony (Douglas Fairbanks Jr) and Gaby (Dolores Del Rio) Seymour. When dancer Yvette Delange (Florence Desmond) begins to direct her attentions to the somewhat unwilling Tony, a quarrel ensues between Yvette and Gaby. The sudden death by stabbing of Yvette causes suspicion to fall on Gaby and it is only when the trial takes place, the true identity of the murderer is unmasked. Cast also includes Basil Sydney, Googie Withers, Cecil Humphreys."
