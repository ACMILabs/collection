        "A woman goes to investigate her mother's apparent suicide and ends up having to face the grim reality of her past. Amalia, the sixty-something mother of Delia, is found dead on the beach, when she should have been on her way to visit Delia in Bologna. Delia, wanting to know why her mother killed herself, journeys back to Naples to discover the truth. She encounters her mother's supposed lover and his son, as well as her estranged father. As she continues to explore, she must face the fact that her relationship with her mother was based on jealousy and disgust as much as it was on love. She must also face up to a terrible lie she told as a child, one that questioned her mother's fidelity and ruined the lives of everyone around her. In Italian with English subtitles. Cast includes Anna Bonaiuto, Angela Luce, Gianni Cajafa and Giovanni Viglietti."
