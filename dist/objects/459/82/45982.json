        "An all-star cast portrays this most mysterious and poignant event of the First World War - the disappearance in action of the Sandringham Company at Gallipoli in 1915. Commanded by the Estate Manager, Captain Frank Beck (David Jason), they were just ordinary men - servants, grooms and gardeners - drawn from the staff of the King's private residence. They left an idyllic rural existence for the fatally ill-prepared campaign and their deaths brought the horrors of the First World War to the heart of the establishment - and to the Royal Family itself. After the war a Special Envoy was sent at the behest of Queen Alexandra (Maggie Smith) to discover what fate had befallen the Company. But the truth was never fully revealed... Also includes a documentary \"All the kings men\", produced in 1991 and presented by HRH The Prince Edward."
