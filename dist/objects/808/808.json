    "description": [
        "On a busy New York City bus a man and a woman begin to argue. Their language is florid and slightly surreal. Very soon we become aware that what we are witnessing is a scene from Russian playwright Anton Chekhov. And very soon the rushed New York commuters are captivated by the performance unfolding in front of their jaded eyes. This innovative adaptation of Chekhov is a delirious celebration of film, theatre and urban life. Nominated for an Academy Award as Best Short Fiction Drama at the 2002 Academy Awards."
