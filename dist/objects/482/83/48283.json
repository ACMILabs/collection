        "BLUES BROTHERS: At last, the Blues Brothers are back! John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd star in one of the most popular musical comedies of all time. Jake and Elwood Blues, two hoodlum brothers searching for redemption, set out to locate and re-enlist the members of their defunct rhythm and blues band in order to fulfil a \"mission from God\". In their quest they are joined by an impressive array of guest stars including James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Carrie Fisher, John Candy, Ray Charles, Twiggy, Cab Calloway and Steven Spielberg. This madcap film has everything from exciting soul and blues music to one of the most amazing car chase scenes ever filmed, a film not to be missed. BLUES BROTHERS 2000: After serving 18 years for the chaos he was responsible for in the original film, Jake Blues (Dan Aykroyd) is released from jail and learns his brother Elwood has passed away. Even more shocking news is that his old mentor and the man he came to think of as his father Curtis has also passed away, leaving behind an illegitimate son. Determined to reform the band in their memory, Jake returns to the orphanage where he and Elwood were raised, only to be asked to care for 10 year old Buster, an orphan with an attitude similar to his own. Desperate for money to fund the band's reformation, Jake visit's Curtis' son Cabel, a police sergeant. When Jake's plea for money is unsuccessful, Buster steal's Cabel's wallet. The band is reformed with singer Mighty Mack (John Goodman) replacing Elwood in the lineup. With the police, the Russian Mafia and a militia group on their tails, the band travels across country to Louisiana, where they aim to win Queen Mousette's Battle of the Bands. Also includes performances from Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Erykah Badu, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Isaac Hayes, Bo Diddley, Dr. John, Travis Tritt, Steve Winwood and Clarence Clemmons."
