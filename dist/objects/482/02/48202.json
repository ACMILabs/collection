        "A document in sound and image, with minimal narration, of northern Indian urban culture. Recording the gestural qualities of everyday life. The film-makers hope to find evidence of a divinity which animates all the drama and movement of a modern Indian city. The fine score is composed from a dynamic mix of field recordings."
