        "Documentary on early childhood development. How does a child make sense of the world and itself in relation to the world? A mother and her child go about their everyday life: shopping trips, play, all seen through the eyes of the child. Interviews with children and adolescents talking about their earliest memories of developing a relationship with the outside world, their fears and fantasies about the world outside their relationship with their mother. How does a child make sense of things like clothes; everyday objects like a teapot and what it's for are learned through play. Without commentary, through images we see the relationship of this learning and the bearing it has on relationships developed in adolescence."
