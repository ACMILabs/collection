        "Opens with scenes of the harvesting of wheat. The life cycle of the corn weevil is shown and the damage that the weevil causes to stored wheat. An agricultural expert is shown examining an infested barn where the weevils are under flooboards and in all possible cracks and crevices; the building is sprayed to kill them. Ends with an appeal to all Danes to help destroy the pest. In Danish."
