        "A travelogue showing Bryce Canyon National Park in Southern Utah, Zion National Park (one mile away from Bryce Canyon) where the road pases through the mountain and the tunnel has \"windows\" cut through its sides which give amazing views of the canyon valley through to Pine Canyon. And finally, the Grand Canyon in Arizona where tourists on horse-back are taken into the canyon with guides. Shows the magnificent views of the canyon as seen from the buses touring along the roads. Edited by Eugene Castle."
