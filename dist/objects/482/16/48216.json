        "The complete process of pearl culture. Women divers take oysters from the seabed, which are injected with tissue and kernels, and placed in wire baskets to mature in warm sea water in bays and inlets. A careful watch is kept on the temperature and conditions of the sea, and the oysters are moved in the water as necessary. The shells are cleaned once a year, until harvesting, when the pearls are removed, graded, inspected and made up for dealers."
