        "Shows the changing aspects of life in East Anglia from the tranquil dawn until the fading light of evening. Scenes include the rural charm of Suffolk with sleepy one street hamlets; the Norfolk Broads with stately riverside homes; student life at Cambridge; crumbling relics of monastic life in Norfolk; and fishing trawlers from the North Sea. Narrated by William Dexter."
