        "Two excerpts from the film 'Never give a sucker an even break' (1941). 'Hurry hurry' -  W.C. Fields offers to drive a woman in a hurry to the maternity hospital. His reckless driving causes her to faint on the back seat as well as leaving a wake of utter bedlam behind him. 'The great chase' - W.C. Fields earns himself a job at the bank after unwittingly foiling the getaway of two bank robbers. He is then taken hostage by one of the robbers in a second robbery attempt and forced to drive the getaway car with policemen hot on their tails."
