        "Peter Jackson's low budget feature debut originally began life as a 10 minute splatter film called \"Roast of the day\" but was then expanded into a feature, painstakingly shot over a period of four years worth of Sunday's. The comedy/horror film which gave rise to the term splatstick proudly lives up to it's bad taste title, offering many gross moments of extreme gore, inventively executed on it's shoestring budget. The bare bones plot revolves a round a team of alien hunters (the Astro Investigation and Defence Service with the unfortunate acronym of AIDS), who have been sent into the sleepy New Zealand town of Kaihoro where a gang of nasty extra-terrestrials lead by the ghastly Lord Crumb, have taken over. Of course much blood and viscera is spilt as the team discover the aliens evil plan to turn the inhabitants of the town into food. Cast includes Terry Potter, Peter Jackson, Peter O'Herne, Craig Smith, Mike Minett and Doug Wren."
