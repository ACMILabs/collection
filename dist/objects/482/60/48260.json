        "This film concerns the theoretical and practical instruction received by students at the College of Aeronautics and Automobile Engineering in Chelsea, England, and the practical application of their highly skilled technical knowledge in many fields of present day life. The students coming from over forty-five different countries are divided into three training groups - automobile, aeronautical, and agricultural engineering. In addition to showing a good deal of detail of the training given, the film displays scenes of the student life out of the class-rooms."
