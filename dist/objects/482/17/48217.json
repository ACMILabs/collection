        "Cinemagazine item: Danish children build Greek school - In 1949 a United Nations Appeal was made for help in Greece. From Denmark came a plan to build and equip a complete school, paid for by Danish children. Students who were experts in building came to live and work in the Greek village, others had to learn the trade. The Danish students were joined by young people from other countries and in two years the school was finished."
