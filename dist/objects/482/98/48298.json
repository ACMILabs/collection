        "Does a little cheating matter? The focus of this film is a conflict that arises in a community when an idealistic teacher chooses to resign her position rather than condone cheating in the classroom. The film, intended for an adult audience, portrays the role of the Home and School Association in providing a middle ground where parents and teachers can meet."
