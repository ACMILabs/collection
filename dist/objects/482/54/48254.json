        "Episode of Series \"Canada carries on\". Montreal's Botanical Gardens are a storehouse of the wonders of nature. From all over the world scientists have gathered a living collection of plants and flowers, providing delight for the casual visitor and rich material for the student of botany. The actual process of plant growth is revealed for us by the time-lapse camera. We see a practical result of the botanist's work in British Columbia's important seed industry. Children, too, at the Montreal Botanical Gardens, cultivating their own plots of ground, take part in the quest for the secrets of nature."
