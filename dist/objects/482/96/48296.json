        "Miniseries about the harsh realities of farming in Australia during the 1980s and one family's battle against economic and climatic odds. It is 1985 and prolonged drought and high interest rates have meant that sheep farmers Tom and Liz Cooper (Colin Friels and Greta Scacchi) can no longer meet the repayments on their foreign currency loan. The bank threatens to foreclose and the couple decides to sue them to save their property. It's a seven-year battle that tests the family's fortitude against the bank's corporate might. Filmed on location in the sheep country near Yass, \"The Farm\" tackles issues which are still relevant to farmers today such as farm succession, economic rationalism, corporatisation and the perceived uncaring nature of government policy."
