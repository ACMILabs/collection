        "Using the device of a prologue in which Mary Shelley takes up her story, the monster and Frankenstein were resurrected at Universal's behest. Although the threads of continuity in the plot are explicit, in tone this is not really a sequel but a macabre comedy, an excursion into the fantastic which hovers between expressionism and surrealism. Karloff's monster is the only sympathetic character. The mad scientist, Dr. Pretorius, seems to take over the evil presumptions of Frankenstein. As originally conceived, the heart of Frankenstein's bride, Elizabeth, was to have been implanted in the she-monster. This makes more sense of the title and the she-monster's behaviour. Suggested by the original story written in 1816 by Mary Wollstonecroft Shelley. Also includes a comprehensive documentary detailing various aspects of the production, including music, make-up, and behind-the-scenes information."
