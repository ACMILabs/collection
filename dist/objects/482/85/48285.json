        "A controversial and challenging film of Jesus Christ's life. Based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, this Christ is an anguished, vain, sensual man battling the forces of both good and evil. The film traces the conflicts that lead to his final disavowal of the flesh in favour of the life of the son of God. Scorsese had for years tried to film the Kazantzakis' novel and on its release it was met with great debate and fury. The film, however, is deeply spiritual. With Willem Dafoe as Jesus, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene, Harvey Keitel as Judas, and an impressive cameo by David Bowie as Pontius Pilate. Music by Peter Gabriel."
