        "Once upon a time there was a guy called \"the boss\" - it was a lonely job. He has to get his own coffee, make pone calls, write his own letters and still run his business. So he hire \"his girl\" or secretary to assist him whilst he ran the business. She was a kind of servant, messenger and scribe. Today there are tens of millions scattered throughout organisations. Studies have found secretaries skills are not being fully utilised but paper processing is exploding. To the rescue comes world processing and re-organising of secretarial duties."
