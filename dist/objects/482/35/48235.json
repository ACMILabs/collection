        "Presents life in the Mailu Islands of South-East Papua New Guinea where a nurse for the London Missionary Society works among the people. Visits a Papuan church service, after a canoe trip through the coral islands, seeing the skilful fishermen. When serious illness occurs, isolation is felt until help comes by radio and seaplane. Shows old customs continuing such as tattooing, feasts, pot-making. Narrated by Sister Clark."
