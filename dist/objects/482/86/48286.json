        "Based on Larry McMurtry's novel about the experiences of a young boy growing up in Texas, \"Hud\" is a powerful story of family corruption and betrayal. Lone (Brandon de Wilde) is a teenager in a sleepy Texas town whose hero is his cavalier uncle, Hud (Paul Newman). Hud is the new face of the West. Unlike his father he refuses traditional values based on hard work and community and instead stands for a new creed of economic selfishness and sexual amorality. Hud's bitter relationship with his father (Melvyn Douglas) comes to a head when a mysterious illness starts attacking their cattle. As the two men fight it out, Lone has to choose between the two men and decide for himself what kind of man he wishes to become. The makers of \"Hud\", many of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s, have lovingly recreated the bleakness and beauty of a desert community. They have also created one of the first modern westerns, a film which challenges the myths of the Wild West and instead powerfully examines the reality of social, economic and gender relationships in rural America. The stunning black and white photography is by acclaimed cinematographer James Wong Howe and the music score is by Elmer Bernstein. Melvyn Douglas won an Academy Award for his performance, as did Patricia Neal, who as the divorcee housekeeper who knows her time and her looks are fading, gives one of the great performances of the 1960s."
