        "Based on a popular video game, Sin the Movie is a compelling, action-packed tale set in Earth's dystopic future. The city of Freeport has been rocked by a number of unexplained abductions involving a mutant humanoid. Colonel John Blade, leader of the elite strike force, Hardcorps, makes it his business to solve the mystery after one of his team is murdered by the monster. His efforts lead him to Sintek Industries, a multibillion dollar corporation headed by Elexis Sinclaire, brilliant biochemist and vicious vixen. When an adopted child, Elyse, is kidnapped, John and JC, the sister of his dead team-member, join forces to destroy the mutant, and stop Elexis from unleashing a genetically-engineered apocalypse upon the city. The director of this animation, Yasunori Urata, has been linked with a number of other important anime works, and is renowned for his stories, which combine human drama with spectacular action."
