        "Opening sequence shows the trophy shield with six state emblems on it and also shot of ABC film crew filming the shield. Competitors are shown on location at Williamstown Rifle Range on a very cold wintry day. Entire film devoted to shots of the competing teams with occasional view of the progressive scores. NSW won and a team is shown with the trophy at the end of the film. Vehicles of the time are shown parked near the competing area. Silent film of historical interest. No credits provided."
