        "A colorful array of floral gardens in Britain. Different styles of flower cultivation are illustrated, ranging from the wild loveliness of early spring flowers in the Scilly Isles to the delicacy of rose gardens in Northern Ireland; from London's roof-top and window-box displays to the planned landscapes which are so much a feature of historic country houses in Britain. Includes the Chelsea Flower Show. Narrated by Deryck Guyler."
