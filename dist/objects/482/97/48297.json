        "Renowned chef Rick Stein takes a languid journey along the coastline of the United Kingdom in search of the best seafood places to eat and where to get the best produce when cooking fish yourself. Rick cooks an assortment of dishes using mackerel, Portland squid, dover sole, gurnard, herring, wolffish, haddock, mussels, smokies, Penclawdd oysters, monkfish, Mount's Bay pilchards, abalone. He also calls in on the Blessing of the nets in Brighton, the Dieppe Street Market, Pilchard Press Works plus numerous other venues. Beautiful photography and delicious dishes make this a gastronomic as well as a armchair traveller's delight."
