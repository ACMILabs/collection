        "This film shows the Moka Festival which is held deep in the heart of New Guinea. The many tribes walk great distances carrying with them a live pig lashed to a pole. The pig represents a major feature of the Moka ceremony. Wealthy chiefs distribute their wealth to the less fortunate chiefs and pigs and shells are currency between the villages. The tribal people adorn themselves with paint and feathers and dance at the \"festival of giving\". Photography by Arnold M. Maahs."
