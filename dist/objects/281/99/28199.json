        "Surveys India's efforts to conserve soil in an effort to meet the challenge of rain and flood. The indiscriminate cutting of trees, the unplanned cultivation of slopes and uncontrolled grazing, all helped to rob the country of thousands of acres of land that were once fertile. Counter-terracing, strip cropping, trenching, and above all, afforestation schemes are undertaken to restore the balance of nature."
