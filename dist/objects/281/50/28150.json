        "Glimpses of a few of the sculptures which made famous the craftsmanship of Indian artists. Among the examples illustrated are the temples of Konarak in Orissa; one of the noblest monuments that man has raised to the Sun God, the Shrine of Kalugumalai carved out of a single rock; the Domambullar in Pudukotah State; the ruins of Hampi in the South; a relic of the Vijayanagar Kingdom, and the shrines at Khajuraho in Central India."
