        "A fable of great humour and appeal, 'The Sand Castle' is the story of the Sandman and the creatures he sculpts out of sand. Under his direction, they build a castle and celebrate the completion of their new home only to be interrupted by the visit of an uninvited guest. The wind blows, and the castle crumbles. The filmmaker leaves the door open to various interpretations. Sound film, without words. (Awards: Twenty-two awards including Melbourne International Film Festival and Academy Award)"
