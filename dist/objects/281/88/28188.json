        "The incidence of malaria in Sardinia had become so high in 1946 that the Italian Government undertook a campaign to eradicate the malaria-bearing mosquito from the island. A special organization known as ERLAAS was set up and in 1947 an all-out effort was launched. All structures where the adult mosquito might be sheltering had to be sprayed with special emulsions. In an attempt to wipe out the larvae, every patch and pool of water was sprayed with DDT mixed with diesel oil, and marshy places were cleared and drained. By the end to 1948 the work was complete and as a result a new era in the life of the Sardinian people had begun."
