        "In the centre of the Western Mediterranean the granite island of Sardinia is inhabited by a vigorous, resourceful race of people, struggling to wrest a livelihood from the inhospitable soil. Tuna fishing is the most productive industry. Ancient ceremonies and festivals are a feature of village life. Man's adaptability to a rugged, rocky island environment is the broad theme of this story of an independent and self-reliant people who shun the ways of the modern world and cling to ancient customs and traditions whose origins are lost in time."
