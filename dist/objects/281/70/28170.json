        "A brief acquaintance with the president of Chile before his assassination in September, 1973. In 1972, several miners from Quebec went to Chile to observe mining operations there. They also met with the President of the Republic. Salvador Allende explains, publicly at a meeting of icampannerors, as well as in a conference with the visitors, the revolutionary socio-economic reforms he envisages for his country, which include nationalisation of the copper industry. Rene Levesque, Theo Gagne and Joseph Gosselin appear in the film. (A film for all students of political change. With English subtitles)"
