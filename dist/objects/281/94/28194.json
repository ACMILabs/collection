        "A behind-the-camera portrait of one of the world's greatest film makers. Ray himself provides the commentary, in which he talks of his development as a writer and director. In particular, he develops the theme that through the medium of film he has not only reached a greater understanding of his own country, but has also found a greater universal understanding. Illustrated by scenes from The Apu Trilogy."
