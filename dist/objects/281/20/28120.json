        "Episode of Series \"History of the Motion Picture\". An examination of the different silent comedy styles of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon. Excerpts from films show each actor on the threshold of their finest work. All three comedians give evidence of their ability to rise above the level of pure slapstick and develop a more personal style of comedy. Suitable for upper secondary level."
