        "In 1957 the Soviet Union put the first satellite into space, and since then has achieved other spectacular \"firsts\" in space. But Soviet scientists are also tackling other problems of more immediate consequence to its 200 million population. The opening up of the frozen deserts of the Arctic Circle and the discovery of minerals there; the chemical compounding of foods; and the use of computers particularly in the field of hospital surgery and medical research are a part of the quiet revolution in progress behind the closed doors of the Soviet Union."
