        "The film opens with a map of the fishing grounds of the world, and the waters of British Columbia are selected to show details of the large-scale salmon industry. A study of this extremely active and resourceful fish in its natural surroundings is always fascinating, and this film combines a clear exposition of fishing by seine net, and the preparation of the fish for the cannery."
