        "The basis of the conflict between BART (Bay Area Rapid Transport) and the Berkley Community was whether tracks, for a kind of railway, should be placed over or under ground. The mayor of the time and some other people explain how the fight was conducted and the strategies of BART and Berkeley and the final victory for Berkeley."
