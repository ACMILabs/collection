        "What is the solution to the problem of the automobile which is threatening to kill cities and their inhabitants? This film proposes that mass transportation systems are the answer and demonstrates that Chicago, New York and London are doing something about it by improving the efficiency and economy of existing systems. Some must take more drastic action. For Example, San Francisco, has set up a rapid transport system authority to combat the problem. Mention is made of the first automatic public transport ticketing system."
