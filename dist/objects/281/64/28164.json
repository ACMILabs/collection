        "The legendary relationship between the West Coast Indians and the salmon, once their staple food, is revealed in this film that contrasts ancient myth and modern reality. We see how Raven finds riches in the harvest of the salmon, only to lose everything through a thoughtless act against the Spirit of the Salmon. So too does modern man jeopardise his living from the sea by heedless action. Images of ancient spear-fishing and primitive smoke-houses contrast with images of today's Indians operating a seiner and working in a cooperative cannery."
