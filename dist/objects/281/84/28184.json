        "Investigation into the murder of a music student, Sapphire Robbins, leads the detectives along London's coloured population. Although she passed for white, Sapphire was half Negro, and her dark-skinned brother is one of several suspects. When the detective expose, in all its irrationality, the violent hate that Sapphire managed to arouse, the murderer is driven into a confession.

Det Hazard (Nigel Patrick), Det Learoyd (Michael Craig), David Farris (Paul Massie), Mildred Harris (Yvonne Mitchell), Mr Harris (Bernard Miles), Mrs Harris (Olga Lindo), Dr Robbins (Earl Cameron), Paul Slade (Gordon Heath)."
