        "Utilising an imaginative rather than a realistic approach, the director Frank Stauffacher, one of the leading experimental film makers in the United States, seeks to capture the atmosphere of Sausalito, a small village on the shore of San Francisco Bay. The film is divided into two sections; Landscape and Song and uses slow motion, split screen, and superimposition techniques. It consists of fragments of visual and auditory experience such as the lapping of water on the shore, the creaking redwood of old houses."
