        "Rune stones are one of the interesting relics of the Viking Age to be found in many parts of central and southern Sweden. The oldest Runic inscription discovered up to now, is to be found on a spearhead from the 3rd Century AD. Sparlosastenen and Rokstenen are amongst the oldest Rune stones in Sweden. The text of Sparlosastenen is difficult to interpret but the pictures still tell us a good deal about the ancient Scandinavian's conception of things. These and other Rune stones tell us much about the Viking way of life."
