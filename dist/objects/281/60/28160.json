        "The foundation stones of the cathedral at New Sarum, the present-day Salisbury were laid on 28 April 1220. Completed and consecrated in 1258, Salisbury Cathedral is the finest example of early English ecclesiastical architecture in Britain. The film includes exterior and interior views of the cathedral - the nave, transepts, choir, High Altar and Lady Chapel, the close, cloisters, chapter house, clock and 404 ft spire. Music and commentary by Horace Shepherd."
