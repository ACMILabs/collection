        "How a dilemma facing fisheries authorities of Canada's west coast is being met and overcome: the need to use the Fraser and other British Colombia rivers for industrial and public uses and also to keep them uncontaminated and unobstructed so as not to impede the Pacific salmon in its annual upstream migration to freshwater spawning grounds. Of concern, too, is the conservation of young fry in their downstream run to the sea."
