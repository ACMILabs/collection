        "Explains how the salt concentration in arid soils can be built up due to over-irrigation and removal of overgrowth; how salting can be prevented in irrigation areas by controlled irrigation and how, when salting does occur, the land can be used for pastures or reclaimed and brought back to full production by tile drainage."
