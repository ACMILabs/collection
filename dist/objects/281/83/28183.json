        "A New York tenement if Spanish-Harlem is not an easy place to live in. One moves fast and grows up quickly because that's survival. But one learns to cope with the ghetto and sometimes can transform rubbish into beauty. Santiago's Ark is such a place of beauty for a boy and his dreams. With endurance and help of the people around him, he sets about building his own ship on the rooftop of his apartment house."
