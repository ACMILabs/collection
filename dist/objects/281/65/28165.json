        "Salmon Run deals primarily with the protection of the sockeye salmon fisheries in the Fraser River of British Columbia. Because of its firm, red meat and rich, amber-colored oil, the sockeye is the most valuable of the salmon. The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, made up of Canadian and United States scientists and research workers, was confronted with such problems as clearing Hell's Gate in the Fraser River so that the salmon would not be lost in their fight to reach spawning grounds upstream."
