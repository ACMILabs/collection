        "Centres on the Italian Ethiopian war of 1935-1936 to lead into an examination of Italian fascism, the character of Mussolini, and how he came to power. Shows how the conflict was one of the chief episodes that paved the way for World War 2. Seen from an essentially American perspective, this film combines contemporaneous actuality footage and interviews with US academics. Written by Anthony Potter. This film is suitable for Upper Secondary levels."
