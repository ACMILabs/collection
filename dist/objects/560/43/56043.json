One of a series in which Robert Hughes surveys Australia's art from the time of the first fleet to the present day. In the years up to the end of World War I, Australian artists made a concerted effort to impress themselves on the world at large. Hughes looks at the work of Norman Lindsay, Sydney Long, George Lambert, Hugh Ramsay, Emmanuel Phillips Fox, Rupert Bunny and sculptor Bertram McKennal."
