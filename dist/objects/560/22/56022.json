        "The wrecking-ball is a most effective instrument of change. It levels buildings to permit the construction of highrises and freeways. Slowly, the sense of identity that people feel in places inherited from the past is being shattered by the drive to modernize. This film chooses looks at Montreal, Brussels & Sydney, where unrestricted development has been resisted with varying degrees of success. Voice and narration by Bronwyn Drainie."
