        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". Challenges our conventional ideas of dinosaurs. Argues that they were not slow-moving, cold blooded reptiles, but were agile, intelligent and hot-blooded. Points out that they didn't all die out and that their descendants are alive and well and living all around us."
