        "Shows how Japan, encouraged by lack of Western resistance took control of French Indochina, the Dutch Indies, Burma, Malaya and the Philippines. Roosevelt attempted to counter Japan's escalating aggression, and by mid-1941, a total embargo was enforced and all assets originating in Japan were frozen on the market. In the face of this pressure, the Japanese government forced the United States into war. Narrated by Eric Sevareid. Suitable for upper secondary level."
