        "Looks at sexism and sex-role stereotyping and explores many of the commonly held myths. Shows two secondary schools where students participate in a \"progressive coeducational\" program and notes both teacher and student attitudes to their roles. We see this through woodwork, sewing, cooking and sports. However, issues such as non-gender specific language and parental attitudes are also raised and explored. Suitable for upper secondary level."
