        "In 1956 the Hungarian Revolution claimed 50,000 lives. Clara and her father were two refugees who came to Canada to settle, fleeing the treachery of the secret police. Both were haunted by the events they had experienced. It takes the arrival of Clara's Uncle Janos from Budapest to explain to her the years of uncertainty and bitterness she had lived through since her childhood escape."
