        "An alien colony settles on earth and language differences present a problem. This film shows in a humorous way how communicating with others involves getting in touch with their ways of exchanging information; and how to overcome the three barriers to communication: linguistic, sociological and personal. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
