        "Every day 25 000 people in developing countries die from using unsafe water, and until recently the problem has been largely ignored. For poor countries, providing clean water is seldom of high national priority, partly because the effects of unsafe water are not immediately visible, but also because there is no quick economic return. This film documents several of the water-borne tropical diseases plaguing Africa, and examines the economic and social conditions that allow them to flourish."
