        "Presents two eras in the town of Lilydale in Victoria, the 1880's and the 1980's to form a case study of an Australian rural town as the metropolis advances towards it. It is a journey in time using archival photographs and diaries focusing particularly on the divergent life styles, attitudes and environments of the two eras of the district. Also includes a period recreation as a means to gain insights into those elements of Lilydale life. Suitable for secondary level."
