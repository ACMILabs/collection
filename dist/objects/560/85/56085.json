        "Follows Maurice Ogden's allegorical poem. A hangman executes the inhabitants of a tow, one by one, without explanation. Fed by the blood of the victims no-one defended - the alien, the one who dared to object, and the Jew - the gallows tree takes root and fills the village square. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
