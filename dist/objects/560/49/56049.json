        "Shot in New York's Central park, this classic one-act play, although written in 1912 in Sweden, proves to be astonishingly timely in the way it deals with woman's struggle against the loss of self and her need for an independent life while remaining a partner in marriage. Two actresses, one a wife and a mother, the other living along, meet in a cafe. The wife talks, the other is silent. The wife faces the truth; the silent woman is her husband's mistress. The agony of confrontation as well as the relief that follows is shared between them; the battle is over and it becomes irrelevant who is stronger. The two women have come to a deeper knowledge of self through each other. Sisterhood is born. Based on the play by August Strindberg. Starring Viveca Linfors."
