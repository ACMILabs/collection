        "One-third of the world's people live in the rural areas of the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Although industrial development programs have vastly improved life in the cities, Third World countries are now faced with the need to revitalize their rural societies. The question is how to accomplish that. Each of these nations now realizes it must find its own answers."
