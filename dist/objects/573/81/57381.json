        "Jocelyn Terry leads a discussion with Val Kent of Huntingdale Technical School and Dr. Alan Diknot of Monash University to provide some explanations of the puzzling aspects of Anne Tyler's novel. The program discusses why the novel opens with Pearl's death; our sympathy for Pearl and for Beck; the effect of their upbringing on the children; and the role of the subsidiary characters."
