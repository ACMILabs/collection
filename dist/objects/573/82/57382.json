        "A panel led by Peter Couchman, (Don Edgar, Institute of Family Affairs Jenni Strauss and Dr. Christopher Worth, Monash University and Colin Goodwin of Philip Institute) discuss the HSC literature theme which concentrates on the family and the connections which operate within families. In Part 1 the texts \"Father and son\" by Edmund Gosse and \"Long day's journey into night\" by Eugene O'Neill are considered. Covers such topics as the changing mix of families, the stress of being oneself in a family relationship and yet still being part of a family, and the kinds of support available for people facing problems. Part 2 looks at more contemporary issues that affect family relationships. The texts \"The Millstone\" by Margaret Drabble and \"A Very easy death\" by Simone de Beauvoir are considered."
