        "(Compilation Tape) The first program (15min) has children simulating a snake. It investigates a snake's features and looks at people's attitudes towards them through the eyes of someone from another planet. The second program (14min) uses art activities and simple experiments to demonstrate how reptiles live. Examples of living reptiles are included to highlight their special features."
