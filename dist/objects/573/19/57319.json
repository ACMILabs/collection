        "Kerrie Aulsebrook, an Education Officer at the Museum of Victoria, looks at the techniques of nature printing. Nature printing is transferring the image of something in nature, (such as fish, plants, feathers, shells, snakeskin), onto the surface of paper. Anything with a textured surface works well: fish have been used in this demonstration."
