        "A panel consisting of Peter Couchman, Tony Staley, David McKenzie, Bruce Grant and Graham Little consider the theme: Power and the political man. Issues dicussed include the ways in which power is achieved; why some seek power, how power is exercised and the effect it has on those who achieve it and then lose it; and the sources of power. The discussion covers these issues as they relate to the texts; \"The Prince\" by Machiavelli, \"Mahatma Gandhi and his Apostles\" by Ved Mehta, \"All the Kings Men\" by Robert Penn Warren and \"Quiet Americans\" by Graham Greene."
