        "Jocelyn Terry leads a discussion with Laurie Clancy of La Trobe University and Colin Goodwin of the Phillip Institute, in aspects of commitment as revealed in Thomas Keneally's book \"Schindler's Ark\" and in Graham Greene's book \"The Power and the Glory\". Some provocative considerations emerge about the varieties of commitment, motivations for and consequences of commitment, as revealed in these texts."
