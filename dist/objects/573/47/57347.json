        "A look at the natural language or whole language approach to the learning of language in the early years of school. This approach is based on the assumption that literacy develops naturally through the use of language as a whole, such as learning to read to follow directions, for information, and to find out about the world. This video also deals with assessment and evaluation and is a good memory jogger for teaches and consultants."
