        "The Australian Army's botanist, Major Les Hiddins is studying the natural survival resources of the vast wilderness of northern Australia. This study takes into account the native bush foods and medicines that have sustained Aboriginal people and is the first study of its kind since European settlement. It provides valuable information for Australian soldiers should they ever have to survive in such an inhospitable region. Some unique flora is also discovered. Suitable for secondary school level."
