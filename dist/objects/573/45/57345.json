        "In October 1986, Orange land forces invaded central Queensland to sabotage Australia's coal export industry. To counter the threat, the Townsville-based Operational Deployment Force (the cutting edge of the Australian Army) was deployed against them. For the first time, the combat capabilities of the Operational Development Force was being tested. \"Jordo\" (Private Paul Jordan) was part of the Force assigned to defend our local resources. The Army cameras went into battle with \"Jordo\" and his platoon."
