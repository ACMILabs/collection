        "Presented by Genevieve Mooy this tape follows the arrest of a woman suspected of theft and follows what happens to her at the police station, the laws that govern police powers of arrest, the interview and bail. It raises issues such as when a person can be arrested, whether a court appearance is necessary, whether the police have an obligation to inform the suspect as to why they are being arrested, warrants, the interview process, cautioning, restrictions on questioning, the right to silence and legal representation, being charged, and bail conditions and hearings. Please note: this tape was produced in co-operation with the NSW Police, so the law in other states and territories may differ substantially, although the basic elements remain the same."
