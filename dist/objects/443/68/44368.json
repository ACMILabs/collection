        "Chance Boudreaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is a down on his luck Cajun soldier, reluctantly hired by Nat Binder (Yancy Butler) to help find her father, an ex Green Beret who is currently homeless in Louisiana. What they both don't know is that their mission is doomed to fail, as Nat's father has been brutally murdered as sport. His killer is the ruthless Fouchon (Lance Henriksen), a mercenary who procures homeless people living around New Orleans and enlists them in his game, whereby they become the live targets. This film features enough of John Woo's trademark action and Jean Claude Van Damme's physical presence to satisy Woo and JCVD fans."
