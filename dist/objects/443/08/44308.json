        "'Cats' is the longest-running musical in the history of the London West End and Broadway Theatre. The musical exploded onto the West End in 1981 and became an instant hit world wide, with \"Memory\" one of it's classic and recogniseable songs. Based on \"Old Possum's book of practical cats\" by T.S. Eliot - CATS is a stunning production with a star studded cast including Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills. The costumes and choreography are superb, effectively transforming humans into felines. Using the latest technology, all the excitement, thrill, romance and intimacy of this theatrical legend is captured on screen. With breathtaking visuals and full digital sound from a 70 piece orchestra, one is lead into the mysterious world of cats."
