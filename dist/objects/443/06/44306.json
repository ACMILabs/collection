        "A BBC dramatisation of the Classic Dickens mystery story of a young man's struggle for self-respect. When Pip visits Miss Havisham and Estalla for the first time, his life is changed forever by the appearance of Miss Havisham in the relics of her wedding dress, the room frozen in time from when she was jilted at the alter a year ago. When Pip acquires a mystery benefactor it seems that he now has the required financial credentials to court Estelle, however his wealth is not all it seems. Cast includes Ioan Gruffudd, Justine Waddell, Charlotte Rampling and Bernard Hill."
