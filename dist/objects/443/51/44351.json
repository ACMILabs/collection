        "In Tony Modra's first senior year, 1992, Modra kicked 22 goals in only 8 games. This statistic was to belie his future goal kicking achievements in an impressive 1993 season which earned him the reputation of Crow spearhead as he went on goal spree after goal spree. Breaking all existing Crow records, Modra started the season in a blaze of glory and marched towards the club's first 100 goal haul. Along the way he captivated supporters with daring leads, pin point accuracy and impressive aerial displays. 1993 was Tony Modra's season."
