        "Every second car now on the road, it is estimated, will cause an injury-producing accident during its lifetime. But, according to experts on safety promotion interviewed in this film, the driver is less to blame than is commonly supposed. Why so many injuries occur is illustrated in experimental crashes; how safety engineering could reduce traffic casualties is shown in a number of test vehicles."
