        "Richard and Rochelle Wright and their two sons travelled the Fraser River from Cache Tete Jaune to the Pacific coast in a rubber raft. In addition to being a great adventure, the trip brought them into contact with people who told them some of the history of the river, and acquainted them with lifestyles vastly different from their own citified ways."
