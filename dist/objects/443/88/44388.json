        "The Tracy team launch a highly dangerous rescue mission in space in this first feature-length Thunderbirds classic. SZero X, a 21st century spacecraft, is suddenly blasted by a strange explosion as it leaves the Earth's atmosphere bound for Mars. Is it sabotage? Can the Thunderbirds discover the perpetrators and save the next launch? This adventure film is gadget loaded and features visual effects by Derek Meddings as well as sound effects by some of London's famous rock stars, including Cliff Richards."
