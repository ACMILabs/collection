        "Episode of Series \"Classic albums: the greatest records in rock history\". Taking more than two years from conception to release, 'Songs in the key of life' is considered to be one of the highlights of Stevie Wonder's career, as well as one of the classic albums of the century. Originally released in 1976, the album entered the U.S Billboard album charts at number one and held the position for 14 weeks. Success also heralded Motown Records' reinvestment in Wonder, resigning him to the label in a lucrative deal. The album was successful in the United Kingdom, reaching number two, remaining in the charts for over a year, and was a worldwide best seller. This outstanding success in 1976 culminated in the announcement that Stevie Wonder was the recipient of Album of the Year at the Grammys, as well as being named Producer of the Year and Best Male Vocal Performer. The remarkable story behind this phenomenally successful year for Wonder is told here as he reminisces about the inspiration behind the album."
