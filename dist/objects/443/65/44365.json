        "This very romantic comedy is all about a girl named Faith (Marisa Tomei) who searches for her \"soul mate\" named Damon Bradley. She was advised of this name by the Ouija board and a gypsy fortune teller. A week before her wedding, \"Damon\" phones to say he is unable to attend. Faith believes she must leave her fiancee, travel to Italy, and find her date with destiny\". During her search, the wrong man (Robert Downy Jnr) falls madly in love with her. What is she to do? With breathless scenery and brilliant performances, it's irresistible entertainment that everyone will enjoy. Cast also includes Billy Zane and Fisher Stevens."
