        "This documentary was originally recorded on half-inch portable videotape and transferred to film. Rosedale, once referred to as \"the rear end of Alberta\" by one of its frustrated citizens, pulled itself together as a community. It formed a citizens' action committee, cleaned up the town, built a park, and negotiated with the government to install gas, water and sewage systems. It all happened within five months. The catalyst of this development process was the use of VTR equipment by the citizens themselves."
