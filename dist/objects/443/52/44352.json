        "It's Thanksgiving and Neal Page (Steve Martin) is looking forward to spending some quality time with the family. While on the flight home, Neal is seated next to obnoxious shower curtain ring salesman Del Griffith (John Candy). When a snow storm causes their plane to be rerouted, the two are reluctantly united by their misfortune. Thus begins a disastrous chain of events that transcends all forms of public transport and threatens to make Neal miss Thanksgiving all together."
