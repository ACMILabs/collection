        "When Kate (Helena Bonham-Carter) falls in love with middle class journalist Martin (Linus Roache), her benefactor Aunt refuses to accept their union, believing her niece can do better. She offers Kate an ultimatum, stay with her lover and renounce any financial support for herself and her father, or assume her rightful place in society and promise to never see him again. Months later, an American heiress, Millie (Alison Elliot), enters their milieu and Kate forms a friendship with the new visitor. When Kate discovers that Millie is not only rich, but dying, her mind toys with the possibility of finding a way that she and Martin can be together and financially successful- Martin must fall in love with Millie. Set in Venice in the early 1900's, this lavish period drama is based on the novel by Henry James. Cast includes Elizabeth McGovern, Charlotte Rampling and Michael Gambon."
