        "Humorist Robert Benchley visits the Disney Studios to sell Walt on the idea of animating the story of The Reluctant Dragon. While evading an officious young studio guide, Benchley stumbles into various studio activities and departments, including an art class, a sound effects session, the multiplane camera studio (at which point he notices the film has switched to Technicolor), the paint lab, a storyboard session for the \"Baby Weems\" segment, a movieola screening of the Goofy cartoon \"How to Ride a Horse\", and finally catches up with Walt in a screening room just as he's previewing the studio's latest film... The Reluctant Dragon! Cinematography by Bert Glennon and Winton C. Hock. Edited by Paul Weatherwax."
