        "Episode of Series \"Classic albums: the greatest records in rock history\". The Band- comprising Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson where initially known for supporting Bob Dylan on tour but they quickly became known as a band, The Band, within their own right. After signing with Capitol Records in 1968, they recorded eight U.S. Top 40 albums, including three million sellers. Out of all of the group's albums, their eponymously titled 1969 album achieved Billboard success, was their second million seller, and is now regarded as a rock classic because of its careful blending of black, country, rockabilly and rock and roll music. The story of The Band and their classic album is recounted here in words, images and music, with contributions by rock legends Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Bernie Taupin and Don Was. Band members too offer an insight into the creative processes at work behind their albums that were universally popular."
