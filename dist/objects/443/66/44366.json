        "There is no more influential or imposing figure in football today than the Kangaroos captain; Wayne Carey. Voted as the greatest player of the twentieth century by Leigh Matthews, Carey has stamped his mark as the dominant centre half forward of his era in over 200 games. All Australian captain, quadruple club champion, leading goalkicker, Carey has earned himself the worthy reputation of \"King\". In this program Carey reflects on the memorable moments of his career, there are also revealing interviews with coach Denis Pagan as well as team mates and opponents."
