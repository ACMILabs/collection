        "In an attempt to get rid of their most inept and detested employee, Mr Bean, The Royal National Gallery of London send him to America to oversee the unveiling of America's most treasured painting, 'Whistler's mother'. The staff of the Grierson Gallery in Los Angeles are not privy to the gallery's rationale for sending Mr Bean, and still believe that they are dealing with a man of the finest intellect, the scholarly Dr Bean. While in America Mr Bean is billetted to stay with David Langley (Peter MacNicol), much to the annoyance of his family who seriously doubt his supposedly brilliant credentials. As Mr Bean unleashes his particular brand of behaviour, which inevitably ends in disaster, they too begin to wonder about the enigmatic Mr Bean. The most significant of his disasters includes destroying 'Whistlers' mother', forcing him into panic mode to rectify the situation before he gives a speech at the grand unveiling. Cast also includes Mel Smith, Pamela Reed and Harris Yulin. Includes 20 minutes of unseen footage as well as interviews with Rowan Atkinson and Mel Smith."
