        "The film explores how the three British colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island became provinces of Canada, and it charts the subsequent decline of their economies after Confederation. Photographs, archival drawings, cartoons, and interviews with Maritime historians are used to document the case. An important contribution to the continuing dialogue on the history and evolution of Canada's federal system."
