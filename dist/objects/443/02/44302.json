        "'Stiletto' is an intriguing investigation of society's fascination with fetishistic footwear. The impact of the stiletto heel on both fashion and culture is scrutinised from a number of perspectives by people including an historian, a podiatrist, a fashion therapist, a fashion designer, and the manufacturers of fetishistic shoes. Looks at stilettos in relation to roleplay, festishism, gender roles, foot- binding, and images of sexuality, using archival footage and photo- graphic stills as supporting evidence."
