        "The first in a planned 'Jersey Trilogy' (which now includes 'Mall Rats' and 'Chasing Amy'), Kevin Smith's low budget feature debut captures with loads of humour and pop culture references, the malaises of 20 somethings struggling with relationships and working in dead end jobs they are way over qualified to be in. Twenty two year old Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) works at the local Quick stop convenience store in New Jersey, a job he resents and finds almost unbearable if it wasn't for his best friend Randal (Jeff Anderson), working at the video shop next door. 'Clerks' covers one eventful day of their lives as they ponder the unfair work practices of the evil empire in the Star Wars trilogy, find out what 'snowballing' is, insult customers, and grapple with their own uncertain future. All the while turning the work ethos on its head. Meanwhile, outside the store local drug dealers Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) and his sidekick Jay (Jason Mewes) give their own skewed philosophy on life. Cast also includes Marilyn Ghigliotti, Lisa Spoonhauer and Scott Mosier. (Awards: 1994 Sundance Film Festival Filmmakers Trophy and 1994 Cannes Young Cinema Award)"
