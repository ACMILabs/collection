        "Two Mules for Sister Sara is a freewheeling, anarchic adventure set in a French-occupied Mexico in the 19th century. An American mercenary (Clint Eastwood) rescues a nun (Shirley Maclaine) from her would-be-molesters, only to later discover that the chance meeting has been a stroke of luck for him, as she knows a great deal about the officers in the garrison he plans to invade. As they embark on a journey together, there develops a sexual tension between the two which comes to an explosive end together with the garrison under attack. Includes a musical score by Ennio Morricone."
