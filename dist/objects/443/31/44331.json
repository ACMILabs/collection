        "Tony Lockett's debut in 1983 showed a young kid with potential, someone who would go on to stand alongside football greats such as Coventry, Pratt, Coleman and Hudson. The path to glory was a slow, tumultuous, and public affair. He sustained serious injuries and made numerous tribunal appearances, his every move followed in the tabloids. Now retired, Plugger has an impressive statistical history which includes: tying the 1987 Brownlow Medal with John Platten, 1987 Club Best and Fairest, winner of the John Coleman Medal in 1987 with 117 goals, leading his club's goalkicking on six occasions - 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1990, representing Victoria three times, and passing Coventry's record to be the leading goal kicker of all time."
