        "In this exuberant song and dance remake of Lubitsch's 'Ninotchka', Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse team up as the leading couple. Ninotchka, a stern lady Communist (Charisse) comes to Paris to retrieve three wayward comrades (Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin, Joseph Buloff) and a Russian composer (George Tobias). Much to her surprise, she is seduced by the trappings of capitalism in the form of champagne, silk stockings and a suave American producer (Fred Astaire), all of which contradict her Communist sensibilities. Includes songs such as: \"Fated to be mated\", \"All of you\", \"The Ritz Rock and Roll\", \"Silk stockings\", \"Red blues\", \"Josephine\" and \"Stereophonic sound\". Music and lyrics by Cole Porter. Screenplay by Leonard Gershe and Leonard Spigelgass."
