        "Set between 1962 and 1974, \"Big Wednesday\" is the story of three surfing friends - Matt, Jack and Leroy. We see their loves, fights and the hero worship that follows them as they conquer the waves. The South Swell 1962: the three rule the waves. Together with their friends they get drunk, go on surfing holidays and have wild and destructive parties. As the years pass, the Vietnam War and growing up take their toll. They witness the changes in themselves, their home and friends. The Great Swell 1974: Matt, Jack and Leroy re-unite to brave one last journey together, to surf the great swell. \"Big Wednesday\" encapsulates the emotions of passing youth against the splendour of the sea and surfing. Includes a special appearance by surfing legend, \"Mr. Pipeline\", Jerry Lopez. Cast includes: William Katt, Gary Busey, Jan Michael Vincent, Patti D'Arbanville and Lee Purcell."
