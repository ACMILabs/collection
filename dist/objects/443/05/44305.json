        "Losing her job triggers a strange turn of events for Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) when she discovers two possibilities for her future. These possibilities are based on the sliding door which signifies whether she catches or misses the train home, and these two scenarios are followed in a parallel sequence. In the world in which she misses her train, Helen works hard at menial jobs to support herself and her unfaithful, writer boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch). In the world in which she catches the train, Helen discovers that getting over discovering Gerry's infidelity is not as bad as she thought when she begins a relationship with James (John Hannah). Through her happiness however comes unexpected confusion, as nothing is as it seems on the surface. Ultimately the two worlds coalesce, but only one man can accompany her into the future. Cast includes Jean Tripplehorn, Zara Turner and Douglas McFerran."
