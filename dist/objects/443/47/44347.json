        "There's a thin red line between the sane and the mad, or so goes the saying. These sentiments weigh heavily on Private Doll, facing the horrors of war for the first time. Having left behind his wife of just eight days, Doll is determined to do whatever it is required to stay alive and to maintain his sanity. As he battles Japanese soldiers however, he is also engaged in a battle with one of his own, a sadistic and tough Sergeant (Jack Warden), who is starkly contrasted to the thoughtful Doll. This explosive dramatization of the American assault on Guadalcanal in World War 2 is a thoughtful study on the effects of war on innocent and not so innocent minds, and the apparent meaninglessness of it all. Cast includes Keir Dullea and Jack Warden. Based on the novel by James Jones."
