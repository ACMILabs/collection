        "John, an imaginitive boy lives at a theme park with his aunt and uncle. After painting a third eye on his forehead, he uses his new organ of sight to gain small insights into the complex and confounding nature of human behaviour, fraught with contradictions between action and intention. Raises open-ended questions on human behaviour. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
