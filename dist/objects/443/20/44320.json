        "Presented by Genevieve Mooy, this video continues the story of the woman arrested for theft in Police Powers, Part 1. It tracks her progress through the legal system, focussing on her court preparation, the role of key figures in the case, including the solicitor, informant, magistrate and prosecutor, the interaction between these people during the trial, and the eventual sentencing of the defendant. Includes ten review questions at the end of the video. Please note: this tape was produced in co-operation with the NSW Police, so the law in other states and territories may differ substantially, although the basic elements are the same."
