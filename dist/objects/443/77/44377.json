        "The land at Rock Ridge is worth a fortune, but strictly off limits to outside investors as the townsfolk already own their land. The only option is to drive them out by sending in the roughest, leanest, toughest gang you can muster and appoint a sheriff (Little) who is ill equipped to deal with their arrival. The black sheriff realises that the situation is out of his control and calls on a professional, one of the jail's cons, who was also one of the fastest guns in the West. This is the overarching plot that serves as a vehicle for Mel Brook's lunatic brand of humour aimed at a cineliterate audience. Includes Madeline Kahn's Academy Award nomination performance in her Marlene Dietrich sendup. Cast includes Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Slim Pickens and David Huddleston. Screenplay by Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor and Alan Uger."
