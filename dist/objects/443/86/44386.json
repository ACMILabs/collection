        "Over half a million Canadian homes are using wood for heating. With the price of oil escalating, more people are converting to this traditional source of energy. In interviews with home owners and experts, advice is given about building regulations, insurance policies, maintenance procedures, and installation of efficient wood-burning units. The greatest potential for wood is in its combination with oil, gas, or electric back-up heating systems."
