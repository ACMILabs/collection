        "A ten year high school reunion in a snowbound town is the setting for this exploration of how men's lives are influenced by \"beautiful girls\". Piano playing Willie (Hutton), former heartthrob Tommy (Dillon), his girlfriend Sharon (Sorvino), and his lover Darian (Holly) all gather with long lost friends for reminiscing and advice about relationships. Out of the group of friends, only Willie has moved away from the small New England town and is pursuing a career as a piano player. He is at a crossroads in his life, contemplating giving up his career for girlfriend Tracy (Annabeth Gish). His feelings are complicated by the presence of a captivating young girl next door (Natalie Portman)."
