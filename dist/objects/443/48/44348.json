        "A stunning psychological drama from director Jane Campion, set against an extravagant European background of wealth and tradition. Isabel Archer (Nicole Kidman) challenges the confines of her sheltered destiny and is determined to break free and find true love. She encounters the seductive but deeply manipulative and emotionally abusive Gilbert Osmond (John Malkovich), and the shadowy Madame Merle (Barbara Hershey). Isabel is drawn into a web of betrayal and tragedy and an internal turmoil that her strength and sensitivity of character strives to awaken from. This is a sensitively crafted and ultimately uplifting film with a strong contemporary resonance."
