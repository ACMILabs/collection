        "Popular comic English television program \"Dad's army\", which ran for nine years, is about numerous men that comprise the local division of the Home Guard in the seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea during World War 2. The men are an eccentric lot who range in age from the very young to the decidedly doddery. In each episode the group muddle their way through a different situation in their own idiosyncratic way. This tape features five classic episodes featuring the fearless fighting force otherwise known as Walmington-on-Sea's Home Guard. \"The Day the balloon went up\": Captain Mainwaring's fearless team must bring down a stray barrage balloon, the only problem is the captain is about to take off on an aerial sightseeing tour of the English countryside. \"Sons of the sea\": Captain Mainwaring has the brilliant idea of river patrol. Things don't bode well for this new method of attack when the men find themselves drifting in the English Channel on a practice session. \"The Two and a half feathers\": apart from mothballs in the pickles and rationed toad-in-the-hole, a more important dilemma arises when new recruit, Mr George Clarke, ten years retired, accuses Lance Corporal Jones of abandoning him in the desert to die when they fought together in the Sudan. \"Asleep in the deep\": when a bomb falls on the local pumping station, efforts to rescue Privates Walker and Godfrey result in nearly the whole platoon being trapped with them. \"The Deadly attachment\": Captain Mainwaring's platoon comes face to face with the enemy when they are detailed to guard a captive U-boat crew."
