        "Alex Whitman is a high-flying New York yuppie sent by his company to open a nightclub in Las Vegas. It is a reluctant move for him, though once there, he meets the beautiful Mexican photographer, Isabel Fuentes. Though opposites in nearly every way, romantic sparks fly and the two have a passionate one night stand. Three months later, Isabel shows up pregnant with his child and every intention of keeping it. The two hastily marry in a Vegas chapel while an Elvis impersonator acts as the witness. A head-on collision of cultures ensues, prompting the contemplation of a break-up. A large family gathering, planned by Isabel, grows larger due to surprise family guests, thus creating a comedy of errors before the story draws to its predictable romantic close. Cast includes Matthew Perry, Salma Hayek, Jon Tenney, Carlos Gomez and Tomas Milian."
