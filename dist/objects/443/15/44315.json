        "Maurice Stubbs has a heavy heart, remorse and broken dreams consume him as someone or something is slowly killing the animals, disembowelling them in fact, around his secluded farm. His usual sense of total isolation is heightened by the inexplicable events that are occurring, and contradict the notion of an idyllic country existence. Maurice, along with his wife Ida and two other frightened residents, city fugitive Jacob and modern city girl Ronnie form an uneasy alliance in search of things they do not know, in places they should not be. For to confront the beast that seems to have no tangible existence is to confront their own internal demons. Based on the novel of the same name by Tim Winton. Cast includes Brenda Blethyn, Ray Barrett, Richard Roxburgh and Miranda Otto."
