        "Episode of Series \"Classic albums: the greatest records in rock history\". Jimi Hendrix's album \"Electric Ladyland\" is one of the classic rock albums of the 20th century. With songs like \"Voodoo Chile\", \"Crosstown Traffic\", \"Gypsy Eyes\", and \"All Along the Watchtower\", it has influenced countless rock guitarists. This documentary, part of the \"Classic Album\" series, examines both the recording process of the album as well as focusing on the life and legend of Jimi Hendrix. Examining each song on the album, the documentary intersperses interviews with Hendrix's friends and musicians who played on the album, with footage of Hendrix both playing and being interviewed, photos (including Linda McCartney's pictures for the album cover), and Hendrix's notes and journals as well as lots of amazing music. People interviewed include Chas Chandler, Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding, Buddy Miles, Dave Mason, Mike Finnigan, Steve Winwood and album engineer Eddie Krammer."
