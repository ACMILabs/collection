        "'Kids' is a shocking movie representing an underground youth culture of excess and liberty to the extreme in an inner-city urban habitat. The viewer is taken on a 24-hour urban jaunt, alluding to amoral grit and an excessive depiction of nihilistic youth as a sensationalized pseudo-documentary. The film focuses on freckled boy Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), whose idea of safe sex is to only have sex with virgins. His theory is disproven when a girl from one of his past unprotected passions tests positive to HIV. Cast includes Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly), Sarah Henderson (Girl #1), Justin Pierce (Casper) and Joseph Chan (Deli Owner). Written by Larry Clark, Leo Fitzpatrick and Jim Lewis. Peter Bici, Jeff Pang, Harold Hunter, and many others from the movie are professional skateboarders on the Zoo York team."
