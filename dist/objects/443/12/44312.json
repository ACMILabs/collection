        "A young man is accused of fatally stabbing his father, and his fate now lies in the hands of his \"peers\": 12 men from all walks of life, different backgrounds, who all bring their own agendas and prejudices with them. Is he innocent or guilty? Is there reasonable doubt? The tension mounts as each piece of evidence is examined again and again. This film provides the viewer with an insight into the American legal system and what may happen behind the scenes of any murder trial. This is an emotionally charged courtroom drama with a star studded cast including Courtney B Vance, Ossie Davis, George C Scott, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Dorian Harewood, James Gandolfini, Tony Danza, Jack Lemon, Hume Croyn, Mykelti Williamson, Edward James and Olmas William Peterson."
