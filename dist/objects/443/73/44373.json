        "Acclaimed Hong Kong action director John Woo has created a delirious mix of spectacular gun battles, furious explosions and breathtaking stunts. John Travolta plays driven but anguished FBI agent Sean Archer, who is using the full force of his anti-terrorist unit to track down the psychotic criminal Castor Troy, energetically played by Nicolas Cage. Thinking he has finally killed Castor in a spectacular airport shootout, Archer is horrified to discover that he is in fact alive but in a coma. Undergoing a radical face-swapping procedure, Archer assumes Castor's identity in an attempt to discover the Los Angeles location of a nerve gas bomb due to explode. When Castor awakens from his coma, he retaliates by infiltrating the real Archer's life and destroying any evidence of the identity switch. Archer is thrust into a nightmare, where he must fight for his life and his family. This cat and mouse thriller was written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary. Music by John Powell. Edited by Christian Wagner and Steven Kemper. Cinematography by Oliver Wood. Also stars Joan Allen, Alessandro Nivola, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain and Nick Cassavetes."
