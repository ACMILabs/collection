        "Charlton Heston and two other astronauts come out of deep hibernation to find that their ship has crashed. Escaping with little more than clothes, they find that they have landed on a planet where men are pre-lingual and uncivilized, while apes have learned speech and technology and use the primitive humans for experimentation and sport. Taylor (Heston) is captured and taken to the city of the apes after damaging his throat so that he is silent and cannot communicate with them. But with the help of a benevolent chimpanzee scientist (Roddy McDowall), Taylor escapes their leathery clutches only to be confronted by a chilling fate. Interesting Note: During breaks in filming, actors made up as different ape species tended to hang out together---apes with apes, orangutans with orangutans, chimps with chimps. It wasn't required, it just naturally happened. Includes 25 minutes \"Making Of\" program."
