        "Ryan O'Neal is the superstar getaway driver and Bruce Dern is the detective obsessed with capturing the speed maniac regardless of the costs. The Driver is well aware of the cop chasing him and leaves a tantalising trail of evidence in a game in which there can only be one victor. This film is notable for its high octane value, rather than a thoughtful character study with lots of dialogue. Cast also includes Isabelle Adjani as a gambler hired as an alibi for the driver."
