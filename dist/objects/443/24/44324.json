        "Two dance films based on productions conceived and performed by the Sydney Dance Company. \"A day in the life of a Darling cafe\" is the theme of 'Cafe' (62mins. 1995), written and choreographed by dancers Paul Mercurio and Kim Walker. The production resembles a mix between a serious dance work and a satirical cabaret piece and is a behind-the-froth study of cafe society. Music by Brett Cabot and Colin Newham. 'Boxes' (60mins. 1985) was conceived by Iva Davies, Bob Kretschmer and Graeme Murphy as a dance work which was first performed by the Sydney Dance Company and the band 'Icehouse' at the Sydney Opera House on November 7, 1985."
