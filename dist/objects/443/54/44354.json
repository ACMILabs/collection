        "The year is 1964, and the mini-skirt is in. Charlie Rogers is a coffee-house singer who joins a financially troubled carnival. He is hired by owner, Maggie Morgan, and soon catches the eye of his pretty female co-worker, Cathy Lean. Cathy's irate father, Joe, clashes with Charlie when he tries to romance his daughter, but Charlie's singing and looks helps bring in the much-needed money for the near-bankrupt carnival. Cast includes Elvis Presley, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Freeman and Leif Erickson."
