        "Teams of doctors, nurses, social workers and volunteers care for the terminally ill, focusing not on dying, but on the quality of life that remains. Time for Caring centres on the role of volunteers within the team at the palliative care unit of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, and provides information on their selection and training. While the film will be of particular interest to those who work in medical fields, the issues explored will surface in many working relationships involving volunteers, professionals and people in need. (Award: New York.)"
