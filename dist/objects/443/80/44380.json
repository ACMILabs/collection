        "Elvis plays a singing GI, stationed in West Germany who has plans for life after the Army; opening a nightclub back home. The only problem is that he's a bit short of cash and must take part in a wager to raise sufficient funds. The bet: he must melt the iceberg heart of a willowy cabaret dancer (Juliet Prowse). Complications arise when he begins to fall for her, and trouble can only ensue when she discovers the bet. Features the following songs: \"GI Blues\", \"Tonight is so right for love\", \"Wooden heart\" and \"Blue suede shoes\". Cast includes Elvis Presley, Juliet Prowse, Robert Ives and Leticia Roman."
