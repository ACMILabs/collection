        "This fascinating, fragmented and complex drama eschews traditional narrative structure to present an intellectually challenging, feminist adaptation of Louise Kaplan's book \"Female Perversions: the Temptations of Emma Bovary.\" The film centres on Eve, a talented lawyer who has just won a case against a disreputable business magnate. However, anticipating a meeting with the governor regarding her aspirations to become a judge brings to the surface insecurities and anxieties. She compensates for her lack of self-esteem by relying more and more on her captivating looks, and by buying expensive lingerie and make-up. Just as Eve is facing the highest point in her life, Madelyn, her unstable sister, is experiencing her lowest when she is arrested for shoplifting. When an incident from their childhood resurfaces, both sisters must confront their painful issues and find some sense of control in their lives. Cast includes: Tilda Swinton, Amy Madigan, Karen Sillas, Laila Robins and Clancy Brown."
