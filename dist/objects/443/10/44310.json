        "'Microcosmos' is a visually spectacular exploration of a hidden world as vast as our own. Marvel at the lush colour and clarity of the images presented; dew glittering on a spider's web, a riot of red poppies bursting open, an undulating parade of caterpillars, a cocoon splitting to release a butterfly, the deadly embrace of a carnivorous plant. Track the movements of a bee as it courts a flower, or experience the collective terror of a nest of ants as they face a hungry predator. This film is an anthropological metaphor for human evolution, constantly juxtaposing our world with that of the microcosmos. Fifteen years of research, two years of equipment design and three years of filming were required to bring this film to life."
