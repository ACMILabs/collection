        "A mid-winter romantic feature filmed in Montreal, although the story could take place in any city where those young people live who have left their parents' homes but still have not made homes of their own. Ernie's alienation is far more extreme than most. For him life is a game, not because he chooses to make it so, but because he is unable to make anything more of it. But for those who befriend him and eventually turn him loose again, his game is not enough. (Awards: Toronto; Barcelona.) Cast: Jackie Burroughs, Anna Cameron, Leonard Cohen, Corinne Copnick, Roland D'Amour, Judith Gault, Alexis Kanner, Derek May, Louis Negin."
