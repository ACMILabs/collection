        "This film demonstrates a new style of excavation used for archaeological work at the Draper site north of Toronto where there are remains of a large Huron village. With financial support from Transport Canada and the Archaeological Surveys of Canada, all the findings were fed into a computer, resulting in far more comprehensive information than would have been the case under the old system. Voice and narration: William D. Finlayson. (Award: Verona.)"
