        "A non-stop comedy adventure starring Rick Moranis as a preoccupied inventor who has created an electro-magnetic shrinking machine that is accidentally activated and shrinks his children to a minuscule size. After they are caught in the garbage and thrown outside, a visually innovative action packed adventure ensues as the children journey through their backyard and encounter attacking insects, a runaway lawnmower, and swooping bees along the way. A fun and heartwarming family film it is also preceded by a Roger Rabbit short adventure involving Baby Herman and a little medical mayhem in \"Tummy Trouble\". Cast also includes Matt Frewer, Marcia Strassman, Kristine Sutherland, Thomas Brown, Jared Rushton."
