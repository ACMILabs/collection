        "Basquiat chronicles the rise to artistic stardom of Jean Michel Basquiat, who in 1981, catapulted from being an unknown graffiti writer to one of the most successful and controversial artists in New York. Embraced by Andy Warhol, Basquiat degenerated into the party lifestyle and heavy drug use, never ceasing to detest the rich who, in his mind, did not really accept him for who or what he was. Cast includes Jeffrey Wright, Benicio del Toro, Michael Wincott, Claire Forlani, Dennis Hopper, David Bowie, Gary Oldman and Courtney Love."
