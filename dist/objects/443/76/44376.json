        "Based on the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray, Kubrick's film portrays the rise and fall, in eighteenth century Ireland and England, of Barry Lyndon - an adventurer-gambler, a cad and a romantic idealist. The film follows Lyndon from his humble Irish heritage, through his ambitious and manipulative exploits to gain favour and power in the high echelons of society and then to his eventual rejection by, and resulting demise at the hands of the overtly hierarchical society he idealised. Kubrick departs from Thackeray's picaresque novel in both scope and tone, replacing the first person narration of the novel with that of the third person, adding to a sense of detachment and abstraction. Meticulously designed and crafted with period detail and lit entirely by natural light in both interior and exterior settings, this film evokes a subtle yet striking sense and critique of the cultural rituals and trappings that pervaded eighteenth century life and its impact on human identity and values. (Awards: Best Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Adaptation. British Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Cinematography)"
