        "Sheriff John T. Chance arrests a gunslinger for a brutal murder. However, the outlaw's brother is the most powerful rancher on the border and his desperadoes surround Rio Bravo so that Chance can't get his prisoner out and the U.S. Marshall can't get in. Hired gunmen slip silently into the little town, waiting for a chance to strike. This classic western combines the talents of John Wayne and Dean Martin with the much acclaimed skill of Howard Hawks."
