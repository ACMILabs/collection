        "Arguably one of Hitchcock's greatest films, \"Vertigo\" is a tense and riveting film about obsession, desire and betrayal. James Stewart plays a cop, with a fear of heights, who is hired to keep an eye on the wife (Kim Novak) of an old friend. He falls in love with her and her tragic death haunts him until he meets another woman who reminds him of her. His obsession with remodelling his new love into the image of the dead woman leads him further and further into a sinister nightmare world in which nothing and no-one is who they seem. With Barbara Bel Geddes and ravishing production credits, \"Vertigo\" is based on \"D'Entre les Mortes\" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. This fully restored and remastered version of Hitchcock's classic contains a restoration trailer and revealing documentary footage."
