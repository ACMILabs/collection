        "This short dramatic film about a young boy torn between conflicting loyalties is resolved with humor and wisdom. Sunday, two o'clock, is zero hour for Gaston. He must be in two places at once: performing at a music recital and playing hockey with his teammates. The game is won, and Gaston plays his piece in his hockey outfit. The well-developed script touches on obedience, loyalty, and the art of compromise. Cast: Mireille Bienvenu, Claude Jolicoeur, Monique Larocque, Andre Poirier."
