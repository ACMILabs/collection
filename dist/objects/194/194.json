    "description": [
        "'L'Arrivee' is Tscherkassky's second homage to the Lumiere-brothers. First you see the arrival of the film itself, which shows the arrival of a train at a station. But that train collides with a second train, causing a violent crash, which leads us to an unexpected third arrival, the arrival of a beautiful woman, the happy-end.  Reduced to two minutes, 'L'Arrivee' gives a brief, but exact summary of what cinematography (after its arrival with Lumieres train) has made into an enduring presence of our visual environment: violence, emotions. Or, as an anonymous American housewife (cited by T. W. Adorno) used to describe Hollywood's version of life: 'Getting into trouble and out of it again.'"
