        "Arthur Negus and Hugh Scully tell the fascinating story of English furniture from the late 18th century to the present day. They demonstrate the all-important points of design and detail which make it easier to date furniture, and to tell the difference between the original and the fake or copy. Part 2 of this two part program consists of 3 segments: Robert Adam; Elegance and Unity; Victorian."
