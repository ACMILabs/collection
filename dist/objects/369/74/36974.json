        "Episode number 11 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". This episode covers a period of history from 1250-1500 that resulted in dramatic changes in Europe. Major conflicts continued as different countries struggled for power, and, although it was a time of great exploration and development, it was also a time of great disaster, with overpopulation, famine and plague sweeping across the continent. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
