        "This is a companion film for use with the film \"Despotism\". It gives a short abstract treatment of the meaning of the word, \"democracy\", showing that two of the historical conditions essential for the existence of democracy are a balanced economic distribution and an enlightened population, which in turn produce two of the abstract characteristics of democracy - shared respect and shared power."
