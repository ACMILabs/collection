        "Episode number 15 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". This episode covers the history of Africa over the period 100-1500AD. Before the 15th Century, Africa was a rich continent of civilisations and empires, and the Nile was the lifeblood of the people. By AD 1000, Islam had the whole of North Africa in its grasp. To the Europeans, Africa was known as \"the Dark Continent\", and by the 18th century they were transporting people from Africa for the slave trade. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
