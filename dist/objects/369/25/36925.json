        "This innovative documentary looks at the creation of the largest scale holographic project ever undertaken. Paula Dawson, the creator, is one of the world's leading holographic artists and an important pioneer in this field. Inspired partly by Vladimir Nabokov's book \"Transparent things\", this work \" To absent friends\" uses the central theme of memory through objects and allows the viewer to stand outside time and reflect on the past, or mirror. Paula's installation was selected as one of forty works shown at Artec'89, a high tech international art exhibition and competition, the first international Biennale in Nagoya, Japan. The three main holograms were exhibited and went on to become joint winners of the Grand Prix '89. This film presents the only opportunity to view the entire installation and to meet the artist who created it."
