        "Alzheimer's disease is very common, mysterious and fatal. This film follows the course of the disease from diagnosis to death. It looks at the subtle, early signs of Alzheimer's disease and the slow loss of language, memory and skills. It looks at what is known about its causes, current treatments and where the hopes for a cure lie."
