        "While Queen Victoria prepares to celebrate her Golden Jubilee, the Forsytes' fortunes continue to fluctuate. Ann, the eldest of the family, dies, and Jo's appearance at her funeral marks a great improvement in relations with his father. Soames commissions June's fiancee, Philip Bosinney to build a house outside London, though it becomes increasingly clear that Soames' wife, Irene and the young architect are passionately in love. Gossip flies, and finally reaches Soames himself."
