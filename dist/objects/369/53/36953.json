        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Disappearing world\". The men and women of the Mehinacu, in central Brazil, live harmoniously in the five family houses of their small village, but conflict and separation of the sexes is an everyday fact of life - with the men and women performing distinctly different roles and tasks in order to thrive together. This film is a record of the elaborate rituals that take a month to complete, and are central to the Mehinacu way of life - a unique and colourful system of custom and taboo that may not survive the modern world."
