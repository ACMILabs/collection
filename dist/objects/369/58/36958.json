        "One of the most delightful films ever made about Mozart, \"Noi Tre\" is also a delicate and touching study of the last moments of childhood, as the 14 year old prodigy spends summer with his father on Count Pallavicini's estate preparing for an important exam at the Bologna Philharmonic Academy. However, in between his studies he falls in with the local boys of his own age, and also feels the first stirring's of love for Antonia, a girl from a nearby villa. Tasting for the first time, the life of a normal 14 year old, Mozart decides to fail the exam."
