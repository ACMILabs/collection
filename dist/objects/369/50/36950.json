        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Disappearing world\". In the West Highlands of Papua New Guinea there are many tribes. One of them is the Kawelka. The most prominent leader or 'big man' of the Kawelka tribe is called Ongka. For five years the Kawelka, driven on by Ongka, have been struggling to assemble a huge gift (a Moka) to give to a neighbouring tribe. For Ongka, assembling and giving this gift is more important than anything in his life. But when a big man dies suddenly in Ongka's enemy tribe things start to go wrong."
