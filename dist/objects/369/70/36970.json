        "Episode number 7 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". The end of civilisation, the period AD 100 - 600, was brought about by the dramatic collapse of the Roman Empire which led to the Dark Ages. During this period, land routes were developed as a result of constant invasion and these were followed by the development of sea routes. Gold and silver were introduced as the exchange rates of the times, and tax was introduced. The epidemic known as the plague, which had started in China, swept across Europe devastating the population. By the year 600 a turning point in history had been reached. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
