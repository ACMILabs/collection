        "Autumn arrives, and the fog swirls malevolently around the streets of London. Soames' marriage to Irene reaches breaking point as he sues her lover, Bosinney, over the country house he has built for him. After Bosinney's death, June persuades her grandfather, Jolyon to buy the house from Soames, and there he prepares to live out his days together with his family. But while Jo, Helene and June are in Spain, Jolyon has a visitor, who then becomes a regular guest and companion through that last, peaceful summer."
