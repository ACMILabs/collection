        "From all over the world thousands of affluent and educated seekers flock to the Rajneesh's ashram in Poona, India. We gain access to the Rajneesh and to the exotic private and public lifestyles that have earned him headlines around the world. The documentary also provides intimate portraits of some of the disciples around Rajneesh, including a young American actor, a former CIA agent, a German princess, a young Australian and Rajneesh's personal dentist."
