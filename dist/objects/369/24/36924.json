        "Ann cleans for a living. She shares everything she has with her two moody children and her equally erratic neighbours but she also shares everything her rich and constantly out-of-town employers have. When Ann's not sorting out the lives of her family and friends, she's thinking about her father's property in the country and how nice it would be to live there. Only one little international mining company stands in her way. But Ann, used to beating the system in her own quiet way, is not about to let that spoil her plans. The dry, quirky style of this wonderfully honest film portrays Australian life in a refreshingly unfashionable way. Based on the short story by Elizabeth Jolley."
