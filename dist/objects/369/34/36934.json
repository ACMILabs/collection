        "Lazarev is a German soldier who is captured by a young and raw Russian partisan. Lazarev is himself Russian and had enlisted in the German forces when they had over-run his land. Lazarev's initial test of loyalty comes when he is able to trick some German offices and overpower them. Finally his trial of loyalty is put to one supreme test when he is asked to lead a group attempting to hijack a train."
