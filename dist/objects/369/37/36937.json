        "Tanya is a brilliant gymnast. Selected while still a small child to be given the training needed to be an international champion, she grows up in an atmosphere of tense and unfriendly rivalry, arrogance and a desire to win at all costs. Disaster strikes at the age of fourteen when an injury brings her career to an end and she is shunted off into the normal world. A controversial and powerful drama about the Soviet system of making and breaking sporting champions. Based on a story by Igor Ageev."
