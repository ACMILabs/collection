        "Episode of Series \"Hidden India Series\". It has only been in the past decade or so that many Indian women have taken a definite step towards \"Liberation\" but despite the fact that a few women have played major roles in government these ladies are few in number, considering the population. The majority are still treated as inferiors, and appear to be completely self-effacing. This modern day 'modesty' seems an anachronism considering the role love and equality have played in the history and culture of this exotic land. This film explores the folklore and mythology of love in India."
