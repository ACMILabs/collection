        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". The first agricultural Revolution (8,000 BC - 5,000 BC) began with the change in climatic conditions. Man began to cultivate the land rather than hunt and fish. Wheat, barley, maize and potato, once growing wild, were cultivated, and animals were domesticated so that man became tied to the land and began leading a more sedentary life. In time, village life began to exist and the birth of civilisation had begun. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
