        "Horses were brought to Australia 200 years ago as servants and loyal friends. Having served faithfully in work and war, they were turned loose. They ran wild, were named \"Brumby\" and branded outlaws. This wild, beautiful and noble animal is a threat to the natural environment. Brumbies are mustered and shot from helicopters, and this film contains scenes of shootings. However, the greatest killer of brumbies is drought - but they are as wild as the land in which they live, and they have a strong instinct to survive. Narrated by Bryan Brown."
