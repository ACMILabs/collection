        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". This episode looks at the origins of mankind; where we come from, and how we differ from other forms of life on earth. It traces our descent from apes in trees, to land apes who stood erect, to our large brain development 500,000 years ago. Since that time no brain development has occurred, only changes in appearance to suit the different climates that existed after the ice-age. 10,000 years ago humans reached a social and cultural level which put them far above other animal life. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
