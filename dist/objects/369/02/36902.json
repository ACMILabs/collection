        "As the century approaches its end, so do the lives of the more senior Forsytes. Jo's wife, Helene, dies from a fall, before madness destroys her mind, and Jo himself begins to see more of Irene. Soames, meanwhile, desperate for an heir, wants a divorce from Irene and his sister, Winifred, seeks the same from her husband, after he elopes with a Spanish dancer. The lives of a new generation of Forsytes start to take shape, but the recurring conflicts of love and personal animosity carry their bittersweet legacies uncompromisingly towards the twentieth century."
