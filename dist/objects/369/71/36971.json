        "Episode number 8 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". This episode looks at the development of Islam over the period AD 600 - 1200. In the 6th century, a Prophet called Mohamed was born in Mecca and later travelled to Medina where he established the first Muslim state and built the first mosque. By the 9th century, Muslims had established a house of science in Baghdad, and during the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries Islamic art and culture evolved. There are now over 600 million Muslims, accounting for 1/7 of the total population of the world. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
