        "A brilliant film version of a play on the life and death of Mozart, filmed in Prague and boasting one of the most literate film scripts of the 1980s. The story revolves around the unpleasant rivalry between Salieri and Mozart - musical mediocrity and genius respectively. Based on the play by Peter Shaffer. Cast includes Tom Hulce as Mozart and F. Murray Abraham as Salieri."
