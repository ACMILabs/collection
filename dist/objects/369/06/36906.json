        "The Great War has left Europe tottering on an economic precipice, and Soames, now on the board of a large insurance company, is nervous about its foreign investments. Fleur's flirtation with the despairing Wilfred Desert ends and she finds herself expecting Michael's child, much to her father's satisfaction. Michael, meanwhile, pricked by his burgeoning social conscience, attempts to help a struggling former employee. But this plan backfires and the result brings only anger and shame to the man he seeks to benefit."
