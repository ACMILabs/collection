        "An epic journey from a turbulent chapter in Australia's past, 'Burke and Wills' is the story of the explorers Burke and Wills' expedition across the Australian continent in 1860. Jack Thompson is Robert O'Hara Burke, a strong Irishman obsessed with the desire to 'write the map'; Nigel Havers is William John Wills, the archetypal Victorian gentleman explorer.  The film explores the changing relationship between the two men as they struggle with the harsh Australian environment they are attempting to chart."
