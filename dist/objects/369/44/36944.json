        "Episode number 17 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". This episode examines the period of European history covering 1453 - 1700. At this time, Europe was no longer threatened by invading Turkey, and in the 16th and 17th century, North Western Europe became the dominant region. The 16th century brought change, evolution and expansion to agriculture, trade, painting, military, religion and science. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
