        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". Greece and Rome (1,200 BC - AD 200). Civilisation came late to Europe but the ancient worlds of Greece and Rome established traditions that we still follow today. Greece brought us democracy, government by the people for the people, as well as the first great philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians. Rome, slower to develop than Greece, inherited Greece's Hellenistic ideals. It had a great military power, and with Julius Caesar as its Emperor, controlled vast areas of Europe and Asia. Rome gave us the Latin language, and developed a legal system which provided the basis of Western law. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
