        "Swing time was the sixth film made by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers together. The story is slight, but quite delightful, bringing Fred and Ginger together, then keeping them apart until the last time we hear \"A fine romance\". Astaire plays a dancer out of work, and Rogers is a dancing teacher - he pretends that he cannot dance so that he may be taught by Rogers."
