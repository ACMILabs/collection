        "A documentary style drama depicting the life and times of one of Australia's greatest explorers. Matthew Flinders was the first man to circumnavigate the vast island continent known in the 18th century as New Holland. However few people are aware that he was also the first person to formally name it Australia. This is not simply a story of an extraordinary man's courage and perseverance throughout a series of arduous voyages, but a romantic adventure fraught with all the inevitable dangers and excitement of conquering an untamed land. Narrated by Edward Woodward."
