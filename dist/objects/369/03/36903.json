        "So the feud goes on into the third generation, says Jo, as one century makes way for another. The Boer War draws the younger Forsytes into its web - Jo's son Jolly and Val Dartie enlist for the army, their dislike for each other growing in intensity; while June and Holly also volunteer as nurses, though each for different reasons. Jo's blossoming liaison with Irene gives Soames the evidence for a divorce, and as the old queen ends her days, marriages, births and deaths continue to shape the destiny of the Forsyte family."
