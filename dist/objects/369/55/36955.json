        "A film study of a newspaper boy in the crowded inner city, which provides substance for discussion of the city environment which can breed cynicism and delinquency in the young. Apartment buildings, rooming houses and dilapidated dwellings are the boy's route, and his world a rundown flat and a rough spoken father. At some doors he tosses his papers with neat precision, at others will deliberate carelessness. Behind his actions you sense his resentment and anger, and at the same time a reaching out for warmth."
