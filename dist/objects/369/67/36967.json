        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". The age of iron (2,000 BC - AD 200) conjures images of a truly epic story. Iron became an increasingly important element of an industry which has lasted almost to the present day. Iron was first discovered by India, later by China and Africa, and has been the sinew of industry until steel, electricity and oil took over. This program shows the different techniques used for smelting iron, 3500 years ago until the present. Iron was the turning point in history industrially and in many other areas. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
