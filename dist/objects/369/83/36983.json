        "Explores the work of one of architecture's greatest innovators. Using Gaudi's credo \"originality is a return to the origin\" as a guideline, shows how the architect's highly personal sense of space evolved from the Mediterranean forms he knew so well. Starting with the Casa Vicens (1878) we follow the major developments in his career. In each building Gaudi's flamboyant use of colour and unusual structural devices are fully discussed."
