        "Episode number 25 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". From the 1930's depression came the rise of political leaders/ radicals. One such person was Adolf Hitler, who created a re-armed Germany. With this power Hitler conquered countries, including Poland. Britain and France declared war on Germany, and Japan bombed Pearl Harbour. America, Britain and Russia became allies - their strategy was firstly to fight Germany and then to fight Japan. The war period saw the creation of military machines and the invention of the atomic bomb, which was later to be used on Japan."
