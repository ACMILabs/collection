        "Episode number 23 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". From 1870 onwards the world changed with great speed. The British Empire took over a quarter of the world's surface. Food prices, due to improved transportations had lowered, turning the peoples' expenditures to entertainment rather than sustenance. Technology and invention were abundant; so too were towns and cities. The 1890's saw the build up of military forces with advancements in weapons and ships. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
