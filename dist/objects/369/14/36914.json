        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Disappearing world\". The Wodaabe are among the world's last true nomads. They follow their herds in an endless migration across African borders. They have no houses, no huts and no tents. They live and sleep under the skies. Although droughts have ravaged their lands since the 1960's, anthropologist Mette Bovin sees their life as a balance between hardship and joy. They have an obsession with male beauty and Wodaabe men wear more make-up than Wodaabe women. \"We like to see people who are handsome\" says one. The Wodaabe insist they will remain nomads despite mounting pressures for them to settle down and lead a \"normal\" life."
