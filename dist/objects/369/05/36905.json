        "Although the 1920s herald a new age in politics and culture, for the Forsytes, as Soames tells Fleur, \"the present is rooted in the past, the future in both\". Fleur and Jon's relationship is destroyed by the bitter family feud that still lingers on, driving Fleur to a marriage with the socially conscious Michael Mont, and Jon to America after his father's death. But the emergence of Mont's best friend, Wilfred Desert, as a threat to their happiness brings the echo of past passions to the story once more."
