        "Episode number 13 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". This episode covers Chinese and Japanese history over the period 1279 - 1644. It looks at Chinese civilisation under the Mongols from 1234 - 1367, followed by the rise and fall of the Ming Dynasty over the period 1368 - 1644. Aspects of Feudal Japanese civilisation are examined; and this episode also looks at the arrival of the first European travellers, in the 16th Century, bringing Christianity and firearms with them. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
