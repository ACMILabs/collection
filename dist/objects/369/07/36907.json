        "The fast-changing '20s go galloping on, and the economy worsens as society trips carelessly through its soirees and fashions. A scandal at the insurance company causes Soames to resign from the board in a flurry of anger, and although a birth brings celebration and reconciliation to the family, scandal of another kind is brewing for them. While, in America, romance stirs again for Jon, and there is the hint that not all the wounds of past love have been healed by time."
