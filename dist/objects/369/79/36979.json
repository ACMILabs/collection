        "Episode number 24 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". This episode examines the end of a period of European history, and the emergence of prosperity for the United States of America over the years 1914-1929. In 1914, European civilisation dominated the world, with Britain and France the major players, and Germany and Italy eager to replace them. This was the time of World War I, and by 1919, Europe was reshaped. The decade following, however, was one of immense prosperity for the United States of America. Based on The Times atlas of world history."
