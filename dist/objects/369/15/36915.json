        "Berlin is at boiling point! Money is worthless and fear rules! Through the chaotic madness two people battle to keep their sanity... but what they uncover is far more dangerous than degradation and starvation...the human guinea pigs who risk insanity and death for a square meal. Starring Liv Ullman, David Carradine and James Whitmore."
