        "Arthur Negus and Hugh Scully tell the fascinating story of English furniture from its very beginnings to the 18th century. They demonstrate the all-important points of design and detail which make it easier to date furniture and to tell the difference between the original and the fake or copy. Part one of this two part program consists of 4 segments: Medieval and Elizabethan; Jacobean and Restoration; William and Mary; Queen Anne and Early Georgian."
