        "Obstacles in the life of a nun's community high in the Himalayas range from a cynical British agent, suspicious natives, longings of the flesh, problems of faith and insanity to the arduous surrounding terrain. The mission prospers, but often at the expense of spiritual progress and although the nuns eventually retreat from the mission and the threatening terrain it is with a sense of having achieved some small spiritual gains. \"One of the few genuinely erotic films to emerge from these sexually staid isles\" said one critic. The glorious Oscar winning photography was a trick because it was shot in a London studio and backyard garden. The title refers to the intoxicating perfume worn by Indian Prince Sabu in his last major role. Based on the novel by Rumer Godden. Stars Deborah Kerr, David Farrar, Sabu, Jean Simmons, Flora Robson and Esmond Knight."
