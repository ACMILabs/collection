        "Ancient Australia is often seen as a land of stagnation and the early Australians were depicted as one of the most primitive peoples on earth. However, this program examines how the long Aboriginal occupation of Australia witnessed spectacular changes. Generations of Aborigines saw the great rising of the seas which isolated Australia; they saw, and probably influenced, sweeping changes in vegetation and wildlife. The Aborigines created a lifestyle which suited their environment. They were skilled herbalists and master trappers and hunters. Their nomadic wanderings followed a logical pattern, reflecting their forethought and knowledge of the land. Narrated by Geoffrey Blainey."
