        "Since her husband's death ten years ago the Queen has been mournful, reclusive and obsessed with her own death. She offers refuge for three days to a man who attempts to kill her: she warns him ' If you do not kill me, I'll kill you'. However, he bears a ghost-like resemblance to the dead king and quickly her passion and love for life is rekindled. The final twist in this remarkable picture will leave you drenched with compassion and only then will you know the mystery of Oberwald. From the play by Jean Cocteau."
