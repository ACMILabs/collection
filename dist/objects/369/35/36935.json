        "This is an atmospheric adaptation by Horton Foote of Harper Lee's sensitive novel. Told in retrospect, it successfully tackles the themes of racial prejudice in America's Deep South with the gradual maturing of compassion and social insight in children. Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, the soft spoken, small town, Alabama lawyer given the responsibility of defending Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly accused of rape. This is perfectly balanced with Finch as the family man who has the added responsibility of bringing up two motherless children, magically played by Mary Badham and Phillip Afford. (Awards: Winner of three Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Gregory Peck)"
