        "Episode of Series \"Hidden India Series\". Mark Twain described India as, \"the one land that all men desire to see and having seen once, even a glimpse, would not give that glimpse for all the shows of the rest of the globe combined\". This video explores many of the familiar and not so familiar monuments of hidden India. They range from massive carvings to mind-boggling man made temples."
