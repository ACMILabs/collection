        "It was the outback's greatest day! A big mob of cattlemen, shearers, stockmen and women gathered together to give Her Majesty the Queen a great Aussie welcome. We look at the lives of these descendants of the outback pioneers and catch the spirit of the Australian bush. Country people devoted a lot of hard yakka to make the opening of the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame a big success. This warm and affectionate view of their lives and this great occasion is a tribute to the enduring spirit of outback adventure."
