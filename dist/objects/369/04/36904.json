        "It is now 1918, and the Great war has shaken out the last vestiges of Victorian England. In the Forsyte family, nearly all the older generation are dead, and among the younger members a new love burns, rekindling bitter old feuds. Oblivious to the enduring resentment harboured by their parents, Jon and Fleur meet by chance and fall in love. But the reluctance of Jo, Irene and Soames to reveal the truth of the past to their children makes them all the more determined to discover it."
