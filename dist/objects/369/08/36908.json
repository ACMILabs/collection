        "Britain's first labour government falls and Michael Mont is returned to Parliament as a Conservative MP devoted to a radical new school of political thought. The libel suit against Fleur culminates in a dramatic courtroom climax, the result of which sends Fleur and Soames on a trip around the world. When they return, the General Strike is about to erupt. The country is thrown into chaos, and the Forsytes' are confronted with painful reminders of earlier emotions as Fleur and Jon meet for the first time in over six years."
