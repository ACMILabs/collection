        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Disappearing world\". Episode 4 of this five part series looks at the story of the people of the Lau Lagoon. 600 years ago in the Solomon Islands, the Lau people abandoned the hills of Malaita to start a new life, incredibly, by constructing small coral islands in the idyllic Pacific lagoon below. Today most of the 60 island communities in the Lau Lagoon have come under Christian missionary influence which has transformed their entire system of beliefs and values and replaced the original \"life of custom\". This program shows the villagers taking positive steps to revive their dying traditions."
