        "We all use electricity in our everyday lives. The Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Scheme can produce essential peak load for all of New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory within minutes, and water to the Murray and Murrumbidgee irrigation system. \"The power of water\" looks at the workings and history of the Snowy Mountains Scheme from the early years of construction through to the most recent technological developments. A comprehensive guide on the Scheme introduces the processes which allow Australia's greatest engineering project to produce a valuable and efficient form of energy - power from water."
