        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Disappearing world\". This program shows a warrior society committed to their own social and cultural identity - using war clubs, wearing elaborate head-dresses and painting their bodies. In 1987, the Kayapo, Indians of Brazil, South America, rallied other Indians to attend a great reunification of the tribes at Altamira - the proposed site of a massive hydro-electric dam that will flood large parts of the Xingu Valley. The behind-the-scenes drama is followed before this large event."
