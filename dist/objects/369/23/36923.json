        "Episode of Series \"Hidden India Series\". India is synonymous with mysticism and this film goes on to explore the many incredible facets of this way of life - and death. Many people from around the world are flocking to India, not as tourists, not to see the might and majesty (of breathtaking architecture that is)... They come to find themselves through the teachings of the gurus, the powerful holy men. Might and majesty in the guise of mysticism has returned to India."
