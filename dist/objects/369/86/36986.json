        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Shock of the New Series\". Part 4 of an 8-part series which presents a social history of the impact and development of the visual arts in the 20th century, by art critic and writer Robert Hughes. In each episode, Hughes examines the forces which monitored the directions painting, architecture and photography took from the late 1800's to the present. In this episode the concept of 'ideal modernity' in the sphere of 20th century architecture is explored. Examines the result of attempts by architects to create an ideal society which arose out of a desire to remake the world."
