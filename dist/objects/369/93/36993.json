        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Shock of the New Series\". Part 2 of an 8-part series which presents a social history of the impact and development of the visual arts in the 20th century by art critic and writer, Robert Hughes. In this episode Hughes examines how World War I and politics influenced art by way of the development of Dadaism in Germany and Constructivism in Russia. He also explores how architecture moved from modernism to a more classical style as a result of preferences displayed by Hitler and Mussolini."
