        "Maitland and its sleepy neighbour, Morpeth, are never quite the same again, all due to a middle-aged couple and their hobby of violin playing. This animated film is a delight to both eye and ear. Victoria Robert's quirky cartoons are perfect complements for Nick Enright's cleverly constructed poem, while Ruth Cracknell's reading of all parts adds wit and charm. An animated film by Jollification."
