        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The World: A Television History\". 600 BC - AD 500 was a time when early humans believed that the natural world was one of spirits, and these were later to be replaced by Gods. Early religion was restricted to local cults, with individual tribes and groups worshipping their own gods. Hinduism developed, and is today the religion of 400 million Indians. Buddhism emerged within the context of Hinduism, and was later to become one of the greatest missionary religions which spread rapidly to different parts of the world."
