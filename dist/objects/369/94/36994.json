        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Shock of the New Series\". Part 3 of the 8-part series presented by art critic and writer Robert Hughes. In this episode, Hughes explores how the Mediterranean, seen by artists and the aristocracy as very much a vision of Eden, gave rise to the art of pleasure, in particular Fauvism and Impressionism. Rare archival footage of Picasso and Matisse at work is included."
