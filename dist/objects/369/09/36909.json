        "In Japan today everyone is looking for ways to increase their wealth and assets, but the Kimura family is particularly determined - in fact it is abnormally determined - to accumulate wealth. They don't want a palatial mansion, they have no outstanding loans and they are not planning to travel abroad. They just love money so much that they work day and night for even the smallest amounts. And of course nothing is allowed to go to waste."
