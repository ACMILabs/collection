        "While Michael busies himself with promoting a slum-clearance scheme, Fleur's restlessness is further stirred by repeated meetings with Jon... not all of them by chance. Even Soames is persuaded to join Michael's scheme, and Fleur seeks to quell her growing discontent by opening a rest home for factory girls. But, like Fleur, the past will not rest.\" Nothing really changes,\" she tells Jon."
