        "Based on travel to Italy, Holland, and around the United States, Unguarded Moments records a series of visual phenomena created physically when nature and technology collide. Repetitive images of the Lubavitcher rebbe, trains, swans, and human gestures combine as a series of sound and movement experiments, as well as social observations, using low-end video and computer processing systems."
