        "Chabrol has called this sinister psycho-drama revolving around issues of class conflict and familial discontent \"the last Marxist film\". Based on the novel 'A Judgement in Stone' by Ruth Rendell the film centres on a wealthy liberal couple living in rural Brittany who employ Sophie, a taciturn young woman, as a live-in maid. Initially satisfied with her work they become disapproving when she forms a close bond with the irreverent local postmistress. Their strange friendship and increasingly odd antics make the family increasingly suspicious of Sophie and when they finally reject her, the two friends exact a chilling revenge. This film is widely considered to mark Chabrol's return to form as a director of thrillers. Cast includes Isabelle Huppert, Sandrine Bonnaire, Jacqeline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Cassel."
