        "The Life of birds, another nature series from the inimitable Attenborough, uncovers new research into the behaviour of birds, secrets of their success, strategies for finding food, complex social systems, and extraordinary ways of breeding and mating. Episodes 7-10 \"Finding partners\": Features the bizarre and beautiful copulating rituals of birds, whilst examining the processes of attracting and keeping a mate. \"The Demands of the egg\": As birds lay outside their body, the survival of the young depends on the parents' protection of the precious eggs. Also covers the subject of creating a nest. \"The problems of parenthood\": Raising a baby requires the adult bird to utilise a variety of skills to satiate voracious appetites. \"The Limits of endurance\": In a constantly changing world, birds must repeatedly alter their patterns to survive nature, man and evolution. This series combines cinematography shot in nature with slow motion and computer-enhanced special effects that allows viewers to observe bird behaviour on a minute level. Attenborough and his crew visited 42 countries to create this magnificent series."
