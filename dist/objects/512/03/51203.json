        "A fast paced, campy remake of the original 1936 Flash Gordon serial (315687) replete with a fierce rock score by Queen. An unseen force from outer space is causing all sorts of freak meteorological events. Flash (Sam Jones), quarterback of the New York Jets, and reporter Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) become reluctant passengers to outer-space when Zarkov (Topol), a discredited NASA scientist believes the Earth is being invaded by hostile aliens. Soon all are bound for the Planet Mongo, hurtling through a convenient Black Hole...there they have to find out who is causing all this extra-terrestrial trouble before the earth destructs. Captured by Ming the Merciless (Max Von Sydow) and hopelessly outnumbered by his slave minions, Flash must make allies of the flying Hawk Men led by Vultan (Brian Blessed) and the fierce Tree Men of Arboria ruled by the dashing Prince Barin (Timothy Dalton) before he can save Earth. Cast also includes Ornella Muti, Mariangelo Melato, Peter Wyngarde. Based on characters created by Alex Raymond in 1934."
