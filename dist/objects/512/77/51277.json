        "It takes weeks to prove yourself when starting a new job. Unfortunately, rookie policeman Jake Hoyt has one day to prove himself to Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris, head of the L.A. Police Department narcotic squad. Harris has a reputation for being the best, and Hoyt is eager to impress him on the ride-along. However, Hoyt soon discovers that Detective Sergeant Harris makes his own rules, becoming violent when his street-justice methods are questioned. Battling with his own morals, Hoyt soon realises that there is more to Harris than meets the eye, and soon realises that his first day at work may also be his last. Denzel Washington won the Best Actor in a Leading Role Academy Award in 2002 for his role as the corrupt Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris, while Ethan Hawke (Jake Hoyt) was nominated for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Cast also includes Tom Berenger, Scott Glenn and musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray."
