        "All the Mirrar are together; we are united against any more uranium mining on Mirrar country...We have no choice - this is our land and our life, we can never leave, we must protect it. Yvonne Margarula, April 2002. Begins with a prologue (12 min.) entitled \"An Unparalleled catastrophe\" which briefly provides a background of the uranium mining industry, nuclear reactors, and the subsequent environmental disasters and health issues which have resulted world wide, including Chernobyl and its aftermath. The documentary then continues with \"Fight for country\" which tells the story of the Jabiluka Blockade - a campaign staged in 1998 by both indigenous and white Australians in protest against ERA's (Energy Resources of Australia now Rio Tinto) recommendation to construct a second mine, Jabiluka, alongside of their Ranger Uranium Mine. Both the Ranger and Jabiluka leases are sited in the Kakadu National Park on Aboriginal sacred land. Over 5000 people from across Australia joined the Blockade and many thousands more participated in protests held throughout the major cities including Melbourne and Sydney. Support came from all walks of life, including Mandawuy Yunupingu of Yothu Yindi, Peter Garrett and Midnight Oil, Kev Carmody, Regurgitator, Coloured Stone, Gary Foley, Sen. Bob Brown, Bono (U2), Australian Conservation Foundation, Friends of the Earth, and most importantly from the Gundjehmi Aboriginal Corporation who provided the legal advice and direction for the Mirrar people in their fight for their rights. Also includes newsreel and archival footage, and backing by some great original music with strong political tones. For more historical background information about the Jabiluka Mine go to www.converge.org.nz/pma/cra0676.htm."
