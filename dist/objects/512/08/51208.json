        "Cai Chunzhi's (Jing Ning) family own a prosperous firecracker factory on the banks of the Yellow River in Northern China. When her father dies, because she is the only child she inherits the factory and becomes \"Master\". She dresses like a man and everyone addresses her as \"Master\" but as a woman, her hold on power is tenuous and she carefully respects the authority of the factory head, Man Dihong. When she hires an artist to paint door gods for the Chinese New Year her life is turned upside down. Niu Bao is a handsome young painter whose pride and headstrong nature put him on a collision course with Dihong, as Bao and his 'master' struggle with their attraction to each other. Winner of 3 Golden Rooster Awards (the Chinese equivalent of the Oscars). Based on the novel by Feng Jicai."
