        "Episode of Series \"Merce Cunningham Dance Company = Cunningham Dance Foundation\". Feature length documentary portrait tracing the history of the collaboration of choreographer, Merce Cunningham, and composer, John Cage, which spanned nearly fifty years beginning at the Cornish Institute of Allied Arts in Seattle, Washington. In telling the story of Cunningham and Cage, award winning filmmaker and Cunningham collaborator, Elliot Caplan, utilizes candid footage of their activities around the world since 1983, rare footage from the Cunningham and Cage archives, and interviews with principal figures involved in the collaboration. Caplan's daily contact with Cage and Cunningham has inspired a revealing and sensitive portrait of two men whose spirit of adventure and iconoclastic thinking have helped to revolutionize life, as well as art in the twentieth century. Includes interviews with Nam June Paik, Robert Rauschenberg, Carolyn Brown, Viola Farber and Rudolf Nureyev. Choreography by Merce Cunningham. Music by John Cage.
