        "Continuing the television series presented by Simon Schama on the history of Britain. This video contains the following episodes: \"The British wars\" (1603-1649) - A time of civil upheaval, turbulance and war between Crown (under the reign of Charles I) and Parliament, where supporters of the King (Royalists or Cavaliers) fought against the supporters of Parliament (Parliamentarians or Roundheads). This led to a divided country and the eventual creation of a new Britain, a republic Britain caught up in a conflict of ideologies of politics and religion and not in individuals. Three quarters of a million lives were lost during these violent times including Charles I who was publicly executed in 1649. \"Revolutions\" (1649-1689) - Following Charles I's execution, the puritanical Parliamentarian reformist Oliver Cromwell ruled Britain with an iron fist but this did not quell the religious and political uprisings. With Cromwell's death in 1658 came anarchy until the restoration of the monarchy with Charles II in 1660. James II of Scotland and his Catholic fervour almost sparked off another revolution until he was deposed by the troops of Dutch King William. The Great Fire of London in 1666 is also covered in this episode. \"Britannia incorporated\" (1690-1750) - In the 1690s and into the first half of the 1700s England and Scotland's relationship was not in particularly good shape in light of the Glencoe Massacre in 1692 and the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The Jacobites in Scotland still supported the deposed James II and the country itself was in the grip of poverty and famine. However half a century later England and Scotland forged a partnership based on profit and interest, not God, which evolved into the Act of Union in 1707. \"The Wrong empire\" (1750-1800 approx.) - Deals with the military might and total domination by Britain in her quest to build an empire - an empire acquired through exploration and daring but also through slavery, exploitation and conflict. Trade flourished, both in commodities and people. Taxation lost Britain the American colonies, but paved the way for dominance in India. See: www.bbc.co.uk/history for more information on this series."
