        "Episode of Series \"Merce Cunningham Dance Company = Cunningham Dance Foundation\". CRWDSPCR features the choreographic process of Merce Cunningham's work with the computer program \"LifeForms\". Cunningham, an inveterate explorer of new technology, became interested in \"how the computer opens the eye to detail -- the way a photograph does.\" Shot over the course of one year, CRWDSPCR follows the dancers from Cunningham's dance company as they transform his computerized images to staged reality. Music by John King. Reference: http://www.merce.org/filmvideo.html"
