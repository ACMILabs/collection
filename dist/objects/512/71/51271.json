        "Episode of Series \"Merce Cunningham Dance Company = Cunningham Dance Foundation\". A multi-media dance work involving twelve sound sensitive electronic poles placed around the stage performed by members of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. The sound is triggered by the dancer's movements and then altered or delayed by the musicians. Filmmaker Stan Van Der Beek recorded rehearsals of the dancers and then overlayed this footage as well as other stock footage images in the final film. Composer Nam June Paik projected these images on television screens during the performance. Non-dance related activities were also performed. Merce Cunningham potted a large plant and Carolyn Brown repotted it. The plant had a microphone attached to it so that any movement would produce sound. At the end of the piece, Merce Cunningham rode a bicycle through the space. Choreography by Merce Cunningham. Music by John Cage. Reference: http://www.merce.org/filmvideo.html"
