        "James Mason is a wounded IRA gunman staggering through the streets of Belfast from one refuge to the next as his life ebbs away. The realism of the early scenes of robbery and escape merges into nightmarish images of the darkened city and then spills over into the baroque excess of the hallucinating man on the run's encounter with a drunken artist. The central character is essentially passive; the dramatic emphasis is on the reactions of those around him. Directed by Carol Reed (The Third man)."
