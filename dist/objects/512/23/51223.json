        "Mel Brooks takes Mary Shelley's classic horror story and adds elements of Yiddish theatre, burlesque and camp to create an hilarious send-up of the horror movie genre. Featuring an array of star comic performances (including Cloris Leachman, Marty Feldman, Kenneth Mars), \"Young Frankenstein\" is considered by some to be director Mel Brooks' best film. Gene Wilder stars as the grandson of the original Dr. Frankenstein who travels back to an absurd Transylvania to uncover his grandfather's hideous secrets."
