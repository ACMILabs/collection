        "A quirky adventure-comedy based on the alleged \"true story\" of one man's attempt to kidnap failed Australian businessman Christopher Skase. When Peter Dellasandro (Lachy Hulme) convinces the creditors of the Quintex Empire to fund a covert mission to send a crack team of experts to Majorca to kidnap Skase and return him to Australia things don't go quite as he planned. What his crack team of misfits lack in skill, they make up for in enthusiasm. Cast includes Craig McLachlan, who stars as Eric Carney, host of a reality TV program who is mounting his own mission to 'get Skase', and Alex Dimitriades as Danny D'Amato, Dellasandro's right-hand man."
