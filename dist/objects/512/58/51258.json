        "The secure existence of an quintessentially middle-class nuclear family living in suburban California is shattered by supernatural forces in this updated haunted-house narrative produced by Spielberg in the same year he produced and directed \"E.T.\" The youngest daughter, ten year old Carol Anne, is inextricably drawn to strange phenomenon that communicate via the family television and which eventually pull her through the screen into the spirit world. Though the film was directed by Tobe Hooper, it is widely considered to carry Spielburg's trademark style in its setting, its childlike sense of wonder and horror, and its extensive use of scary special effects. Cast: Jobeth Williams, Craig T. Nelson, Beatrice Straight, Dominique Dunn, Oliver Robins, Heather O'Rourke. Written by Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais and Mark Victor. Music by Jerry Goldsmith."
