        "This re-construction by the maker of \"Endless Summer\" (1966), of his third surfing film (originally released in 1960), features footage taken at some of the best longboarding beaches in Hawaii and California. Bruce Brown, developed the surf film genre (which originated in Australia) by adding a slight narrative line and a light-hearted commentary. From the late fifties to the early seventies Brown made nine surfing films which he roadshowed across America, screening them in local halls, theatres and school auditoriums, and providing live improvised commentary. The soundtrack for this and a number of Brown's other surf films were composed by jazz legend Bud Shank and performed with his quartet."
