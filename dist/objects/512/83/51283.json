        "The surreal tone of this critically acclaimed, off-beat British comedy set in the fictional North England town of Royston Vasey, has been described by one critic as \"Monty Python meets Twin Peaks\". Diverging wildly from most sit-com conventions, the series features over sixty characters, practically every resident of the town, most of whom are played with remarkable skill by three core cast members. Ranging from mildly eccentric to plain psychotic, the townsfolk of Royston Vasey suffer from a particularly demented variety of disfunctionality and xenophobia. They include the local shopkeepers Edward and Tubbs, who go to murderous lengths to ensure their shop remains for local people only; the Denton family, toad-breeders obsessed with maintaining their household rituals at all costs; inept veterinary surgeon Dr Chinnery, who's never yet saved a patient; Barbara, the local transsexual taxi driver (one of the show's more well adjusted characters); Pauline the demonic Restart Officer at the local Job Centre; and Lance, the sadistic owner of Lance's Joke Shop. The series had its origins in a live sketch comedy, then became an award-winning radio show before it moved to television where it has continued to win awards and has garnered a cult following. Written by Jeremy Dyson, Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. Starring Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith."
