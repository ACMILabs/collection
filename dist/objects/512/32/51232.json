        "The Doctor and Ace (Sophie Aldred) land in London, 1963, amidst an environment of mysterious magnetic fluctuation and a military stake out. Leaping in the back of scientific advisor Professor Rachel Jenson's wagon, the time lord and his companion find themselves in the thick of a siege in which men are being killed by a mysterious \"death ray\". The Doctor informs Group Captain Gilmore, the man in charge, that these are the energy weapons of the Daleks. The Daleks have come to retrieve something the first Doctor left behind at the school of his grand daughter Susan, the powerful Hand of Omega. The Daleks are species divided however, with two warring factions competing for the Hand. On one side there is Dalek Emperor Davros, on the other the renegade Imperial Dalek faction headed by the Supreme Dalek. The Doctor must stop the Daleks from gaining the Hand and protect Group Captain Gilmore and his men from extinction. Boasting more special Dalek induced effects than in previous episodes, Sylvester McCoy starred as the seventh Doctor in this 25th season of the cult series for a period of three years (1987-1989). Written by Ben Aaronovitch."
