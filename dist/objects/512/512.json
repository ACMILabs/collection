        "Created in 2001, this work shows a modernist house in a rural setting gradually losing its domestic contents in a turbulent flow across four screens. Tables, chairs, cutlery, clothing and bedding are propelled into outerspace and taken on a journey through NASA space. The work is an ironic comment on experiments with Artificial Life, and has a surreal atmosphere that is underpinned by the ambient sound track."
