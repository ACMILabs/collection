        "Roddy Doyle (The Van, The Snapper, The Commitments) wrote the screenplay for this romantic comedy, set in modern day Dublin. Brendan is a shy schoolteacher, with few friends and no sex life to speak of who is obsessed with old films. He imagines himself at the centre of all his favourite roles, from \"The Quiet man\" to Godard's \"Breathless\". One evening whilst drinking in a local pub Brendan meets Trudy - an outgoing, vivacious and bubbly blonde - his complete opposite. Despite a disastrous first date Brendan and Trudy form an unlikely romance. Trudy's secretive nature about her line of work leads Brendan to believe she is some kind of criminal, perhaps even a violent one. Brendan's attempts to introduce Trudy to his snobbish family are disastrous and the pair struggle to keep their romance aflame. Characters enact scenes from Brendan's favourite films, replete with subtitles. Part of the appeal of this film is the litany of film references and clips lifted from old movie classics. Directed by Kieron J. Walsh and starring Flora Montgomery and Peter McDonald."
