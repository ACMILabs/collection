        "A British-Australia co-production, \"Do or die\" is a 2 part mini series about the plight of a British mother to reconnect with a past lover from Australia who holds the key to her son's mortality. When a car hits Sam and Nicky's son, their lives are thrown into turmoil when tests discover he has leukaemia and neither of the parents is an exact match and life saving donor--he is not Nicky's son. Sam discloses that when backpacking as a teenager with her friend in Australia, she became involved with Michael Tyler, a known bank robber who was eventually caught and imprisoned by Detective Daryl Quint, but whom escapes after Sam returns to Australia to try and persuade him to save their child. Quint, convinced that Sam and Michael still have feelings for one another, charges her with being an accomplice after she is forced to drive Michael away following an arranged meeting intercepted by the police. A veritable hot bed of beaches, slow tracking, swanky looking Sydney city shots and dogged law enforcement as represented by Quint (McInnes), the cast includes Tom Long, Kate Ashfield, Hugo Speer, William McInnes and Martin Sacks. Directed by Rowan Woods (The Boys), who has made a career out of directing for the small screen."
