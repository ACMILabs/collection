        "Episode of Series \"Merce Cunningham Dance Company = Cunningham Dance Foundation\". Beach birds for camera is a version for film of the dance \"Beach birds\". It is in that sense a different piece from the stage production as the title suggests because of the medium used - film and all of its implied language. Merce Cunningham introduces the dance and extrapolates on his exploration of film as a medium for presentation and how the language of film affects the reading and possibilities of the production. Cunningham explores the language of film expressing this through change and use of the human body. Movement and time as with the use of the camera is an extension of the use of the human body. Cast is made from members from the Merce Cunningham Company with music by John Cage."
