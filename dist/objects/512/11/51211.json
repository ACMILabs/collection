        "Atmospheric adventure film and science fiction classic, \"Voyage to the bottom of the sea\" tells of a routine scientific exploration mission to the North Pole which goes horribly awry. The submarine crew, helmed by Admiral Harriman Nelson, a taciturn old-school navy man, are alarmed to discover that the Van Allen radiation belt has been ignited by a freak meteor shower, and the earth and sky are afire. Nelson, at loggerheads with his deputy, makes the inflammatory decision to extinguish the inferno by detonating a nuclear missile. Despite the censure of the United Nations, Nelson presses ahead with his scheme, whilst combating natural disasters, mutiny, giant sea creatures and a religious zealot on board. This film won many accolades for its special effects (state-of-the-art for its day), with a screenplay reflective of public concerns about potential apocalyptic nuclear disasters."
