    "description": [
        "Three delightful animated claymation shorts from director Nick Park and the studios of Aardman Animation, all featuring the hapless inventor Wallace and his faithful dog, Gromit. \"A grand day out\": Wallace likes a nice bit of cheese with his crackers, so when the eccentric inventor finds his fridge empty and the local corner shop shut for Bank Holiday, he is forced to look further afield for his cheddar. The two plasticine heroes blast off in their home-made rocket on the ultimate day-trip to the Moon! \"The Wrong trousers\": A hilarious tale of skulduggery involving an extraordinary pair of automated trousers and a villainous penguin. Posing as an innocent lodger, the fiendish fish-eater sets about recruiting mild-mannered Wallace as unwitting accomplice to his dastardly plot; a diamond heist. It is left to the faithful Gromit to turn detective and save the day as malice and mayhem culminate in a breathless train chase around the sitting room. \"A Close shave\": Trade is booming for Wallace and Gromit's window cleaning Wash'N'Go service and love is in the air as Wallace falls for the owner of the local wool shop, the lovely Wendolene Ramsbottom. However, Wallace has a new invention - a Knit-O-Matic machine - and adventure looms; sheep are being rustled, wool is in short supply and Wendolene's malevolent pooch is on the prowl. All three shorts also available separately on VHS."
