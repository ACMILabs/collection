        "This is a compilation of excerpts from the British television program \"The Benny Hill Show\" during the period 1964-1967. British comedian Benny Hill died in 1992 but is still remembered for his rather wicked schoolboy sense of humour, the sometimes tasteless sexual innuendos and smuttiness in his comedy skits and sketches and the wonderful send-ups from TV game shows and news broadcasts, to film parodies, the Royal family and top Hollywood stars. Included in the cast of many, is Australian singer and entertainer, Patsy Ann Noble. Written by Benny Hill with additional material by Robert Gould. NOTE: Due to the archival nature of this material, the sound and picture quality may vary occasionally."
