        "The Life of birds, another nature series from the inimitable Attenborough, uncovers new research into the behaviour of birds, secrets of their success, strategies for finding food, complex social systems, and bizarre ways of breeding and mating. Episodes 1-3 \"To fly or not to fly\": Examines the daily routine of birds in thorough detail, investigating the post-dinosaur phenomenon of birds that walk the earth. \"The Mastery of flight\": Celebrates birds' awesome ability to take to the skies, conveying the majestic speed, endurance, and agility of many creatures. Attenborough discusses the splendid proficiency of birds to fly with aerodynamic skill and grace. Flapping, gliding, thermals, and breathtaking displays of synchronised formation flying are some topics covered. \"The Insatiable appetite\": Investigates bird nutrition and food intake. Birds depend on a great variety of food supply, from acorns to zebra meat. Bill shapes and sizes have evolved over time to assure maximum efficiency when sourcing food. The series combines cinematography shot in nature with slow-motion and computer-enhanced special effects that allows viewers to observe bird behaviour on a minute level. Attenborough and his crew visited 42 countries to create this magnificent series."
