        "The Life of birds, another nature series from the inimitable Attenborough, uncovers new research into the behaviour of birds, secrets of their success, strategies for finding food, complex social systems, and bizarre ways of breeding and mating. Episodes 4-6 \"Meat-eaters\": Many birds are carnivores, eating live and dead flesh to survive. In this episode Attenborough explores birds' competition for hard-to-find prey as the audience observes the various strategies employed by hunter and scavenger birds to source food. \"Fishing for a living\": Displays the skilful fishing practices utilised by a variety of birds, across freshwater and saltwater locations. \"Signals and songs\": Birdcalls and extraordinary patterns of colour are used for various reasons in the animal kingdom - to communicate, copulate, deter predators and scare off rivals. Attenborough examines a broad range of bird songs and plumage. The series combines cinematography shot in nature with slow motion and computer-enhanced special effects that allows viewers to observe bird behaviour on a minute level. Attenborough and his crew visited 42 countries to create this magnificent series."
