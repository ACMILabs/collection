        "Set in Montreal, \"The Score\" is a film that revolves around three generations of criminals (and actors) enmeshed in a potentially rewarding heist with a lot of attendant risks. Nick Wells is a criminal who knows to stick with the rules that make him successful: never work in the city where you live and never work with a partner. His mentor in crime Max, entices Nick to break both these rules and hook up with young blade Jack Teller, and rob Customs House in Montreal for a priceless sceptre. Nick is suspicious of Jack and distrusting of his ways. The three however must find a way to work together in order to collect the booty. Frank Oz (Bowfinger, In and Out, Dirty rotten scoundrels) directs this stylish thriller that is as much about the dynamics between the thieves as it is about a crime. Using a well-worn formula (one last job), \"The Score\" nevertheless manages to impress with its ability to build and sustain tension. Apparently a degree of improvisation was used in the scenes between De Niro and Brando, the latter of whom was less than co-operative in taking directions from Oz and preferred to be instructed by De Niro."
