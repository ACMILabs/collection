        "Episode of Series \"Merce Cunningham Dance Company = Cunningham Dance Foundation\". This documentary explores Merce Cunningham's method of choreography, including his employment of random methods through use of the I Ching, his collaboration with composer John Cage and his relationship with the dancers in his Company.

Included are dance excerpts from \"Trails,\" \"Scramble,\" \"Aeon,\" \"Quartet\", \"Suite For Five\", \"Roadrunners\" and \"Fractions\". In English with French with English subtitles.
