        "Originally aired on ABC in 2002, this eight part slice-of-life comedy series gives an obvious nod to the reality show \"Sylvania Waters\". Kath (Jane Turner), forty-something homeowner and fashion and fitness conscious woman, finds her lifestyle cramped when her spoilt only daughter, Kim (Gina Riley), returns home after leaving her husband, Brett (Peter Rowsthorn) - again. Kath has recently embarked on a passionate new relationship with butcher Kel (Glenn Robbins) and marriage is on the cards. Written and created by Gina Riley and Jane Turner, this video features the first four episodes in the series. \"Sex\": Kim arrives home unannounced and Kath does not intend slowing things down on the romance front, much to the disgust of her daughter. Kim enlists the help of second best friend Sharon (Magda Szubanski), to find the recipient of the black lingerie she located in Brett's drawer. \"Gay\": Brett professes his continued affection for Kim but she suspects he loves Rottweiler, Cujo, more. Meanwhile, Kath begins to suspect something sinister behind her daughter's breakup. Kim and Sharon try speed dating. \"Sport\": Eager to get back at the women with whom Brett did the dirty on her with, Kim agrees to play in Sharon's netball final against them. When Kim's skills aren't forthcoming, Kath steps in. \"Fat\": It's fitting time for the bridesmaids dresses and Kath is mortified to discover Kim won't fit into the dress. She orders Kim to shed the kilos and Sharon contemplates a career in marriage counselling."
