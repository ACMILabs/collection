        "Episode of Series \"Merce Cunningham Dance Company = Cunningham Dance Foundation\". In the Spring of 1974, Merrill Brockway produced two half hour programs featuring Merce Cunningham and his company. The programs were only aired twice that year and were not seen again for twenty-five years. These two programs contain important archival material from the early 1960s and 1970s. Excerpts of performances of \"Winterbranch\", \"Second Hand\", Sounddance\", \"TV Rerun\", \"Changing Steps\", \"Landrover\", and \"Signals are included. Throughout the programs, Cunningham discusses his ideas and approach to dancing. Choreography by Merce Cunningham. Music by Christian Wolff. Reference: http://www.merce.org/filmvideo.html"
