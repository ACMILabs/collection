        "Gary (Ray Winstone) is a retired criminal, living in a luxurious Spanish villa with his ex-porn star wife and a couple of choice friends. The news of the impending arrival of Don (Ben Kingsley) - a former colleague of Don's and a psychopath, puts the group on knife-edge. Don descends on the group like a hurricane - spewing foul language and oozing menace. His mission is to bring Gary back to London for a jewellery heist, masterminded by Teddy Bass (Ian MacShane). Gary's refusal means little to Don as he cajoles, threatens, prods and manipulates Gary into taking the job. Don also works on intimidating the group, who are catatonic with fear and are on a helpless mission not to evoke Don's anger. \"Sexy beast\" is a thriller/crime film that has a kinetic style that is at times reminiscent of Guy Ritchie. This film was Jonathon Glazer's debut feature and Ben Kingsley was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor."
