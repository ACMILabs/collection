        "Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn) is a former tennis pro, now a small time gambler on the run from some bookies who will do anything to get their money back. On his way to Las Vegas to pay his debt, he car breaks down in a small desert town. Whilst waiting for his car to be fixed by quirky mechanic Darrell (Billy Bob Thornton), Bobby meets and becomes attracted to Grace (Jennifer Lopez) who unbeknownst to him, is married to Jake (Nick Nolte), a much older and seemingly possessive man who is furious when he discovers them together. When Bobby is unable to pay for the repairs to his car and Jake offers to pay Bobby to kill his wife, he agrees, becoming involved in a situation far worse than anything he has ever imagined - when Grace makes him an offer he can't refuse. The town characters creating havoc in Bobby's world include a wisdom-spouting blind veteran (Jon Voight), Jenny, (Claire Danes) a troubled teenager trying to escape the confines of the town and her abusive boyfriend Toby N. Tucker (Joaquin Phoenix) and the Sheriff (Powers Boothe) trying to maintain order in the town, despite hiding a secret of his own. Also includes appearances by Laurie Metcalf and Liv Tyler. Based on the novel 'Stray Dogs' by John Ridley."
