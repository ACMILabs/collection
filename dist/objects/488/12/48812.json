        "Scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have spent years trying to discover the formula to make matter invisible. When initial testing on a gorilla proves the developed serum works, Caine is pressured into testing it on a human candidate by his supervisor Dr. Kramer (William Devane), despite the formula being unstable. Rather than screen likely candidates, Caine decides to test the serum on himself. However, while the formula injected into the gorilla could be reversed, once Caine proves that his formula also works on humans his team are unable to reverse the process. Despite the team's efforts to find a solution, Caine, unable to deal with his invisibility goes insane and begins to stalk his research team, in particular his ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and Matt (Josh Brolin), her new boyfriend. Director Paul Verhoeven uses computer-aided special effects in an amazingly realistic portrayal of invisibility in this sci-fi thriller which also stars Kim Dickens, Mary Jo Randle and Joey Slotnick."
