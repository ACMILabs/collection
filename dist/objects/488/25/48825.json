        "Part 1: India - East to West. TV satirist Ian Hislop travels from Calcutta to Rajasthan via the Taj Mahal on a typical Indian passenger train, the Palace on Wheels - a classy passenger train, and the Calcutta Rajdhani Express, an express train which travels 1,000 miles in 18 hours with only one stop. Part 2: Africa - Senegal to Mali. Actor Danny Glover travels the Bamako Express railway - the oldest railway in Africa. Both journeys take a view of the social and cultural aspects of life around train travel in the respective countries."
