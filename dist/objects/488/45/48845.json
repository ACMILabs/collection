        "Wong Kar-wai describes his first feature as 'a tragedy set in the big city, focussing on several ordinary characters in a hopeless situation'. It has also been described as 'an idiosyncratic riff on the plot and themes of Scorsese's Mean Streets'. Ah Wah (Andy Lau) is an enigmatic hit man who, with his offsider Fly (Jacky Cheung), is, despite himself, dragged into trouble time and time again. The arrival of his cousin (Maggie Cheung) briefly offers hope of escape from the downward spiral. The emphasis is more on atmosphere and interplay between the three characters than upon plot. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
