        "Ellen (Sharon Stone), a female gunslinger, arrives in the town of Redemption for a quick-draw contest. The contest has been the initiative of the town's corrupt mayor, Herod (Gene Hackman), and attracts gunslingers from around the county, all with mysterious pasts. Ellen is seeking revenge on Herod for past injustices, the smooth talker known as 'The Kid' (Leonardo DiCaprio) may possibly be the mayor's son, and the quiet Reverend Cort (Russell Crowe) refuses to participate despite being the fastest gun in town. As the contest continues all is revealed, leading to a final showdown between Ellen and Herod."
