        "Annabel Chong was a university student in Los Angeles when she decided to enter the porn industry to finance her studies. This video commences soon after Annabel Chong has become famous for creating a world record in having sex with 251 men in one day. Resisting both a conservative and feminist anti-pornographic morality, Chong asserts her right as a woman and a feminist to both engage in the porn industry and to be unapologetic for her sexual desires and experience. But this ethically ambivalent documentary, filmed in a cinema-verite style in Chong's home, on set of porn production houses in Los Angeles, and most disturbingly, in Chong's parent's home in Singapore, shows that for all the passion and sincerity of her passion, the pornographers creating, shaping and exploiting Chong's sexual persona are all men. The filmmakers play on our voyeurism, beginning by titillating us and end up asking for our compassion: which makes for an uneasy but rivetting viewing experience. Annabel Chong, it needs to be said, is determined to refuse being portrayed as a victim. But ultimately sadness is the dominant emotion the viewer is left with by the end of this documentary. For all the apparent conviction of her beliefs, Annabel Chong seems immersed in a world in which she is used and exploited by men."
