        "If you've ever wanted to confront the great questions of existence head on, or to probe beneath the veneer of everyday life and discover the underlying truths that shape our Universe, then you should probably read \"A history of western civilisation\" by Bertrand Russell. If it's a long way to your local library, however, or if you are afraid of contracting one of the rare dermatological diseases that can be picked up by handling too many serious books, then this hand crafted video cassette, in full colour and with full rewind facilities, could be the answer you've been looking for. Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin have distilled a lifetime's experience into this cornucopia of erudition, enlightenment and something else beginning with 'e'. Winner of the Special Jury Grand Prize, Cannes 1983 the video includes the short film \"The crimson permanent insurance\"."
