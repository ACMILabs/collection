        "Mr Bleeker, a retiree, is called into the office to help with finances. He accuses one of the female staff with body odour. She is embarrassed and is consoled by the secretary who tells her it is a fact. Hence the title of the film. Mr Bleeker also berates staff who gossip, collecting for football pools and male staff annoying female staff. Mr Bleeker gives advice to various staff about wasting time, he considers proper dress, manners and decorum should be evident in the office. A grievance committee approaches management to complain about Mr Bleeker but in the end they resolve the problems themselves."
