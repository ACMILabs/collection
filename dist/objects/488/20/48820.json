        "Episode of Series \"Safetycare\". Looks at firefighting techniques of starvation, smothering, cooling and stopping the chemical chain reaction; extinguishing agents such as water, foam, carbon dioxide and dry powder; fire extinguishers for ordinary combustibles, flammable and combustible liquids, flammable gases, combustible metals, electrically energised equipment and cooking oils & fats; classifications of fires and the operation of fire extinguishers. The main aim of this package is to provide the facilitator with discussion points important to the overall development of the program and to allow participants the opportunity of discussing the impact the program may have on current work practices and whether in fact changes may be required. Included is a Trainer's Manual."
