        "Rory McHoan was last seen on his way to visit his brother, Kenneth, seven years ago. No trace of him was ever found despite an exhaustive police investigation. Inspired by his grandmother, Rory's nephew, Prentice, takes on the task of finding Rory, and uncovering the truth about his missing uncle's disappearance. With only Rory's archaic and unreadable computer disks, pages of a novel-in-progress, and a ghost at his shoulders, Prentice must make a long journey with discoveries to be made about himself before he can unravel the dark secrets that lie buried in his family's history. Based on a novel by Iain Banks. Cast includes: Joseph McFadden, Bill Paterson and Valerie Edmond."
