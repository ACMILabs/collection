        "Shot in 24 countries, \"Baraka\" is an extraordinary visual feast that examines the passionate and destructive love/hate relationship between humans and earth. A spectacular diversity of memorable images have been gathered from around the world from the natural and man-made environments, both past and present. The style is strongly reminiscent of the film \"Koyaanisqatsi\" in its use of timelapse photography juxtaposed with slower sequences, and the somewhat sentimental, simplistic portrayal of humanity."
