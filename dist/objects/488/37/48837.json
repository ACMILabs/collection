        "Failing to convince a psychiatrist that she is sane after overdosing on aspirins and vodka, troubled teen Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is prescribed a period of genuine rest at renowned mental institution, Claymoore. Further diagnosed with borderline personality disorder - symptoms of which are mental instability, pessimism, and social contrariness - Susanna is locked away from the outer world and thrust into the company of a group of disturbed young women including Georgina (Clea DuVall), a pathological liar, Daisy (Brittany Murphy), a woman suffering a bizarre eating disorder, and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a charismatically cruel sociopath. Intrigued by Lisa, Susanna rebels against the authority represented by Nurse Valerie and Dr. Wick, and befriends her fellow inmates, allowing herself to become caught up in their collective madness. Forming a love-hate relationship with Lisa becomes the catalyst for events that ultimately help Susanna to resolve many inner conflicts, and fight her way back to sanity. Based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Susanna Kaysen. (Awards: Academy for Best Supporting Actress, Anjelina Jolie, 1999)"
