        "Documentary on Andreas Vesalius, born in 1514 in Brussels. Appointed Professor of Anatomy at Padua in 1536, he revolutionised anatomy with clear and succint lectures and dissections of cadavers. In 1543 his seven books on the structure of the human body was published - a comprehensive work which describes bones, muscles, blood vessels, nervous system, abdominal and thoracic viscera and head. The work corrected anatomical myths dating back to Roman times and emphasised the wholistic structure of the body. His use of detailed illustrations and emphasis on dissection and observation paved the way for modern anatomy and physiology."
