        "Danny Kaye is the quintessential singing, dancing, royal clown in this classic musical comedy set in 12th century England which parodies Robin Hood style swashbuckling adventure films. He plays a court jester who accidentally falls in with a band of outlaws who are plotting to kill the king. They try to use the unwitting fool to get close to the king, however they do not reckon on his ability as a jouster as well as a jester, which brings their plans undone in a hilarious manner. Cast also includes Basil Rathbone, Angela Lansbury, Glynis Johns and Cecil Parker."
