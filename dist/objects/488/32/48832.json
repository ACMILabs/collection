        "The first installment of Pasolini's lively 'Trilogy of Life', drawn from famous story cycles ('The Canterbury Tales' and 'The Arabian Nights' followed). Based on eight of Boccaccio's tales of sexual deception set mostly around 14th-century Naples, including those of the seducing nuns, the three jealous brothers who murder their sister's lover, the wizard who could turn his wife into a burro, and the story of a false saint. Pasolini plays Giotto, the fresco painter around whom the various tales revolve. The film won the Special Jury Prize at Berlin in 1971. Cast includes Patrizia Capparelli, Franco Citti, Ninetto Davoli, Angela Luce and Sylvana Magano. In Italian with English subtitles."
