        "Film makers Dominic Anciano and Ray Burdis have created an original rumination on friendship which blurs the line between documentary and fiction. Jude Law is a recently deceased film maker whose latest film is screened to his grieving family and friends on the day of his funeral. The group is shocked to find that over the last year Jude has in fact been filming them, using hidden cameras to record their most private moments and guilty secrets. Embarrassment gradually turns to fear as the film peels back the layers of their lives, each more treacherous than the last. With liberal use of improvisation and a tour-de-force performance from Ray Winstone, 'Final Cut' is a contemporary exploration of morality, mortality and the power of the recorded image. Cast also includes Sadie Frost, Dominic Anciano and Ray Burdis."
