        "These two short community advertisements (30 seconds each) were made to create awareness about the suffering of indigenous peoples as a result of forced removal from their families in the middle of twentieth century Australia. The audience is asked to consider the current impact experienced by these people today as a direct result of government policy whilst the Aboriginal people are still asking \"why?\".
