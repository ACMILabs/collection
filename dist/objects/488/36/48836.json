        "A widow settling her husbands estate finds an 8mm film in his safe. The film on the reel is a \"snuff\" film, and shows a young girl being tortured and killed. Upset by the film, she hires private detective Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) to find the girl on the film and determine if the film is real. When Tom learns the girl on the film is a runaway, his investigation takes him to Hollywood, where, with the help of Max (Joaquin Phoenix), a clerk in an adult bookstore, he discovers the world of underground pornography, and his initial investigation becomes an obsession."
