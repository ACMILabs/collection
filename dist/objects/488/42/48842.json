        "Episode of Series \"Speaking from experience\". This Australian program presents a sensitive account of Alzheimer's disease from the point of view of their families and carers. It looks at the early signs and behaviours, and the ways in which the patients and their carers handle diagnosis of the condition. The emotional impact this disease has on families is openly discussed, as well as practical advice given on how carers can best handle the progression of the condition."
