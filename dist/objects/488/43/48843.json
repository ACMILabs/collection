        "6 episode television mini series about young Australian outback heiress Katrina Stanton (Nicole Kidman) who, after her mother's death learns that her father, supposedly dead, is in fact alive and living overseas. She sets out on a journey from outback Australia to London to trace him. Her London uncle, initially aloof, finally reveals that her father (Denholm Elliott) resides in Bangkok and has contact with him through the family solicitor there. While staying in London, Katrina is seduced by suave young drug dealer Arkie Ragan, who offers to accompany her to Australia via Bangkok and help her contact her father. He hides 8kg of heroin in her suitcase and she is arrested at Bangkok airport. Taken to the notorious \"Bangkok Hilton\", she fights to survive conditions in the women's prison while awaiting her trial, her only support being the family solicitor Richard Carlisle (Hugo Weaving) and, unknown to Katrina, her father who acts as the associate on the case. All legal channels are exhausted when Katrina is sentenced to death, and her only hope for survival is escape. This forces her father to confront some of his own demons."
