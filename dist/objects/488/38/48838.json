        "Based on Jeffrey Deaver's best selling novel, Officer Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) stumbles upon a bizarre murder scene. Her inexperience as a police officer bears no hindrance to the professional way she deals with the evidence, which catches the eye of paralyzed detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington). Donaghy and Rhyme become embroiled in what eventuates as an incomprehensible slate of brutish murders where clues can only be unravelled in one place - the mind of the murderer. Cinematography by Dean Semler"
