        "Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his wife Karen (Mary Steenburgen) are raising three children - high strung Kevin, tomboy Taylor and toddler Justin. When they learn Kevin's behaviour problems mean he will be held back a year, Gil attempts to become a super-father and solve Kevin's problems himself. His older sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is a single mother raising an introverted son (Joaquin Phoenix) and a promiscuous daughter (Martha Plimpton). Family life isn't much sweeter for Gil's younger sister Susan, who is trying to convince her overachiever husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), that she would like another baby, even though it interferes with the Life Plan he has for their toddler daughter. When the black sheep of the family, Larry (Tom Hulce), shows up unexpectedly with a son of his own, the Buckman's must all deal with the consequences of their relationships."
