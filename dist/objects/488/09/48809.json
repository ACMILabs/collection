        "A group of medical students are determined to experience the afterlife by putting themselves in a near-death state and reviving themselves at the last minute. To literally \"flatline\", shut down their hearts, just for a short time, to experience what it would be like to die. Problems arise when one of the students, Nelson Wright (Kiefer Sutherland), becomes obsessed with death and is determined to experience the afterlife before being revived. The screenplay was written by Peter Filardi who wrote the plot after hearing of a friend's own near-death experience during an operation. 'Flatliners' was one of the most popular films of the early 90's and was the first dramatic lead role for Julia Roberts. Cast also includes Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt and William Baldwin."
