        "Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a highly successful Wall street businessman. He is a prime example of the opulence that flourished during the excessive consumerism of the 1980's. Everything has its place and there is a place for everything, everything that is except Patrick's mental stability. Call it a nervous breakdown or psychosis, his soul is simply not there. Combining horror, suspense and extremely dry satire, \"American Psycho\" is a meditation on excess and the loss of personal identity. Considering the controversial nature of Bret Easton Ellis's novel, director Mary Harron and co-script writer Guinevere Turner have transliterated the work with remarkable wit and insight. The film maintains the ambiguous balance between what may be a horrific reality or an elaborate fantasy of a desperately lost soul. Cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon."
