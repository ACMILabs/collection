        "A former 'video-nasty' and one of the few examples of the perversely themed 'nunsploitation' genre, which is basically a thinly veiled excuse for some soft core erotica. The usual ingredients for this genre are all present in The Killer nun, that being drug addicted nuns, lesbianism, sadism, murder, necrophilia and lashings of nudity. Anita Ekberg stars as sister Gertrude a sexually repressed, morphine addicted nun who descends into madness when her elderly patients begin to get murdered, making her the prime suspect. Soon enough the unhinged sister is shooting up, having sex with strange men and making inappropriate advances at her fellow sisters. Cast includes Joe Dallesandro, Alida Valli, Lou Castel. Also known as Suor omicidi."
