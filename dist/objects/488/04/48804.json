        "Uprooted from her familiar surroundings and forced to move to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother, Sarah (Robin Tunney) is disappointed to find that she is again relegated to the role of the outsider at St. Benedict's Academy. However, the main thing that sets her apart from the others - her magical ability - soon draws the attention of fellow misfits Nancy (Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (Neve Campbell) and Rochelle (Rachel True), who try to recruit her as the fourth member of their coven. Sarah is at first unwilling to enter their world of magic and ritual, afraid of her own untapped powers and sceptical of the others' euphoric worship of the deity, Manon, but when her reputation is ruined after an encounter with the school's most popular boy, Chris (Skeet Ulrich), she reconsiders. The four bind themselves into a formal coven one afternoon and cast their first spell as a group: Rochelle asks for revenge on a racist class-mate, Sarah asks that Chris fall in love with her, Bonnie asks for the severe burn scars that cover her body to be removed, and Nancy asks for all the power of Manon. Empowered by Sarah, a natural witch, their spells have the desired results, and the group becomes more close-knit as they continue their occult explorations. Feeling guilty about what she has done to Chris, Sarah seeks advice from the proprietor of the local occult shop, Lirio, who advises the group to be careful, as whatever they send out will return to them times three. The others ignore this advice and group leader Nancy soon becomes corrupted by the powers she is given after a midnight invocation on a stormy beach, resulting in the death of Chris. When Sarah suggests that the others practice more caution, they turn on her, tormenting her ceaselessly after she leaves their circle. Caught in a struggle between reality and illusion, Sarah is forced to invoke a greater power to help defend her against Nancy's maliciously twisted magic. The soundtrack for this film features original music by composer Graeme Revell."
