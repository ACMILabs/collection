        "Written directly for the screen by master of horror Stephen King. Brian Krause, best known for his role as white-lighter Leo on the television series \"Charmed\", stars as Charles Brady, who along with his mother Mary (Alice Krige,) are 'Sleepwalkers', creatures similar to vampires and werewolves, a dying race who can only stay alive by feeding on the life force of a virgin. When Charles and his mother move to the small town of Travis, Indiana, Charles becomes attracted to Tanya Robertson (Madchen Amick), a girl in one of his classes at school. When Mary pleads with her son to bring the beautiful girl home so they may feed off her, he is unable to do so as he has fallen in love with her. During their first date together Charles tries to take things further than Tanya intends and to ward him off she stabs him with a corkscrew. Staggering home to his mother, Charles is nursed back to heath and the two plan their retaliation against the Robertson family. Features cameo appearances by Mark Hamill, John Landis, Tobe Hooper, Joe Dante, Clive Barker and Stephen King himself as a cemetery attendant."
