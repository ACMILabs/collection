        "This lengthy biography of Winston Churchill is based on his own memoirs and narrated by Orson Welles. His early family life at Blenheim Palace, Harrow school and Sandhurst Military College is discussed, together with his military service in India and Cuba, and the occasions where he retreated from public life to devote time to his painting and writing. However, the primary focus of the program is on the contribution he made as Prime Minister of Britain during World War 2, rallying the people with his oratory and using his energies and determination to repel Hitler's advances across Europe towards Britain. The program presents a good summary of the more important European military campaigns, with maps, and outlines the role played by Britain and its allies under Churchill's leadership. It uses a large range of archival footage from various campaigns and cities across Europe and North Africa, interspersed with extracts of Churchill delivering key addresses."
