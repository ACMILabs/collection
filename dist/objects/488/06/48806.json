        "Ed TV explores fame through the Big Brother phenomenon where ordinary people become famous just by allowing the nation to watch them 24/7. Ed (Matthew McConaughey) is chosen to be the star of the lastest real TV program. He agrees to allow cameras to film him 24 hours a day and broadcast this across the nation. After a shakey start the program takes off and Ed becomes the latest big thing. He initially enjoys his fame. But he starts to rethink his decision when the intrusive cameras potentially cause him to loose his new found love Shari(Jenna Elfman) and destory his family."
