        "Using paintings, drawings and sketches, this episode tells of the year 1567 when Mary, Queen of Scots, married James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, believed to be her former husband's murderer, inevitably losing the support of her loyal subjects. Mary is imprisoned and forced to abdicate the throne. Years later Mary attempted to regain the throne, unsuccessfully, eventually fleeing to England to seek support and protection through Queen Elizabeth I."
