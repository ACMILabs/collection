        "Originally filmed on large format cameras for IMAX theatres, this documentary relates the filmmakers' story of their inspirational ascent to the summit of the world's highest mountain, that took place just days after the 1996 tragedy in which eight climbers lost their lives in a deadly storm. Breathtaking photography is combined with on-camera interviews and personal stories, to give the viewer a privileged insight into the climbers' mental, physical and emotional highs and lows as they push themselves to the limits of human endurance. Narrated by Liam Neeson with music by George Harrison."
