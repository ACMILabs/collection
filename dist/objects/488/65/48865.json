        "Part 2 of the Hymer's 8 week stay in the 1940's house. \"1944-1945: the beginning of the end\": the first lot of wartime treats from the U.S turns up on the Hymer's doorstep and is favourably received. D Day arrives and the family is treated to a picnic at the Biggins Air Show. When VE Day is upon them there's a dance to attend with 1940's enthusiasts. Kirstie is sent to work on aircraft and the family prepare to leave Braemar Gardens. \"2001: Homecoming\": On returning from the 1940's house, Lyn, Michael, Kirstie and the boys discuss how their lives have changed individually and as a family. We are also privy to bloopers from the show - scenes in which the family contravened the regulations laid down to them during the 8 week period. The War Cabinet provides feedback on how serious/usual their breaches were and how they think the Hymer's fared in general. Footage of the Hymer's visiting a refuge shelter at Chiselhurst is also shown."
