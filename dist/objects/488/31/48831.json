        "Pauline Collins is Shirley Valentine-Bradshaw, a housewife and mother in cold dull England who dreams of adventure and stimulation. Her best friend wins a holiday in Greece and Shirley decides to come along. On the beautiful island of Mykonos, Shirley finds herself increasingly attracted to fisherman Costas (Tom Conti), and before the whirl wind two weeks on the Aegean is finished, she has to make big decisions about whether to return to her middle-class life back in England or to pursue the adventures of a new life promised by Greece and Costa. With the magical locales of Mykonos as a backdrop, \"Shirley Valentine\" is a perennial crowd pleasing comedy which also manages to develop some perceptive insights into the emotions and experiences of women in the middle years of their lives."
