        "This confronting video is an interesting study of violent crime explored from both the perspective of the victim's family and the men who carried out the senseless crime. On the victims side are the mother and father, as well as friends and co-workers. On the other are two of the four men convicted of the murder. In the middle, mediating, is Senior Sergeant Terry O'Connell of the NSW Police Service. The meeting offers an opportunity for all those traumatized by the event to hear the other side of the story. It allows all parties the chance to air their feelings and opinions and to vent pent up emotions. The outcome for the viewer though is the reiteration that crime is truly senseless."
