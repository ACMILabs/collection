        "Set in the early days of the Bosnian War, this film is based around the relationship of two young men who find themselves on opposing sides in the conflict. Holed up in a tunnel, the Serbian soldiers strive to maintain their bawdy sense of humour while under siege from Muslim soldiers who are torturing and killing those around them. The continuing problem of accountability is highlighted, as soldiers on each side deny responsibility for the atrocities which have affected the other. Meanwhile, their country is torn apart. A powerful anti-war film that conveys the futility of war through the often ironic use of popular music, including a rendition of John Lennon's \"Give peace a chance\". In Serbian with English subtitles."
