        "A training film aimed at developing management skills. Tom, the \"Mate\" has difficulty accepting leadership responsibilities and fails to provide firmness and direction to his work group. Harriet, the \"Martyr\" is constantly snowed under with work because she is disorganised and fails to delegate work to her staff. Rick, the \"Master\" avoids risks for fear of making mistakes. Dr. Warren Burrows, Motivation Specialist, assists in examining and improving their management skills. Made in association with the Victorian Film Corporation and the Australian Film Commission."
