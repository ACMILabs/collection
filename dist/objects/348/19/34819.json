        "Is Cannes really like St Kilda, or is it just a state of mind? Animated watercolour drawings and handcoloured photocopies of photographs shape this introspective reflection on the nature of landscape and the human response to it. Technically impressive, atmospherically scored and quite hypnotic in its effect, this is a very distinguished work."
