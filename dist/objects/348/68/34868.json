        "Episode of Series \"Wind in the Willows Series\". An enchanting puppet musical that captures the beauty of the English countryside and a way of life that disappeared with the decline of the British Empire. The film features favourite characters; Rat, Mole, Badger and Toad of Toad Hall. Based on the story by Kenneth Grahame and adapted by Rosemary Anne Sisson."
