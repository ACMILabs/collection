        "In October 1986, Victorian nurses began an historic strike action which was to last 50 days. This video is the nurses version of the dispute. Despite widespread condemnation mainly from the media, the nurses eventually won out for an appropriate career structure including significant pay increases. Actual strike footage together with nursing training films and old photographs explore vocational stereotypes and place the strike in the context of the current crisis in the health care system."
