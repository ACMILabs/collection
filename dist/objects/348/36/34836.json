        "A collection of three classic, silent avant-garde films. Bunuel and Dali's surrealist nightmare \"Un Chien Andalou\" (1929) which caused a riot at its Paris premiere. Rene Clair's dada-surrealist classic \"Entr'acte\" (1924) in which inanimate objects start to have a will of their own. Made in collaboration with Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picarbia. Jean Vigos' \"A Propos de Nice\" which is a fascinating study in contrasts between the tourists and sunseekers of the wealthy section of Nice and the toilers of the poor sections of the old town. A carnival in the latter part of the film emerges as a kind of dance of death."
