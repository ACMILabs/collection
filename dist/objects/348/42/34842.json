        "The Journey is a fourteen and a half hour film, shown in six parts. It is not a conventional narrative film and at times, it moves slowly, deliberately allowing silence, time to think about what we have heard. \"The Journey\" examines aspects of the global nuclear arms industry, and, while it gives us a great deal of information, it is the voices of families from many parts of the world that we hear, voicing their fears, their discoveries, their hopes and their anger about the silencing of their voices by the media and information systems that stand between us and the truth."
