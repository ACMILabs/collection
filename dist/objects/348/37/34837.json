        "This film depicts the metaphorical adventures of a poet and is composed of four episodes: \"The Wounded hand or the scars of the poet\"; \"Do walls have ears\"; \"The Snow ball fight\"; \"The Profanation of the host\". The movie has an avant-garde roughness and unpredictability in its construction and use ofsymbols, but it is fundamentally a very characteristic, neo-Romantic study of the joy and agonies of being an artist. It remains extremely interesting and a source of Cocteau's later work. In French dialogue only - no English subtitles."
