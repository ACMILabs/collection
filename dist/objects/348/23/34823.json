        "This film captures the feel of salt in a seaside village and the rigours of shipboard life through the adventures of Tim, a gallant stowaway. The sweeping power of the wild ocean and angry sky, and a swirl of greens and greys are forcefully projected while lively sea shanties and the call of gulls accent the storytelling. Based on the well known children's book by Edward Ardizzone."
