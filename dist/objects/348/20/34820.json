        "This is a rare look into the private world of Maurice Sendak, who describes the significant events of his own life and their impact on his work. Who are the monsters in \"Where the Wild Things Are\"? Why does everything good happen while children are asleep? How did the Lindberg kidnapping affect the fantasy of \"Outside, Over There\"? What influence did the personal tragedy of the Holocaust have on the characterisations Sendak has created?"
