        "After being forced from their tribal grounds, the Murrowarri were dumped onto a tiny reserve on the fringe of a white town. In this film Essie Coffey, black activist and musician, shows the conflicts of living as an Aboriginal under white domination. This film is part of her effort to make her community proud of their black identity while struggling to survive."
