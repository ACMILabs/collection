        "It is not just the threatening capacity of global nuclear war nor the disfiguration of natural ecological forces but rather it is the work people do that indicates the end of their use on this planet. If not destructive and wasteful in its own right modern work relies on others being so. This is a critical film essay about the final phase of work. It is built in seven parts which correspond to each day of the week."
