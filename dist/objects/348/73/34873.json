        "The game is called Beatie Bow and the children play it for the thrill of scaring themselves. When Abigail is drawn in, the game is quickly transformed into an extraordinary adventure when she realises that somehow, through some eerie time shift, she had arrived in \"The Rocks\" of one hundred years ago. Stars Peter Phelps and Nikki Coghill. Based on the novel by Ruth Park."
