        "A pair of owls live happily together in an old ruin. One of the birds from a neighbouring farm, a peacock, observes their happiness and wonders at this achievement, as the birds he lives with are always squabbling and discontented. When the ducks, chicks and geese have congregated together the owls tell them a story illustrating the secret of their happiness. Unfortunately the birds refuse to believe or to learn. Based on the book by Celestino Piatti."
