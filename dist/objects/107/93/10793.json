        "Telling Tales are real stories told and produced by people with a disability and those who are disadvantaged. Telling Tales challenges the 'norms' as often represented by mainstream film with first person accounts that provide a real opportunity to be seen and heard.  The stories explore personal journeys of identity, displacement, relationships, longing and memory. Telling Tales was produced in partnership with Arts Access and supported by the Department of Human Services and the Deafness Foundation for Telling Tales"
