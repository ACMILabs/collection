        "The latest `chapter' of the remarkable Weather Diary series finds Kuchar observing his personal, social and natural environment with wry humor and introspection. Writes Kuchar: `Set in central Oklahoma during May, I spend 3 weeks in a motel and get talked at by a small weather-radio that seems to rule my life. I, myself, get to talk at the lady who runs the motel and who runs a cosmetic empire downtown. The viewer gets to see her equipment and her corner of the world as storms lurk somewhere off-camera, waiting to enter stage left and bring down the house. This is one of the more social installments of the weather diary series'."
