        "An unusual angle on London indicating the wealth of history concealed under crowded streets. Looks at many of the underground services which play an important role in the life of the city; the great electricity tunnels under the Battersea Power Station and the Thames; the water mains and the labyrinth sewers; the Postal Service tube railways; the Chancery Lane silver vaults; and a 700 year old carmelite crypt. Narrated by Tim Turner."
