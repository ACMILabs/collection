        "An animated film, in a humorous vein, showing how seasonal unemployment may be greatly lessened if industry, and the public generally, avail themselves of the increased labor supply during winter lay-offs. The advice comes from someone who knows--a gentleman thief and safecracker whose nefarious but highly skilled profession gives him a particular advantage in assessing the state of business, and the contents of strong boxes, during the winter fall-off of work. How the situation may be rectified with a little foresight and imagination is amply and amusingly illustrated. Animation by Gerald Potterton and commentary by Guy Glover."
