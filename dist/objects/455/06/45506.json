        "A behind the scenes view of what is involved in the making of a children's television program. Students can witness first hand the entire process from the conception of an idea to the end product in production. 'Making television' begins with the script writers (Grant Cathro and Lee Pressman) in search of an idea, then follows the process through to rehearsals and conferences. The actors involved discuss their perceptions of the characters they play, and the director gives us an idea of their role in bringing all the disparate elements together at the filming stage. The value of the studio is emphasised while set design and special effects are also explored."
