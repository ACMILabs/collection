        "Follows the life of Churchill from his entry into politics, his part in World War I, his early prediction of World War II and his defiant unconquerable leadership of his government, Britain, and the free world against Hitler. He saw his statue unveiled in Guild Hall, became Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports; and was revered by all on his 80th birthday - he became a legend in his lifetime. Includes 1911 film footage of Churchill as Home Secretary at the siege of Sydney Street, London's East End. Commentary by Wynford Vaughan-Thomas."
