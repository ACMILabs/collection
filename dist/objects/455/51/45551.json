        "Episode of Series \"The Researchers\". Siroseeder is a machine designed to spray a herbicide, cultivate the soil in narrow rows, insert seed and fertilizer at a predetermined depth, replace the soil and press it down lightly. Normally. farmers could use four implements and make up to eight passes to do the same job. If these and other experiments are fruitful, inputs of time, labour and fuel will fall dramatically, as will the risk of soil erosion."
