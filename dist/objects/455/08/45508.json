        "One of the great and universal styles of modern writing is the review, as everything from restaurants to motorcars are reviewed in the printed format. Television reviewer Jackie Stephen shares with the audience how she goes about the process of research and writing, the problems posed by different genres, and the constraints of writing for a family newspaper. Emphasis is placed on her review of the television comedy series \"Hale and Pace\"."
