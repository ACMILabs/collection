        "For the people of Papua and New Guinea the time when the family patch of land was the basis of society and the foundation of existence is passing. Commercial agriculture has been introduced and opportunities of wage earning are raising living standards. Main products are copra, coconut oil, coffee, and cocoa. Agricultural research stations have been established by the Administration for the benefit of both white settlers and native growers. Government Co-operative buying has been introduced and the new economic opportunities have enabled the people to become partners with the Administration. The cocoa industry is showing particularly rapid development."
