        "Making clouds rain has been the subject of intensive research in several countries since the mid-40's. This study is the story of rainmaking in Australia - from the first tentative experiments with dry ice to the present, large-scale operations using silver iodide as the seeding agent. The film gives an account of the basic theory of cloud-seeding and outlines the techniques used in its practical application. Contains good aerial footage and use of instructional maps to describe cloud formation and rainfall."
