        "History on the Run examines the media's coverage of Canada's federal election of May, 1979. Spanning a three-week period, it is literally filmed \"on the run.\" A fascinating look at journalists in action, it is also an opportunity to glimpse political figures behind the scenes and their attempts to manipulate the media."
