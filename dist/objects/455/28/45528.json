        "In Elvis' 29th film he plays it straight in a Western written and directed by the creator of \"Gunsmoke\", \"Rawhide\" and \"The Virginian\". Elvis is cast as ex-outlaw Jess Wade, a man determined to stick to the straight and narrow and reform his ways. Wade is captured by his former band of outlaws. The gang then goes on to terrorise a small town by threatening to use an ornate Mexican canon on the village - a canon which Wade is falsely accused of stealing from the Mexican revolutionary forces. Cast also includes Ina Balin, Victor French, Barbara Werle and Lynn Kellogg. Elvis sings only one song in the movie."
