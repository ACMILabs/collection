        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Wonders of the universe\". In the first of these three episodes, \"To the edge of time\" explores our place in the cosmic scheme as we try to measure the universe. Explains how we accurately measure distance in space, investigates the \"Big Bang\" theory and ponders the possibility that our continuously expanding universe may one day end in the \"Big crunch\". Episode two, \"Once in a lifetime\" examines Halley's comet, which makes an appearance in our skies once every 76 years as regular as clockwork. If you've ever wondered where it goes for the rest of the time, the answer is here! Episode three, \"Solar system superlatives\" looks at the biggest, the smallest, the hottest, the coldest, the highest and the deepest - a tour of record-breaking wonders of the solar system."
