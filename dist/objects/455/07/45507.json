        "Witness upper primary students as they try their hand at first time directing. This short tape briefly covers everything from how to take the lens cap off and load the video camera, watching the director at work, getting the best take, editing, sound and improvising. One thing is for sure, what they lack in years they make up for in confidence and enthusiasm towards putting themselves and their schoolfriend's in the picture."
