        "Three 25 minute segments dramatically explore the subject weather in \"rain and floods\", \"deserts\" and \"tornadoes\". The first segment clearly explains what influences and creates the water cycle; differences in cloud formation and the life of a cloud; how and why light or heavy rain falls, and looks at the causes and effects of extreme flooding using the Mississippi and Bangladesh as main examples (also why Hawaii is wettest place on earth but does not suffer flooding). Contains many tidbits of interest, including an easy class experiment on how to measure a raindrop. The second segment looks at deserts and the geography and climatic conditions that form them, specifically the Sahara, Kalahari, Gobi, Antartic, Death Valley and Mars. Includes how sand dunes are formed (some are stable for centuries, others are dynamic), and Bedouin and camel adaption to desert extremes. The third segment looks at tornadoes, \"the most violent weather phenomena\". Explains how and why they form and develop, why they are so powerful and sudden, and the best defence. Focuses on \"tornado alley\" (Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas), and the tornado \"chasers\" - newsmen and scientists who go to extreme lengths to predict the location of the next tornado. Dramatic and interesting visual images throughout."
