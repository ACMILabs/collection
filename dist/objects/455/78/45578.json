        "During the short Arctic summer on Baffin Island, the native Inuit enjoys four months of continuous daylight. But it is not time for relaxation, for provision must be made for the long, cold winter night ahead. In this film Idlouk, an Inuit hunter, tells of his life in the northern land. We watch as he stalks the seal so vital to his existance, and as he and other hunters set out in kayaks to harpoon the white whale and the narwhal. At camp we meet his wife, children and aged parents, each of whom has work to do in the unceasing struggle for survival in this harsh land. (Six awards. including Chicago; Durban; Cortina d'Ampezzo)"
