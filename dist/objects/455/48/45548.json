        "Sci-five is a film about five very different young Australians who share an absorbing curiousity about the world. It contains interviews with Darren Kelly, Geraldine Milroy, Robert Sinclair, Lindy Coulson and Tim Allen. Each of the five has been a finalist in the BHP Science Prize and their projects provide a focus around which we explore their lives in more detail. The film aims to disprove the common assumption that science is \"too hard and too boring\" an option for young people. It has no objective commentary, using instead the insights of the teenage scientists themselves. A mosaic structure juxtaposes and intercuts their stories to create a rfascinating documentation of ideas and motives."
