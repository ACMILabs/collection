        "A day in the life of a streetcar motorman shows him transporting hundreds of people to their places of business or to and from stores. We are shown the public as individuals, with little idiosyncracies and personal approaches to boarding a streetcar-amusing, or not, depending on the point of view-which are received with equanimity by the long-suffering driver. Photographed by Lorne C. Batchelor."
