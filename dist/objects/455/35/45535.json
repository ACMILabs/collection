        "Until the 20th century the native farmers of the Gold Coast of Africa were ignorant of the plough and the wheel. Today, their primitive farming methods are being improved through expert instruction, and there are centres where they can learn about dipping, vaccinating, feeding, and improving the quality of their cattle. Commentary by Julian Huxley."
