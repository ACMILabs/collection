To celebrate the construction of the Glass Tower, the world's tallest building, architect Doug Roberts and builder James Duncan hold a gala event on the highest floors. The trouble is that Duncan's son-in-law and electrical subcontractor, Roger Simmons, installed faulty wiring throughout the 138-story tower to save money. While the town VIPs enjoy the party, a security guard wonders why his equipment is malfunctioning, only to discover that a burnt-out circuit breaker has ignited some rubbish on the 85th floor, which is swiftly turning the skyscraper into a \"towering inferno\". It is then up to Roberts and Fire Chief O'Hallorhan to find a way to stop the blaze. Cast includes Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Richard Chamberlain, Jennifer Jones, O.J. Simpson, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner and more..."
