        "Jessica Lange stars as country-western singer Patsy Cline, whose tragic death in 1963 cut short one of the most fabulous success stories in the annals of popular music. In contrast with Cline's rise to fame in the years between 1956 and 1963, her private life was turbulent and tragic. As the wife of hard-drinking Charlie Dick (Ed Harris), Patsy is subjected to all manner of abuse and humiliation, yet she stays on. A happy second marriage is all too short-lived, as is Patsy herself. Patsy Cline's fans may notice that Robert Gretchell's screenplay takes quite a few liberties with details of Patsy's life."
