        "Recalls Scotland's efforts in pioneering housing schemes and gives details of the immediate postwar plans for building. Looks at temporary structures, to meet emergency needs; two-family dwellings which can later be converted into single dwellings; and permanent modern homes. Although the film deals with a serious subject, its approach is occasionaly light and humourous."
