        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Wonders of the universe\". Episode one of these three episodes, \"Light fantastic\" explores the realm of galaxies beyond the Milky Way and explains how modern astronomy has unveiled the wonders of a universe of interdependence where galaxies, clusters and super-clusters collide, entwine and unravel one another. \"The Blue Planet\" explores how Earth might appear to alien travellers from another world. How the sun drives our weather, why the tilt of the Earth causes the seasons, and what causes the variations in the length of day and night. \"Big Bang big mystery\" looks at the story of cosmology's most popular creation theory : the notion that everything started in a cataclysmic eruption."
