        "The film examines stress in biological, social and emotional terms and outlines various methods for overcoming its health-threatening effects. Aided by interpretations from stress specialists, the film focuses principally on how different people experience and cope with stress in their daily lives. Several less conventional ways in which people cope with stress are shown: a company recreation project, a community sports program, meditation, yoga, Tai Chi, acupuncture and biofeedback. The film concludes by describing some of the tell-tale signs of stress, and encouraging sufferers to take action."
