        "This film shows Toscanini conducting pieces by Verdi and also focuses on his and other Italians efforts to fight fascism in Europe by living and working as exiles in America. Music includes La Forza del Oestino and Hymn of the Nations, the second piece being the one Toscanini chose to play on the day Italy was liberated from the fascists. Features Arturo Toscanini as conductor, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, Jan Peerce (tenor) and the Westminster Choir."
