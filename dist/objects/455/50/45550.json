        "When Katya (Michelle Pfeiffer), a beautiful Russian book editor attempts to send British publisher Barley Blair (Sean Connery) a manuscript written by \"Dante\" (Klaus Maria Brandauer), a noted scientist, she unwittingly involves him in a world of international espionage. The explosive manuscript - which, if published in the West could dramatically alter the global balance of world power - is intercepted by the West's spy-masters, who then send Blair to Russia to gain more information on the mysterious manuscript. But when Blair, who has a deep affection for Russia and its people finds himself falling in love with the beautiful Katya, he must decide whose side he really is on. This adaptation of a novel by John Le Carre was scripted by playwright Tom Stoppard. It features a score by Jerry Goldsmith with Brandon Marsalis as a soloist. Other cast members include James Fox, Roy Scheider, J. T. Walsh and John Mahoney. (Awards: Golden Globe 1991: best actress for Michelle Pfeiffer)"
