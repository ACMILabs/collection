        "Australia has accepted the responsibility of training and assisting the people of Papua and New Guinea who are on the threshold of a more complex way of life. Education at the primary level for some is being established. Health services include the provision of hospitals and doctors and the training of young men and women to teach sanitation and hygiene. Religious teaching is undertaken by Missions, and European sports and pastimes are taking the place of tribal feasts."
