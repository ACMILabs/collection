        "A young boy, Tony Walker (Anthony Kemp) has a habit of calling the police for crimes that don't exist. Tony discovers that two men are planning to kidnap the Prime Minister - needless to say, no-one believes him. Finally Tony and his group of friends foil the efforts of the would-be kidnappers. Cast includes Ian Hendry, Wilfred Bramble, Maurice Kaufmann, Eileen Moore and Alfred Bell."
