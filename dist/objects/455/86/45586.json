        "During the years 1956-1969 Frank Bagnall produced a series tracing the involvement of the Army, Navy and Airforce services during the Second World War. The series is comprised almost entirely of actual footage and is united by the themes of human effort and sacrifice. The individual episodes are available separately in the collection on 16mm. NAVY: illustrates the conditions of active service in the Royal Australian Navy in the war including missions such as an Island invasion with America, and defending bases in New Guinea and Northern Australia. ARMY: records the Australian soldier's participation in the Second World War. Covers fighting in Libya, Greece, Crete, Syria and Tripoli, and the Singapore, New Guinea and Borneo campaigns. AIRFORCE: Australian airmen serve their country admirably, earning distinction in areas as widely separated as New Guinea and Europe. Victory comes at a cost however as machines and men are lost in the name of conflict. Repackaged by Film Australia in 1995."
