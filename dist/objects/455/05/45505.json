        "This video has been produced by television production professionals with the video camera novice in mind. It covers the following crucial areas to consider when attempting to create a more watchable and enjoyable tape: forward planning, camera technique, lighting and sound, and an emphasis on practicing often to perfect the techniques described. The specific techniques include; how to operate the camera effectively, how to light a scene, record the sound occurring within a scene, when to consider adjusting the camera's colour balance, focussing, exposure, stability, composition of the picture, changing angles for interest and care of the equipment."
