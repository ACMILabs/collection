        "Heartfelt valentine to early days of moviemaking, with O'Neal literally stumbling into his job as director, and Reynolds as an overnight screen hero. Before making this tribute to the brilliant, haphazard early days of Hollywood filmmaking, director/screenwriter Peter Bogdanovich interviewed several veteran filmmakers including John Ford, Raoul Walsh, Allan Dwan and Howard Hawks."
