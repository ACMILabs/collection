        "Ian McKellen and Judi Dench star as Lord and Lady Macbeth in what is considered to be one of the best productions of Macbeth. McKellen won the 1976 Plays and Players Best Actor award and Judi Dench the 1977 Society of West End Theatres' Best Actress award for their roles. A small group of actors create the play for a small audience in an intimate atmosphere. Intense and compelling, the production uses the costumes and props of the Royal Shakespeare Company."
