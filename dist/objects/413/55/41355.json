        "Steele Rudd's classic Dad and Dave stories represent what is both noble and comic in colonial society. The Rudd's are a loud, unconventional farming family, ekeing out a living in the harsh conditions of the bush with little respect for authority. Stereotypical \"fair dinkum Aussies\", Dad's blustering and Ma's stoicism hold the family together. This film features the talents of an all-star cast including Leo McKern, Dame Joan Sutherland, Geoffrey Rush, Ray Barrett, Nicholas Eadie, Noah Taylor and Barry Otto, with songs and music by Peter Best."
