        "Michael Douglas, Glenn Close and Anne Archer star in this gripping, if at times inconsistent thriller. A passionate week-end encounter ends Dan Gallagher's perfect life. Alex refuses to be a woman scorned and her capacity for revenge and violence is without limit. The conclusion is unforgettably shattering as the nightmare draws to its inevitable \"bloody\" climax. Glenn Close gives an excellent, terrifying performance as the homicidal Alex as the film grapples with men's subconscious fears about women."
