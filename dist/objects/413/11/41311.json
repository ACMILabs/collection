        "Guilt and love gone awry are the themes of this early Hitchcock film, the last of his silent films. Peter, a fisherman and Philip, a rich lawyer, have been friends since their childhood but fall in love with the same woman. Peter asks Philip to propose for him, but Kate's father does not approve of the marriage. Peter leaves to seek his fortune and Philip courts Kate. When they hear of Peter's death, the two become lovers. However Peter returns and marries Kate and she bears Philip's child. Based on the classic theme of the eternal triangle. Although this Hitchcock film is not as well known, it is a must-see for film buffs."
