        "Episode of Series \"Lonely planet: the experience\". British traveller, Ian Wright, presents an informal tour through the small towns and rugged wilderness of Alaska. His journey begins at Eagle, on the Canadian border then heads south to Prince William Sound, and finally north to the vast Katmai National Park and the Arctic Circle. Along the way he meets goldminers, trappers, salmon fishers and a kayak builder. Creature comforts are few and far between but the scenery and wildlife are magnificent. Whales and dolphins cavort in the icy fjords, fed by glaciers, and brown bears share the salmon fishing with the tourists."
