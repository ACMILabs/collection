        "Australia was the first country in the world to have a 40 hour working week, which accompanied by an array of public holidays, led to the identification of Australia as the working man's paradise, a mythical land of the long weekend. This film examines how, in the face of deregulation and restructuring, long term unemployment and 24 hour trading, Australians have structured and restructured their time. Will Australians, drunk on sunshine, rally in time to save their precious weekend - or has it, in the drive to be flexible and efficient, already been lost?"
