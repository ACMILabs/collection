        "The aim of this program is to provide employees with an awareness of the Sexual Harassment issue and the role organisations play in determining policy and action. The program gives insight into the issue by dramatising several realistic situations which constitute harassment and by stressing the need for co-operative effort to deal with it. The video is accompanied by a manual which may be borrowed as a separate loan item."
