        "The Emperors of China conquered the world and then locked it out. Cinematographer, Zhao Fei, takes his cameras into the inner sanctums of the Forbidden City, to explore the private world of emperors, concubines and eunuchs, who lived in palaces with lavish gardens and temples. Re-creations based on Imperial archives and rare manuscripts create a fascinating portrait of a way of life and tradition hidden for hundreds of years. Narrated by Rod Steiger."
