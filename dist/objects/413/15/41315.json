        "Cecil B. DeMille's classic Biblical epic, with a galaxy of stars led by Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Pharoah. It is the story of the life of Moses from birth and abandonment through manhood, slavery and the trials of turning his back on a privileged life in the Pharoah's household and leading his people, the Jews out of Egypt and to freedom. Filmed in Egypt and the Sinai with one of the biggest sets ever constructed for a motion picture, this is a unique and motion picture experience with the parting of the Red Sea and the writing of the tablets being unforgettable highlights. Oscar winning special effects."
