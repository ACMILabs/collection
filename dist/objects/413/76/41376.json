        "Adam West and Burt Ward starred as the \"Caped Crusaders\", Batman and Robin, in the highly popular '60's television series which spoofed the comic strip created by Bob Kane. In this feature length film, the \"Dynamic Duo\" battle against the archfiends of the underworld; Joker, Riddler, Penguin and Catwoman. These underworld criminals plot to steal the Total Dehydrator, abduct nine members of the UN Security Council and hold the world to ransom. \"Will our heroes Batman and Robin, the boy wonder, thwart the evildoers in their nefarious plan?\""
