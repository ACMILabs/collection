        "Join your favourite prehistoric past, Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Spike and Pete - plus three mischevious new dinosaurs - for another exciting adventure. A huge meteorite has plunged into the Great Valley, cutting off the water supply and causing tension among the once peaceful dinosaurs. Eager to help, Littlefoot and his friends search for more water and find a large pool trapped between the Great Valley and the Mysterious Beyond, home of the dreaded Sharpteeth! Even though danger is close at hand, Littlefoot learns that through cooperation and team spirit you can move mountains. Animation produced by Nelson Shin."
