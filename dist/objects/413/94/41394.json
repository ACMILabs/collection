        "Episode of Series \"Andy Hardy Series\". The fourth film in the series and the first to put Andy's name in the title. The story moves at a jitterbug pace along comic and heartfelt storylines. Andy (Mickey Rooney) is in a fix as he has made dates for the Christmas dance with steady girlfriend Polly (Anne Rutherford) and voluptuous Cynthia (Lana Turner). Meanwhile Dad (Lewis Stone) must oversee the household while Mum (Fay Holden) is caring for Grandma. The new kid next door (Judy Garland in the first of three fondly remembered Andy Hardy appearances) helps Andy out of his jam and how she does it is an absolute delight, as are her renditions of \"It never rains but what it pours\", \"In-Between\" and \"Meet the beat of my heart.\""
