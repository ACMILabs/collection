        "Episode of Series \"Lonely planet: the experience\". Justine Shapiro travels off the beaten track on a tour of Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands. She visits hot springs heated by a volcano, views the countryside from the roof of a train and almost tries roast guinea pig. A highlight of the journey is a visit to the Amazon forest, guided by the indigenous people of the area. The Galapagos Islands were made famous by Charles Darwin in developing his theory of evolution and are home to a fascinating diversity of wildlife, with many species found nowhere else in the world."
