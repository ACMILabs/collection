        "Alan Bates gives an eery performance in this twisted tale of mind control, primitive power and the dark side of the soul. Bates plays a tramp-like figure named Crossley who claims to have spent many years with the Australian Aboriginals learning their ancient magic and claims to have learnt the power to kill with a shout. The film is a tale by Crossley during a cricket match in an insane asylum. The story centres on Crossley's meeting with a seemingly loving young couple, he (John Hurt) a successful composer and she (Susannah York) a dedicated nurse in a small village. Crossley seduces the wife and in the process gains an ever increasing power over the couple. With a gripping ending that will have you on the edge of your seat, this is an intriguing film which questions the definition of madness."
