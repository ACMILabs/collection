        "By acclaimed writer Dennis Potter, \"Lipstick on your collar\" is a romantic comedy which transports the viewer back to the 1950's and the era of rock and roll. Mick Hopper, working in the War Office as part of his National Service, uses his imagination to escape the drudgery and bully boy officers. By transporting them into his fantasies as rock and roll singers he deals with the harshness of life. When Private Francis, a young Welshman joins Mick, they join forces. Often astonishing and never dull, \"Lipstick on your collar\" is a must for all Dennis Potter fans."
