        "Based on the novel \"The Wooden Horse\" by Eric Williams. This is a classic wartime escape film which will not fail to enthrall. Many attempts were made to escape Nazi prison camps and a band of British officers planned a daring, ingenious escape from the notorious Stalag Luft III. Tunnelling under an exercise horse, they fought a dangerous battle to survive. Starring Leo Genn, David Tomlinson and Anthony Steel."
