        "The National Film and Sound Archive has assembled a superb compilation of historic footage which follows the growth and development of the Blue Mountains, one of the most spectacular natural features of the Australian continent. Original commentary has been retained and music selected by the NFSA has been added to the silent segments. The footage has been gleaned from home movies, documentaries and newsreels and amongst the many items of interest is the feature on Norman Lindsay's house and garden."
