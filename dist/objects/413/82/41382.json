        "Jodie Foster is mesmerising in her role as Nell, a woman raised in an isolated wilderness. When her mother dies, Nell is forced to face a whole new world of discovery, fear and people who want to strip her of her once protected innocence. Her precarious journey into modern society is carefully monitored by Dr. Jerome Lovell (Liam Neeson) and psychologist, Paula Olson (Natasha Richardson) who are moved by Nell's special untouched spirit and purity. Co-starring Richard Libertini, Nick Searcy, Jeremy Davies and O'Neal Compton. Based on the play \"Idioglossia\" by Mark Handley."
