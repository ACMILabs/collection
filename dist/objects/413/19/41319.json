        "Charles Dickens' classic tale is brought to the screen with an excellent cast of Paul Scofield, John Mills, Pete Postlethwaite, Tom Wilkinson and Julia Sawalha. Martin Chuzzlewit is a very wealthy old man. Having disinherited his grandson Martin, he only trusts his companion, the orphan Mary Graham, employed on the understanding that she will get no money. With a fortune to grasp, Chuzzlewit's family bring forth all their cunning, greed and selfishness. There is the snivelling hypocrite Pecksniff with his two daughters Mercy and Charity and the evil Jonas who will resort to murder to gain the money."
