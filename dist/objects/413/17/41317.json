        "The \"Young Ones\" launched themselves onto television with their own brand of anarchic comedy. Written by Ben Elton, Rik Mayall and Lise Mayer with Alexei Sayle, \"The Young ones\" stars Adrian Edmondson, Rik Mayall, Christopher Ryan and Nigel Planer. Five classic episodes are featured. A potentially explosive situation erupts when a bomb lands in the house in \"Bomb.\" The guys are so BORED that Vyvian cuts off his finger in \"Bored.\" Can the boys hold their own on University Challenge in \"Bambi.\" \"Interesting\" sees the boys throw a party. Rik's idol Cliff Richard does not star in the \"Young Ones\" own version of Summer Holiday."
