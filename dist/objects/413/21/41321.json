        "Don't bother to knock features a rarely seen dark side to Marilyn Monroe's usual performances. While babysitting in a hotel, she begins a flirtation with one of the guests (Richard Widmark). He is on the rebound after breaking up with his girlfriend (Anne Bancroft), and is willingly seduced by the babysitter. When the baby awakes and disturbs their lovemaking, Monroe becomes deranged and terrorizes both the man and child. The film gives a chilling glimpse into the mind of a homicidal personality."
