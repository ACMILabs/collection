        "Dr. Richard Walker (Harrison Ford), an American cardiologist, is plunged into an emotional nightmare when he discovers his wife has mysteriously vanished during their visit to Paris. He sets out to find her, and begins to fear the city itself as he grapples with a bewildering web of language, locale, laissez-faire cops and indifferent bureaucrats. Walker's only chance at finding his wife alive seems to rest with a streetwise waif with underworld connections (Emmanuelle Seigner). Cast also includes Betty buckley, JHohn Mahoney, Jimmie Ray Weeks, David Huddleston."
