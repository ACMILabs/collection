        "A story of lust, power and love set in 16th Century England. Henry VIII (Richard Burton) lusted after women, especially those that were unattainable, in his desire to produce a male heir to the throne. His wife Catherine of Aragon (Irene Papas) only bore him a daughter and was past childbearing. In 1527, he fell in love with Anne Boleyn (Genevieve Bujold), who vowed to bear him sons. He divorced Catherine, broke from the Catholic Church and on the 25th January 1533 secretly married Anne. For this and other indiscretions, he was excommunicated. However, Henry was fickle, and his union with Anne would last for just 1000 days and from this time onwards, the power of the Monarchy, State and Church were irrevocably changed."
