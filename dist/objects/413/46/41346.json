        "Twenty years after his acclaimed \"The Last Picture Show\", Peter Bogdanovich returns to the small town of Texasville to investigate what happened to the characters who inhabited the initial film. Duane (Jeff Bridges) is now an oil businessman whose company is going broke and his marriage to the vivacious Karla (Annie Potts) is on the rocks. A chance encounter with his old high school flame Jayce (Cybil Shepherd) precipitates a mid-life crisis for Duane and he begins to question his philandering and his refusal to let go of the past. The performances are what makes this film wonderful, with excellent performances by the entire cast. Engaging and humane, \"Texasville\" is a bittersweet elegy to growing old and the slowly extinguishing values of small-town life. Based on the novel by Larry McMurty."
