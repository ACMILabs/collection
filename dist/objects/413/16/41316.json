        "Daniel Auteil and Emmanuelle Beart (the leading actors from Manon Des Sources) star in this triangular love story which explores the darker recesses of the heart and soul; where emotion is repressed. Two longtime friends in the classical music world find their friendship is threatened when a beautiful woman enters their lives. Ravel's music forms a striking background to the drama as one woman embarks on a journey of surrender to passion."
