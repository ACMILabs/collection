        "Debonair playboy Nickie Ferrante (Cary Grant) and beautiful nightclub singer Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr) meet travelling first class aboard a transatlantic luxury liner courtesy of two other people. She is a tycoon's mistress and he is engaged to an heiress. Their sudden, but undeniable love affair leads them to make a vow - that they will break off their current relationships, get jobs and meet in six months to continue their affair. However, a tragic accident prevents Terry from keeping their rendezvous and the lovers future takes an emotional and uncertain turn. This film is a remake of Leo McCarey's \"Love Story\" and Vic Damone croons the title tune on the soundtrack."
