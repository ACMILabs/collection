        "Alfred Tennyson's epic poem about the fated charge by the Light Brigade at Balaklava in the Crimean War, immortalised a military legend. This is a fictionalised acccount of this suicidal charge. Major Geoffrey Vickers (Errol Flynn) leads the 27th Lancers against Indian Chieftan Surat Khan who has joined forces with the Russians. Within this scenario, Vickers is involved in a tumultous love triangle with his brother and beautiful fiance (Olivia De Haviland). Directed by Michael Curtiz who also directed \"Casablanca\" and \"The Adventures of Robin Hood.\" The classic charge at the film's conclusion is an inspired piece of filming."
