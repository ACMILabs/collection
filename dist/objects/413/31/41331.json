        "Episode of Series \"Lonely planet: the experience\". Ian Wright tours the north east coast of Brazil, starting from the large port of Salvador, the capital for 300 years, and filled with the architectural remnants of the Portuguese Empire. His journey ends at the mouth of the great Amazon River at Belem. The program offers a tantalizing glimpse of life in Brazil, beyond the more obvious tourist centres, from forest to villages to busy ports. Ian learns how to scale a palm tree, joins a street party during Carnival, visits exotic markets and attends an obscure local ritual of music and dance that lasts all night."
