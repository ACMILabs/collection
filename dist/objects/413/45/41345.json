        "Based on the play by Noel Coward, Hitchcock's version of what Coward intended as a comedy was produced as a melodrama. Larita Filton, a married woman, falls in love with a young artist. When he suicides, Larita divorces her drunken husband and travels abroad. There she meets John Whittaker who knows nothing of her past. His mother finds out the truth about Larita and compells John to divorce her. Hitchock appears in this film strolling past a tennis court. It is a must see for Hitchcock film buffs."
