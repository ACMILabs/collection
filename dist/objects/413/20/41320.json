        "In this emotionally-charged film about prejudices and human frailty, Tom Hanks stars as Andrew Beckett, a brilliant young lawyer battling AIDS, who is suddenly fired by his prestigious firm. Fighting for both his life and his professional reputation, Beckett hires street-wise personal injury attorney, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington in a power-house performance), to represent him as he sues the firm for wrongful termination. Seperated from Beckett by a deep social and cultural chasm, Miller has to challenge his own prejudices and fears if he is to take on the system and win. Honoured with an Academy Award for his brilliant performance, Tom Hanks leads a strong cast which includes Jason Robards, Mary Steenburgen and Antonio Banderas as Hank's lover."
