        "A gripping, moving film with an all star cast and based on the book by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts. It is the tragic tale of 937 German Jewish refugees who left Nazi Germany in 1939 on a ship bound for Cuba. The voyage was part of a propaganda exercise by Goebbels who had arranged that the ship would not be allowed to dock in Havana. As the ship headed towards the United States, President Roosevelt denied entry to the ship. A return to Hamburg would mean certain death in the concentration camps, a fate which the passengers resolved to prevent."
