        "Episode of Series \"Blue wilderness\". The Shadow on the reef looks at the incredible Whale Shark, the world's largest shark. Valerie and Ron Taylor explore the wonders of the deep below the coral reef, emphasising the message that this fragile ecology is increasingly under threat. \"Turning Turtle\" sees Ron and Valerie Taylor at odds with the Queensland Government over the fate of turtles on coral islands. The Green Turtles are a rare and ancient species and the fight to save them pits the Taylors against bureaucracy and harsh physical conditions."
