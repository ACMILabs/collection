        "Episode of Series \"Face the press\". Paolo Totaro hosts a discussion between Rhoda Roberts (Vox Populi), Sonia Voumard (The Age) and Mandawauy Yunupingu (teacher, musican, ambassador and father), on the eve of National Aborigines Day. Mandawuy explores the ways he is bridging the gap between black and white culture through both his band Yothu Yindi, the first aboriginal band to make the charts and to sign with an American record company; and as the Principal of the Yirrkala Community School in North East Arnhem Land, where, as the first aboriginal headmaster, he devised the curriculum mix of aboriginal and western studies known as \"Both Ways Education\"."
