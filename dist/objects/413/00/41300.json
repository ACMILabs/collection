        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Absolutely fabulous\". A collection of three episodes from the hilarious British comedy, \"Absolutely Fabulous\". \"Isotank\": Edwina sulks in her isolation tank, banished from the kitchen because Saffie is working on a science project with her friends. However, the arrival of Patsy upsets all their good work. \"Birthday\": Edwina is not coping with the fact that she is turning 40. Saffie organises a party for her but the guest of honour will not cooperate. Especially when ex-husband number one brings his New Age Californian girlfriend and ex-husband number two brings his boyfriend. \"Magazine\": Patsy has to deal with presenting a segment on a morning television programme, dealing with her high-powered editor, and (tragedy of tragedies) Edwina has scored a guy and she hasn't. Will the cocaine and vodka be enough to get her through? The usual mixture of high camp, drug and alcohol-tinged exaggerated theatrics and wonderful comic writing. With Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley. Co-written by Dawn French."
