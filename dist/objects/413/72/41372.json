        "Wai Tung, a successful real estate investor lives in New York with his lover Simon. Wai Tung's parents, wondering why he is unmarried, enrol him with a matchmaking service. Simon believes the solution is for Wai Tung to marry Wei Wei, an illegal immigrant desperate to remain in America; a marriage of convenience solving both their problems! When the news reaches Taiwan, Wai Tung's parents board the first plane to the Big Apple so they can preside over the traditional wedding banquet. Suddenly a little white lie turns into a fully fledged farce as the simple registry office ceremony escalates into an over-the-top reception where everyone wants to kiss the bride - except the groom! Starring Ah-Leh Gua, Sihung Lung, May Chin, Winston Chao and Mitchell Litchenstein. Winner Golden Bear Best Film: Berlin Film Festival, Best Director and Best Film: Seattle Film Festival, Critics Choice Best Film: Sydney Film Festival. Chinese dialogue with English subtitles."
