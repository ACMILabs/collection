        "Tom Clancy created the hero Jack Ryan in a series of thriller espionage novels. Harrison Ford again plays the intrepid CIA agent. When his mentor (James Earl Jones) becomes gravely ill, Ryan is appointed CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence. A tough first assignment awaits when he is asked to investigate the murder of a personal friend of the President with secret ties to Columbian drug cartels. A deadly field operative (Willem Dafoe) has been despatched in a covert operation against the Columbians unbeknown to Ryan. Directed by Australia's Philip Noyce, this is an action-packed film which looks at corruption in the corridors of power."
