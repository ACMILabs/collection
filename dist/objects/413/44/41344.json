        "Days after the release of \"The Swan\", Grace Kelly became a real Princess by marrying Prince Rainer of Monaco. In this film, she is a Eurpoean Princess destined to marry the Crown Prince (Alec Guinness). Princess Alexandra is more interested in studying astronomy with her tutor than marriage plans, yet once she sees the Prince, it is love at first sight. Capturing his attention, let alone his affections, proves difficult, until Princess Beatrix, Alex's mother, connives a scheme to make the Prince jealous. Co-starring Louis Jourdan, Agnes Moorehead, Jessie Royce Landis and Leo G. Carroll."
