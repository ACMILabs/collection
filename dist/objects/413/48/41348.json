        "Based on the novel by famed writer John Le Carre, Richard Burton plays a spy who is unwilling to \"come in from the cold\" to assume a desk job. Burnt out, he takes on the most dangerous job of his career, stalking a dangerous East German agent played by Oskar Werner. Full of crosses and double crosses, this is a brilliant espionage thriller. The quality performances by Burton, Werner and Claire Bloom are matched by a tension-packed and well-scripted screenplay. The harsh black and white camera work makes a powerful statement about the futility of the Cold War."
