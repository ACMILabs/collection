        "Richard Lowenstein's film \"Say a Little Prayer\" is an under-rated Australian children's film about a child's perspective on the world which adults can enjoy. Eleven year old Seymour is bored during the school holidays, living with his fussy guardian in Richmond. His world changes when he meets the fabulous Angie, a young woman who treats him with respect and loving attention. They begin a friendship which is initially fun until Seymour comes to understand that his friend is a heroin user, and her life not as carefree and safe as he initially believed. Lowenstein's gift for understanding the specificicities of subculture make this a moving film about families and contemporary dislocation. Sudi de Winter is excellent as Angie and Mickey Camilleri is the shy child Seymour. Co-stars Ben Mendelsohn. Based on Robin Klein's novel \"Came back to show you I could fly\" with music by Not Drowning, Waving."
