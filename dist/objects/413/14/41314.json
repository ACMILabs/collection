        "Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders have formed one of the most successful comedy duos of the 1990's. This collection of sketches from their successful BBC comedy series contains some of their best material as they disguise themselves in a variety of personas. Their comedy style varies from satire to slapstick and sketches such as \"Fat men\" and \"Bus-stop gynaecology\" are guaranteed to generate laughter."
