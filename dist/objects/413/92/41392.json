        "Episode of Series \"Video expeditions collection\". Join a band of intrepid Americans on a cycling adventure holiday through Russia and Estonia. After visiting Moscow they cycle into the countryside and tour the ancient cities of the \"Golden Circle.\" Exquisite old churches and fortresses are the pride and focus of these otherwise poor communities. Other highlights include the magnificent spectacle of St Petersberg and a journey back in time to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, where the streets seem to have changed little in 200 years. The American travellers share their impressions of the people and places they encounter, which perhaps reveals more about their own attitudes and values than the Russians, but nonetheless makes an interesting contrast between the tourists and the locals, East and West."
