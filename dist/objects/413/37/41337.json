        "The great Kodiak bear is the largest carnivore to roam the Earth. Living on Alaska's Kodiak Island, the bear roams the jagged coastlines and 4,000 foot mountains as part of their territory. This program captures the bears hunting, fishing, and teaching their young survival skills. As portions of the island become development targets, the contact between bear and human becomes more frequent. Compelling footage will have viewers spellbound."
