        "Based on the play by James Goldman and winner of three Academy Awards. The story of Henry II (Peter O'Toole) and his estranged wife Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn), is one of the most fascinating in history. Set in Chinon Castle in 12th Century France, the film centres on the royal couple's remarkable love-hate relationship, which ranges from tender to tempestuous as they connive and cajole to decide which of their three sons will succeed to the English throne."
