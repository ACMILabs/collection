        "Sonja (Lena Stolze) is the pride of her small German town. She's innocent, intelligent and a European essay competition winner. However, as she grows older, and wants to write about a new subject, \"My hometown during the Third Reich\", Sonja finds the whole town turning against her. Fearful of the secrets she may uncover, they abuse and harass this \"troublemaker in a skirt\", denying her access to the town records so her story is never written. She must use all her wit and determination to uncover the truth in this intriguing comedy with a twist!"
