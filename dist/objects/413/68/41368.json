        "From the beloved classic novel by the author of \"The Secret garden\" comes a wondrous film, filled with storytelling magic that unlocks imagination and inspires dreams. It is the story of Sara Crewe, a young girl who shares an exotic life with her devoted father in India until he is called to military service and Sara is sent to a strict New York boarding school. Sara's natural exuberance is misunderstood and she gains an undeserved reputation as a troublemaker. She draws strength from knowing that to her father she will always be a little Princess. With courage, imagination and kindness, she overcomes the hardships that beset her and changes both her life and the fortunes of those around her. Cast includes Eleanor Bron, Liam Cunningham, Liesel Matthews, Rusty Schwimmer, Arthur Malet, Alison Moir."
