        "Episode of Series \"Face the press\". David Maybury-Lewis's series Millenium raised the awareness of the richness of tribal cultures around the world. In this \"Face the Press\" interview he expounds his theories on tribalism and how differently western societies perceive these cultures. Sometimes controversial in his approach, David Maybury-Lewis is an articulate original thinker. For those who have seen the Millenium series, the program will provide an insight into the mind of its creator; for those who haven't, this program will generate an interest in his work."
