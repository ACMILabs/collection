        "This controversial Czech film, featuring a very young Hedy Lamarr, gained international notoriety for its loose morals and a lengthy nude sequence. It was banned in America, Britain and Germany. The story follows a young woman's search for love and fulfillment after she marries an unloving and much older man. Eventually she leaves him to return to the family home where she falls in love with a handsome young surveyor, but her husband discovers the affair and takes drastic action. The story is straightforward melodrama but an effortless sensuality and remarkable cinematography give the film a freshness and eloquence that is quite special."
