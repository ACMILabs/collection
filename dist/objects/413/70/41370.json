        "From the multi-award winning creator of \"A Grand day out\" and \"The Wrong trousers\" comes a brilliant new adventure thriller starring our hero Wallace and his ever-suffering canine companion Gromit. Trade is booming for Wallace and Gromit's window cleaning Wash'N'Go service and love is in the air as Wallace falls for the owner of the local wool shop, the lovely Wendolene Ramsbottom. However, Wallace has a new invention - a Knit-O-Matic machine - and adventure looms; sheep are being rustled, wool is in short supply and Wendolene's malevolent pooch is on the prowl."
