        "One of the most respected and beloved of actresses, Katharine Hepburn presents a unique self-portrait using footage from her many films, never-before-seen home movie footage and personal memorabilia. Hepburn looks at the ups and downs of her career as well as taking the viewer on a personal journey. Her candour and commonsense approach have been representative of her dynamic personality, independence, integrity, determination and strength of character. In a Hollywood which was largely dominated by men, Katharine Hepburn was a woman to be reckoned with."
