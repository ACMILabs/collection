        "Mack is an anti-social young gangster who plots to hold up a bank. The police and a rival underwold gang are pursuing him because he has an incriminating tape. An encounter with steamy jazz singer Wendy abruptly halts his criminal activites and, throwing caution to the wind, the two embark on a tempestuous relationship which becomes an all consuming obsession. Despite the danger, the two lovers live only for the moment and on the edge of tragedy. Cast includes Hugo Race, Santha Press, Rebekah Elmalogou, John Flaus and Dominic Sweeny."
