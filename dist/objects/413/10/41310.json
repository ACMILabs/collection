        "Clark Gable and Carole Lombard were one of Hollywood's legendary couples, but unlike Bogart and Bacall, they only made one film together. Babe Stewart (Clark Gable) is a big time card shark, forced to hide in a small mid-western town where he meets Connie Randall (Carole Lombard), the local librarian whom he marries on a bet. Her innocence and sincerity act as a foil to his sauveness and eventually he is reformed by goodness and love. Co-starring Dorothy MacKaill."
