        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Absolutely fabulous\". Three hilarious episodes from the smash hit comedy series, \"Absolutely Fabulous\". \"Fashion\": Edwina is organising a celebrity fashion show. Once the ecstacy tablet kicks in it is all mayhem and disaster. \"Fat\": Edwina is horrified that an old friend, Penny \"the stick\" Caspar is going to pay her a visit. With Patsy's help she attempts to lose some weight fast. \"France\": Edwina and Patsy pay a visit to the French countryside, scaring the horse, the locals, and anything else they come in contact with. The usual mixture of high camp, drug and alcohol-tinged exaggerated theatrics and wonderful writing. Co-written by Dawn French. With Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley."
