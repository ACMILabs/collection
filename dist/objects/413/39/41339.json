        "Noddy and his friends have lots of fun in four exciting adventures. \"Noddy loses sixpence\", but he isn't the only one. Even the Pink Cat's tail has gone missing! The Goblins trick Noddy out of his car in \"Noddy and the goblins.\" In \"Noddy and the naughty tail\" Bert Monkey sells his pencil case with his magic rubber and it falls into the hands of Mr. Tubby. Big Ears suggests that Noddy should hold his umbrella when driving in \"Noddy and the pouring rain.\" This delightful puppet animation is based on the characters created by Enid Blyton."
