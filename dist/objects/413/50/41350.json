        "This cinematic masterpiece, directed with enormous sensitivity by William Wyler, tells the story of two women (Merle Oberon and Miriam Hopkins) who fall in love with the same man (Joel McCrea) and the damage to their lives that can be caused to all three by the malicious lies of a spiteful teenage schoolgirl (Bonita Granville). This powerful story of gossip and suspicion was based on Lillian Hellman's controversial Broadway success \"The Children's Hour.\" The appearance of Walter Brennan as the local taxi driver brings the only light relief to such a dramatic film and the outstanding performance of Bonita Granville was nominated for an Academy Award."
