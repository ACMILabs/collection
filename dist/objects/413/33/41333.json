        "Clash of the carnivores examines the Tasmanian Devil, Tiger Quoll and Eastern Quoll which once ranged across mainland Australia but are now only found in the rugged regions of Tasmania. The competition for a limited food supply is fierce with some unexpected battles and alliances. Healesville Sanctuary features in \"Window on the wild\" where studies are being undertaken into the lifestyle of nocturnal animals such as the Eastern-barred bandicoot. The sanctuary provides an ideal study locale in addition to a refuge for these highly endangered species."
