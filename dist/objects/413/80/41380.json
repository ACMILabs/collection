        "Ruth Cracknell, Simon Bossell and Max Cullen star in this tender human comedy. Spider McCall is an ambulance driver with a bad attitude. On his last day he lands the assignment from hell, driving Rose Dougherty to her birthday party in a distant country town. Rose is an eccentric 70 year old with an attitude probem to rival Spider's. During their journey they discover a rare friendship amidst laughter, love, adventure and danger. Max Cullen won an AFI Award for his portrayal as Jack, a bee-keeper trying to win Rose's affection. Stay tuned for the credits as a little story unfolds during them."
