        "Based on Randy Shilts best-selling book which was drawn from a true story. The film exposes how the inaction and in-fighting amongst Government officials, blood banks, the scientific community and the general public contributed to the spreading of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and the general ignorance about the disease. The film will evoke anger and shock, but is ultimately moving. Starring Matthew Modine and an all-star cast of Alan Alda, Phil Collins, Richard Gere, Anjelica Huston, Steve Martin, Ian McKellen and Lily Tomlin."
