        "Long ago, Willie Brown bargained his soul with the Devil at the crossroads in return for fame. Gifted young guitarist Eugene (Ralph Maccio) will do anything to play the blues like his legendary hero and travels across country where he meets the now old and cantankerous Willie. Together they journey to the fated crossroads and Eugene learns that to really play the blues, you must live them first. Joe Seneca and Jami Gertz also star in this production which features an incredible soundtrack by Ry Cooder."
