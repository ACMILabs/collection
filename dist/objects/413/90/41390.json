        "Episode of Series \"Video expeditions collection\". Explore the majestic \"Crown of Europe\", from icy peaks to verdant valleys. Join the adventures of Swiss expatriate, Peter Merkle returning to his homeland, on a trek across the cantons of Switzerland. This is not a tour for the unfit or faint-hearted. Hike the mighty Morteratsch glacier, mountain-bike over rugged trails near Lake Lucerne and paraglide through the mists of Mount Titlis. This breathtaking tour concludes with an awe-inspiring view of dawn breaking over the Matterhorn."
