        "This is the poignant story of Jacques Mayol (Jean-Marc Barr), a free diving champion who must choose between his passion for the sea and his love of a New York businesswoman (Rosanna Arquette). His mettle as a human being is tested when he finds he must choose between two vastly different lifestyles. One with the passionate woman in one of the worlds largest cities and the other in a small village close to the sea which has always been his life. An extraordinarily beautiful film set against spectacular backdrops in Sicily, Paris, New York and the Greek Isles."
