        "Would you spend nine days on a desert island somewhere in the Indian Ocean, exist with a bare minimum of kit, spend your time alone, sleep rough, and make do? Most people would hesitate at accepting such a challenge, but for ex-model and television star Joanna Lumley, the challenge was irresistible. After one day of training with the Irish Guards, she found herself on the proverbial desert island, off Madagascar, and left to fend for herself. This is an account of the way one of Britain's most popular celebrities adapted to an extreme change of lifestyle, having to literally \"live off the land\", finding her own fresh water and food while staving off the intense heat and a myriad of insects. The contrast between Joanna Lumley in these circumstances and her character Patsy in the outrageous \"Absolutely fabulous\" comedy series is very stark indeed!"
