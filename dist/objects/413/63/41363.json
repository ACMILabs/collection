        "Miss Nelson is the nicest teacher in the school but her students are the worst behaved. When she suddenly does not come to school, a substitute teacher, Miss Viola Swamp, appears instead. Miss Swamp immediately lays down the law - no talking, no goofing, no free time. The students immediately begin a search for Miss Nelson, realising how wonderful she really is. They get nowhere, and are grateful on the day Miss Nelson mysteriously reappears. Animated and based on the book by Harry Allard, illustrated by James Marshall."
