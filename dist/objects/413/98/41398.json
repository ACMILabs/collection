        "No sex, no violence, no news is the programing policy of China's biggest satellite TV network. Following producers, distributors, satellite moguls and advertising executives, this documentary looks at how business is conducted in a strange world where official party propaganda merges with Hollywood and MTV. The competition is fierce in the struggle to access China's huge television audience and rapidly expanding consumer market. This program explores the impact of global TV on modern China, offering a fascinating insight into Chinese society and values."
