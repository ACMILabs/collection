        "Episode of Series \"Andy Hardy Series\". Andy (Mickey Rooney) is dazzled by a picture in a magazine of a glamorous debutante (Diana Lewis). When Judge Hardy's (Lewis Stone) crusade to save an orphanage takes him to New York City, Andy joins him in the hope of meeting his dream girl. However, the Big Apple shows little sympathy for a cocky, small town boy and his hairbrained schemes to break into high society backfire with disastrous but humerous results. Finally, his old pal Betsy Booth (Judy Garland), a high society girl herself, lends Andy a hand - and a tuxedo. This is one of the most entertaining films in the series and features Judy Garland performing \"Alone\" and \"I'm Nobody's Baby.\""
