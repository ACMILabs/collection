        "Lucy Bell stars as Mary MacKillop in this dramatisation of her life. Born to Scottish migrant parents, Mary experienced a calling to the religious life when she was five. As a young woman she was troubled by the poverty and injustice of colonial Australia and established the Sisters of St. Joseph. Her work brought her into conflict with the Catholic hierachy and she was at one point excommunicated. Her faith and dedication never wavered and her Order continues to inspire to this day. Lucy Bell gives an excellent performance as Mary, providing an insight into the character of this amazing woman."
