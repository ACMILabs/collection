        "The French Riviera serves as the picturesque backdrop for this classic, suspenseful Hitchcock caper with Cary Grant as John Robie, a reformed cat burglar once known as \"The Cat\", suspected in a new wave of jewel thefts from luxury hotels. Meeting pampered heiress Frances (Grace Kelly at her most ravishing), he sees the chance to bait the mysterious thief with her mothers' (Jessie Royce Landis) fabulous jewels and clear himself of suspicion. His plan backfires, but Frances, who believes him guilty, proves her love by helping him escape and in a spine-tingling climax, the real criminal is exposed. Script including the much-imitated fireworks scene by John Michael Hayes. The cinematography by Robert Burks won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, 1954. Co-starring John Williams, Charles Vanel, Brigitte Auber, Jean Martinelli and Georgette Anys. Based on the novel by David Dodge."
