        "A classic teenage film filled with sun, surf and romance. Sandra Dee became the stereotypical blonde haired blue-eyed surfer girl in this first Gidget movie. Francie Lawrence desperately wants to find true love at 16, and becomes a mascot for a group of college-bound surfer boys and their drop-out leader the Great Kahoona, played by Cliff Robertson. During the summer vacation she becomes attracted to Moondoggie played by James Darren. Gidget does everything to make him fall for her and by the end of the summer her dreams come true."
