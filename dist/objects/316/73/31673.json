        "Episode of Series \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\". Sea Arrow Squids gather in large masses during their annual mating frenzy. The males transfer packets of sperm from their bodies to that of the female by using a specially adapted tentacle. The female attaches the fertilised egg clusters to the sea bottom where they hatch in approximately 28 days. Commentary by Rod Serling."
