        "Stolen money, a love intrigue and police chase unite with the main theme which is a day in the life of an old woman who scratches out a living collecting used pop bottles and picking through back alleys. She is not too poor, however, to repay a kindness. The film ends on an unexpected note of humour. Stars Nan Steward, John Evans."
