        "Episode of Series \"21st Century\". In an exploration of the reactions to and applications of science and technology in the field of art, we are shown into the studios of various artists, such as Victor Vasarely and Yaacov Agam in Paris. The bizarre machines of Tinguely display a jaundiced attitude towards the values cherished by our technological era."
