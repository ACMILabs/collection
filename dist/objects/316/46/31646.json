        "The traditional life of Tibet is depicted by Huston Smith, Professor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Smith shows the extent to which traditional customs have been invaded and corroded by the West. All social and economic activity revolves around religious practice. The importance of the Dalai Lama is emphasised. Set in Gyuto Tantric Monastery in Northern India, this moving film explores the essence of Tibetan Buddhism and focuses on the unusual chants of the Gyuto monks, whose training enables them to chant in chords. The film was shot mainly in Dalhousie, India, where the two Tantric Colleges, Gyuto and Gyume, were re-established in exile."
