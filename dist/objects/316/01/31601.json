        "A documentation of an experiment which successfully analysed the genetic code of a mutant virus. Dr Norton Zinder and his colleagues at Rockefeller University, New York City, are shown as they separate the mutant viruses from non-mutants, grow new generations of the mutants, extract the mutants' genetic materials, and test whether or not this material will manufacture a certain protein known as the coat protein."
