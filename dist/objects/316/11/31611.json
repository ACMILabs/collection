        "Differing in their degree of adherence to pioneer customs, in their size, in what they produce and in the philosophy that unites each membership, the kibbutzim of Israel are greatly diverse. Here, a young Israeli boy describes life as it is on his particular kibbutz where the children are raised apart from their parents but retain close family ties. Nir explains how his kibbutz operates and tells about his family's role on the kibbutz."
