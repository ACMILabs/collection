        "Episode of Series \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\". On the island of Guadalupe, 130 miles off the west coast of Mexico, there is a colony of unique aquatic mammals, the nosed sea elephants. On this trip, Cousteau and the crew of the Calypso examine the habits of these unusual animals and try to gather information as to the size of the herd, whether new colonies are forming and where they go in their seven months at sea. With Jacques Cousteau and narrated by Rod Serling."
