        "Episode number 17 of Series \"The Australian eye III\". Eugene Von Guerard, (affectionately known as 'the father of the Gallery School' Victoria, being founder), with his training in the naturalistic German school of Romanticism, was able to produce works that express reverence for nature's mysterious processes as well as appreciation of the splendours of the untamed Australian landscape. The European concept of sublimity is discussed and some of Von Guerard's most majestic works are studied."
