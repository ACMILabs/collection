        "Episode number 16 of Series \"The Australian eye III\". Ian Fairweather's 'Epiphany' (1962) which describes events to come in the life of the child Jesus, is considered by many of his admirers to be his greatest work. The film examines this powerful, sombre painting in detail, illuminating its intricacies and drawing on other related works by the artist, including a number of rarely seen canvasses from private collections"
