        "Aimed at the child today, the film gently ridicules the idea of smoking and those who smoke. Determines and examines the four major reasons why people smoke, each reason reflecting the infantile needs, the sheep-like behaviour and the general dumbness of the cigarette smoker. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
