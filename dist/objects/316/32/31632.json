        "Looks at neo-Nazi groups in Germany today that have been known to destroy Jewish cemeteries, paint swastikas on the street and distribute anti-Semitic propaganda. While not viewed as a flourishing movement on the verge of popular acceptance, the neo-Nazis are shown to be a group whose philosophy and immediate predecessors demand that their activities be put into proper perspective."
