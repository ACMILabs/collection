        "Shows the well-known aboriginal poet, Kath Walker, living on Stradbroke Island, Queensland; the very place which was once the home of her native tribe. She welcomes visitors - particularly aboriginal children - hoping to imbue them with pride in their own culture. Her charisma is clearly seen as she talks to the trees and plants."
