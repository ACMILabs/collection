        "The snow goose is a tightly scheduled bird. It winters in the United States, flies 4,000 kilometres to breed and raise a family in the high Arctic, and returns before the frost sets in. This film documents the formation-flying, feeding habits, rearing of young and lifestyle of the great snow goose. Written by Joseph Koenig; music by James Solkin; voice and narration by Bud Knapp."
