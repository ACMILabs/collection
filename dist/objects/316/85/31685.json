        "In 1952 4,000 people died as a result of \"smog\", a mixture of natural fog, soot and smoke, containing poisonous waste gases. The ensuing Clean Air Act designated smokeless zones and all soft coal fires were banned in London. Shows how inspectors keep a close watch on domestic and industrial air pollution, so that smog is a thing of the past."
