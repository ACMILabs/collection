        "A ten year old struggles with the problem of sharing her mother with a boyfriend who has just moved into the house. The mother is completely at a loss as to what to do, as what seemed a fine idea to her at first quickly turns sour with resentment and jealousy. The resolution of this conflict is thoroughly realistic, and without a \"happily ever after\" ending."
