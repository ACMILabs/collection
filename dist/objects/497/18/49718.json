        "Aboriginal education is a part of life in aboriginal communities and survival of aboriginal culture and language is through the young. This documentary records the celebration of the first Aboriginal Arts in Perth 83 festival which attracted participants from all over Australia, including Maureen Watson, Jack Davis and Vic Hunter. Traditional dance, song and story-telling were a feature and interaction with the audience was encouraged - a way of sharing the Aboriginal culture with non-Aboriginal Australians. The film also documents Aboriginal community members from the Mowanjum Community in Derby, WA and the Warmun Community in Turkey Creek, WA, visiting schools in Perth, teaching the school-children about Aboriginal culture and traditions in an effort to improve race relations and bridge the gap of understanding between all Australians."
