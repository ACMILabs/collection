        "A country town priest (Norman Kaye) becomes increasingly unreliable and approachable after a protracted period of mourning following the death of his wife 10 years before. Ruby Rae, a 10 year old girl enters suddenly into his life and the two establish a warm friendship. Through a series of shared (but simple experiences) made delightful with Ruby's observations along the way, Reverend Walsh's faith is restored. Cast includes Margaret Mills and Aletha McGrath. Music by Brett Rosenberg."
