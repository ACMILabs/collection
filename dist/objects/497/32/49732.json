        "It is a sad and beautiful world that provides the setting for Jim Jarmusch's third feature. It seems like a world of bad luck and trouble to Jack and Zack. These deadbeats may well have deserved a comeuppance, but not jail, certainly not for the long haul, and absolutely not in the same cell together. The big-talking, foolish Jack and the sullen, daydreaming Zack are mutually repellent. A new convict is pushed into their cell, an Italian tourist, Roberto. Somehow the three manage to escape and they wind up in the trackless bayou, pursued by bloodhounds. Cast includes Tom Waits, John Lurie, Roberto Benigni and Ellen Barkin."
