        "Camelot Gardens is a \"gated community\" for the wealthy with luxurious yet sterile homes, and a security force which ensures that riff-raff will be kept off the grounds after dark. The Stockard family are the new kids on the block, obsessed with acceptance and political advancement within the community. Their ten year old daughter, Devon (Mischa Barton), is not interested in befriending children her own age. One day she wanders into the nearby woods and discovers Trent, a 22 year old who scrapes together a living by mowing the lawns of the wealthy inhabitants of Camelot Gardens. Both Trent and Devon have physical and emotional scars to deal with, and they soon become friends. However, things come to head when the community discovers that Devon's best friend is a grown man. Cast also includes: Sam Rockwell, Chris McDonald and Kathleen Quinlan."
