        "Screen Sound Australia uses newsreels and home movie footage, photographs, newspapers and interviews to present a detailed account of the world famous Redex trials held in Australia between 1953 and 1955. Over a distance of 6,500 miles, competitors drove standard passenger vehicles on a designated route around the eastern half of Australia. Rather than being a race, competitors were required to complete every segment in a fixed time, losing points if they arrived at any destination a minute early or late. We see the thrills and spills of the races as well as the cunning and ingenuity of the drivers who maneuvered their cars along dusty and hazardous outback routes where there was no access to motels, petrol stations, or even roads."
