        "Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and Arnold Vosloo return to star in this sequel to the 1999's blockbuster, 'The Mummy'. When evil mummy Lord Imhotep is resurrected in a British museum, Rich and Evie O'Connell develop feelings of deja-vu. The situation worsens when their son Alexander discovers the ancient arm bands belonging to the Scorpion King and puts them on, which will awaken the Scorpion King and bring forth the end of the world. When Imhotep discovers the wearer of the bracelets and the only thing standing in his way of reigning again is a child, he arranges for the child to be kidnapped, leaving Evie and Rich only days to save their son and the world from Imhotep and the Scorpion King. Cast also includes wrestling star The Rock, AKA Dwayne Johnson, as the Scorpion King."
