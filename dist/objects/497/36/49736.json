        "Romantic comedy starring Sabah, one of the Middle East's most popular singers of the 50's - 70's. Following the Egyptian revolution, Prince Chawkat resides in his palace, desperately trying to avoid destitution. As he tries to manage his domestic finances, his debts mount, forcing his family to make ends meet. Prince Chawkat must learn to earn his own living rather than rely on his inheritance. His daughters Jihan and Myrva try to assist him, but his pride constantly intervenes. When the Prince falls in love with a young woman, played by Sabah, he finds that he must learn humility before he can earn her love. Prince Chawkat's journey reflects the message of Nasser's 'New Egypt', creating its own opportunities and relying on its own resources rather than looking towards Europe for economic harmony. The film promotes that a man can create a destiny that culminates in a harmonious marriage and family life, through study and hard work. Sabah sings Houb al Khatf (Secret Love) and Beh Fatha Ba."
