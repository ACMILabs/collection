        "'AstroTurf' is a 3-D animation that tours through periods of time that mark different technologies, from the prehistoric to beyond the 21st century. As the technology advances, human evolution is virtually at a standstill, always at odds with the technology that is demonstrated to be fallible. Ian Haig uses bold graphic style drawing on influences such as; 1950s television, sci-fi imagery, computer games, cartoons and comic books. 'AstroTurf' becomes a platform to celebrate computer imaging and the alternate aesthetics that the medium allows for."
