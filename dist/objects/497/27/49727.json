        "In this suspense thriller, a missing anthropologist is given up for lost by his wife (Darien Takle) and twin brother Edward (John Bach), but his daughter (Emma Takle) is convinced something odd is involved in her father's disappearance. Events conspire to put the three people together on a manhunt for the anthropologist amongst a \"lost\" tribe in the dense jungle of the southern island of New Zealand."
