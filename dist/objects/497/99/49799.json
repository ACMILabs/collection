        "December 31st, 1999, and everyone has gathered at Blackadder's for millennium celebrations. There is money to be made, $10,000 in fact, when Blackadder claims he can bring back items from the past using a time machine developed by Baldrick. It will be the best New Year's Eve prank ever. Complications arise when they discover the time machine actually works, there's something lacking in the navigation department, and they have the opportunity to change history. In their travels Blackadder and Baldrick encounter Shakespeare (Colin Firth), Robin Hood (Rik Mayall) and Maid Marion (Kate Moss), Napoleon, Roman Centurions and Queen Elizabeth I. Also included on the tape are 'Baldrick's video diary' and a behind the scenes look at the production of the film, 'A Blackadder in the making' (directed by Anthony Palmer). This includes interviews with cast and crew members including Richard Curtis, Rowan Atkinson, Paul Weiland, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Miranda Richardson and Patsy Byrne who provide insights into character and series developed."
