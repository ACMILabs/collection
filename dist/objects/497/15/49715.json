        "A compilation of rubbery figures skits that first featured regularly in the Australian television comic series of the late 1980's \"Fast forward\". An irreverent and satirical play on the then Australian Prime Minister and treasurer (and comic duo it seems), Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. Includes skits Evil Kneating, Back to the Future and more. Puppeteers: Esther Haskell, Jenny Ishmakovich, Jenny Sherlock and Kath Gordon."
