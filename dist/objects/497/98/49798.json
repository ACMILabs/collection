        "David Lynch's prequel to the cult television series, \"Twin Peaks\", depicts the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer, whose plastic-wrapped corpse was found floating in the river in the introduction of the TV series. In the quiet town of Twin Peaks, Laura is the popular prom queen by day. By night, however, she is the sex-crazed cokehead who prostitutes herself to support her drug habit. Her race to oblivion is escalated further by an awareness of sexual abuse which has been taking place since she was a child. Cast includes: Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise, Moira Kelly, Harry Dean Stanton, Kyle MacLachlan, Kiefer Sutherland, James Marshall, Grace Zabriskie, Pam Gidley, David Lynch, David Bowie and Chris Isaak."
