        "Based on the novel \"No place to hide\" by Ted Allbeury, \"Hostage\" is about a man on the run, a man who wants nothing more to do with the life of a British Secret Service Agent. A professional killer who murders in the name of Queen and country, John Rennie (Sam Neill) has one more job to do. A senior defence analyst is taken hostage by terrorists and it is up to Rennie to secure the release of the hostage and eliminate the terrorists. This leads him to Argentina, to secrecy and corruption, violence and seduction and eventually to the fatal mistake of falling in love. Plans start to fall apart, doubts begin to set in and Rennie's questioning of his orders make him a liability - a danger to National Security. Cast also includes Talisa Soto, James Fox, Art Malik, Cristina Higueras, Michael Kitchen, Jean Pierre Reguerraz."
