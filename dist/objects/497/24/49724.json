        "Geoff Crome is twelve and a bit, imaginative, lives on a beach and believes in miracles. During the last perfect summer of childhood he finds both miracles and friendship. Despite his father's warnings, Geoff becomes friends with Firpo - a strange, skinny, magical character with a burning, though simplistic, ambition to win the Olympic Games. When Firpo accepts a challenge to run an \"olympic selection\" race on the beach, Geoff tries everything to help him win - body building, diet, prayer - but Firpo scorns them all, convinced he will win with a miracle. Geoff so much wants to believe in Firpo's miracle that he sets himself against his whole world - family, community and finally against the innocent dreams of his childhood. From the stage play by Bruce Mason. Screenplay by Bruce Mawson and Ian Mune. Starring Stephen Fulford, Stephen Papps, Paul Gittins, Gabrielle Hammond."
