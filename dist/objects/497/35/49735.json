        "Episode of Series \"Australia Council archival film series: on music\". Peter Sculthorpe, Australia's best-known contemporary composer, discusses his personal philosophy and the influences which have shaped his creative development. Sculthorpe studied at the Melbourne University Conservatorium of Music and at Oxford University. His \"Sonatina for Piano\" was performed at the International Society of Contemporary Music Festival in Baden-Baden in 1955 and he went on to receive international recognition with the success of his Sun Music series. Throughout his career, Sculthorpe has drawn on a diversity of cultural influences in his quest to develop uniquely Australian music. He has composed for film, television, theatre and opera as well as the concert platform, and enjoys the status of elder statesman among contemporary Australian composers. A performance of his work \"Kakadu\" in 1989 was a rallying point for Australian conservationists and since then Sculthorpe has used his music to promote environmental causes. Research and interview: James Murdoch."
