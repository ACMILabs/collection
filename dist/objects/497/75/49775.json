        "Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn play husband and wife Eddie and Maureen whose devotion to each other is hindered by the self destructive behaviour which eventually leads Eddie to an institution for the criminally insane. During his ten year confinement, Maureen divorces Eddie without his knowledge, marries successful businessman Joey (John Travolta), and settles into middle class comfort to raise her three daughters. On the day of Eddie's release, Maureen is unsettled by the emotional conflict which forces her to choose between her responsibility towards the husband she abandoned and the family that provided a refuge from her past. Based on a screenplay by John Cassavetes. Cast also includes Harry Dean Stanton, Gena Rowlands, Debi Mazar and James Gandolfini. Edited by Petra von Oelffen. Photographed by Thiery Arbogast. Music by Joseph Vitarelli."
