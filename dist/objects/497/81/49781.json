        "Christopher Guest's hilarious mockumentary, \"Waiting for Guffman\", chronicles the misguided efforts of Blaine Missouri theatre group's efforts to put on a musical commemorating the town's 150th anniversary. Guest (who wrote and stared in the cult spoof, \"This is Spinal Tap\") also stars as the outrageously camp theatre director, Corky St. Clair, who is hired by the council of Blaine to direct the show. His suspect theatre expertise ranges from off-off Broadway to a disastrous production of \"Backdraft - The Musical\". The cast for \"Blaine - The Musical\" is filled out by a small group of inept but keen town locals whose enthusiasm far surpasses their talent. The mainly ensemble cast are spot on with their small town counterparts, particularly Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the screenplay with Guest), as local dentist Dr. Allan Pearl, who wins the lead despite his lazy eye and wobbly singing voice. Rounding up the cast is the wonderful Parker Posey as the bored Dairy Queen shop girl, and husband and wife Sheila and Ron (Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard), the seasoned pro's with an eye for broadway. If things weren't bad enough, word gets out that influential Broadway theatre critic Mr. Guffman is coming to opening night, raising the stakes for the amateur crew."
