        "Jake is an extraordinary child who just so happens to love dressing up and performing. His resolution to be himself and carve out an identity for himself regardless of societal expectations is inspiring. A remarkable story told in Jake's language in which he articulately discusses growing up and his love of singing and performing in drag. An eye opening piece which challenges assumptions of personal identity and that kids do understand themselves and their 'place' in the world."
