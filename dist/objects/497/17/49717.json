        "This is the story of a disabled man's unconventional struggle for rehabilitation. Kwakka is a spruiker at the markets selling goods off the back of his truck. When he becomes a paraplegic after falling off the truck he has to make a new start in life. His girlfriend tries to get him interested in more 'respectable' work. Kwakka however has different ideas. An outdoors man at heart, he gets a job selling disability insurance door-to-door. But even this doesn't satisfy him and soon, despite the objections of his girlfriend, he's plotting to get back into his old trade - this time in a wheelchair. This amusing drama has some telling points to make about attitudes to disability, and was nominated for Best Screenplay in a Short Film at the 1989 AFI Awards."
