        "Isis Hanna (Egyptian), Sammy Kwong (Chinese), Stavroula Pikros (Greek) are three elderly Australians. All emigrated to Australia, but at different times in Australia's migration history. This documentary shares their stories and explores the effect of cultural difference and assimilation. They talk openly about aging in a foreign country 'when home is no longer home' and what they plan for the future. All subjects of the documentary have been part of a special program in Sydney at St. George Migrant Resource Centre designed for elderly migrants. Once a week each migrant group gets together to share a meal, socialise and tell stories."
