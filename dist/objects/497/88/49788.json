        "Four documentary 'filmzines', each directed by a seventeen-year-old female student assisted by a professional film crew provided by the National Film Board of Canada. The films evolved from fanzines (low-tech, independently produced niche magazines), produced by the young filmmakers that addressed issues central to their lives. Their 'windows into youth culture' range from alternative music and punk subculture to self-mutilation and education. 'Salt' stays true to its roots, using innovative digital imaging techniques to maintain the feel of the 'zines' that inspired its making. A comprehensive companion website to the film project can be found at http://www.nfb.ca/salt/"
