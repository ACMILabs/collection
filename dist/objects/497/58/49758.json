        "One of Them is the bittersweet story of two teenage boys growing up in New Zealand in the 1960s, trying to come to terms with being gay, or as they call it being \"one of them\". Newcomers Cameron J. Watt and Ciaran Pennington both give a touching performance as Lemmy and Jamie, who are endearing in their angst-ridden confusion and cocky humour. Always on the outer, their 'difference' brings them closer together, (as well as their love for Vogue magazine and pop divas). This project has brought together the award winning talents of Stewart Main and Peter Wells (Desperate Remedies), and has itself won accolades at festivals in London, Italy, Canada and Australia."
