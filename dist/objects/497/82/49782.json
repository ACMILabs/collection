        "Adapted from the Vladimir Nabokov novel, \"The Luzhin Defence\" tells the story of Luzhin, a chess grandmaster who arrives at a lakeside resort in Como, Italy, to partake in the World Championship Tournament. Luzhin is an idiot savant whose obsession with chess has cost him the ability to function in society. Exploited by his teacher during his adolescent years, Luzhin has become introverted and prone to outbursts of indecipherable nonsense until he meets Natalia, a society beauty who is also staying at the resort. She resolves to offer him a world outside that of chess, but it is a world that Luzhin is not equipped to deal with. Cast includes: John Turturro, Emily Watson, Geraldine James, Stuart Wilson, and Chris Thompson."
