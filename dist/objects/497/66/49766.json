        "Danny Flynn (Daniel Day Lewis) has just been released from prison after serving a 14 year sentence for something he didn't do. Returning to his old neighbourhood, he is re-united with Maggie (Emily Watson), his child hood sweetheart, whose husband is also serving time in jail for his involvement with the IRA. Maggie is desperately unhappy raising her son alone and Danny's presence brings some light to her depressing life. Danny and Maggie become close once again, much to the anger of their fellow neighbours and friends. Wanting to do something positive with his life, Danny draws on his past experience as a successful boxer and transforms the local community centre into a gym where he can teach the local children boxing. After a bomb goes off at the centre, Danny and Maggie are forced to make a decision about their future. Directed by Jim Sheridan (\"In the name of the father\"), \"The Boxer\" shows us the personal impact of Ireland's political troubles. Also available on VHS [318846]."
