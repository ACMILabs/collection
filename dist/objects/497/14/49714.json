        "Mercy Steele remembers her childhood in Lowmead, Queensland in the 1920's. Born on 10th March 1921, Mercy's time with her mother was cut short when her mother died giving birth to her younger sister - her father eventually walked out on the family, leaving Mercy's granny to look after the two girls. The film is a visual representation of Mercy's childhood memories set in the lush landscape of Northern Queensland. This romantic view of a landscape mirrors the romantic view of what was in reality a harsh life. Storyteller and singer: Mercy Steele (Awards: Sydney Film Festival, 1990; St Kilda Film Festival, 1991)"
