        "A young boy of thirteen, Craig (Willy Simeon), is less than excited when his birthday present isn't quite what he'd been expecting - an old out of tune piano. His efforts to learn the piano are thwarted and Craig's life is not the same when it is realised that the piano has quite a demonic sensibility. The piano drinks, smokes, kills the cat and suffers from several personality disorders that include jealousy...so what is the likelihood that the piano will be excited by Craig's decision to use an electric piano for his debut stage performance? Cast includes: Ian Watkin, Brenda Kendall, Craig Parker, Raoul MacIntosh, Jessica James. Written by Jonothan Cullinane."
