        "Set in Georgia, Cate Blanchett plays Annie Wilson, a young widow with three children to look after. Following an accident that kills her husband, she relies on her psychic visions to give the townsfolk clairvoyant readings regarding their relationships and love lives to earn a little extra money. Annie receives visits from Valerie (Hilary Swank) who is married to Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves), a psychotic wife abuser who warns Annie not to talk to his wife again or he will hurt her and her children. She also has to contend with his taunts of her being a witch - a feeling that is echoed by some of the locals. When young socialite Jessica King (Katie Holmes) goes missing, the local police and her fiancee ask Annie for her help in finding the body and leading them to the murderer. Screenplay by Billy Bob Thornton."
