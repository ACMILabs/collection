        "Uneven ensemble drama about the value of friendship, intimacy and love. When Katie (Rena Owen), a one hit wonder and faded singer, returns to Auckland after ten years in LA to find new direction in her life, she takes refuge with Stephen, her oldest friend, who is in a difficult relationship with the much younger Mark, a songwriter, substance abuser and ex rent boy. Mark writes songs for a punky energetic young dyke couple who are in a rock band together and who encourage Katie to sing with them. Together they take off to a remote beach house where Stephen and Mark finally confront the demons that shape and inhibit their relationship. More secrets are revealed and needs exposed when Katie's American lover arrives on the scene. Cast also includes Simon Prast and Dean O'Gorman."
