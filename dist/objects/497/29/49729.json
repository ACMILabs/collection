        "This gothic horror/melodrama follows the entwined lives of Jack and Dora, deeply connected siblings who suffer lasting trauma after being separated from their parents, then from one another when they are sent to an orphanage and adopted by very different families. While Dora finds loving adoptive parents, the farming family Jack enters treat him brutally, eventually driving him to murder. Reunited with Dora as a teenager, Jack is still unable to let go of his idealised early childhood memories of their lives together with their mother and is consumed by a violent psychotic rage. Meanwhile his four feral sisters from his adoptive family are out to seek revenge for the death of their parents. Cast includes Alexis Arquette, Sara Smuts-Kennedy, Bruno Lawrence."
