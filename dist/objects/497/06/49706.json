        "Edward fears he is losing his grip on reality. Outwardly, he appears grumpier. Eventually he tells his wife she is the only thing that he can remember - but can she help him and what can be done? A poignant film about ageing, shot in black and white featuring Willie Fennell, Moya O'Sullivan and Noni Hazlehurst."
