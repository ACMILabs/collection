        "Against the background of political turmoil a loner on the run is caught between the forces of a repressive government and guerillas in the resistance movement in this fast paced political thriller/action/buddy movie. Set in an imagined totalitarian future, the film and the book on which it was based foresaw some of the confrontations between authorities and protesters that marked the 1981 Springbok Rugby Tour of New Zealand. The debut feature for both director Roger Donaldson and actor Sam Neill, this film is recognised as marking the beginning of contemporary New Zealand cinema. Cast includes Sam Neill, Ian Mune, Warren Oates, Nevan Rowe and Donna Akersten. Based on the novel 'Smith's Dream' by C.K. Stead. Reference: 'New Zealand Film 1912-1996' eds. Helen Martin and Sam Edwards. Oxford University Press, Auckland 1997."
