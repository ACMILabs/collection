        "Shot in 16mm and VHS, this film is reminiscent of the silent era. The main character, a young man, lives in a world filled with paradoxes; he drives through a shopping mall, walks backwards and reads newspapers upside down. The title recalls the children's game of trying to pick the fault in an image; this experimental film, shot in black and white, encourages the spectator to do the same. A beautiful musical score by Barry Adamson."
