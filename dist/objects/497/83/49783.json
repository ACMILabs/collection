        "Set in French Guiana, three convicts escape from the notorious prison on Devil's Island and hide amongst the colonists. In need of clothing and money, the three make plans to rob a milliner, Felix, and his family. The trio are deterred from their larcenous intents when they develop a fondness for the family. Discovering that Felix is on the verge of bankruptcy, the convicts offer their services as household help. Matters are further complicated when they discover that Felix's wealthy cousin arrives to audit the books. Cast includes: Humphrey Bogart, Aldo Ray, Peter Ustinov, Joan Bennett and Basil Rathbone."
