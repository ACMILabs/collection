        "Two neighbours, who own adjoining properties, both attempt to combat this disease in their sheep. The sheep in the first property are suffering from the combined effects of overstocking and worm parasites. On the second property, after a period of trial and error, what is termed correct stocking is achieved, and as a result, the worm problem solves itself. The film emphasises that sheep must be drenched at the right time and properly fed all the time."
