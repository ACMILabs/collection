        "A film record of the building of the seventeen and a half mile, US$200,000,000 bridge-tunnel crossing of lower Chesapeake Bay in Northern America. The bridge-tunnel will connect the eastern shore of Virginia with Norfolk area, forming a link in the Ocean Highway and replacing the existing ferry service. The project comprises two trench type tunnels, four man-made islands, twelve miles of low level trestles and two high level fixed steel bridges and an earth-filled causeway. It all began in 1957 when the first tests were started and was eventually completed on 15th April 1964 when the official opening took place."
