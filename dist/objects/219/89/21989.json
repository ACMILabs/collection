        "Episode of Series \"Environment in Crisis\". Anaconda Aluminium Company opened a plant at Columbia Falls, Montana. In 1968, after a plant explosion, poisonous fluoride emissions began to damage trees for miles around. All sides of the resulting controversy are presented objectively in this film,which should spark discussion of the environmental crisis in general and of the scientific, social and economic issues involved in finding solutions to pollution problems"
