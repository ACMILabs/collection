        "Detailed explanation of causes, symptoms and effective treatment of foot rot in sheep. Isolated cases must be penned separately and the flock checked to ensure that the disease has not spread. In flocks where foot rot is widespread, the only solution is the thorough inspection of all sheep, paring and cutting away all unhealthy tissue and painting with an antibiotic solution, or administering a formalin foot bath."
