        "By means of laboratory demonstrations, animated drawings, and microphotography, the phenomena associated with variations in body temperature in animals and in human beings are shown. The blood stream is shown to be the distributor of heat energy; foods eaten are, therefore, important to body temperature. The function of the hypothalamus is compared with that of a thermostat."
