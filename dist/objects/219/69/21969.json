        "Episode of Series \"The Crossroads of the world: a study of North Africa and the Middle East\". Change is neither easy nor even. In this film you see neighboring countries in North Africa and the Middle East with vastly different forms of government. In monarchies, all power resides in a king; in others, military juntas rule. Here and there democratic governments hold power. Everywhere, from Iraq to Algeria, the ferment of change shows in many ways. Part four of the original six-part series."
