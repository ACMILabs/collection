        "The problems presented by what is popularly called \"the information explosion\" are no more keenly felt than by teachers and students. This film appraises current teaching methodology and provides a basis for discussion to provoke new thoughts and ideas on teaching techniques. Designed as an in-service aid for re-assessing and re-evaluating teaching programs and methodologies and provide a starting point for curriculum development."
