        "By means of diagrams and photography tells the story of thermostatic control. Shows, in fact, how the expansion of metals when heated can be used to regulate temperatures. The story is treated historically, beginning in the 18th century with the problem of accurate time-keeping, especially for navigation, and leading up to such complicated modern examples as open-hearth steel processing."
