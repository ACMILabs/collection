        "Reviews some of the work of the Russian physiologist, Ivan Pavlov, whose experiments with conditioned reflexes paved the way to a better understanding of human and animal behaviour. The difference between blind instinct present in all animals from birth, and reflex reactions set up by conditioning to certain often repeated stimuli is made clear. The process of checking the reflexes is explained and its application in the treatment of certain neuroses in human beings is shown."
