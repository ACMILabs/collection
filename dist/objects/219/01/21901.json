        "Focuses attention on the more delicate question of the prejudices and resistance which may be encountered at all levels when Work Study is introduced into industry. The story is based on the day-to-day record of a six-months period in an engineering firm in the Midlands, and is presented as a realistic account of the difficulties experienced and overcome, in an effort to bring fundamental problems into open discussion."
