        "At Frederiksborg Palace is the famous organ constructed in wood by Esaias Compenius of Brunswick. Kept in working order since 1610, it is a living witness to the love of music which enriched the reign of Christian IV. In the film, the music of Buxtehude (who had considerable influence on J.S. Bach) brings out many of its unique beauties. Tapestries by Hans Kneiper, included in the film, illustrate daily life of the 17th century."
