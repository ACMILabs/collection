        "As our industrial society consumes more mineral resources, the decreasing supply of such irreplaceable minerals as coal, oil, stone and metals make conservation a problem for today. Conservation for better living requires development of renewable resources such as waterpower to conserve non-renewable coal, more efficient mining and extraction methods, and new resources of power, such as nuclear and solar energy."
