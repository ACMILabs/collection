        "Through the story of one man who loses his sight and who, with expert and sympathetic training, finds self-confidence and financial independence, the film illustrates the work which organised welfare of the blind is doing in Britain. It emphasises that in selected occupations the blind person can compete on terms of equality with the sighted, and shows many aspects of industrial rehabilitation."
