        "A preemptive strike against a generation of uncontrolled, emotional teenagers. \"Control your emotions\" is hosted by an unnamed expert wearing a white lab coat. He sits behind a desk while moving around blocks labeled RAGE, FEAR and LOVE and a big cardboard disk titled PERSONALITY. He also repeatedly interrupts the story of Jeff Moore, the film's protagonist, with psychobabble such as, \"Your emotions can be your own greatest enemy,\" and \"Severe emotional stress often decreases efficiency.\" Jeff, who has dark circles under his eyes, supposedly has a hard time controlling his emotions. But the only examples shown are of him losing his temper. But by the end of the film Jeff has learned that he's happiest when reason triumphs over feeling, and he joins the gang at a marshmallow roast."
