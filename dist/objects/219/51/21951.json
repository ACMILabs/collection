        "The soil, the streams and lakes, and the forests are among our most vaulable natural resources, but in almost every continent human habitation has caused untold waste through thoughtless agricultural, pastoral, and mining activities. This film (produced in 1938) explains the seriousness of this waste, and shows some of the steps which are being taken in the USA to counteract the effects of wind and water erosion and the consequences of unwise farming and grazing, and it indicates the general principles which must be observed if the continent's most valuable natural resources are to be conserved to benefit future generations!!"
