    "description": [
        "In his book Beyond Freedom and Dignity, Dr. B. F. Skinner rejects the general belief that within each individual there is an \"inner man\" immune to environmental shaping. In discussion with Elizabeth Hall of Psychology Today magazine, he illuminates the origins of behaviorism and some of its basic principles and argues the need for a culture designed by behaviorists. Within this context, he explores the notion of control, its use and potential misuse, punishment and freedom."
