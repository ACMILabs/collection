        "An exposition through film animation of the theory that Earth's land areas are fluid and that, in the process of a slow, rolling, boiling motion, one part of the Earth might well be engulfed and then rise again some distance away, much the same as froth on a kettle of soup. From this theory comes the idea that continents were formed from one super-continent that broke up, whose pieces sank, and then rose once more, but far apart. Introducing the film is Professor J. Tuzo Wilson, geophysicist, University of Toronto. Animation by Co Hoedeman. (Award: London.)"
