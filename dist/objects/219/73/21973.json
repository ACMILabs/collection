        "Entirely the product of collective effort, this film attempts the portrayal of real images of women by looking at five individuals who recognize their strengths and the possibility of alternative roles to those of tradition. Each woman speaks about herself and the portraits merge with one another in a continuous stream of music and photography toward a totality of impression."
