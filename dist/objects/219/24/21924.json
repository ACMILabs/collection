        "A brief outline of the history of conducting leads to a discussion of conducting as a sign language, which translates the composer's signs and instructions on the score into signals which the orchestra can follow. How each conductor gives their own interpretation to a work is shown by contrasting performances of the same passage conducted by different artists. Features the Vienna Symphony Orchestra."
