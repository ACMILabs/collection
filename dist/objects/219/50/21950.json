        "Emphasises the importance of soil conservation in the catchment areas of the Snowy Mountains and illustrates how erosion is being controlled. Erosion in the Snowy area is due to the removal of vegetation through excessive grazing, burning off and the construction of roads. Ways in which this is being handled are prevention of fires, re-vegetation, control of grazing, building of brush fences and matting, and contour ploughing."
