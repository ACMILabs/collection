        "Episode of Series \"Comparisons\". An on-the-spot comparison of family life in India, France, Japan and Canada, in which the internationally known author/anthropologist, Dr Margaret Mead, discusses with the film's writer/director how the upbringing of children contributes to a distinctive national character. Centre of attention in each case is a year-old baby in the family of a farmer of average means. Dr Mead summarises the more typical national characteristics at the conclusion of the film."
