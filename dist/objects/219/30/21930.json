        "The topic of conformity is at the heart of any course in social psychology, and any treatment of the topic must rely heavily on the classic materials of Sherif, Asch and to a lesser extent Milgram, Kelman, Crutchfield, Moscovici, etc. The phenomena of conformity are relevant to the students' own experience. Demonstrates laboratory work while maximising student involvement."
