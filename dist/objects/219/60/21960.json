        "In some parts of Australia, farmers have to rely on seasonal rains for their annual water requirements, with the result that crops are often ruined due to low rainfall. In areas with a suitable clay sub-soil, earth dams can be constrcuted to conserve water to improve pastures and increase production. This film describes the principles and methods of dam construction recommended by the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission of New South Wales."
