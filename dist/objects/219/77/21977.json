        "A study of bacteria and how they can be controlled in food. Special photographic techniques are used to show the shape of bacteria and their method of multiplying. An experiment demonstrates that bacteria flourish in dirt; thus cleanliness is essential when handling food. Experiments with milk prove that heating destroys bacteria and cooling retards their growth."
