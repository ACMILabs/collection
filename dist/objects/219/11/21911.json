        "Episode of Series \"21st Century\". A timely - even frightening - reminder of the rapid advance computers are making into our lives. In many fields the impersonal efficient machine is shaping and controlling our destinies. The film points to the ever-increasing reliance on computers and illustrates computer applications of today and in the future specifically in production, aviation, medicine, education, law-enforcement, rocket space travel, design, communication etc. Implications for citizens' rights to privacy. Reporter: Walter Cronkite."
