        "What can a truck driver do if his company decides to rent trucking services and to let him go? More and more companies find it practical to \"contract out\" subsidiary operations such as the trucking of their goods, with consequent layoff of some men. A common cause of industrial disputes, this problem is dramatized to provide ground for discussion."
