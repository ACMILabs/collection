        "Episode of Series \"Psychology\". Descriptions and illustrations of the four classes of motivational conflict (after Dollard and Millar) are shown, demonstrating the basic research on animals and then generalising this into an understanding of human behaviour. Laboratory animals (rats, in this case) in a typical T-maze experiment point out the principles used in analysing and interpreting the behaviour of high school and university students."
