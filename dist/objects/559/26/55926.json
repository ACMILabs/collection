        "Examines the rise and fall of the Shah of Iran, highlighting his position as a puppet in the hands of the great powers after World War II. Shows the role played by the CIA in Iran's internal problems; the role of the Shah's security service in suppressing all those considered disloyal; the oil boom; the promotion of Western values; the fortune amassed by the Shah's family while the majority of the Iranians remained poor; and the revolt against the Shah led by the Ayatollah Khomeini. Narrated by Henry Fonda Suitable for upper secondary level"
