        "The world's knowledge of American Western history owes more to the American Western than it does to original documents. Shows the origins of the Western in the dime novels and newspaper reports and give a run down of the criteria used in the Western genre. Using archival material and extracts from Western films, a comprehensive study of both the myth and the reality emerges. The following film extracts are used: Bond of Blood; Local Colour; The Virginian; Tumbleweeds; Ride the High Country; Jesse James at bay; Stagecoach; The Big Trail. Narrated by Ben Johnson."
