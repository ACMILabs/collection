        "A mysterious parable from Poland done in line-drawing animation, shows a day in the life of three members of a nameless society - a property owner, his manacled slave, and an intruding stranger who tries to liberate the slave. The mill owner's activities determine the events of the day. He goes fishing, and his man sits in chains; he stretches out in a hammock and reads and smokes while his man plays the flute for his enjoyment. The observer sees the two men, follows them to the mill and helps the slave escape at night. Morning finds the slave returning to his master with the observer his captive. The man who tried to break the slave's chains ends up in chains himself. Music and sound effects only."
