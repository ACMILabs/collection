        "Roger Corman, the king of low budget exploitation, originally directed films with American International Pictures; up to nine or ten a year at his peak. He later decided to concentrate mainly on producing and selected young and up-and-coming actors and film students to work on his films. Featured in this documentary are nine of the Corman graduates who have gone on to make a name for themselves. Some of the people featured are Joe Dante, Jonathan Demme, Peter Fonda, Ron Howard and Martin Scorsese. Corman and the graduates talk about the elements a Corman/New World picture must have to succeed. Various filmmakers and actors tell of what it is like to work with Roger. \"Hollywood's Wild Angel\" also includes approximately twenty film excerpts, mostly in the form of film trailers. Narrated by Michael Wager, edited by Harvey Greenstein and Christian Blackwood. Title song 'Hollywood Dreams' composed and performed by Rick Lock and Cathy Chamberlain."
