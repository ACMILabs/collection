        "A chronicle of the newsreel in America, the curious child of journalism and show business that pioneered the coverage of news on film. Format of the film is similar to a newsreel with respect to the juxtaposition of images, the raising of issues without following them through, and the shock value of pictures. Suitable for middle and upper secondary and tertiary levels."
