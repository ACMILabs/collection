        "A documentary by Walther Ruttman, dealing with a day in the life of a city and heavily influenced by Eisenstein's 'Potemkin'. Ruttman emphasized visual rhythms in his cutting and strove to give his films a symphonic organization and as such the film was widely influential to other filmmakers showing how the motifs of everyday life could be patterned thematically. Suitable for Upper Secondary level students."
