        "This film begins with Queen Victoria's funeral procession in 1901, at which time no one could envisage any threat of war. This film looks at the technological development of Germany, the mass migration to America during the first decade of this century, the seeking of allies by France, the events leading up to World War 1, and the Russian Revolution"
