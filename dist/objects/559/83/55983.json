        "The conflict between the innocence and commercialism of Christmas is illustrated by urban scenes of a parade featuring a spaceman and rollerskating donkey, the observations of an entrepreneur selling wildly colored trees, and the operation of a \"Rent-a-Santa\" service. This open-ended Academy Award nominated film allows the audience to form its own conclusions regarding the commercialization of a religious holiday."
