        "A number of different animals, insects such as ants and a spider, various birds, a beady eyed and rather charming mouse, and other larger mammals are shown making and living in their homes. The principal uses to which animals put their homes, safety, shelter, food storage and the raising of young, are reiterated as they are found in various species. The human parallel is drawn by a group of children who run into the house when a storm occurs. Suitable for lower primary level."
