        "A look at the atmosphere of the earth and other planets as oceans of gases providing planetary life-support systems, and the consequences of an experiment to create an atmosphere for human habitation on another planet at the cost of existing life forms. Dramatically presented but fascinating comparative analysis, nonetheless, of earth and venus's atmosphere - with a view to human habitation on the latter. Suitable for lower and middle secondary levels."
