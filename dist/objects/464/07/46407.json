        "Two strangers, played by Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez, meet through a personal ad in a pornographic magazine. They are both interested in exploring a sexual fantasy that for a variety of reasons they feel shy of disclosing with regular partners. Filmed in flashback, while the two characters are interviewed straight to the camera, this erotic and intelligent film explores how men and women are navigating the fraught arena of sexual desire in a post-feminist and post-macho culture. Both Baye and Lopez deliver charming and realistic performances in which they present the ambiguities and contradictions of modern urban life: on one hand proud and happy with their independence; on the other aching for the comfort and solidity of dependency. In the end, the sexual fantasy which begins this pornographic affair, does not matter: it is up to the viewer to interpret the relationship through the nature of our own desires and fantasies. Beyond sex, desire and fantasy, \"A Pornographic Affair\" argues that what matters is our ability to communicate and to be open to being touched by another human being. In French with English subtitles."
