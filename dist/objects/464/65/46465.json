        "The term \"skip bombing\" is applied when the bomb is purposely bounced from the water and is aimed to make allowances for the distance travelled after hitting the water. Shows by diagrams the calculations needed to correctly use this method of attack. Also show examples of bombs of varying weights being dropped from various heights at various speeds from different types of aircraft. \"It is considered that a slick of four bombs should be dropped to ensure that the ship will sink and the motto should be 'Every skip a ship and damnation to Tojo'.\""
