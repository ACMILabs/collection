        "Set in Brooklyn in 1965, this comedy film focuses on several Catholic school boys who get into ever increasing amounts of trouble with the presiding priests of the Catholic school, St. Basil's. Michael is the new student who latches onto the class egghead, Caesar, who is constantly picked on by the class bully, Rooney. Rooney intimidates Michael and Caesar into becoming his erstwhile chums and, along with a few other members of the 'gang', they receive corporal punishment for minor infractions, disrupting communion and confession and, ultimately, their antics inspire changes in the strict school hierarchy. Cast includes: Andrew McCarthy, Mary Stuart Masterson, Kevin Dillon, Malcom Danare, Donald Sutherland, John Heard and Patrick Dempsey."
