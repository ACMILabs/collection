        "Episode of Series \"Insight profile\". Emily Rodda became a writer by accident. One night, she made up a story for her daughter about a young girl and her experiences throughout the day. Her daughter asked her to repeat the story the following night. Using everyday examples, Emily explains that anyone can be a writer. She shares her thoughts on how to develop small ideas based on simple objects, people and situations - into large ones, and then how to extend on these ideas to create a novel, using what she calls, the simple spell. The simple spell is just two words: What if?"
