        "When Guy, a recent film-school graduate with big ideas, takes a job as assistant to major studio executive, Buddy Ackerman, he believes his ship has finally come in. Little does he know, however, that it is a slave ship, for his boss is indeed worse than a slave driver, delighting in abusing his new toy-boy. Guy struggles to push his idea for a script and feels he's finally made it when Buddy congratulates him on a job well done. However, much to his chagrin, his conniving boss actually takes sole credit for the project, pushing Guy to his wit's end. He breaks into Buddy's Beverly Hills home and takes him hostage, then proceeds to torture him in a number of demeaning and horrifying ways. Cast includes: Kevin Spacey, Frank Whaley, Michelle Forbes, Benicio del Toro and Jerry Levine."
