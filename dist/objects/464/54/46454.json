        "Based on the novel \"Shoeless Joe\" by W. P. Kinsella, this is the story of one man's quest to transform vision to reality. \"If you build it, he will come\" is the ethereal message that inspires Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) to construct a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield. At first \"he\" seems to be the ghost of disgraced ballplayer \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), who materialises on the ballfield and plays a few games with the awestruck Ray. However he gradually he comes to realise that his ballfield has been divinely ordained to give a second chance to people who have sacrificed certain valuable aspects of their lives, including a Salingeresque writer (James Earl Jones) and Doc Graham (Burt Lancaster), who gave up a promising career in baseball in favour of medicine. The film is a celebration of the love of baseball."
