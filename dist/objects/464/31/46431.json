        "Episode of Series \"Look at Life\". A survey of work carried out at the Ministry of Aviation Research Centre at Boscombe Down. Aiming always for increased safety and efficiency, all sections of a new aircraft must be rigorously tested and teams of pilots, scientists and engineers seek out any flaws which must be corrected before a machine becomes operational. The men who will fly the aircraft are also seen undergoing tests at Boscombe Down. Narrated by Raymond Baxter."
