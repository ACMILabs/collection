        "TEXT RAIN is a playful interactive installation that blurs the boundary between the familiar and the magical. Participants in TEXT RAIN installation use familiar instruments of their bodies, to do what seems magical - to lift and play with falling letters that do not really exist. In the TEXT RAIN installation participants stand or move in front of a large projection screen. On the screen they see a mirrored video projection of themselves in black and white, combined with colour animation of falling text. Like rain or snow, the text appears to land on the participants heads and arms. The text responds to the participants mentions and can be caught, lifted, and then let fall again. The falling text will land on anything darker than a certain threshold, and fall whenever that obstacle is removed."
