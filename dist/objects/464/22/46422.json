        "An exciting study of Ravel's composition \"Bolero\" with the subtle meanings and accents polished to a brilliant interpretation by members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra with Zubin Mehta. The film involves the viewer in each musician's approach to his part in individual preparation and general rehearsals prior to the final performance. It also gives some insight into Mehta's perspective on musical values in the composition. (An edited version of Title 001358)"
