        "This film, which was produced by The British Central Office of Information for the Control Commission of the British zone of postwar Germany, shows the daily life of a Kreis Resident Officer (the Control Commission Officer in charge of a German Kreis or district). The KRO is seen dealing with the day-to-day difficulties which arise, showing how they are tackled, and what problems have yet to be solved."
