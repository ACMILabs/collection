        "Episode of Series \"Insight profile\". Gary Crew explains how he developed the ideas behind his award winning novels. He takes you back through his childhood and early life to the buildings and landscapes which were the inspiration for the settings of many of his books. He explains how the right 'setting' for a novel is as important as a good storyline, and how to develop any place, no matter how boring, into something special."
