        "Second and concluding part of the story based on the novel by Marcel Pagnol that began with \"Jean de Florette\". This part, taking place ten years later, deals with the revenge inflicted by Jean's daughter on those responsible for his death. An absorbing tale that makes its leisurely way to an unexpected climax. Cast includes Daniel Auteuil, Yves Montand and Emmanuelle Beart."
