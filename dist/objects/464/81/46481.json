        "Based on the true life exploits of Irish gangster Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) who pulled off a series of daring robberies in the eighties, earning him the nickname, The General. John Boorman's offbeat black and white biographical film (lensed by cinematographer Seamus Deasey), chronical's Cahill's blatent criminal reign and his eventual downfall, via an over-ambitious art heist. Boorman mines rich material from this unlikely hero who apart from having a very unorthodox relationship with two sisters (Angeline Ball, Maria Doyle Kennedy), became a folk hero in Dublin because of his open contempt for authority and his ongoing battle with the Irish police force. Gleeson's performance is aptly understated, choosing to portray Cahill as an enigmatic figure forever concealing his face. Jon Voight as the frustrated police inspector obsessively in pursuit of Cahill makes a fine and sympathetic adversary. Cast also includes Adrian Dunbar and Sean McGinley. (Awards: John Boorman- Best Director 1998 Cannes Film festival)"
