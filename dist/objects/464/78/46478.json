        "This is a moving story about a mother and her seven illegitimate children. But far from presenting life as a drudge, Sandrine Veysset conveys the pleasure of a children's universe wrapped up in a land of dreams, play, and their mother's love. Focussing on the mother's extraordinary spirit and resilience in the face of the father's cruelty and exploitation, this heart-rending story is set against the backdrop of changing seasons and the tough routine of farm life in the south of France. In French with English subtitles."
