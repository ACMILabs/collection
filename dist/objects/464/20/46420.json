        "A study of a modern colliery at Comrie, in Scotland. Comrie is a challenge to coalmine owners. It has been fully mechanised with the most modern coal-hewing and safety equipment; ventilation throughout the mine is constant and controlled, and every amenity and safety measure to help the men who work underground is in use. In addition, the surface works are well planned, so that slagheaps and railway-yards do not deface the countryside."
