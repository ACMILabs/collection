        "Bangers (1998, 9 min)- Julie-Anne (Cate Blanchett) comes home from a hard day at the office to discover that her mother (Lynette Curran) has locked the cat in the house all day and that she is expected to cook 'bangers' for dinner. Preparing the meal becomes a manifestation of all the repressed tension in Julie-Anne's work and home life. \"Feeling sexy\" (1998, 50 min)- This film is renowned painter Davida Allen's first feature film. Vicki (Susie Porter) is a passionate and vivacious artist whose love for lust and life is slowly being stifled by domestic doldrums. Unable to elicit appropriate responses from her doctor husband Greg (Tamblyn Lord), Vicki embarks on a carnal affair with art student Hugo. When Vicki confesses her indiscretion to Greg, punishment comes in the shape of a blue-heeler who nearly destroys the house and Vicki's psyche. Novelty being the spice of life, Vicki will have to call on all the resources of her creativity and imagination to coax Greg along on the path to restoring their relationship."
