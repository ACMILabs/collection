        "Episode of Series \"Insight profile\". Author John Marsden discusses the theories behind writing a successful novel. Using examples from his own work, he explores the different writing styles he uses in his own works, the way the characters think, and the motivating factors which make the characters come to life on the page. Also includes discussion on sentence structure, imagery, and how to select the right words to captivate the reader."
