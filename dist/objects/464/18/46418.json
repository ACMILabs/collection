        "Episode number 7 of Series \"DoDo: the kid from outer space\". DoDo is a kid with extraordinary powers, and he knows how to use them. When he arrives on earth, DoDo has a series of adventures with Compy the Computer Bird and Professor Fingers, who can invent anything. From Hollywood to Loch Ness, from the Pyramids to Paris, DoDo and his pals have fun at the movies, help Interpol capture some spies, find sunken treasure, visit a rodeo and still have time to keep the world from being sold. In this episode Professor Fingers, wanting to become famous, discovers a new antibiotic which will hopefully cure an Arabian sheik's only son who has been ill for over a year with a mysterious disease. DoDo and the Professor travel to Arabia with the cure and are rewarded for their work. Animated by Harold Whitaker, John Smith, Tony Whitehouse, Tony Guy, Bruno Bozzetto, Arthur Humberstone."
