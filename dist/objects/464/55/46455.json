        "This is a superb documentary featuring every species of bear around the world, and their fight for survival. Contains images which seemingly show that bears, as a species, are thriving; the truth is somewhat less attractive. The polar bear is the only species surviving in sufficient numbers in the wild to make it relatively safe, some of their darker cousins are staring extinction right in the face."
