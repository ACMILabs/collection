        "A picturesque account of the search of a particularly naive young man for his ideal mate in the big city (San Francisco) and his rather overwhelming success at the film's conclusion. Though told with tongue in cheek, it has a lot to say about loneliness in a busy world. Stylistically, \"Adventures of Jimmy\" takes a not undeserved poke at those psychoanalytical literary travelogues so popular in the 1950's featuring the neurotic as hero. Mr Broughton reads the commentary while Weldon Kees, himself a poet and painter, arranged and plays the musical accompaniment. Written by James Broughton. Photography by Frank Stauffacher."
