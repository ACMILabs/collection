        "'De Dam' in Amsterdam is the capital of adolescent Europe, a town square beside a canal where the young of four continents gather, talk, sing and love. In its search to find and know what the new generation thinks and feels about the world, the United Nations sent a camera crew to the Netherlands, spoke to many youths from England, Canada, Denmark, Switzerland and Malaysia, and caught a wide variety of attitudes on many public issues."
