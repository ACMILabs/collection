        "Filmed in one of the Greater London Council's adventure playgrounds where activities are built around tall forest trees. It shows the playground activities which appeal to children and in which they can engage with comparative safety and security in the presence of a play leader. All types of play equipment are obviously enjoyed by the children of all ages in the delightful park setting. A non-narrated films blending music and playground noises in its soundtrack."
