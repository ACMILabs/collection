        "A light-hearted autobiographical commentary on the life cycle of a blue bottle, from new laid egg to airborn maturity. Sequences include the laboured burrowing of the chrysalis through a bed of loose stones and and the wriggling, writhing and eventual rending of the cocoon. The relating of the single embryo to a swarm of its fellows simplifies the process in the life cycle."
