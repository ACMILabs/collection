        "Re-enacts the hardships of two trappers and their Indian scout during a few days in 1840. The mountain men trap beaver and trade pelts with friendly Indians. After contact with hostile Indians they reconsider their way of life. Gives the flavour of a transitional period in the westward expansion of the US."
