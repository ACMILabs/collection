        "London is the busiest airport in the world; 38 airlines use it and some 600 planes arrive and depart every 24 hours. Passengers from many nations pass through the airport and are assisted in every way posible by an efficient staff. The control tower and servicing staff are in operation seven days of the week, 24 hours a day. When passenger planes are not so numerous heavy freight planes take over. Radio control enables planes to land and take off in foggy weather and at night."
