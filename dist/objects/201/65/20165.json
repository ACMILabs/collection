        "Civil defense workers carry no guns. Their job is to help where tragedy has become personal reality. This film shows the activities, training and operations of civil defence organisations in Australia. The film is designed to assist in training civil defence recruits in all States and to widen appreciation of the need for civil defence preparedness among the general public in times of both peace and war. Adapted from the film \"Aftermath\" by Film Australia for the Natural Disasters Organization. No other credits available."
