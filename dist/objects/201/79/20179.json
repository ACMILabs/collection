        "Episode of Series \"Interaction in the Multicultural Classroom\". Aggression is a concentrated, focussed reaction to lack of security and approval. Within the classroom aggression on the part of teachers can take the form of verbal abuse, stridency and belittling techniques to satisfy the teacher's need for security at the expense of pupils. The film shows that pupils can respond to this behaviour by aggression in return or by withdrawal."
