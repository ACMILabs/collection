        "Describes a little boy's adventurous train ride, while his mother frantically searches for him. The little boy falls asleep after the initial excitement of the ride is dispelled, and awakens to find the train in a railway yard, and is scared by the alien and bewildering surrounds. In an endeavour to escape he rushes blindly into the arms of a friendly railway worker who calms his fear and re-unites him with his mother. Written by John Richardson and stars Stephen Paul as the boy and Ethel Paul as his mother."
