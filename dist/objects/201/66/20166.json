        "An experimental film showing the fascination of an old house and its garden for a small girl. She goes there to retrieve a lost ball, and wanders about looking at the trees and flowers first, and then going through the Georgian doorway and up the staircase exploring the rooms, looking at the pictures, trying an old fashioned cane chair and then, becoming engrossed in her surroundings, she knocks over a vase of daisies and is frightened as she sees ugly masks staring at her from the walls. She dashes downstairs and out the gate without stopping even to retrieve her ball. Photographed by Mike Browning, music by Allan Lee."
