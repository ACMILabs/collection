        "Portrays the difficulties experienced by a man who wants to go straight but is unable to get work because he has a prison record. Day after day Charles Brown answers the want ads but employers will not hire an ex-convict. Doubts and fears beset him - he is sincere in his desire to work at the trade he learned in the penitentiary and yet society will not trust him. Eventually, before he falls into his old ways, the John Howard Society secures a job for him where he can take his place in society and regain his self-respect. Film award: Canadian Film Awards."
