        "An allegory of contemporary society, this animation film shows a society where man has lost his freedom in the struggle to wrest recognition from the very society that is restricting his freedom. The chair is the symbol of success. Without a chair, man is a social outcast. Highly critical of our way of life and modern society, the film questions the present and the future. Complex and innovative animation techniques emphasize the message. A film without words. (Awards: Annecy; Oberhausen; Chicago)"
