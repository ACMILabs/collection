        "The two worlds of 11 year-old Musembe are the two worlds of 20th century Africa: the modern city where Musembe and his parents live in a large apartment building, and the primitive village where his civil servant father was born. A journey \"home\" - back to the family's village - shows us the natural beauty of Kenya and gives a very human insight into the decisions which confront many Africans today. Musembe feels drawn to the village, and the tribal customs but his father reminds him, \"We are city people now\", and we realize the emotional conflicts which come with rapid social change."
