        "Episode of Series \"Disordered Mind\". Philip, an attractive, intelligent six year old is always in trouble at home and at school because of his aggressive behaviour. At the suggestion of the school authorities his mother takes him to a child psychiatrist, who discovers that his fighting covers deep-seated anxieties. We see the psychiatrists Dr. Hyman Caplan, Dr. June Cumberland and Dr. Taylor Statten counselling Philip and his mother, and the boy's teachers discussing his change in behaviour following several months of treatment."
