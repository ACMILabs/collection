        "The travels of a red bicycle, assembled in Nairobi, enable us to learn about economic life in Africa, as it passes to a succession of owners. A tribal chief visiting the city buys it for his son and takes it back to his village in the bush. Subsequently, it is acquired by a young farmer, a government coffee tester, some tourists on safari, and eventually returned to the original village, where its parts are broken up and shared by everyone."
