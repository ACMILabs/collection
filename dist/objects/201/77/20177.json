        "Episode of Series \"Adolescent Development\". Focuses on the behaviour that reflects the emotional turmoil of early adolescence including giggling, destructive criticism of school, unrealistic ideas of their future, hours spent in seemingly useless activity. Most of the scenes are set in the home and show parents making appropriate and inappropriate responses. Different personality types, such as the leader and the quiet type have been selected to illustrate this budding stage. Produced for the parents of teenagers, not the teenagers themselves. Girls are chided for \"their unrealistic ideas of their own future.\" Boys are criticized for the way they \"seem to spend hours in completely useless activity.\""
