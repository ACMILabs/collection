        "A vast land of contradictions seen by plane from Algiers to Capetown, its varied history, primitive in the south and highly civilized in the north. The wide range of climatic and geographical conditions and their effect on the way of life. Thriving cosmopolitan cities and tiny villages; jungle growth; desert; mineral wealth and arid lands, people black and white; all are part of the African continent."
