        "A trial demonstration was arranged at Orange, N.S.W., in which a Cessna plane carrying 75 gallons of water was used to find out what part light aircraft can play in fighting grass fires. Although the test was inconclusive it did show that a small plane would be of no use on a day of extreme fire danger."
