        "Outspoken views of young men from Canada and Great Britain about what is wrong with the world. Provocative questions of the time are discussed by the young men, some of whom accept the values of our age, others who rebel against a society they call smug, empty and afraid. How the viewpoints of youth differ, individually, and between Canada and Britain are noted by Professor Frank Scott. Edited by Brian Keene."
