        "As a medium for information exchange, the telephone is constantly evolving, and so too are the techniques we use to make this powerful tool work for us in the business community. It's important that we master these techniques. This video aims to improve your presentation and time management with the telephone in terms of your voice (variations in tone, pitch and volume), spelling out difficult names or numbers, good listening, mood, techniques for putting callers at ease and etiquette for receiving business calls using \"hold\" options and note taking."
