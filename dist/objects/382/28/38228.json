        "Episode of Series \"Famous authors\". A biographical portrait, set against a backdrop of the Dorchester countryside with portraits and engravings of the period. Although Hardy lived for periods of his life in London and Cornwall, it was his native countryside and its inhabitants which provided the inspiration for his novels and poetry. The program documents the influence of the poet, William Barnes, Leslie Stephen of the Cornhill Magazine, his two wives on his life and work and the commercial success he enjoyed."
