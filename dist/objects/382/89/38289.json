        "Elizabeth Macarthur made an enormous contribution to the establishment of Australia's wool industry, but is usually not recognised in the history books. Each time her husband, John, returned to England (for four years and later for eight years) Elizabeth was left to breed the sheep, produce the wool, manage convicts, bushfires and Aboriginal uprisings, run a profitable farm, act as accountant and be a mother to their six children."
