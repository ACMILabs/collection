        "Episode of Series \"Dragons tongue. - Series 2.\". In this Chinese language program, Professor Colin Mackerras explores the Public Transport system in Beijing. This is heavily used as cars are a rarity. Buses are in great demand and overcrowded. Trains are more modern and luxurious by comparison, while bicycles are by far the most common form of transport. This episode illustrates the vocabulary and protocols required to use the Public Transport system effectively. Presents a sequence looking at the history of the Chinese Language and the confusion which can arise when words sound the same but have different meaning."
