        "Artistic genius and the descent into madness are at the centre of this stunning drama about Camille Claudel. An independent woman, she ventured into the male dominated sphere of sculpture in the 1880's and left an indelible mark on the genre. After achieving an apprenticeship to renowned sculptor, Auguste Rodin (24 years older than she), and reaching a level of intimacy with him, she longs for more. His refusal initiates a decline in their relationship and her sanity. Based upon the biography of Camille Claudel by Rein-Marie Paris, great niece of Camille, this hauntingly dark and brooding film will sweep its audience along the raging torrent that was Camille Claudel's life. Stars Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Adjani. English subtitles with French dialogue."
