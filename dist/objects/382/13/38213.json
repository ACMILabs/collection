        "Episode of Series \"Journey into Japan\". Once a sacred Shinto site that drew devout pilgrims, Fuji is seen to be ringed by polluting industries, littered with trash, and topped by crassly commercial souvenir stands and fast food sheds. For residents of Tokyo, Fuji used to be a daily sight; today, because of the smog, they rarely see it. Later as he explores Tokyo, Keith Adam muses on how industrial development has cut the people off from more than just the sight of Fuji but also from what it once stood for. Shinto traditions have disappeared into pragmatic secularism; close-knit, communal neighbourhoods have given way to cramped, impersonal high-rise apartments, agricultural land and open spaces are being overwhelmed by industrial plants that pollute without thought for the future. Narrated by Keith Adam."
