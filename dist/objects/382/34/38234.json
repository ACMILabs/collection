        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Dandelion = Pusteblume\". Two more episodes of the popular German children's series Pusteblume (Dandelion). \" A Pig in a rocking chair\" - Peter Lustig would like a pig, but where can he keep it in such restricted quarters? On the veranda in the rocking chair? Peter takes a look at how animals are properly kept on a farm where there are cows in the meadow and dogs, cats and doves have their own little house. The farmer and his family look after all these animals, because they derive their livelihood from eventually selling the animals. \"Mermaids don't need snorkels\" - If you want to observe animals underwater, then it is best to use a snorkel, since this will allow you to breathe under the water. For really deep diving, it is necessary to take a bottle of oxygen attached to your back in order to look at sunken ships or to do research."
