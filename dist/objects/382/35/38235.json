        "Celestine (Jeanne Moreau) takes up a post as chambermaid to a middle-class family and becomes the catalyst that reveals their sexual, religious and social repressions. The film, foot fetishism and all, is pure Bunuel, a sharp social satire in which the sexy, cruel and cool Moreau is wonderful. Loosely based on the novel by Octave Mirbeau."
