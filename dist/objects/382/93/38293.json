        "Being a parent is one of humanity's most demanding and rewarding experiences - a mixture of infatuation, mad passion, fear, fun, guilt and enduring love. This amusing documentary looks at four young couples who share their intimate experiences of parenting by providing privileged access to rare moments on home video recordings and interviews. It's a fascinating story of how a family grows and changes. \"Baby Crazy\" is narrated by well known actress Noni Hazelhurst, and is almost required viewing for soon to be parents, baby watchers, and baby lovers. It shows all the sensual, tender, crazy and fun-filled aspects of babyhood along with the pain and not so fun-filled aspects of having a child. Inspired by the book \"Baby Crazy\" by Helen Townsend."
