        "The paintings of Dutch 17th century painter Rembrandt van Rijn, are world famous, but a large number of his beautiful drawings have never been seen by the public. This film explores this rich oeuvre, setting it in the context of Rembrandt's life, his work, his contemporaries and the society of 17th century Holland."
