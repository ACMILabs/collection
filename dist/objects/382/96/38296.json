        "Cathy Ann Matthews had only pleasant and peaceful recollections of her childhood. Not until her own daughter was getting married did the memories of the past come flooding back. This sensitive and moving docu-drama is about a woman coming to terms with the horrible abuse she went through as a child and deals with the way these memories flooded her mind until she became almost suicidal. Stars Deidre Rubenstein, Tony Barry, Gabrielle Mason, Julie Hamilton and Noni Hazlehurst. Based on the book 'Breaking though: no longer a victim of child abuse' by Cathy Ann Matthews."
