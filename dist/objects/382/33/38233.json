        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Dandelion = Pusteblume\". Two episodes of the successful German children's series Pusteblume. \"A Load of old rubbish\" - Many old things are thrown away simply because people don't know what else to do with them. Peter Lustig shows us ways to reuse many things. Something new can be made, toys can be exchanged when they are no longer a favourite and many waste products, like glass bottles, can be reused, as long as we don't just throw them away. \"The world under our feet\" - Somewhere in every town, there is always some digging going on. Cars and trains travel underground in tunnels with multiple exits. When this happens, the earth gets pushed upwards, just like a mole hill which can be so annoying in the middle of your garden. However, people make even bigger hills when they go looking for coal, ores or salt in the earth, since all the earth that is excavated during mining has to be put somewhere."
