        "Three soldiers who served in the Vietnam War detail their experiences of training and combat. Max Nicolson describes his conscription through the \"marble\" system, and explains the importance of mateship during basic training. Alf Law discusses the racism directed towards the Vietnamese and his personal experiences of Agent Orange. Peter Harris discusses his hatred of army training and also the deep conflicts faced by the soldiers when they returned to Australia and confronted wide-spread opposition to their involvement in the War."
