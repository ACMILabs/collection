        "If the idea - a trek from the North to the South Pole travelling along the 30 degree East line of longitude - was simplicity itself, the actual journey proved to be quite the opposite. Using every conceivable mode of transport Michael Palin and his crew passed through 17 countries and filmed for five months. What you see is what they saw - warts, bedbugs and all."
