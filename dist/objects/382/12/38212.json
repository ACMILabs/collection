Chinese schools follow a traditional curricula where the emphasis is on reading, writing and mathematics. Facilities are often simple and the teaching using the traditional \"chalk and talk\" method. Schools are responsible for teaching the importance of birth control and hygiene to students as well as giving them a moral and political education. Outside the classroom students play Chinese games such as \"elastics\". The program also looks at the importance of radical characters in Chinese writing."
