        "Joan (Wendy Hiller) has known exactly what she wanted since childhood, and all her dreams are to come true with her forthcoming marriage to a millionaire - but a storm strands her on a remote Hebridean island and the forces of nature conspire to change her mind. With its overwhelming sense of place and stunning visual effects, this most personal of Powell and Pressburger's films is also one of their most perfect. \"I had reached the point of thinking there were no more masterpieces, until I saw 'I Know Where I'm Going'.\" Martin Scorsese"
