        "Episode of Series \"Dragons tongue. - Series 2.\". In this Chinese language program, Professor Colin Mackerras looks at recreational activities in China. Cinema going is particularly popular and European and American films are being shown more frequently. The Peking Opera is a much loved and traditional art form, steeped in cultural heritage. Although it is not as popular amongst young Chinese, tourists love the rich pageantry. The Chinese also love outdoor events in parks and on waterways. The composition of Chinese characters in Chinese writing is also examined."
