        "Episode of Series \"Dragons tongue. - Series 2.\". In this Chinese language program, Professor Colin Mackerras explores the many ways in which the Chinese people look after their health. Hospitals may be run by Government Departments for workers. Apart from conventional medicine, traditional therapies such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion are widely accepted. Herbal remedies are also important to Chinese medicine and many pharmacies carry both manufactured drugs and herbal treatments. This program also looks at the composition of a character when practising calligraphy."
