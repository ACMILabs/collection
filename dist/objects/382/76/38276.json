        "Episode of Series \"Tonia Todman's craft room\". Stencilling, a craft that started thousands of years ago with primitive cave painting has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is a very adaptable and creative way for the home decorator to personalise his or her home in a way that is appealing and inexpensive. Tonia Todman tells you all you need to know to be able to enhance your home with charming stencilled designs. Stencils can be applied to your walls, floors, tables, cupboards, beds, boxes, trays, fabrics, the list goes on. Their application can stretch as far as your imagination takes you, to give your home and homeware a unique, picturesque and individual touch. Tonia tells you how to plan and design a stencil, how to transfer designs, how to position and space your stencils for the most effective results, and describes painting techniques and the choice of colour schemes."
