        "Two episodes of the \"Blue Wilderness\" series in which Ron and Valerie Taylor investigate conservation methods for sea creatures. In \"Shark shocker\" they go to South Africa to see an electronic shark barrier, which may deter sharks from swimming near beaches, as an alternative to nets which trap other sea creatures. In \"Turning turtle\" the Taylor's show the need for rescue work with sea turtles on Raine Island off the Queensland coast."
