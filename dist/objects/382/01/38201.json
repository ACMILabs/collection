        "In the late 18th century, Rama I, first of the great Chakri kings, ordered his architects to build a new capital for Thailand - Bangkok. In Thai, Bangkok is called the \"City of Angels\". Today one tenth of Thailand's population lives in Bangkok, the most urbanised city in Thailand, which contains all the elements of Thai life seen in the extreme. Presenter Keith Adam, takes us on a tour of this city of contrast, a city of canals, superb temples and palaces alongside bustling markets, traffic jams, pollution and poverty."
