        "Three important and poetic films exploring homoeroticism. (1)\"Un Chant d'Amour\" is the only film directed by Jean Genet. A silent movie filmed in 1950, the film sensuously explores the themes that obsessed Genet in his writing: homosexual love and desire within the oppressive confines of prison. This explicit film was banned from circulation for 20 years. (2)\"Flames of Passion\", made in 1989, is a witty gay remake of \"Brief Encounter\". (3)\"Looking for Langston\" (1989) is dedicated to the black artists of the Harlem Renaissance. Writers such as Langston Hughes and James Baldwin not only celebrated the African-American history suppressed by white society but also liberated black homosexual desire. \"Looking for Langston\" is a beautiful and erotic essay on black men's love for each other and the difficulty of negotiating gay love in a racist culture. From the director of \"Young Soul Rebels\"."
