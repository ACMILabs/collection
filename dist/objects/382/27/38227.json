        "Episode of Series \"Famous authors\". Born in Portsmouth and raised in Chatham and London, Dickens' early life was occasionally happy but largely marked by poverty and hardship. The trials of his family in a debtor's prison, his own experience in a blacking factory, and later as a law clerk, as well as the years he spent roaming around the London streets were all to find their way into his novels. A goalsetting workaholic Dickens achieved early success and a fame he was never to lose. Set against the landscapes he knew and loved, and illustrated by portraits and contemporary engravings, this video gives an overview of Dickens' life and influences."
