        "This visual history of Australian women documents the contribution of a previously overlooked group. Their work, their mothering and their civilising influence has been a major factor in Australia's coming of age. This program begins with the daily life of Aboriginal women and also discusses issues important to these women later in the 19th Century. Also examines convict and free women; women's contributions and life during the gold rush; fashion, education and family size, the impact of the 1890's depression on women. Some individual women highlighted on this video are Mary Reiby, Caroline Chisholm, Louisa Lawson, Catherine Spence, Dame Nellie Melba, Mother Mary Mackillop, Truganini and Daisy Bates."
