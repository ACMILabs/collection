        "Episode of Series \"Dragons tongue. - Series 2.\". In this Chinese language program, Professor Colin Mackerras looks at popular sports and physical activities in China. Basketball is rising in popularity and China used its excellence in Ping Pong for diplomacy when it was re-opening its doors to the world. Physical education in schools is seen as very important, while Mao Tse-tung encouraged participation in the martial arts as a way of developing a physically, morally and spiritually sound country. The program also examines the different writing styles and the emphasis on balance and movement in forming characters."
