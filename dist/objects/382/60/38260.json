        "For the last decade in Nicaragua, women have been at the frontline of fighting and won the respect of their male companions both as organisers and combatants. Women have brought about this revolutionary change in attitudes by freeing themselves of the stereotype conventions regarding the place of women in war. The six women profiled in the film are remarkable for their sensitivity and the candidness with which they tell their stories. Though they have all experienced the horror of war, none have been hardened. They release their deepest feelings through poetry, and identify more with humanitarian idealism than political ideologies. Filmed entirely on location in Nicaragua."
