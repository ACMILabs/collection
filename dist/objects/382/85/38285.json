        "This program starts with the post-war baby boom and goes on to look at immigration, housing, views on women's work, the rock and roll craze and the new morality, the pill, censorship and equal pay - all issues highly relevant to Australian women in this era. Issues important to Aboriginal women are also explored. Some individual women highlighted in this episode are Germaine Greer, Bobbie Sykes, Kath Walker, Dawn Fraser, Dame Joan Sutherland, Jan Marsh, Judith Wright and Pat O'Shane."
