        "This lavishly mounted tragedy is Luchino Visconti's final film and it is among his greatest. Tullio and his wife Giuliana appear to have an open marriage - Giuliana is aware of her husband's liaison with a young countess named Teresa but is prepared to do nothing about it. It is not until she herself falls passionately in love with another man, Filippo D'Arborio, and bears his child that the marriage begins to fall apart. Tullio, driven by jealousy takes irrevocable steps to sever his wife's connection with her lover. Stars Giancarlo Giannini, Laura Antonelli and Jennifer O'Neill. Based on the novel by Gabriele D'Annunzio."
