        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Dandelion = Pusteblume\". Two episodes of the successful children's series Pusteblume. \"A roof over your head\" - People live in houses in order to protect themselves from the wind, rain, heat or cold. Peter Lustig experiences what can happen without a roof over one's head. In addition, he shows us how people build new houses and how some animals build themselves a hideaway. \"Tracks in the wood\" - Peter Lustig finds lots of tracks made in the wood by animals who live there. Naturally, he also hears lots of different noises made by animals when they forage for food or creep through the undergrowth. People go into the woods too of course, to collect mushrooms or just to go for a walk. The forest ranger is really cross with those who rubbish the woods and damage the natural environment."
