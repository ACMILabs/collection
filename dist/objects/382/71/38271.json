        "In this, the first of three videos, the Australian artist and teacher, Val Osborn, gives a step-by step guide to basic oil-painting techniques. Beginning with a brief history of Australian art from the time of the first settlers, to illustrate the special requirements of painting the Australian landscape, he then gives an introduction to the tools of the artist. Finally he demonstrates two exercises in creating three dimensions on a flat surface, a white billiard ball on a white background and a red apple, showing how to create highlights, mid-tones, shadow and drop shadow."
