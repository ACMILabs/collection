        "Episode number 1 of Series \"A New vision\". Botticelli, one of the greatest exponents of Renaissance art, and celebrated in his own time, fell into obscurity until the 19th Century. He spent most of his life in Florence, with periods in Rome, and in his time created some of the most famous paintings of all time. He brought a new grace, energy and rhythm to the human form, which became more expressive in his hands. Under the influence of Savaranola he gave up painting for a while and became a religious fanatic, but after Savaranola's death returned to a more melancholy vision of painting, including his drawings for Dante's Divine comedy"
