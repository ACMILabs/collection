        "Set in colourful Papua New Guinea, Tim Flannery, while ill, was being carried from the mountains when he noticed one of the stretcher bearers wore a black claw as pendant. This was the first piece in a biological detective story to locate a completely new species of mammal. Tim searched for 7 years until he found the Black Tree Kangaroo, or \"Tenkile\". This creature had never been filmed before. It was one of the many animal survivors \"marooned\" on ecological islands in the sky, rainforest peaks isolated from lowland environments."
