        "Surreal, dryly hilarious road movie from one of the most talented directors to emerge on the international film scene in the late 1980s. The scenario chronicles the plight of a mine worker who loses his job and sets out on a crosscountry odyssey but who is forced by circumstances into a life of crime. Winner of the International Critics Prize at the Moscow International Film Festival. In Finnish with English subtitles."
