        "This video brings out of the shadows some Australian women whose achievements in science and technology have been largely unacknowledged. It attempts to redress the situation by bringing into focus some examples of their successes. It also makes the point that through the determination and dedication of women in the past, women today have inherited the right to forge a career for themselves in any field they choose. Evocative vignettes from the past together with pictures and interviews featuring modern women form an excellent vehicle for further discussion. Suitable for years 7 - 12."
