        "Kirk Douglas hosts this program which takes as its starting point an exhibition of impressionist and post-impressionist art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The program focuses on the subject matter chosen by these artists, their emphasis on light and colour, and the new methods and technologies they employed. Prominence is given to the works of Monet, Cezanne and Van Gogh, but almost all of the impressionist and post-impressionists are represented and discussed briefly. A valuable introduction to this important art movement."
