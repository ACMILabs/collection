        "Australia's women's history from 1788 to the present has been a time of enormous change for Aboriginal women, Australian-born and migrant women, working-class and middleclass, in war time and in peace. This video explores the changes in the lives of these women throughout history - changes brought about by economic conditions, legislation, immigration, education, war, the pill and women's liberation."
