        "Episode of Series \"Read it yourself\". Nerys Hughes presents the well-known children's story, \"The Enormous Turnip\". An old man planted some turnip seeds, but one of the seeds grows and grows, till it is so enormous no one could harvest it - at least, not until help came. The video comes with the picture book of the same story so young viewers can both watch and read the story. The video concludes with a talk on turnips, a song about planting turnips and some related gardening and craft activities for children."
