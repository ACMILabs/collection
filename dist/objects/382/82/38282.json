        "The initially small minority protesting against Australian involvement in the Vietnam War flourished into a massive mobilisation against the war that not only ended Australian participation in the war, but also radicalised and irreversibly changed Australian society. In this video three participants in the anti-war movement discuss their involvement. Irene Miller was an original member of the Save Our Sons Movement, one of the earliest of the anti-war organisations. Michael Hamel-Green was a draft resister and he gives a fascinating account of the \"underground\" movement which worked to protect draft resisters from prison by installing them in \"safe houses\". Jean McLean discusses the history of the anti-war movement and the lead up to the first anti-war Moratorium in 1970, the largest protest in Australia's history."
