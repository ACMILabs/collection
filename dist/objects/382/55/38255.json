        "Gloria is a housewife with attitude. She has to be: one son is a drug dealer, her youngest son is having an affair with the family dentist, her husband can't excite her anymore, and her mother-in-law is determined to drive her crazy. To survive in the concrete jungle of Madrid, Gloria snorts cleaning powders and searches for sex with masculine strangers. This wickedly funny movie is an early feature by Almodovar and it revels in inverting and satirising the conventions of television soap opera and of the Hollywood \"women's film\". Absurd, fast-paced and stylistically innovative, \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" stars the fabulous Carmen Maura."
