        "This visual history of Australian women documents the contribution of an often overlooked group. Their work, their mothering and their civilising influence has been a major factor in Australia's coming of age. Yet women have been receiving second class status from officialdom since the earliest days of Australia's settlement. This program begins by looking at the reduction in the size of families, the White Australia policy and changes in society's views on morality. It looks at both World Wars and their impact on Australian women. The contrast between the flappers and the poverty of the 1920's is interesting to consider. Jewish refugees and British immigrants, votes for women, changes in fashion and issues important to Aboriginal women are all discussed. Individual women highlighted in this episode include Vida Goldstein, Muriel Heagney, Elizabeth Kenny, Dame Enid Lyons, Dame Mary Gilmore and Katherine Suzannah Pritchard."
