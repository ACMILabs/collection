        "In this second lesson, artist Val Osborn introduces the concept of tone, first by showing the tonal possibilities of black and white drawings, and then by explaining colour relationships, secondary and tertiary colours, pastels and transparent colours and how to mix them on your palette. He then introduces some of the basics of landscape painting by completing two exercises; painting rocks and painting trees."
