        "The eminent architectural historian Alec Clifton Taylor presents three of his personal favourites - a choice based on each town's character and visual impact rather than dry historical fact. With his unrivalled knowledge of building materials and a discerning eye, the viewer learns to appreciate Chichester's marvellous use of flint, the \"bastard\" limestone of Richmond and the fan vaulting of Tewkesbury Abbey. A delightful, informative program for both those with a passion for architecture and those who know little."
