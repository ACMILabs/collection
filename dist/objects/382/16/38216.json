        "Episode of Series \"Journey into Japan\". Examines how geishas are trained in song, dance, and sophisticated conversation, and how they still reign supreme as Japan's most prestigious entertainers, as compared to women who work in clubs and bars. Geishas are employed for important functions. The program also takes a very general look at the state of women in Japan today."
