        "This disturbing and controversial portrait of Aoi, a reluctant prostitute on the streets of Bangkok, is a very personal piece of work from filmmmaker Dennis O'Rourke. The soul of this young woman is captured as she shares her life story with the camera as much as with the filmmaker. O'Rourke picked her up in a bar and paid a pimp for her services. They stayed in a cheap motel in the red-light district. What proceeds to be laid bare, is a searing portrait of prostitution and the self-loathing that it helps breed."
