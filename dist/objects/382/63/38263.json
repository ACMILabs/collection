        "Broad Shots was made by a group of young women from Broadmeadows as part of the Broadmeadows Healthy Localities Project, a local youth health promotion project. It looks at the issue of violence against young women through a series of interviews, skits and voxpops. \"Broad Shots\" is funny and fast and is a good starting point for discussion on domestic violence, sexual harassment and assertiveness. It is targeted at young people aged 13 to 16 years. Also contains appearances by comediennes Judith Lucy and Magda Szubanski."
