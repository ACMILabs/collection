        "Interviews with three Australians who served in the Vietnam War. Kevin Freeman and John Dellaca served as conscripts in the war, and both talk of their combat experiences as well as their difficulties in returning to Australia. Fay Lewis served as a nurse in Vietnam and she discusses the pressures of being a female in the \"male\" environment of war, as well as explaining the experiences that led to her involvement in the anti-war movement. The interviews reveal the horror of war as well as documenting the tensions faced by the conscripts about Australia's involvement in the War."
