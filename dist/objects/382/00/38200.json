        "Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev, supported by artists from the Royal Ballet and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, perform one of the most brilliant ballets ever seen, which is superbly captured in this memorable film. With music by Serge Prokofiev and choreography by Kenneth MacMillan, this breathtaking performance was filmed live at the majestic Royal Opera House, Convent Garden in 1966, and it still stands today as one of the most highly acclaimed films of a ballet ever made."
