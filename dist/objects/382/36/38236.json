        "Episode of Series \"Mini dragons. II\". Indonesia, now the world's 4th largest nation, has made rapid strides in economic development in the past decade, but not without cost both to traditional Indonesian culture and the natural environment. The impact of these economic changes is illustrated by profiling three of the \"winners\" in the new Indonesia - Bob Hasan, Indonesia's \"King of the Forest\" and 10th richest man, who has made his fortune producing plywood for the Japanese from Indonesia's rainforests; Francois, an entrepreneur hoping to develop a tourist resort on the still unspoiled island of Lombok; and finally, Rakhmat, a young aeronautical engineer who must leave his family in Indonesia to study overseas and advance his career."
