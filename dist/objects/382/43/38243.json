        "The story of Aya, the Japanese war bride of an Australian serviceman, spans over twenty years from the early fifties to to the mid-seventies. Hoaas' intention was to question Australian attitudes to Asians and to express, through the character of Aya's husband Frank, some disturbing contradictions in the Australian male psyche. In her examination of cross-cultural complexities Hoaas is reticent in projecting feelings, adopting a somewhat elliptical approach to dramatising Aya's relationship."
