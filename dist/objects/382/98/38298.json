        "Award-winning filmmakers, Dr. Jan Aldenhoven and Glen Carruthers, spent two years working with a team of biologists to produce this engaging and stunningly photographed study of the lives of a mob of 60 Eastern Grey kangaroos in a NSW river valley. The biologists had been studying this mob continuously for fifteen years. Their studies have revealed the richly complex society of the mob. In the course of the year, we see everything from birth to the dramatic and sometimes deadly contests between the males. Winner of a Logie award for best documentary."
