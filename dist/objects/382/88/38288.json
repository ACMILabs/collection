        "This incredibly energetic and intelligent woman stands out as one of the few women who have been recognised throughout Australia's history. She was called a saint in her own lifetime. Caroline Chisholm pioneered migrant welfare and helped the most disadvantaged groups of all; the women and children, the poor and uneducated, the ignorant and the persecuted. She achieved more in her lifetime than almost anyone else in our history."
