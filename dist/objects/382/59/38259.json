        "Abandoned early in life, Ruth and Lucille have been raised by various relatives - now it's Aunt Sylvie's (Christine Lahti) turn. But Aunt Sylvie isn't like their other relatives, she used to be a hobo and can't seem to change her eccentric ways. She takes midday naps on park benches and wears an overcoat lined with old newspapers. Sylvie may be embarrassing, but she's like a breath of fresh air to the two girls. Can Lucille and Ruth cope with Sylvie, and can Sylvie cope with the real responsibility of a family? This is a beautiful story of quirky relationships, loneliness, and the bonding of kindred spirits. Based on the book by Marilynne Robinson."
