        "Fellini's second feature is an autobiographical story of five young men who hang around a small sea-town playing pool, getting drunk and teasing young women. Though they all dream of living in the big city and making a success of their lives, only Moraldo manages to overcome inertia and moves to Rome. Anecdotal and often very funny, \"I Vitelloni\" finally conveys an aura of melancholy nostalgia as the desires and ambitions of the young men are revealed as ultimately unfulfillable: partly due to circumstance, partly due to economics, partly due to personal weakness."
