        "This video looks at the current soil structure of many of the intensive farming areas of Victoria and how good soil structure is the key to profitable and sustainable agriculture. It investigates current farming practices and reaffirms that it is necessary to assess current farming practices and the way in which we treat our valuable ancient and fragile soils. Some of the problems described are; Crusting, soil fragility, impermeability to water, slaking, soil compaction, wind erosion and waterlogging. The suggested solutions to these problems include minimum tillage techniques - stubble retention, deep ripping and direct drilling. This video tells how farmers recognised soil problems on their farms and how they altered their management systems in order to improve soil structure and farm profitability."
