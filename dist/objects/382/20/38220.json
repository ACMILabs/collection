        "Episode of Series \"Dragons tongue. - Series 2.\". Professor Colin Mackerras explores the shopping habits of the Beijing people. Since the liberalisation of the Chinese economy, there has been a huge increase in the variety of goods for sale and the ways of selling - from markets to privately and collectively owned shops. Three dramatised segments illustrate different aspects of shopping, while the short section on calligraphy introduces the new simplified characters."
