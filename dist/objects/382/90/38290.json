        "Coral Sea dreaming is a remarkable visual and musical odyssey into the world of coral reefs. The haunting and magical experiences of the reef realm are communicated through the camera work of David Hannan who teamed with scientist Russell Kelly and artist Cathy Bone to present their \"dreaming\". The video is without words, but with a specially composed musical score by Adelaide composer Tania Rose. Scientific understanding begins in seeing. \"Coral Sea dreaming\" lets you see for yourself, lets you be the explorer. Accompanied by an educational and resource guide."
