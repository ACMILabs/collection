        "Eminent architectural historian, Alec Clifton Taylor presents three of his personal favourites- a choice based on each town's character and visual impact, rather than dry historical facts. With his unrivalled knowledge of building materials, and discerning eye, the viewer learns to appreciate the \"lively robust and totally self-assured\" key-stones of Stamford, the entertaining Gothic houses of Totnes and the \"riotously exuberant\" timber-framed houses of Ludlow. This program will entertain lovers of architecture and armchair travellers."
