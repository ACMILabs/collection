The three strokes that comprise folk art are demonstrated clearly, simply and step-by-step so that you may practice to perfection at your own pace in your home. Includes scores of hints and shortcuts. Project One is a beautiful oval storage box with a delightfully rustic antique flower arrangement painted on the cover. Project Two is a teapot stand with a simple baroque design."
