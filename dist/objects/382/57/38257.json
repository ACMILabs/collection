        "A poignant love story, a pulse-pounding international music competition, and music of timeless beauty is featured in this enthralling tale of talent and romance. Shortly before the Great War, celebrated singer Joachim Dallaryc (played by real-life opera star Jose Van Dam) suddenly announces his retirement from the stage, leaving the opera world stunned. Only the fabulously wealthy and diabolical Prince Scotti, his lifelong rival, gloats. Dallaryc retreats to the country devoting himself to training two young singers, the beautiful Sophie, who falls in love with him, and Jean, a retired thief who falls in love with Sophie. Their unrelenting and rigorous apprenticeship ends when Sophie and Jean are invited to an international singing competition staged by Prince Scotti. It will lead to either fame and riches - or to Prince Scotti's revenge for his defeat by their teacher in a singing competition two decades before."
