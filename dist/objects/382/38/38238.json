        "Organic farmers work with nature rather than against it, a process of positive cooperation with the soil, without the intervention of chemicals, in order to produce a quality product. Filmed on location in Victoria, this video covers the production, marketing, export potential and labelling of organic produce in Australia. It features citrus grower, Robert Ridgewell; bio-dynamic wheat/sheep farmer, John Greenwood; vegetable grower, Neville Cann and Ian Diamond, organic wholesaler."
