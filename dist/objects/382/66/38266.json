        "Sam Wanamaker introduces this program which covers Lautrec's life, his artistic influences, the art and life of the period and most importantly a survey of all of his work, from his early sketches to the 360 lithographs created between 1891-1901. The program uses a mixture of archival photographs, stills of Lautrec's work, an artist recreating some of his works and animated segments, in Lautrec's style of painting, which illustrate his life and the nightlife he pursued obsessively."
