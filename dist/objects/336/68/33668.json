        "This is an engaging story of young enterprise, pitfalls, and eventual success. It is about two young Greek boys of Montreal who try to earn some extra money for a trip to their homeland by delivering pizzas. The misadventures they encounter, and how they surmount them all, make an amusing story full of youthful initiative. (Awards: Buenos Aires; Cork; San Antonio)"
