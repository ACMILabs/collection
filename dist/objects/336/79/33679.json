        "When Miss Emily Grierson, the town's aristocrat, was young, her tyrannical father drove her suitors away. After his death, Emily succumbed to the advances of a man beneath her station and this film shows the consequences of this event. This film is a twentieth century Gothic tale dealing in the mysterious and the macabre and is of interest to both film and literature classes. Stars Angelica Huston and John Carradine and adapted from the short story by William Faulkner. Narrated by John Houseman."
