        "For some of us home and work are not in the same place. Well paid as a boiler-maker, Gary Honig must often leave home to exercise his highly specialised skill. Sometimes, his wife and two daughters accompany him in their trailer but more often they remain behind in their home in Stony Creek, Alberta. The film describes how one family copes, combining family life, and work in the increasingly industrialised West."
