        "Episode of Series \"Working Artists\". Jim Pallas assembles fantastic sculptures which move and light up as they respond to heat, sound and motion. The film follows Pallas as he creates new pieces, describes finished work and explains the philosophy behind his art. In the final sequence, Pallas attends the unveiling of his latest work which displays intricate light patterns triggered by the movement of dancers."
