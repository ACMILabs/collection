        "Set inside a printing factory in the mid 1930's, this film documents the production of the London telephone directory. Commencing with the preparation of blank rolls of paper, the film progresses through each stage of the production until the directory is ready for delivery. Captures the working conditions and technology of a printing factory in Great Britain in the mid 30's. Made by Norman McLaren while he was working for Britain's General Post Office in the 1930s, this film is a novel attempt to inject some interest into what may be considered a dull subject."
