        "A week-long festival was organised by a group of Montreal citizens to raise funds in support of the Cree Indians who stood to lose their land because of the James Bay hydro-electric project. This film alternates between the spectacular performances of the Indian and Inuit peoples and the meeting halls of Mistassini where they talk of their past to defend their future."
