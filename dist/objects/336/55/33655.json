        "Torn between the world of their childhood and the world where they must mow live and work, two flamboyant Newfoundlanders pay a nostalgic visit to the deserted outport where they were born. This is their story, and the story of so many others who, like them, became victims of the Newfoundland government's controversial Resettlement Program. Credits include: Photography by Kent Nason."
