        "A film about a group of farmers and their wives who went to live and work among the Tanzanians, training them in Canadian methods of grain growing and production. It examines the cultural effects of this exchange both on the Canadians, who found themselves isolated by geography and language, and on the Tanzanians who were exposed to Canadian work habits and technology."
