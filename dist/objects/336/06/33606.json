        "Jan, an intelligent 32 year old, separated from her husband, has suffered a nervous breakdown and tried to commit suicide. She is not helped by a cliche-ridden mother, but a sympathetic and affectionate bond exists with her sister, Barb. After repeated attempts, Barb finally succeeds in having Jan admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. The film deals with the issues of self-doubt and failure, the structure of the human personality and the whole area of family relationships."
