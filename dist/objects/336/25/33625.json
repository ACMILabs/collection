        "250,000 managers get fired in North America annually. A cinematic drama drawn from real life examining executive terminations and a new industry specialising in handling them. The central figure, D.R. \"Biff\" Wilson, 44, is a composite figure based on extensive conversations with fired executives; the others play themselves. An interesting look at business ethics. (Awards: New York, Yorkton, Chicago, Oscar nomination)"
