        "Episode of Series \"The Australian eye V\".

The Roberts and Conder story is told through paintings, drawings, photographs and extracts from early films. Places the artists in a social and historical context within Australia and also indicates the influence of the French Impressionists upon their work. Suitable for middle and upper secondary, and tertiary levels."
