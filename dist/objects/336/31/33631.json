        "Balladeer James Bennet satirises the history of Halifax in a song which he composed and sings in honour of the city's founder. Clad in period costumes, Bennet travels through time against a background of old photographs and paintings, archival and contemporary film footage, until he ultimately finds himself in the midst of the city's present-day building boom."
