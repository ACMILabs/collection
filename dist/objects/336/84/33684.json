        "This is a contemporary portrait of the nuclear age told through the lives of those directly affected by it. The film is shot on location at the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Facility near Denver, the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant in central California, and in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \"Dark Circle\" interweaves dramatic personal stories with rare, recently declassified footage of the secret world in which the hydrogen bomb is manufactured, tested and sold. Four years in the making, this film reveals the ironic and complex human costs of a nuclear economy even in the absence of a nuclear war."
