        "Many films which pertain to dance and dancers tend to show only the seemingly effortless end product, while generally ignoring the hours of preparation that are involved. This film succinctly communicates the paradox of beauty achieved through sweat and diligence by focusing on the different preparations of two ballet dancers, Lois Bewley and Lawrence Rhodes. Photography by Peter Sova. No commentary - music only."
