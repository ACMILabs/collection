        "A group of pupils, aged 8-13, start off on a school project to find out all they can about garbage, its composition, its disposal and the impact of its disposal on the environment. The places they visit tell us a lot about the society we live in and about ecology, cities, art and history. The students are shown that what we do today has an impact on what happens tomorrow."
