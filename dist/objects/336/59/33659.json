        "A visual poem, vivid, lyrical, as intriguing in its colour fantasy as in the beauty of its images. This is an escape from a merry-go-round of painted horses suddenly turned to flesh and blood, making a wild plunge for freedom. But these are horses of extraordinary colour - lime, mauve, bronze and gold - as if caught in some mysterious kaleidoscope of the dawn. A technical triumph, these unusual effects were achieved in the printing process. (Awards: Teheran, Colombo, Tel Aviv, Philadelphia)"
