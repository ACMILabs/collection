        "Taking the roles of different characters, two actors perform the life story of a person called Baxter. The various significant stages of Baxter's life, his death and his acceptance into heaven are performed. This delightful production has no dialogue but is accompanied by the actors' own sound effects. Patrice Arbour stars as Baxter and Bernard Carez as all other characters."
