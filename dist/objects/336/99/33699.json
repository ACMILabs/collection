        "An unstable relationship develops between prostitute Louise (Judy Davis), and a married man Rob (Bryan Brown), following the suicide of a mutual friend, Lisa. Lou (Davis), who is left with Lisa's diaries becomes infatuated by her friend's life and unrequited passion for Rob. She attempts to assume Lisa's identity, in appearance, thoughts and actions, which poses the viewer with the question, will she too end her life? Lou sees in Rob an avenue for salvation from her life of drug addiction and prostitution. It is a destructive relationship, with Rob giving her little encouragement or hope. Rob is drawn to Lou for the possible insight she can offer into the years that passed between his sudden departure from Lisa and his now, unconventional marriage. Ultimately, it is a one sided relationship and Lou must decide whether she can make something of her life. Cast includes Bryan Brown, Judy Davis, Cathy Downes and Baz Luhrmann."
