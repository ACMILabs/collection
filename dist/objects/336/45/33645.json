        "This is about a group of young volunteers, the Free Youth Clinic, who run a 'crisis bus' to rescue young people experiencing bad drug trips, usually LSD. They pull up whenever the need arises and try to talk the person down. If the patient needs further medical aid, they know where to obtain it. The film shows some of the patients being interviewed after their rescue."
