        "Focuses on the Easter service in the Russian Orthodox Church of St Peter and St Paul in Montreal. The depth of the emotion touched by this ancient ceremony is reflected in the film. Filmed in a shadowy, taper-lit space, sonorous with chanting voices, and coloured with occasional views of icons and frescos, the film shows an absorbing religious experience."
