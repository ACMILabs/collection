        "This film is about a prodigal son returning to a snowbound cabin in the Yukon. Described as an absurd star comedy with appeal to addicts only: most of the humour consists of repeats of one line, \"Taint a fit night out for man nor beast\". This film was written by W.C. Fields who also starred in it, along with Rosemary Theby, George Chandler and Richard Cramer."
