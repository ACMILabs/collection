        "A view of the practice of veterinary partners working in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. Thirty thousand miles of house calls a year is routine for these two country veterinarians whose patients include just about any creature that hops, trots, swims or flies. This film follows Doctors Vic Demetrick and Reg Maidment through the daily rounds that take them from sterile clinic to farm paddock. The devoted vets obviously relish their work. They display an enormous warmth and respect for each other, their animal patients, and their human clients. \"Canaries to Clydesdales\" shows that it takes compassion, commitment, and a strong dose of humour to succeed in this profession. After seeing this veterinary team at work, the career-minded will have the personal insight to evaluate their own qualifications. Awards: New York; Birmingham"
