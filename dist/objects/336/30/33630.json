        "This film traces the history of midwifery in America, describing its prominent role in colonial times, and its gradual restriction through professional standardisation. It also shows the process through which midwifery has regained acceptance and the film emphasises the view that pregnancy is not an illness and childbirth is not a surgical operation. Narrated by Mariette Hartley."
