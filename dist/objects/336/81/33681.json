        "This film describes life in the \"intractable\" section of a maximum security jail based on prisoners' actual accounts. The \"tracs\" sections are notorious jails inside the jails, totally isolated from the outside world and beyond the reach of the law and of public scrutiny. A work funded through the Experimental Film and Television Fund."
