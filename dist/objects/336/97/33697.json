        "Peter Weir's directorial feature film debut is an offbeat horror story/fantasy about a small Australian country town called Paris. Giving the term 'road kill' a whole new meaning, the townsfolk of Paris make a living out of the victims of road accidents by allowing a crazy psychiatrist to conduct experiments on them. They also prosper from the cars that cause the accidents but death, destruction and mayhem ensue as the cars turn against the town. John Meillon is wonderful as the chipper Town Mayor and Terry Camilleri portrays the disbelief in his character's predicament very well. Produced by Hal and Jim McElroy and written and directed by Peter Weir. Cast includes: Chris Haywood, Bruce Spence, Kevin Miles, Max Gillies, Max Phipps. Also available on DVD [319169]."
