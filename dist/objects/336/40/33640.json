        "This film is the portrait of Augusta Evans, an 88-year-old Indian woman (the daughter of a Shuswap chief), who lives alone in a log cabin without running water or electricity. She recalls past times, but lives very much in the present. Self-sufficient, dedicated to her people, she spreads warmth wherever she moves with her songs, her harmonica and her soft-voiced comments. Award: San Francisco."
