        "Episode of Series \"Corporation\". The arrival of Steinberg's French affiliate, Supermarches Montreal, on the outskirts of Paris is viewed here from the point of its cultural effects: the impact of the supermarket on the shopping and eating habits of the French; and the problems of adjustment by store employees, by Paris shoppers, and by local merchants who see their customers drift away. As Sam Steinberg makes his first visit to the French stores, many of these problems are seen at first hand. Voice and narration by Arthur Hammond."
