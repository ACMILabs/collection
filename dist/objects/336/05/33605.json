        "In this fifth and final part, Norman McLaren deals not with motion (if motion is defined as a change of location in two- or three-dimensional space) but with change - change in the amount and colour of light within an otherwise static screen. Normally, the animator combines such change with motion, but here it is studied in isolation. Award: Athens."
