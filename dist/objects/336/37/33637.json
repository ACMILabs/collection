        "In order to keep Canada's vast quantities of mail moving, Canada Post dug around for a suitable solution. They came up with MAPP (Major Area Postal Plant), an ingenious, highly complex, streamlined system that relies on the postal code for efficient operation. The postal code relies on you and me, the mailing public, for inclusion in the address. The film tells what happens when a piece of mail is set on its course. No other credits available."
