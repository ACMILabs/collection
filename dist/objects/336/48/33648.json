        "In this age, when most people follow their dreams passively on the television screen, there are still a few individuals whose passion is for the real thing. Here is a film about such a one, with a passion for wings and the freedom of the skies. Filmed by Bill Mason, whose own devotion is to the canoe, the subject here is his friend Blake James, another filmmaker, who pilots his own one-man plane. The film is Mason's view of this \"hobo of the skies\" but it is also an adventure. Photography: Bill Mason, Blake James. (Five awards, including Oscar nomination, Hollywood.)"
