        "A superb visual trick that will mystify its audience, this animated film transforms the commonplace into magic. The film presented a serious technical challenge because the subject was both elusive and explosive. A film to watch, enjoy and laugh about. (Awards: Cannes; Chicago; Elmhurst; Columbus; Paris; Genie, Toronto.) Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
