        "A warm and lively film, Bekevar Jubilee dips back into history to look at a time when the first Hungarian peasants came to settle the plains of Saskatchewan. The film documents the festivities commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Bekevar community, and contrasts it with footage and photographs of the old - and new - countries at the turn of the century."
