        "Here, in cinema verite style, film is used as a means of letting a family look in on itself, at the differences of outlook, lifestyle and values that separate the parents and two grown sons. Completely unrehearsed, it is a record on film, of a few days' visit back home on the part of the older son (the filmmaker) and of the conversations that took place among the four in a genuine though abortive attempt to reach mutual understanding. The film is an example of the communications barrier that divides many families."
