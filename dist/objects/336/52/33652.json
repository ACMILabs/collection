        "An intimate portrait of a family's struggle to cope with an autistic son. The film examines the effects of an endless cycle of successes and failures, the frustration's of seeking treatment for a problem that still eludes definition, and the painful uncertainty of what the future will bring. A powerful, thought-provoking film for anyone who seeks to understand autism or the disabled person's relations with family. Award: New York"
