        "Zero motion and irregular motion (the other two of the five categories of motion) are examined by Norman McLaren in this part of the series. Immobility (or \"zero motion\") and its duration, when occurring within a context of motion, plays a vital role in animation. The student sees how irregular motion, though seldom found in nature, can be used freely by the animator."
