        "This film provides a lively introduction to the professional and personal lives of three female engineers - just a few of the growing number of women who are opting for \"non-traditional\" jobs. Their enthusiasm for and commitment to their work makes them convincing role models for high-school girls who might be considering engineering as a career possibility. As well, the film is effective in fostering positive attitudes towards women working in the traditionally male professions of science and technology."
