        "Ten million buffalo once roamed the plains of North America but now, only a few carefully protected herds remain. The carrier pigeon, the whooping crane and other species have fallen prey to the greatest predator, man. This program shows efforts by wildlife specialists to preserve and nurture the creatures that remain in the wilderness areas. Scenes rarely photographed are included in this spellbinding documentary."
