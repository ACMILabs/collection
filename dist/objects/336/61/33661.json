        "Kenya is vitally concerned with education. With the help of the Canadian International Development Agency, the government built the Kenya Technical Teachers' College (K.T.T.C.), where it trains people to teach at every level of technical education. Once trained, these teachers go out to the numerous village polytechnics situated throughout Kenya and teach their skills. By teaching trade skills to villagers, local industries may be developed and technology will be introduced to the country."
