        "This film offers a cinematic tour of Canada's National Library. It shows that this huge structure in the centre of Ottawa is more than a repository for books. The history of Canada is housed here, preserved in old letters, newspapers, books, music scores and manuscripts. This film provides an interesting overview of the services offered by the library, highlighting the fully automated reference service, which can respond in minutes to the steady flow of inquiries the Library receives from the public. Voice and narration is provided by Bronwyn Drainie."
