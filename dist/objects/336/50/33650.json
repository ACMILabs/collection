        "A film on the Quebec publishing scene in general, and on Robert Davies' Les Editions l'Etincelle in particular. Davies, an Anglophone publishing French books, is attempting to expand into the international marketplace without sacrificing his own integrity. He discusses the difficulties of survival in the limited Quebec book market, and is shown at work in Montreal, Paris and at the Frankfurt Book Fair."
