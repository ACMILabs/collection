        "An account of the origin and history of the Torrens Title System. Shows Torrens' work as Registrar-General and Member of Parliament, in the securing of land tenure in South Australia. Insecurity had plagued early settlers in South Australia, until Torrens' land title reform bill was passed in 1857. Unsatisfactory registered transactions were replaced by a single certificate, one copy being held by the Registrar-General and the other by the owner."
