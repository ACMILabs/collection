        "In Jochen Kuchen's playful animated short 'Recently 2' a man undertakes a new medical procedure that allows him to see everything inside his body. What he discovers however is an inner world brimming with memories, hopes, dreams and disillusionment. Beautifully conveyed by blending various styles of animation, this evocative work ultimately explores not the building blocks of the body, but those of the soul."
