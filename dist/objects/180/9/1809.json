        "A four screen looping animation work, Pet Shop pulls at the heart strings with its adorably cute 2D animated animals. Corompt's work uses reductive and stylised modes of representation, exploring how we engage with these synthetic characters. The unquie relationship that exists between spectator and subject, inviting the spectator to partake in an unspoken agreement, where they may teeter on the boundary of the objectivity and empathy, simultaneously acknowledging its artifice, while at the same time participating in its pathos."
