        "The film opens with shots of the waste of a house flowing in the sewer, this sewer being illustrated by a remarkable cross-section of the waste disposal system of a house, and the sewer in the adjacent road. An animated map of London's vast sewage system is built up historically, shown in relation to relief and drainage and the urban spread of London. Finally a close-up study of the pumping and purification station is shown, and we see the treatment of the seage until unusable sludge is shipped to sea."
