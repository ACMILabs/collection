        "This 30 minute interview with the president of FILEF Australia, Giovanni Sgro, was produced in ACMI's screen pit in December of 2003. Roberta Ciabarra conducts a delightful interview with Giovanni, in which he recalls his own experience of migration and starting a new life in this country. He also provides valuable insights into the history of migrant workers and their impact on the politics and development of Australia. Created as part of the Racconti: La Voce del Popolo Digital Storytelling in association with The Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and their Families (FILEF)."
