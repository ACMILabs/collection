        "An animated illustration of the safety rule: \"Never touch plumbing and electrical fixtures at the same time.\" In the film we see a young woman commit the fatal error of switching on an electric light while in her bath. After a fleeting glimpse of a gravestone with the inscription R.I.P., we see her in the next world where in her celestial tub she is about to repeat her mistake but remembers the consequences just in time."
