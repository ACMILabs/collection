        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". Observations of electrical effects lead to the concept of molecular polarity. Covalent substances give two types of results: some show marked interactions with electric charges, others give little effect. A model is developed based on polar and non-polar molecules. The molecular dipole model is extended to explain differences in solubility, conductivity and chemical reactivity."
