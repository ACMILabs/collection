        "Children are given guidance in cutting-out and preparing figures for a shadow play. Children learn to make Japanese style flat paper puppets, after being shown a play at their Creative Leisure Centre in Brisbane. After deciding upon a story to illustrate, each child draws and cuts out outlines, gluing on lace, and paper doily frilly finishes and painting black for maximum effect. Finally scenery is fixed to the cloth screen, sound effects and puppets tried out and a bright light shone on the screen ready for the performance of St George and the Dragon, narrated by an instructor."
