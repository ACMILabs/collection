        "A film about noisy adolescents, motorcycles, and the tendency of some adults to make blanket judgments without troubling to know the facts. The film is designed to prompt discussion of what youngsters and their elders have a right to expect of each other. It touches on some basic principles of democracy and raises questions about the problem of communication between the generations. Cast includes: Bernard Behrens, Anthony Brown, Vernon Chapman, Lawrence Cherniak, Mignon Elkins, Eric Endersby, Cec Linder."
