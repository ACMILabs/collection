        "An outstanding early British documentary made by Rotha and sponsored by the Orient line. Remarkable for its fine photography and editing techniques especially the use of combined dissolves and superimposition to develop two associated ideas simultaneously (influenced by early Soviet filmmaking principles). Describes the building of the steamship \"Orion\" at Barrow-in-Furness and its economic effects on the life of the town, making particularly effective use of the local dialect (the film unit were noted for their attempt to show the working class under a positive light). Written and edited by Paul Rotha; photography by George Pocknall, Frank Bundy, Frank Goodliffe and Harry Rignold."
