        "Herring fishing in the North Sea, following a group of Dutch boats on a typical cruise. A documentary record of a Dutch trawler on its annual voyage to the Dogger Bank, fishing ground for herring. Shows the ceremonies and celebrations that usher in the herring fishing season, decking of boats with flags and departure of the fleet to the international fishing grounds. The nets are put out, the crew wake in the middle of the night for the laborious business of hauling in the catch, a storm comes up and the fleet turns home. The film stresses the cooperation at sea among fishermen of different nations who rely on the Dogger Bank for their livelihood."
