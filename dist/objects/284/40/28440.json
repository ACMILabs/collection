        "A film for VW car lovers. All aspects of the production of the Volkswagen Beetle, manufactured in the Australian plant in Clayton, Melbourne. The manufacture and assembly of the many parts of the motor is shown, including pattern and tool making and the press shop, moulding of parts, the addition of mudguards and doors and the painting of the bodywork. We see the chassis assembled and joined with the engine, then these joined with the bodywork before finishing touches are made. Car trials and suburban and rural driving conditions demonstrate the reliability and performance of the car."
