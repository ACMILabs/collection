        "Venereal disease in Britain, a programme introduced by Jo Grimmond, M.P. It avoids moral issues, and concentrates on facts: the symptoms of infection, the confidential nature of treatment at a special clinic and the contact slips for patients to give to those who infected them. At the end, three patients are interviewed: a prostitute, a boy and a girl (who talks good sense about parental attitudes). To some extent it will discourage promiscuity; certainly by making it clear that treatment is neither embarrassing nor painful it will encourage those who suspect that they have been infected to seek treatment. Restriction: To be shows to members and students of the medical profession and nursing profession."
