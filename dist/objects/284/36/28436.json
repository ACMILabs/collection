        "Episode of Series \"Mechanical Drawing\". The film begins by demonstrating that the only accurate method of telling others exactly how to build an object is to make several drawings showing how the object looks from different points of view. The film then describes orthographic projection, utilising animated diagrams and animated models to provide unusual three-dimensional effects."
