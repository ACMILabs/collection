        "Episode of Series \"Basic woodwork\". This film shows an array of tools which it is essential to keep sharp. These include the chisel, paring chisel, mortise chisel, the gouge and other curved tools, the cutting edges of all of which need to be kept sharp on an oilstone. The correct way of doing this is shown in detail and the latter half of the film describes the regrinding of tools, ending with a reminder that rust is thae principal enemy of steel tools. This can be kept down by frequent sharpening and the use of vaseline on the tools when put away for any length of time."
