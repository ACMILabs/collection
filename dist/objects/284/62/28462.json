        "Shows how sheep can be raised successfully in low rainfall areas of Australia. It concentrates on one large station, Wilgena, nearly two million acres in extent and carrying 45,000 sheep. This station is self supporting, generating its own power and light, and is fitted with the most modern appliances. It produces sheep of fine quality and is entirely mechanised, the sheep being rounded up by men on motor bikes. In an area with an average rainfall of only 5 and a half inches, much needed water is supplied by sub-artesian bores. Vermin-proof fences check pasture destruction by rabbits and stock losses by dingoes."
