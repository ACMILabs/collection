    ], 
    "description": [
        "An early advertising film, using animation, which promotes Australian made Kiwi boot and shoe polish and a fair capitalist system that allows for the initiative of youngsters. The 'Imperial Hotel' is left short staffed during World War I. Two young boys apply for the position of boot boys, but lament that they can't clean boots. An Australian soldier, overhearing their conversation, offers each of them a tin of Kiwi boot polish which has impressive results and secures employment for them at the hotel."
