        "Shows how sheltered workshops provide training and employment for variously handicapped people. Discusses the main problems in organising a local centre. Explains the work being done to encourage and assist disabled and handicapped people. About 150,000 Australians of working age are so seriously handicapped, mentally or physically, that they are unable to join the normal workforce. Today more than 5,000 are usefully and gainfully employed in a growing community movement - the sheltered workshop."
