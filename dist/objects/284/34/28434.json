        "In 1901, there was established at Shantiniketan an institution for boys and girls, where education was in close communion with nature. Twenty years later, the institution had grown to such proportions that it came to be recognised as an international university, the Visva-Bharati. This film gives an interesting glimpse of Shantiniketan the \"Abode of peace\", the school of international culture, established by the Poet Rabindranath Tagore at Bolpur, not far from Calcutta. Languages, sculpture, painting, embroidery, music, dancing and other fine arts are an integral part of training."
