        "Impressionistic film, studying the effect of the total eclipse of the sun, in October 1976, in the southern half of Australia, on human and animal behaviour. Scenes of life in Australia are shown prior to, during, and after the eclipse, with an Aboriginal legend forming the theme of the film. Scenes include Aborigines dancing, race meetings, fairs, and reactions of the general public in the street. Also includes more orthodox scientific observations."
