        "Reviews Shakespeare's life amid scenes of beautiful Warwickshire, which must have been familiar to Shakespeare as a boy. The film shows the influence that working in Stratford-upon-Avon has upon the players at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. It is centred round the production of \"The Tempest\" - Shakespeare's last play. With Ian Richardson as Prospero and Ben Kingsley as Ariel."
