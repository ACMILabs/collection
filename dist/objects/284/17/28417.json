        "An intimate study of a figure whose faithful service behind the scenes contributes to the peace and orderliness of the church. In a little French-Canadian village we meet Monsieur Eusebe, whose whole life has been the care of his parish church and whose proprietary attitude and dour exterior serve only to conceal the love and satisfaction he finds in his work. We see how a sexton's work is never done as a funeral follows a wedding followed by a christening. And always there is the preparation and tidying up for the next occasion."
