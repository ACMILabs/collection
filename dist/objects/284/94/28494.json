        "A dramatized presentation of the role of the shop steward in the effective day-to-day funtioning of free trade unionism. The film beings with the election of machinists Johnny Walachuk as shop steward for the men in his section of a large industrial plant. Continuing, it shows the part the shop steward plays in carrying out the grievance procedures set up by company and union. How Johnny fulfills responsibility to protect from infractions of the agreement the men who elected him, is told in his own words and typifies the function of the union shop stewards generally in Canada."
