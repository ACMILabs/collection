        "Episode of Series \"21st Century\". This film surveys the new techniques of motion picture which are revolutionising the industry and promising even more startling visual effects in the future. Among techniques presented are films made by computers, a mixed-media combination of live dancers and movies, films that depend on multiple screen effects, and shows using many screens of different sizes and shapes. One film demonstrated allows the audience to alter the plot line as it progresses."
