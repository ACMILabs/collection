        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Alcheringa (A)\". Migratory habits of inland Aborigines who go walkabout to the coast to collect shellfish at certain times of the year, to augment their diet. The husband walks ahead and carries his fire sticks in his hair. His wife goes into the rock pools and quickly fills the string bag which hangs from her shoulder; cooks the fish in their shells in the hot ash; water is poured over the fire to cool the shellfish before they are removed and eaten."
