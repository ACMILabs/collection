        "In Cyberdelia we see the best of video and computer art that was available in Australia in the analogue pre-digital period. The self identified \"cyber artists\" include Stellarc, Gus Till, Adem Jaffers, Captain ROM, Troy Innocent, Jeff Jaffers and Ollie Olsen. These early techno-artists used low-cost, high-result technology like the Amiga computer in innovative ways to achieve remarkable results. The show is a visual feast. Clever integration of conceptual art practice, video editing, digital and analogue effects, fractal generation, optical effects, and camera effects, provide a stunning range of visual experience. Passing time and mundane commercialisation of technology may have dampened the ardour of cyber ideologists, yet the philosophy and lifestyle evidenced in these artist interviews came from true believers in an alternative sub culture."
