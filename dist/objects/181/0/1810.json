        "The SCREENSPORTS event is a unique, entertaining and informative 'CINEMA EXPERIENCE'. SCREENSPORTS represents an historic leap in the marriage of live performance and technology. It has the potential to be an ACMI flagship pioneering new international standards in screen-based performance. Based on the highly successful Theatre Sports;live improvisation performance the Screensports concept draws on screen culture and the screen as the basis for live improvisation.  A troupe of actors are thrown into virtual worlds utilising the ACMI template sets and the globecaster technology. The actors use these sets as a stimulus for fast and hilarious improvisation. Screen sports will be fun and informative and appeal to a wide range of people. In order to develop the Screensports performance it is crucial to conduct a creative development workshop to produce the content for the live performance."
