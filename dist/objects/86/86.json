        "This interview forms part of the Sport and Screen project which will be exhibited at Screen Gallery at Federation Square. It hopes to document the oral history of the developing relationship between sport and the screen in Australia in the last half of the twentieth century. The interview with Robert (Bob) James Parish CMG, OBE is conducted by Daryl Dellora. Bob Parish was born on 7 May 1916 and played a long and distinguished part in Victorian and Australian cricket over many years. In particular he was Chairman of the Australian Cricket Board(ACB) from 1975-80 during which time a major development in international cricket took place - that of the creation of World Series Cricket(WSC). The new 'television friendly' game of WSC could not develop without the assistance of the ACB and it was in negotiating this relationship between the ACB and WSC that Bob Parish played a central role."
