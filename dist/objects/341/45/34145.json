        "Boyd Webb is usually classified as a sculptor although he does not exhibit three-dimensional objects. His art-works are extremely large photographs. In this film, the artist has designed eight new works specifically for the film camera. They expand on recent photographic pieces which have dealt with the vagaries of life in a post-nuclear era."
