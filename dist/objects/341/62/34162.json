        "An award-winning documentary that focuses on the guerrilla leader, political fugitive and revolutionary hero, Tomas Borge. Borge, the only surviving member of the original Sandinista movement, is Minister of the Interior in the nine man National Directorate, the collective leadership that governs Nicaragua. He recounts his experiences during his internment under the US-backed Somoza dictatorship. Explains the events which led to the formation of the revolutionary Sandinista movement and its rise to power in 1979. Also explores accusations made by Ronald Reagan that the Sandinista government is involved in activities that threaten to destabilise Central America. Contains b&w sequences. Photography by Geoffrey Simpson."
