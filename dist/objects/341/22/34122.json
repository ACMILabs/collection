        "Long before the idea of community arts became a popular and welcome activity, George Seelaf was organising participatory art activities for workers in factories. This film looks at the influence that George Seelaf has exerted through his commitment to labour movement ideals; his support for radical artists and writers and his pioneering work for community arts. Seelaf established the Trade Union Clinic and Research Centre, now known as the Western Region Community Health Centre in Melbourne's western suburbs. Secretary of the Australasian Meat Industry employees Union for 25 years he refused to accept the Order of Australia bestowed upon him because John Kerr was officiating. Includes interviews with Wally Curran, Frank Hardy, Noel Counihan and Andrew Reeves."
