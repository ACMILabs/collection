        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". Humans have bred and kept farm animals, as a food supply, for a long time. Particularly in commercial production situations, the way in which the animals are housed is a result of economic factors rather than a concern for the animals' welfare. This documentary looks at studies which are trying to determine how to look after animals' well-being and maintain productivity."
