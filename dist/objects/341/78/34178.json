        "An exploration of stillbirth and neonatal grief by sharing the experience of two families. One family, under the guidance of a specialised medical team, undergoes an unusual counselling process to help them resolve their grief more easily. They are encouraged to spend time seeing, holding and touching their dead baby. This is a film which questions our attitudes on death."
