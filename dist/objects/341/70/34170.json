        "Golden Summers covers the most celebrated period in the history of Australian art, the years from 1885 until shortly after the turn of the century. The artists at the time were Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Charles Conder and Fred McCubbin, popularly known as the Heidelberg School, and they believed that it was their task to paint Australian realities. Narrated by Patrick McCaughey."
