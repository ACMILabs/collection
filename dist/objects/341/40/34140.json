        "From the 1890s until the 1930s, early advertising frequently used images of industrial work to sell its products. Modern advertising, on the other hand, surrounds us with images of idealised homes and families, shopping and holidays, offering a world of consumerism in which work has become invisible. This film investigates the disappearance of work from advertising"
