        "This film deals with the fragility of relationships, goals and dreams. The film is a sensitively drawn image of working class existence in one of Melbourne's industrial suburbs. It is about Doug, who has always wanted to go to Queensland and about his plans that do not work as they are expected to. Stars John Flaus."
