        "During the 1940s and 50s the U.S. media, in an effort to smooth public concern over the threat of nuclear destruction, produced a series of propaganda films which were a combination of deliberate misinformation and hilarious naivete. This documentary is made up of the vintage films, newsreels, cartoons and television programs. Narrated by Martin Sheen."
