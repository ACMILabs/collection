        "This is a film about the meaning of life, about why the human brain is the most extraordinary thing ever created. Sit back and watch the exploding rocket, the eccentric animation, what it means to be a parent, Land Rights, the re-enactment of Archimedes and listen to the 21 original compositions of music. Or look at Latin America in a way you've never seen before. Narrated by Noni Hazlehurst."
