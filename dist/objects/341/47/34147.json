        "A documentary about Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and her work. Doctor Kubler-Ross is a trained medical practitioner and psychiatrist and has specialised in the care of dying patients - both young and old. Her work concentrates on the re-education of people's attitudes towards dying, and a great deal of her time is spent, not only with patients, but also lecturing to others."
