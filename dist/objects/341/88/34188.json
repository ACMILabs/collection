        "This animated motion picture maintains all the wisdom, with and compassion of Hans Christian Anderson's tale. The graceful delicate images and music evoke the sadness and ultimate joy of the sensitive duckling whose only fault is that he is different. The universal theme of alienation, prejudice and true beauty are subtly expressed in the film."
