        "This compelling documentary film tells the true story of three Japanese Americans who refused to let themselves be put into the internment camps which were being established across the US in the Spring of 1942. Gordon Hirabayashi, Fred Korematsu and Minoru Yasui courageously defied the government and were separately convicted and imprisoned for violating Executive Order 9066. The film interweaves the personal stories of the three men with startling archival footage of war-time anti-Japanese hysteria, the evacuation and incarceration, and life in the camps. It captures them today, now fighting to overturn their original convictions in the final round of a 40 year-old battle against the act which shattered the lives of two generations of Japanese Americans. (Award: Winner 1984 Cine Golden Eagle)"
