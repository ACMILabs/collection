        "A survey of the role of women in Australian cinema from the beginning to 1940 using interviews and archival footage. Prominence is given to the collaboration between Lottie Lyell and Raymond Longford, the McDonagh sisters (whose 1933 production Two Minutes Silence was the last Australian feature directed by a woman until My Brilliant Career in 1979) and the careers of actresses Louise Lovely, Helen Twelvetrees and Shirley Ann Richards. Includes extracts from \"A Girl of the Bush\" (1921), \"The Cheaters\" (1929), \"The Squatter's Daughter\" (1933), \"The Silence of Dean Maitland\" (1937) and \"Dad and Dave Come To Town\" (1938)."
