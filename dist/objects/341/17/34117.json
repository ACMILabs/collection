        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Black futures (A)\". For 40,000 years, the Aboriginal people of Australia had a rich and diverse culture, which sprang from and reflected their way of life and beliefs. Their culture was not written, but spoken, sung and performed. Since the coming of white man their culture has very nearly been destroyed. Aboriginal playwright, screenwriter and director Bob Merritt believes that a resurgence of Aboriginal culture is possible and in 1984 set up the Eora Centre for the Visual and Performing Arts in Redfern to offer young Aboriginals a comprehensive education in their traditional arts. Looks at the role of the Eora Centre and interviews some of its teachers and students."
