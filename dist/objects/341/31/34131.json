        "This film is an examination of the thoughts and aspirations of the Victorian ruling class mentality as revealed through the Albert Memorial, a monument of pure signification. The soundtrack, composed by Michael Nyman, consists of a montage of voices, and is composed of Victorian quotations and modern analyses, together with the bemused speculation of a couple of American tourists."
