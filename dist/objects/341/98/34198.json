        "Based on the book \"Oh, wie schon Ist Panama\" by Janosch. Published in the US under the title \"The trip to Panama\". English version by Judy Duris. Little Bear and Little Tiger are two friends who abandon their happy home to search for Panama - 'the land of our dreams'- only to return to the place from which they came. A subtle treatment of the theme of appreciating what you already have."
