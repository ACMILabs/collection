        "This film is a personal journey, a form of diary that ventures into the territory of the unconscious. It is based upon the exploration of the body's movements whilst asleep. \"Shadows\" was shot over two consecutive nights during real sleep. With Adam Buscomb and D.M. Parrish. No commentary - music performed by Dalmonico Babari and Rommy Reinhard."
