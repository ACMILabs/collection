        "When do permanent differences appear among an embryo's cells? Using experiments with embryo salamanders, scientists follow the development of cell growth and differentiation. Embryologist, Hans Spemann, discovers the organiser, that group of cells which differentiates first then induces differentiation of other cells around it. This work laid the basis for modern developmental biology."
