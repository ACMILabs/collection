        "Australian theatre and film director, Michael Blakemore, recreates his childhood and adolescence in the 1930s and 1940s in Sydney and reflects on the events which led to his career in the theatre and eventually a directorship of Britain's National Theatre. By implication the film is also something of a mini history of surfing in Australia. Utilising a compilation of old newsreels, family snapshots, re-enactments and Blakemore's commentary, the film is an intriguing piece of Australian social history."
