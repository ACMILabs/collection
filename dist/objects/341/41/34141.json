        "A biographical documentary about classical music composer, Elizabeth Maconchy. Born in 1907, she began writing music at the age of 6 and continued to do so, succeeding in an area that, in the early to middle 20th century, was almost entirely a male preserve. This film features some of her works and includes interviews with people who have been associated with her."
