        "Since it first became known in 1974, the signature of the contemporary English 'primitive' painter, Reginald Pepper, has been gaining prominence amongst critics and collectors. It now appears that such a painter does not exist. This film presents an overview of the case of Reginald Pepper and also looks at the broader issues concerning 'primitivism' in art."
