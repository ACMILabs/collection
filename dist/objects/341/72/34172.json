        "A documentary about women, peace and power. Greenham Common, England, was once land belonging to the entire community and used for its common good. Now nine miles of wire fences divide the US Airforce Base from the women and the children they claim to protect. The land is home to 32 guided missiles. Women came to Greenham to challenge the belief that the peace we seek can come from any army. Women speak out in opposition to nuclear weapons."
