    "description": [
        "Just another day in the life of three ordinary robots suffering for their art - Jackson, a painter/sculptor; Roland, a composer/musician; and Hands, a champion skater. This award-winning animated film tracks the demise of the three redundant robots as they attempt to reassert meaning into their empty lives. Made in the style of a documentary-soap and containing a rather dark sense of humour, this is a somewhat offbeat satirical depiction of the genre. Voice: David Hopewell. (Awards: Best New British Animation, Edinburgh International Film Festival 2000; Jury Award, Art Film Festival 2001)"
