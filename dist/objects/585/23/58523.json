        "The benign countenance of pudgy film director Alfred Hitchcock welcomed viewers to stories of terror, horror, suspense, and twisted endings for an entire decade. His clipped British accent and catlike theme music became symbols of Hitchcock's black humour. The stories would often appear to end with evil triumphant, in strict violation of the television code of ethics. This situation was always resolved following the last commercial when Hitchcock would return to explain in his deadpan sardonic way, what silly mistake or chance occuurrence had finally done the villain in."
