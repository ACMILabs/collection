        "Few television series have attracted as much critical and public acclaim as these six triumphant plays, now preserved on video. Written by six different authors each play is a lavish and authentic dramatisation, produced with style and quality. And binding them together with his magnetic and dignified performance as the mighty monarch is Keith Michell - the definitive Henry VIII."
