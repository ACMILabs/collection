        "Today the workplace is changing. Quantum changes in the world economy, in technology and in society itself have brought about a revolution in the nature of work. Increasing use of self-management strategies have led to a far greater sharing of management functions through the whole workforce. The classic functions of management - planning, organising, leading, and controlling are becoming everybody's business, hence the title of this series. Throughout the series, reporter Cheryl Hall explores the new approaches to management in all sectors of the workforce. Kerry O'Brien speaks to experts on the key issues of management today."
