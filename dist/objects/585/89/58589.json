        "This series is an entertaining and informative introduction to the symphony orchestra. Featuring Maestro George Solti and the musical talent and humour of Dudley Moore, the three volumes trace the development of the various sections of the orchestra from the time of Bach and Handel to today. The theme of the four parts of the orchestra is established by breaking down a piece of music into its four constituent parts - strings, brass, percussion and woodwind."
