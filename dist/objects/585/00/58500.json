        "An epic seven hour long series, celebrating the fifth centenary of the European discovery of America, which explores the profound transformation of two worlds following the voyage of Columbus. The sword and the cross of these Spanish conquerors forged a new society and a new people. New crops to feed mankind and a slave trade began which changed the face of two continents. The filmmakers take the legacy of Columbus and force us to question whether we should celebrate or mourn his discovery."
