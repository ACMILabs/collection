        "A five part series introduced by Margaret Nicol, clinical psychologist and author which deals with distinct aspects of maternal grief. The programmes are dedicated to all women who have grieved over the loss of a baby and to the memory of those children. Each episode is designed to look at the experiences of women who have suffered different types of reproductive loss. The focus is on the need for the womens' experiences to be validated and for the existence of the lost child to be acknowledged."
