        "History, when viewed with hindsight, has the aura of inevitability. This series reviews key events of the 20th Century and examines the reaction to these events as they actually occurred. Each programme uses original material such as newspapers, photographs, archival footage, cartoons and music to enhance the contemporary feel."
