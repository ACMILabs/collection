        "John Romer, an emminent archaelogist, undertakes a personal quest to examine the history of the Bible. He explores its origins and evolution through time as a rare and valuable sacred text, to a modern day paperback best seller available to the masses. Romer does not set out to discredit or disprove the literal truth of the Bible, but to examine how this influential text has shaped the world."
