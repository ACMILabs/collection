        "This is a series of animated films about the animals of Farthing Wood and their journey. Kestrel brings news that the humans are filling in the pond, and with no source of water, they would surely die. Toad advises that they should head for the nature reserve at White Deer Park. They set off on a very long journey, full of adventure and excitement. Based on the bestselling books of Colin Dann."
