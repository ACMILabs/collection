        "John Canemaker is a well-regarded American animator who works in a variety of styles and has always succeeded in plumbing an array of emotions and situations in a humorous and engaging manner. Canemaker is also well-regarded as an animation historian and biographer. His fluid style, hand drawn and quite low-tech, is unpredictable and highly entertaining, cleverly evolving from one moment to the next. \"Confessions of a star dreamer\": An actress and vamp discusses her feelings toward procreating, her profession and the industry. \"Bridgehampton\": With music by Fred Hersch, this piece elegantly portrays a suburban changing of the seasons. \"Confessions of a stand-up\": Wonderful piece satirising the pitfalls and pratfalls of being a comedian, as told by Dennis Blair. \"Bottom's dream\": Canemaker reworks the notions underpinning Shakespearean comical character, Bottom. \"The Wizard's son\": The young son of a wizard imagines the possibilities and adventures that await him, wreaking havoc in the meantime. \"Behind the scenes\": An absurd piece on the interaction between line, form and shape. Bonus material includes excerpts from: \"The Creative spirit\" with a commentary about creative thought and processes; \"Laughter is good medicine\"; \"Break the silence: kids against child abuse\"; \"What do children think when they think of the bomb\"; \"Science experiences\"; and three thirty second advertisements for AIDS benefits."
