        "Imagine that New York photographer Cindy Sherman and David Lynch met in a dark alley and decided to collaborate on a project, filmed on 16mm in black and white, with a mono soundtrack. Are you there yet? If so, then welcome to the world of 23-year-old Chicago native James Fotopoulos. \"Migrating forms\" is the story of a man and a woman conducting a tawdry affair under the watchful eye of his cat. The woman, who reaches out to him emotionally, discovers a cyst on her back. The man, who seeks the gratification of another, rejects her, whilst developing his own cyst. Fotopoulus presents a palette of unrelenting dark and grotty spaces, burgeoning with sinister possibilities and thwarted dreams. His experimental, minimalist cinema despondently explores the spaces of the physical and psychological consequences of sex. This avant-garde, experimental, abstract work of haunting qualities, is bleak, austere and disturbing in its evocation of anti-eroticism. Winner of Best Feature award at the 2000 New York Underground Film Festival. Features scenes of full frontal male and female nudity. Cast includes Rebecca Lewis and Preston Baty. Original Music by Tom Nicholl."
