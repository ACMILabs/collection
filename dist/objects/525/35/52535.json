        "Set in a small Argentinean town in 1847, Camila (played by Susu Pecoraro) is the daughter of a wealthy diplomat growing up amid a bucolic and privileged, albeit confined, existence. Camila grows up to be a headstrong woman who clashes frequently with her conservative family. When she confesses the conflicted thoughts and disturbing dreams that concern her to Ladislao Gutierez (Imanol Arias), a Jesuit priest, the two soon enter into a torrid affair. Defying convention, her tyrannical father and overwhelming opposition from the Church and society, the doomed lovers are driven into exile where they live together anonymously. Despite their passionate union they continue to suffer torment and guilt as a result of their choices. As a political critique, \"Camila\" lays bare the power that the conservative, repressive Rosas government had over the people of Argentina at that time although the narrative skirts around the complexities of these issues in favour of the lovers' plight. Based on a true story, which was reputedly suppressed by authorities due to its controversial subject matter, this historical melodrama pays great attention to period detail, serving as a fascinating portrait of Argentinean culture, in particular religious traditions and societal mores. Where it lacks perhaps is in its traditional depiction of the lovers' passion, manifested in several bodice-ripping sequences. Cast also includes Hector Alterio, Elena Tasisto, Carlos Munoz and Hector Pellegrini. Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film. In Spanish with English subtitles."
