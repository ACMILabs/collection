        "Episode of Series \"Empires\". Traces the life of early Christians Peter and Paul, who faced powerful obstacles - including the mighty Roman Empire, political persecution and crippling personal disagreements - in their attempts to spread the word of Jesus. Episode 1. \"The Rock and the river\" - With the Messiah dead and their cause deemed subversive, the followers of Jesus face a bleak future, until their hope is re-invigorated by a vision of the risen Jesus. A former persecutor of Christians, Peter soon becomes an indomitable figure, uniting the group into a tight community of ardent believers. Paul, educated, passionate, determined and dogmatic, uses his formidable talents to spread his new beliefs around the Roman Empire. Episode 2. \"The Empire and the Kingdom\" - Led by missionaries, Christian ideas continue to spread among Jews and non-Jews throughout the Empire; hostile locals, imperial forces and conflicting ideas threaten the future of the movement. Paul splits with his former allies, establishing churches in his image; in 70 AD, after decades of tensions, a four-year war erupts that destroys much of Jerusalem, but the communities established by Paul survive and grow. Fascinating work features the words of Paul and other ancient writers, historical re-enactments and interviews with contemporary scholars."
