        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Dragon stirs\". Final two parts of a four-part series about China. China, known as the Middle Kingdom between heaven and hell, has a long history of patriarchy and an unquestioning obedience by women to their family and feudal overlords. However, with the coming of the new millennium a law was passed allowing China's women the same social and political rights as men. This is a historical presentation of women and their role in China, politically, socially, and philosophically during the 20th century looking at the traditions, culture and customs which held China's women back for so long in their fight for equality with their male counterparts. Issues covered include arranged marriages, the binding of women's feet, outside influences, Chinese reformists and feminists, the women's movement, Mao Tse Dong and the Peoples Liberation Army, communism, Cultural Revolution of the 60s, sexuality in the 70s, free market and consumerism in the 80s and 90s. Features personal stories from women of all ages and varying backgrounds, archival footage including b&w images, excerpts from motion pictures made in China and profiles of those who played an influential role in the advancement of women's rights in China. Narrated by Peter George and Diana McLean. In Mandarin with English subtitles and commentary in English."
