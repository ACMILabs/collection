    "description": [
        "Tropfest is the world's largest short film festival, held one night in February each year at the Domain, Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. The aim is to showcase work from young and emerging filmmakers, providing them with a festival atmosphere to screen their works to peers. In an attempt to encourage production, not just the exhibition of films, the festival has a Tropfest Signature Item, announced a few months prior to the festival. Each film must contain the TSI in whatever form the filmmaker sees fit. In 2003, the TSI was 'rock'. This disc contains the sixteen 2003 finalists."
