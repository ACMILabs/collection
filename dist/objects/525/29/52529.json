        "This beautifully moving and poignant film depicts the plight and emotions of children held in Australian mandatory detention centres, seeking refugee status. Over a series of evocative animated images, one hears an array of children's voices, describing their experiences of migrating from overseas and their detention in Australia. The children depicted as caged, migratory birds, reflect upon their environment, treatment and future. These interviews, conducted with three children being held in centres, clearly express the trauma of their experiences (both journeying to and once in Australia) and are heart-rending in their evocation of innocence abused. On completion of this film, in October 2003, these children remained in mandatory detention, awaiting their claims for refugee status to be processed."
