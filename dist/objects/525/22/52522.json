    "description": [
        "Series one of \"The Dreaming\" consists of the first thirteen of a total of 78 short animations of Aboriginal Dreaming stories that make up the six part series. This ambitious project was produced by Aboriginal Nations, an independent animation company committed to employing Aboriginal animators. With reference to an intellectual property protocol developed by the company, the stories were sourced from Aboriginal communities, and the permission to tell and animate them was obtained from community elders. The soundtracks utilise the voices of Aboriginal actors and feature original music by Aboriginal composers. A comprehensive teachers guide and supporting videos introducing the series and offering insights into the storytelling and animation process are also included."
