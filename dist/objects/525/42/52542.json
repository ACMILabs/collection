        "Filmed on location in the raw and gritty back streets of modern day Kingston, Jamaica, this action-packed cop thriller tells the story of two friends whose lives have taken them in very different directions. Crime fighter Capone (Paul Campbell) is transferred back to his hometown where he encounters his long time friend Ratty (Mark Danvers) who not only is the right-hand man of the notorious local don, Wonie (Carl Bradshaw), but is also involved in gun-smuggling. Each tries to convince the other to change sides grimly putting their loyalty to one another to the test. But it is their friendship, however, which unfortunately suffers, finally ending in tragic and violent circumstances. \"Third world cop\" has many classic, sometimes corny, one-liners and is accompanied by a cool laid back soundtrack (produced by Sly & Robbie) of some great reggae and dancehall music performed by Sly & Robbie, Beenie Man, Luciano, Marley Brothers Featuring Ghetto Youths Crew, Lady G, Red Dragon among others. The film, a huge hit in Jamaica and becoming that country's highest grossing film of all time also features many of the same production team that created \"Dancehall queen\" (1997), including actor Audrey Reid who plays Capone's childhood sweetheart, Rita. Cast also includes Winston Bell, Lenford Salmon, Desmond Ballentine aka Ninjaman with cinematography by Richard Lannaman. In English but also contains English subtitles intermittently throughout."
