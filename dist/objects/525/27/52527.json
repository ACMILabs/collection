    "description": [
        "Series six of \"The Dreaming\" consists of thirteen of a total of 78 short animations of Aboriginal Dreaming stories that make up the six part series. The support video accompanying series six focuses on cultural maintenance and its role in improving Aboriginal health. This rich and ambitious project was produced by Aboriginal Nations, an independent animation company committed to employing Aboriginal animators. With reference to an intellectual property protocol developed by the company, the stories were sourced from Aboriginal communities, and the permission to tell and animate them was obtained from community elders. The soundtracks utilise the voices of Aboriginal actors and feature original music by Aboriginal composers. A comprehensive teachers guide and supporting videos introducing the Dreaming and offering insights into the storytelling and animation process are also included."
