    "description": [
        "Originally aired on the ABC in 2002, this eight part slice-of-life comedy series gives an obvious nod to the reality show \"Sylvania Waters\". Kath (Jane Turner), forty-something homeowner and fashion and fitness conscious woman, finds her lifestyle cramped when her spoilt only daughter, Kim (Gina Riley), returns home after leaving her husband, Brett (Peter Rowsthorn) - again. Kath has recently embarked on a passionate new relationship with butcher Kel (Glenn Robbins) and marriage is on the cards. Written and created by Gina Riley and Jane Turner. \"Old\": Kath's exhausted by the solo wedding planning and Kim thinks her mum is showing her age. She becomes paranoid Kel thinks that too and is losing his desire for her. \"Money\": Kath's worrying about the down payment for her pumpkin style coach and is adamant she's paying for everything herself. Kim's spending money like its going out of fashion. She does help out however by modelling for Kath's pyramid selling lingerie party. \"Party\": Kim's organising Kath's hen's night - the night she never had. Kel's reluctant at having yet another buck's night, but Kath manages to convince him otherwise. Everyone is guaranteed a night to remember - at least parts of it anyway. \"The Wedding\": Kath and Kel's fairytale wedding ends in disaster with most of the bridal party ending up in the hospital. Told in flashback, the episode is a fitting culmination to series one."
