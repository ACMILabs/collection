        "This video presents a selection of the best from the first series of the hilarious British television comedy program \"Goodness gracious me\", an Anglo-Asian show featuring irreverent and satirical sketches and songs, in quite a pointed way, about multicultural society and western values and traditions. Meet the Kapoor (pronounced Cooper) family, Indian but more English than the English, Smita Smitten - the showbiz kitten, the Techno-Bangra Kiss My-Chuddie-Boys, and many other wonderful characters who don't mind having a \"go\" at their own culture, be it Anglo or Asian. In fact nothing is sacred. Also features a short segment of bloopers at the end. Cast includes Sanjeev Bhaskar, Meera Syal, Kulvinder Ghir, Nina Wadia, David Lamb, Amanda Holden, Anil Desai, Arabella Weir."
