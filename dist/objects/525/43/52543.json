        "Poignant and confronting, this documentary portrayal of life in the streets of Harlem (notorious for its gang violence, drugs and shootings) is presented through the personal stories of nine young African Americans drawn from a broad cross-section of the African American community in Harlem whose ages range from 12 through to 26 years old. Writer and sociologist Terry Williams befriended the group, provided them with notebooks and video cameras and sent them out to make an autobiography of the city of Harlem and its community through their eyes and in their words. Each person views their life and Harlem from a different perspective providing the positive as well as the negative such as 18 year-old Jermaine (architect student) who is concerned about the thousands of abandoned buildings, turning his anger and frustration into determination and positive action; 12 year-old Amir (actor), star of theatre, commercials and TV soapies, brought up in a privileged environment but still managing to keep his feet on the ground; 17 year-old Barr Elliot \"Star Dragon\" (hip-hop singer) who directed his \"kill or be killed\" mentality into music and the dream of being successful one day; and 18 year-old Nikki Matos (teenage mother) who, surrounded by the ethos of violence and killing among young black males, is determined to create a better life for her young son. Most of the group come from single parent families, some from violent backgrounds, but their resilience and determination to overcome their circumstances is truly inspiring. Gritty and at times disturbing, revealing the dark world of drugs, poverty and violence, \"Harlem diary\" also engenders a sense of dignity, humour, passion and hope by these nine thoughtful young people."
