        "Cult television program \"The Kumars at No. 42\" was an instant success in native Britain. It revolves around a fictional immigrant family who have bulldozed their back garden so they can build a studio on the back of their house and indulge their spoilt only son, Sanjeev, who fancies himself as a celebrity chat show host. Each guest is subjected to a grilling from Sanjeev as well as his mother (Indira Joshi), father (Vincent Ebrahim) and Granny Sushila (Meera Syal). The comedy is quite outrageous as the guests frequently become overwhelmed by the absurd banter between the family and Sanjeev, who tries in vain to take command of his show. Guests include Michael Parkinson, Richard E. Grant, Fay Ripley, Minnie Driver, Garry Lineker, Mel B, Claire Sweeney, Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, Ray Winstone, Richard & Judy, Lorraine Kelly, Stephen Fry and Lesley Garrett."
