    "description": [
        "Influential American avant-garde artist Stan Brakhage (1933-2003) made nearly four hundred films over fifty years. Addressing grand themes of birth, sex and death, Brakhage pioneered the art of handmade films - scratching, drawing and painting directly on to the film itself. This compilation contains twenty-six works by Brakhage including some of his most famous titles. Interviews and audio commentary by Brakhage, as well as an accompanying booklet, provide a fascinating insight into his philosophical and technical processes."
