        "Episode of Series \"Australian story (Television program)\". Noel Pearson, Aboriginal lawyer and Cape York adviser, and his brother Gerhardt Pearson, Cape York leader, together and along with several key business people, philanthropists and the corporate world are attempting to change the social disintegration within the Cape York Aboriginal communities. This program explores the establishment of the Indigenous Enterprise Partnerships, a concept and strategy initiated by Noel Pearson, comprising of four private business entities - Westpac, Myer Foundation, Boston Consultancy and Bodyshop - and other leaders in the business world, along with Aboriginal leaders to provide employment and education to the remote indigenous communities and instigate social change especially amongst the younger generation. Disillusioned with Government bureaucracy and the welfare system, Noel and Gerhardt are committed to change, believing that to overcome the unemployment, alcoholism, gambling, illicit drug use, family violence and child abuse, change has to come from within the Aboriginal community itself. \"Australian story\" presents some of the early successes resulting from the partnership and includes interviews with Ann Sherry (Westpac), Colin Carter (Boston Consultancy), Noel Pearson and Gerhardt Pearson. Hosted by Caroline Jones."
