        "Episode of Series \"Compass (Television program)\". This program discusses the aftermath of September 11 and its impact on Australian Muslims who represent just over 1% of the Australian population. Whilst focusing on some of the negative aspects including vilification, violence and antagonism towards women by non-Muslims, vandal attacks on mosques and a media which seemed to be more intent on dividing the community rather than uniting it, \"Encounters with Islam\" also seeks to reveal a more positive view. Through interviews with various leaders of the Islamic community, academics, young people and non-Muslims, it is apparent that a re-evaluation is taking place amongst the Muslims and a recognition that their world of Islam needs to be demystified and the Australian population informed. The link of crime and acts of terrorism with Muslims stems from not only the tragedy of September 11, but also preceding incidents in Sydney of gang rapes and drug related crimes allegedly by men of Muslim backgrounds. Misunderstanding and prejudice are trying to be counteracted through dialogue and discussion between the different faiths, support, understanding and a \"fair go\" by the non-Muslim Australian community and a better educated and more sensitive media. Presented by Geraldine Doogue."
