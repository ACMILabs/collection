        "Second series of the acerbic slice-of-life comedy show, \"Kath & Kim\" satirises the ambitions, aesthetics, language and aspirations of the working class. Kath (Jane Turner), a forty-something homeowner, fashion and fitness conscious woman, is newlywed to Kel (Glenn Robbins) the butcher. The bane of Kath's life is her disgruntled, spoilt and indulged daughter Kim, a tasteless, overweight and overbearing fashion victim. Written and created by Gina Riley and Jane Turner. The announcement: Kath struggles with her libido and flagging marriage to Kel; Kim tries to win back her estranged husband, Brett. Inside out: Kim and Brett consider renovations, as well as procreation. The Moon: Second best friend Sharon helps out Kim despite her appalling demeanour; Sharon attends a class reunion; Kath plans a honeymoon. Obsession: Kath and Kel embark upon a new health and fitness regime; Kim struggles with her choices as a wife, humiliating Brett; Sharon takes up river dancing; Kath and Kel attend a plastic surgery clinic. My Boyfriend: Brett and Kim become separated in the largest furniture store in the Southern hemisphere; Sharon acquires a boyfriend; the netball final becomes a heated affair. Another announcement: Kim and Kath go shopping for the baby; Brett and Kim attend birthing classes, clashing over a range of issues. The Shower: Kath meets Kel's sleazy best mate Sandy; Sharon plans Kim's baby shower. The Hideous Truth: Kim awaits the birth of her child; Kath experiences flashbacks from her tumultuous first marriage."
