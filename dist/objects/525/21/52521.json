        "Based on the award winning novel \"Deadly, unna?\" by Phillip Gwynne, \"Australian rules\" speculates on the deep rooted racism of a small rural fishing community, Prospect Bay, South Australia, where winning the premiership is the most exciting thing to happen since winning a tidy town competition. The film is viewed from the perspective of Blacky/Gary, a quiet, sensitive, and questioning youth who is best friends with football team mate Dumby Red, a brilliant aboriginal footballer and idealist, apparently unaffected by the animosity of older cousin Perry towards the whites. The status quo changes after a farcical grand final presentation in which one of the goonyas (whites) is selected over arguably Best on Ground Dumby. The football field proves the town's racial arena whereby gunyas (blacks) are tolerated for their superior football prowess - off field, the small minded community is a pressure cooker of racism and hostilities which explode after a tragic event. Blacky's relationship to Dumby's sister Clarence also proves a point of contention with his abusive, belligerent and racist father. A thoughtful and passionate film, \"Australian rules\" was criticised in some sectors for being racist, it is however as much about friendship, intolerance, and life in an isolated community as it is about racism. Cast includes: Nathan Phillips, Luke Carroll, Lisa Flanagan, Tom Budge, Simon Westaway, Celia Ireland, Kevin Harrington. Screenplay by Phillip Gwynne with Paul Goldman. A study guide accompanies the video."
