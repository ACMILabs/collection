        "Alain Resnais tells Gauguin's story through his almost autobiographical paintings. At 35, Gauguin gave up a successful career in banking, deserted his wife and children and began to devote himself entirely to painting. The films commentary is drawn from direct translations of his letters, journals and other writings. Attracted to folk and primitive art, he sought to make his work simple, direct statements of highly personal emotions, rejecting the scientific theories of impressionism and all the notions of a purely representational art. The film's commentary is drawn from direct translations of his letters, journals and other writings."
