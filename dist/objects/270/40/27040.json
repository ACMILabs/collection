        "The park is a natural ecosystem within the city. Plants are the producers, using energy from the sun to produce food by photosynthesis. Animals are the consumers; mushrooms are decomposers. man contributes by mowing the grass and pruning the trees and shrubs to substitute for grazing and browsing animals that are not there, he also fertilizes to supplement natural decay, and waters to supplement natural rainfall. These inter-relationships are examined and a pattern of observation for exploring a local park is thus provided."
