        "English version by J.L. Levi-Alvares. Set to the background music of Handel, J.C.Bach and Vivaldi, this film illustrates how paintings stored in the National Museum of Warsaw which have been damaged by time or during wartime occupation of Poland, are restored. It shows the careful and painstaking skills required to once again allow these paintings to take their rightful place on the walls of the Museum."
