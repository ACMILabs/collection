        "An impressionistic approach to documentary film production utilising a variety of striking images which at times suggest an almost surrealistic sense of humour. Jacques Baratier and Jean Valere have captured Paris nightlife in 1956 featuring its streets and inhabitants, cabarets, Chansonniers and other entertainments, its lights and edifices. As the night progresses, Parisians return to their homes and venues close as markets prepare to open. Excellent cinematography by Maurice Barry. A film without dialogue, incorporating songs in its soundtrack."
