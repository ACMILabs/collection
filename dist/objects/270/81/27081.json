        "This British documentary promotes the benefits to industry of new computing technology. A prescient film; as well as arguing the necessity of adapting computers to commercial and industrial applications, it anticipates the ubiquity of digital technology in the years to follow. This film is part of the epicentre of a high-nerd aesthetic of colourfully geeky enthusiasm for cheesy electronic technology."
