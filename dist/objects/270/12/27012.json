        "A delightful experiment in social satire. A large box floats into view, then begins to revolve and change shape. Doors open and close to reveal quick snatches in color of zooming airplanes, TV commercials, silent movies, a mouth spouting gobbledygook, and, finally a loop of film which is eaten by the box in one gulp. Is the box our world?"
