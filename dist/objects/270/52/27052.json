        "Epileptics face discrimination in the area of employment. Employees are reluctant to take on an epileptic, usually for reasons of job safety and insurance, this occurs especially in the manufacturing areas of employment. This film aims to improve the image of the epileptic, and to show that he is a valuable and productive member of the workforce."
