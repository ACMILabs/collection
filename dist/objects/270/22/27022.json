        "Episode of Series \"Challenge for change/Societe nouvelle\". A film about the play of the same name, which describes the harsh lives of the early Saskatchewan settlers and the foundation of the Co-op movement on the prairies. With great sensitivity and ingenious staging, the 25th Street House Theatre troupe conjures up an important, often touching era in Canadian history - the development of the West."
