        "While indicating the need for preparatory work on paper, this film emphasizes that the scout master must continually keep in mind the boy in the out-of-doors. Starting with the general aims, the film demonstrates the places of the Troop Committee, parents, patrol and the troop in a democratically planned programme. Shows the smooth co-ordination of these groups to produce a workable plan which is successfully carried out."
