        "Episode of Series \"The Desire to read\". This tall tale from Russian folklore follows the hilarious misadventures of a Russian peasant who tries in vain to protect his pea patch from a flock of hungry cranes. The film ends with the defeated peasant illustrating that, although life can be difficult, humanity somehow manages not only to survive but to survive in good spirit."
