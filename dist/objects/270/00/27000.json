        "With demonstrations and teaching devices, Eliot O'Hara relates the physical laws of light to the specific needs of the art student. In his own painting of a two-storey white house in sunlight, Eliot O'Hara shows the application of the four basic elements of lighting: the direct light of the sun; shadow influenced by sky; shadow with reflected light, and shadow with very dim light."
