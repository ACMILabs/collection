        "One of man's continuing problems is to reconcile the difference between what life is like and what it ought to be like. Shows the idyllic and essentially peaceful nature of life in the wilderness. Contrasts these scenes with sounds of riot, assassination, and other indications of man's crimes against man in order to stimulate discussion on the effects of and solutions to some of society's major problems."
