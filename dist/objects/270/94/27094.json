        "A tribute to Dag Hammarskjoeld, late Secretary General of the United Nations. His leadership in a troubled period including the Korean War, the Suez crisis, and the conflict in the Congo are featured, as are his interests in the UN agencies for relief and development. He believed strongly in a personal contact between national leaders. This in part led to his death in an aircraft crash when visiting the troubled Congo in 1961."
