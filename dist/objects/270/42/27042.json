        "A lyrical look at this small historical, Melbourne suburb. Parkville is characterised by Victorian mansions, terraced houses, cast iron, park railings and ivy-clad columns. Social life is carried on in the wide streets, parklands and pubs. An atmospheric film of beautiful images featuring background low-key guitar music. Made by the students of Swinburne with the assistance of the Parkville Association."
