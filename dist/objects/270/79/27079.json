        "Bark painting - inseparable from the social, cultural and religious life of the Australian Aborigine - shown as it is today to satisfy the demands of a commercial market and as it was, the changing pattern of the life of the Aborigine being reflected in his painting. Illustrations in Arnhem Land range from the fishing and hunting, musicians and dancing, to fighting, and mourning and burial ceremonies. In its western region we see various animal and plant totems in the attractive \"x-ray\" style, whilst elsewhere wind designs, clusters of stars, cycad and hybiscus trees are depicted."
