        "Episode of Series \"War in the Air\". A discussion of the ways in which aeroplanes have been developed since the First World War as a pointer to the way they will develop in the future. A brief resume of the development of the warplane from the First to the Second World War, and of the strategic implications of new weapons in modern air war. Atomic and hydrogen bomb experiments; modern defences - fighter, radar, rockets; long range offensive weapons - rockets, carrier forces, V bombers; and lastly, the web of strategic air forces covering a diminished world."
