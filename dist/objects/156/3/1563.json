        "Set in a holiday carnival resort, O Dreamland was one of the breakthrougth films of the British Free Cinema movement of the 50s, which radicalised the documentary form by removing the \"objectivity\" of voice-over and making working class life the pivotal subject of the camera's gaze. With hindsight, O Dreamland now resonates as a record of a vanquished proletariat past."
