    "description": [
        "\"Correspondences\" was an ACMI Screen Gallery Exhibition, held 21 August 2008 - 2 November 2008.  See Exhibition activity record \"Correspondences\" (ID 35 ) for more information  Spanish director V\u00edctor Erice's small but acclaimed body of work has been widely acknowledged for its poetic and masterful storytelling. Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami is regarded as a master of contemporary world cinema, voted by many critics as the most important director of the nineties.  Although these two great filmmakers met face-to-face only once before this exhibition, they discovered powerful parallels in their interests and ideas. Featuring film, photography and new work created especially for the exhibition, Correspondences represents the long distance creative dialogue and intimate rapport that developed between Erice and Kiarostami."
