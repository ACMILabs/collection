        "Filmed on location at Mornington Peninsula, Bellarine Peninsula, Apollo Bay, Torquay, Westernport Bay and Port Melbourne, this film is designed to alert students to the conflict inherent in man's use of the coastal system, potentially one of the most fragile of environments. Shows the abuse of the sand dune systems through leisure, sport, traffic and the erection of structures, as well as the heavy demands placed by industry and shipping on coastal waters. Stresses that these competing interests will, if left unchecked, ultimately destroy the delicate flora and fauna balance of the coastal system. Music performed by Pink Floyd - \"Be careful with that axe, Eugene\" Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
