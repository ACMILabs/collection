        "Alastair Birtles, marine biologist, recounts his journeys of discovery through the mountains of coral of the Great Barrier Reef. Shows how the reef mountains grow, how islands are born, how the reef is a vast living system that is constantly growing, dying and growing again while facing serious threats from man. Brilliant underwater sequences filmed and directed by award winning film-maker David Parer capture the private lives of the creatures inhabiting the coral forests. Densey Clyne contributes on the minute details of the reef's underwater life."
