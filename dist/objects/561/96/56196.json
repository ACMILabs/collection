        "The third film in Cinesound's 'Dad and Dave' series, this film had virtually nothing in common with the Steele Rudd stories and instead was based upon one of Ken Hall's favourite comic formulae of the 'fish out of water'. The Rudd family are taken from their usual rural haunts to the city when Dad unexpectedly inherits a women's fashion emporium. Cast includes Bert Bailey, Shirley Ann Richards, Peter Finch, Fred MacDonald, Billy Rayes, Alec Kellaway, Sidney Wheeler, Connie Martyn, Ossie Wenban, Valerie Scanlan, Muriel Flood, Leila Steppe, Marshall Crosby, Cecil Perry, Billy Stewart, Marie D'Alton and Leslie Victor."
