        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Free to choose\". Milton Friedman disputes the view that consumers need governmental protection against the business community and that government actions tend to make consumers better off. The best protection, he claims, is the free market where consumers will desert inferior products or sevices. Suitable for middle and upper secondary, and tertiary levels."
