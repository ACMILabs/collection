        "Milton Friedman argues that inflation results when the rate of growth of money supply exceeds that of the production of goods and services. The cure is to slow the printing of money, causing short-term increases in unemployment and reductions in growth, but leading to long-term real growth. Suitable for middle and upper secondary and tertiary levels."
