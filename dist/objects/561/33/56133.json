        "John Cleese plays the foolhardy businessman who thinks he has had a successful year in his factory operation, unaware that inflation and depreciation of capital investment have been eating away at his profits. His crockery and cutlery business has also fallen prey to the clutches of inflation. Cleese's more astute business friend informs him of his ignorance, providing a clear and simple explanation of the economic concepts. FOR USE ONLY IN A DOMESTIC SITUATION OR FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY."
