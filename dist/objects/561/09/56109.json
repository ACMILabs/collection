        "Covers the audition process at the 1979 Colorado Shakespeare Festival from the viewpoints of the actors and directors. The actors' feelings about acting, about themselves and the roles they play are examined, as well as how they handle rejections; the directors talk about how they decide which actors to cast in which roles. The final scene shows the successful actors playing the roles for which they auditioned."
