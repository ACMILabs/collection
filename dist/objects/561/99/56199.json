        "Grant Taylor, Peter Finch and Chips Rafferty are cast as three bold Australians in the war-time-morale-boosting feature, recreating war-torn Tobruk in a field near Camden, NSW. Although ostensibly a tribute to the Australian fighting spirits, \"The Rats of Tobruk\" is dominated less by rhetorical patriotism that by a sense of tragedy and heartbreak of war. George Wallace and Joe Valli appear frequently throughout the film to improvise some comic relief but the mood remains set by the three heroes as they soberly face their responsibilities in the war."
