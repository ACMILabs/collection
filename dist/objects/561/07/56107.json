        "Presents 92 year-old Richard St Barbe Baker, the man who founded the international movement \"Men of the Trees\" in 1922, talking about trees: their life-giving qualities, the threats to them from disease and overfelling; and the need to plant for our lives. The first half of the film is scientific in approach while the second half becomes more lyrical with St Barbe reciting his favourite tree poems."
