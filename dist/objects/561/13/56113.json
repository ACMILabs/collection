        "W.C. Fields' first film displaying his prowess at the pool table; rivals for the same girl find that a \"friendly\" game does not help to settle the matter. A useful comparison with later films in terms of the development of character, history of comedy and the role of women. Written by W.C. Fields and musical score by Stuart Oderman."
