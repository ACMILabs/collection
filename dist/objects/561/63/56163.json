        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Free to choose\". Milton Friedman examines government spending, claiming that it leads to fraud and abuse and may not help the very people it sets out to assist. Self-help projects will, he claims, generate work and lead to a more efficient and dynamic system than the Welfare State can provide. Suitable for middle and upper secondary and tertiary levels."
