        "Examines the progress made since 1936 when Dr Norma Ford Walker established a Twin Register: explains how fraternal and identical twins develop; shows a close examination of the placentas of twins; observes the behaviour of a set of identical twins; and concludes with a pair of identical twins separated shortly after birth reminiscing about their discovery of each other after twenty-four years. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
