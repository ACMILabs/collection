    "description": [
        "In his second feature production, Ken Hall retained little but the title of the old play by Bailey and Duggan which had been more faithfully filmed in 1910. Hall's film focussed on the rivalry between two sheep stations, one managed by a strong willed woman, Joan Enderby and the other by a weak willed enemy, Clive Sherrington. Hall believed in providing light relief in his dramas and the film introduced some of his most effective comedy sequences. Strong nationalistic sentiment pervades the film, with Frank Hurley's photography of the outback capturing some vistas of impressive grandeur. Cast includes Jocelyn Howarth, Dick Fair, John Warwick, Fred MacDonald."
