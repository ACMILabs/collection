        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Free to choose\". Trade unions, claims Milton Friedman, benefit members at other workers' expense; government employees gain higher wages at the expense of the taxpayer. Higher wages and better working conditions would result from a free labor market. Suitable for middle and upper secondary, and tertiary levels."
