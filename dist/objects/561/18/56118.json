        "The proliferation of cinemas in the 1930's, and the advent of the newsreel provided a window on the world for the ordinary working class person. This film presents two newsreels produced by two different companies as they appeared in the cinemas on 30th March, 1939, each giving a scant coverage of world political events, and social and sporting events on the home scene. Useful to compare the coverage of events in the two newsreels as well as comparing the newsreel with today's television news coverage. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
