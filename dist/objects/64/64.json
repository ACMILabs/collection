        "dark narratives through surreptitiously recorded phone conversations"
    ], 
    "description": [
        "In this chilling work, Auder taps into phone lines and uncovers dark narratives of ordinary lives. While Auder's camera dispassionately observes nature from a window, we eavesdrop on a series of surreptitiously recorded phone conversations -- conversations we wish we hadn't overheard but can't stop listening to. A divorced couple argues about their daughter's boyfriend, two women compare their dates, a man makes plans with his mistress, teenage lovers bicker. The disembodied, anonymous voices come to us through the static of the lines as if from a bad dream. These purloined conversations are as banal, sinister, and ultimately fascinating as anything in contemporary fiction, except that Auder's \"characters\" are real."
