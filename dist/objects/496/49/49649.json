        "A strange and unusual film about one man's struggle for identity, his alienation with the world of today and his attempts to remain shut off from all that is offensive and intrusive, and yet which eventually leads him on a frenetic search amongst his books, magazines and photographs for Bob Proudfoot, \"The man you know\". Using photographic images, newspaper articles, background voices and narration, this satirical experimental film attacks just about all areas that were once considered taboo, or not open for discussion, in Australia - politics, religion, sex, family life. Cast includes Lance Curtis as the young man and Steve Jacobs as the voice of Bob Proudfoot."
