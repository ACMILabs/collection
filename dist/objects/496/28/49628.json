        "Ever since Skeleton Weed was first discovered in Australia in the early 1900's, farmers and scientists have been searching for a way to stop it spreading through the wheatlands of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. This is the story of their search. Using archival footage and stills, it tells of the early frustrations over failure to eradicate the weed, the hostility of wheat farmers faced with a problem they did not understand, and their growing appreciation of the role of scientific research in devising the best methods of keeping Skeleton Weed in check."
