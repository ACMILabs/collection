        "Played out as a series of video confessions, Love from Guy follows the downward trajectory of Guy (Angelo d'Angelo) a likable but conflicted young man from an Italian background. After Guy's wife walks out on him, he tries to piece together the reasons why she left by recording a video letter intended for her. Director Sandra Lepore's short drama explores the ambivalence felt by the protagonist as he tries to reconcile his family's background and conflicting values which are wrecking havoc on his relationship. Cast includes Les Chantery, Francesca Radice, George Rubiu, Gina Bortolin."
