        "Based on the novel by Klaus Mann, \"Mephisto\" is the story of one man's struggle between his art and his morality. Set in Germany of the 1930s, \"Mephisto\" plots the rise of provincial actor Hendrik Hoefgen (Klaus Maria Brandauer) and the simultaneous rise of Nazism in Europe. Hoefgan is a talented, if vain actor who is not above flattery and manipulation of those around him to achieve his ambitious ends. A man who once had left wing political leanings, Hoefgen is forced to renounce his personal politics and even betray former colleagues in order to gain favour with the Nazis and advance his career. \"Mephisto\" is a compelling portrait of an artist whose ambition is in conflict with his integrity. The mood and aesthetics of 1930s Berlin are aptly evoked in this award winning drama (Oscar for Best Foreign Film, 1982). Directed by Istran Durnoik (Sunshine, Meeting Venus) and also starring Krystyna Janda and Ildiko Bansagi."
