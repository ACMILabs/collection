        "An animated short. A woman and her grandmother sit together playing cards. As they are shuffled and dealt, the film cuts between pre-war Poland, Europe during the Holocaust, the woman's childhood, and the present. A meditation on the relationship between public history and personal memory, as it is played out in the dynamics of the family."
