        "Amos (Freeman Gosden) and Andy (Charles Correll) become lion tamers at the circus. With the real lion being too ferocious, Amos and Andy decide to trick the crowd by \"taming\" a fake lion - a lion costume with two men inside. However, the real lion escapes and unbeknownst to Amos, gets into the cage with him, whilst the fake lion runs away. All hell breaks loose as Amos tries to fend off the hungry lion."
