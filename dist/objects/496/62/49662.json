        "We hide behind clothes. We hide behind hair. We hide behind jewellery. And all of a sudden none of that's there... A warm documentary about women's experience of their bodies in a Korean Bathhouse at Sydney's Kings Cross. Snippets of voices slide over lush cinematography as the corporeal and the emotional melt in this bathing experience."
