        "Born in Paris, France and emigrating to Sydney, Australia as a child with her recently divorced mum, writer director Throsby in this autobiographical film, Sense of Smell explores the connection between scent and memory. Being in a vastly different cultural environment Throsby recalls how the smell of the cakes in the local European cake store in Sydney enabled her to vividly recapture her earlier childhood memories of Paris, transporting her to her birthplace helping her form a sense of place. In trying to develop a picture of place and memory Throsby goes to Paris and talks with Parisians who share their stories to discover that 'smell' is the key to her memories."
