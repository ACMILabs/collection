        "Documentary about Melbourne's Fashion Design Council (FDC) and the hey-day of 1980's Austalian fashion -a time when models skipped and danced down the catwalk to the sounds of analogue synth pop. Fueled by the energy of the DIY Punk and New wave scene the FDC was formally established in 1984 and made fashion a crucial part of the Art School/Music nexus of underground creativity in Melbourne."
