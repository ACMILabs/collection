        "Don't be deceived by the talk of goodwill behind the scenes in the world of Santa Claus training, the reality is different. We are witnessing the passing of the old Santas. Now they do it for the money. 'If we're not professionals we're nothing' muses the narrator-Santa in training. But the day of reckoning comes for every Santa who has to face the acid test: the client. Adapted from the short story by Peter Murphy from his anthology 'The Moving Shadow Problem'. Cast includes Matthew Green and Esme Melville."
