        "Episode of Series \"The West\". Episode seven (1877-1887): \"The Geography of hope\" (85 mins) - By 1877, American conquest of the West was almost complete leaving the Chinese, Mexican-Americans and the Indians no longer welcome - either assimilate or get out. Discrimination also extended to the African-Americans once the Federal Troops withdrew from the South. The grassy plains became desirable for farming and grazing, railroads were being established, and small settlements and farming communities were expanding and developing into large cities and states. In the meantime, the Indian people were being forced off their land and into reservations. Harsh restrictions were put on the Indians and by law they were compelled to change their identity, to assimilate, speak English, attend American schools (military style) and were banned from practising any of their ceremonies and rites. Children as young as five were taken away from their parents, often never to be seen again. Episode eight (1887-1914): \"One sky above us\" (111 mins) - The final episode of this magnificent series. Covers the 1887 Dawes Act which resulted in the breaking up of Indian tribes and their ownership to land; the shooting of Chief Sitting Bull and the slaughter of Lakota Indians at Wounded Knee in 1890; mining corporations, industrialization and ecological destruction during the mid 1880's; harnessing of the Owens River resulting in the Los Angeles Reservoir in 1913. Throughout this series we have followed the tragic history of the Indians, and in particular, the man of peace, Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce tribe. In Chief Joseph's words \"Whenever the white man treats the Indian as they treat each other, then we will have no more wars. We shall all be alike -- brothers of one father, and one mother, with one sky above us and one country around us, and one government for all. Then the Great Spirit who rules above will smile upon this land, and all people may be one people\". Narrated by Peter Coyote."
