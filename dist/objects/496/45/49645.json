        "These are the rules: No post editing; no synchronous sound; no more than three takes. The facts: only 52 seconds of film using an original restored 35mm Lumiere camera. 40 filmmakers from around the world partake in one of the most fascinating and enlightening cinematic experiments in film history, to commemorate the centennial of the Lumiere Brothers' first motion picture. \"From slapstick comedy to political propaganda, documentary realism to costume drama, the world is fleetingly captured once again. But the lens of the contemporary beholders has seen a century the Lumiere brothers could scarcely have imagined. Watching the directors it is hard to decide which side of the camera provides the greater entertainment! Who cranks the handle themselves or who insists on a full technical crew; who conquers, or cracks under the constraints is fascinating and just as illuminating as the succinct sensations they create.\" - Amree Hewitt. 45th Melbourne International Film Festival, 1996.
