        "A pre-eminenent feminist experimental filmmaker and performer, Yvonne Rainer has been making films since the seventies. Her work utilises a variety of art and media forms to create a multi-layered series of images and texts that convey her deep interest in human relationships. \"Privilege\" is a reflexive narrative which employs found and staged interviews, fragments of drama and graphic inserts on a computer screen to disjunctively range over the themes of menopause, racism and rape, from which the viewer is required to distil meaning on the issues of sexual and class identity. Cast includes Alice Spirak and Blaire Baron."
