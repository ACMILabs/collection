        "Shot in black and white and with no dialogue (one word is spoken), just sound effects (most notably textile machinery), this non-linear short is about grieving, loss and infidelity. A phone call in the middle of the night triggers a chain of events in pregnant young Judy who accidentally discovers her dead husband was having an affair with a woman from work. Cast: Donna McRae, Dino Marnika (Awards: Winner of numerous awards, including editing and sound awards at VCA School of Film and Television Awards, 1993)"
