        "Knowing their aspirations will come true is what separates teenage friends Narelle and Nancy from other dreamers. Together, they are going to make it big as a singer and a writer and get out of their current situation - high school, Melbourne, and move to America. All it takes is money. As the girls slip in and out of fantasy, reality becomes all the more unbearable as their parents try to separate them. Cast includes Louise Fox and Di Adams."
