        "W. C. Fields earns himself a jot at the bank as a security guard after unwittingly foiling the getaway of bank robbers. Unfortunately he is then taken hostage by one of the robbers in another robbery attempt at the bank and forced to drive the getaway cark, with policemen hot on their tail. Possibly from the feature \"The Bank dick\" (also known as \"The Bank detective), 1940."
