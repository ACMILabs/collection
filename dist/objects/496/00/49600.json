        "A hilarious Charley Chase comedy that revolves around Mr and Mrs Moose, not the best-looking couple in town. He (Charley Chase) gets his teeth fixed and she (Vivien Oakland) gets her nose lifted. They both look great - so great that when they meet accidentally, they don't recognise each other and plan an illicit rendezvous. Also stars Ann Howe, Charles Clary, Gale Henry and Malcolm Denny."
