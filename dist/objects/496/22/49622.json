        "Elvis: That's the way it is is a remastered, special edition of the original. This edition includes special features such as the original theatrical trailer and the restored documentary, \"Patch it up: The restoration of 'Elvis: That's the way it is'\". The documentary is a great introduction to the original picture, providing insights into Elvis the performer, both on stage and in rehearsal. Those who worked and performed with Elvis add an intimacy that only further draws the viewer into the world of Elvis. His masterful performance and ease with the camera makes the feature throughly entertaining for both Elvis enthusiasts and novice alike."
