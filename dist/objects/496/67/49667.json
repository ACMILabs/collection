        "A child born to Italian parents in country Victoria learns about his growing sexuality. In innocence he and his friends play the usual child games of Doctors and Nurses as a natural means of learning. His play is fettered by religious guilt (that he's yet to understand) and further complicated my his mother's sudden death. A story about the loss of innocence - both as a state of mind and a time in one's life that will never be the same again."
