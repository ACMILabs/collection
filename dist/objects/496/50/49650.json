        "Set in the early 1950's this is a moving story of a relationship between a grandfather,'Pop' who was a soldier in the Lighthorse Brigade during the first World War, and who now is a lighthouse keeper in a very remote and isolated part of Victoria, and his young visiting grandson, Ryan (aged around 12-13 year's old). Pop appears to be immersed in the memories of the war, the horror and tragedies haunting him continually. He and Ryan engage in war games which become increasingly disturbing for Ryan and his relationship with his grandfather. Filmed in black and white, the lighthouse takes on an almost surreal aspect adding to the haunting mood of this rather tragic tale. Shot on location in Portland and Cape Nelson Lightstation. Cast includes Harold Hopkins, Zach Meyers and Penny Larkins."
