        "A compilation of two companion films. 'New Norcia' (23 mins. 1990) is a representation through images and journal extracts of the history of contact between European and Aboriginal cultures, circa 1850-1900 at the Benedictine Mission at New Norcia in Western Australia. 'New Norcia Voices' (19 mins. 1992) combines interviews with a monk at the monastery, historians, and men and women who were brought-up at the mission. Each brings a different perspective to the legend of the founder Bishop Salvado, the legacy of the Mission and what this might mean today.'New Norcia' narrated by Ian Taylor."
