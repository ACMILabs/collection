        "Vlad is a Russian chimpanzee sent up to space as a cosmonaut in the middle of the Cold War. With the end of the stand off between the Soviet Union and the West, Vlad is trapped forever in an endless orbit, a victim of humanity and their history. This deceptively simple animation achingly conveys the alienation, terror and ultimate loneliness of the poor animal doomed to wander the cold metallic surfaces of his space pod. Visually and emotionally powerful."
