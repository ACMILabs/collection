        "This documentary explores the contact between European and Aboriginal cultures which occurred at the Benedictine community in New Norcia, Western Australia around 1850-1900. Extracts from the journal of the founder of the monastery Bishop Rosendo Salvado and photographs taken at New Norcia at the time are used to represent the history of the abbey and the contact between the cultures that occurred there."
