        "Tells of the construction of Britain's second-longest suspension bridge, across the River Severn, from its earliest beginnings to its opening by Queen Elizabeth in 1966. In terms of scientific advance, economy and beauty it is superlative, and its construction points the way to the bridge across the Humber which will be the biggest in the world."
