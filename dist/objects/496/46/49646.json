        "Vincent Gallo made his directorial debut with this comedy drama about convict, Billy Brown, who is released from prison after serving a five year sentence for a crime he did not commit. Bitter and prone to violence, Billy is determined to convince his dysfunctional parents that he has been leading a respectable life doing top-secret CIA work. To give his story credibility, he impulsively kidnaps Layla from a tap-dancing class, forcing her to pose as his wife when he returns home for a visit. Layla strangely takes to the role with enthusiasm and remains with Billy even after the parental visit. Cast includes: Vincent Gallo, Christina Ricci, Anjelica Huston, Ben Gazzara, Kevin Corrigan, Mickey Rourke, Rosanna Arquette and Jan-Michael Vincent."
