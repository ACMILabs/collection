        "\"She had a bad childhood. For a while they thought her mad. She got sent to jail for nothing. Much. It only made her worse. She turned to drugs and murdered men. Fell again again into the black hole of despair. This is the story of Lying Ugly Mess Bitch. These are the insides of Lying Ugly Mess Bitch.  In My Gash takes you into the flesh of a depressed and dangerous girl, drug fucked and damaged. Four wounds are entrances to the nightmare interior where the stories and horrors of bodily memories emerge under the cursor on screen. Each gash leads to the black hole of despair where soundloops and suicide circle endlessly.\""
