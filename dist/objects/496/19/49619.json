        "An animation that bleakly looks at love. When a couple meet and lay eyes on each other in a bar it's instant attraction. Locked into an endless embrace (and locked in chains) with magnets abounding to symbolise the courtship, the relationship dramatically ends. The magnets are seen to disappear and join a graveyard of other magnets, a graveyard of lost love."
