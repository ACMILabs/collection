        "Usually known for her extensive career in photography spanning over 20 years, Cindy Sherman directs her first feature film and brings to life the characters that she has depicted within her photography. Dorine (Kane) is the company doormat, seemingly obliging and mild mannered until one day she accidentally electrocutes a fellow worker, who happens to be her most obnoxious opponent. The unhinged Dorine continues her killing spree believing that all can be friends when dead. Her antics verge on discovery when the bitchy co-worker played by Molly Ringwald suspects that all is not okay. Following in the b-grade genre of film-making, Sherman delights with an excess of gory special effects. Cast also includes: Jeanne Tripplehorn."
