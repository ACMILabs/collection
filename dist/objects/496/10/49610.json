        "Karima and Aadel are both escaping painful pasts and guarded secrets in Egypt. They meet in Beirut, a city where they find peace and where they fall in love. But as always, the road to love is a thorny one and they must both come to terms with their fears. For Karima, it is being stalked - is it the detective who is constantly turning up wherever she goes, or some other darker stranger? And Aadel must come to terms with his fears after a loveless marriage which ended in him brutally murdering his wife - for which he was imprisoned for one year! Starring Samira Ahmad and Aamad Homdy. In Arabic with no English subtitles."
