        "Based on a true story, 'The Dish' tells the story of the first landing on the moon and the role a bunch of technicians in remote Australia played in delivering those images to the world. In stark contrast to images we've seen before in films and the news of NASA control rooms - hundreds of experts working around the clock to ensure a successful mission - the film segues to the activities of staff in the sleepy remote town of Parkes, South Australia, where the equal task of tracking the lunar module was shared with NASA. After we witness the Australian's low-key approach to this responsibility what is revealed in this gentle comedy is a cultural critique; a celebration of the unique qualities that make us Australian and defines our cultural values."
