        "Director Toby Zoates takes his camera to the squats of inner Sydney in an attempt to ascertain who the real deviants of society are - those who choose to do things their own way, or those that try to stop them. Utilising the cinema verite style and a punk soundtrack, he interviews a cross-section of people affected by issues such as unemployment and drugs, and examines the tactics those disenfranchised by societal pressures use to survive. This documentary, shot during Malcolm Fraser's reign as Prime Minister, looks at the mundane reality of life for many young people, and aims to persuade viewers to take political action against a system that is seen to oppress individuality and demonise non-conformist behaviour. Filmed around Pyrmont, Kings Cross, and Chippendale."
