        "Brian McKenzie documents the Seager family who are a family dedicated to the racing of their beloved greyhounds. The family has grown-up with the ritual of training, caring and racing the dogs, but as the teenagers grow up, their independent lives take them increasingly away from this family pursuit. Tenderly compiled with sometimes humorous but gentle observations of the family, we are led more deeply into the psyche of the Australian spirit."
