        "Episode of Series \"The West\". Episode five (1868-1874): \"The Grandest enterprise under God\" (84 mins) - Following the Civil War, the North and South united but the Americans then desired to unite East and West. To do it, they would build a railroad - its completion would be one of the greatest technological achievements of the age. With Federal money and two corporations, Union Pacific and Central Pacific, 1,775 miles of track spanning from Omaha to Sacramento, the Great Pacific Railway was completed over a period of three years with the final spikes being hammered in on May 10, 1869. With this freedom of travel also came the buffalo hunters, killing and slaughtering and depriving the Indians of their sacred rights and spiritual attachment to the buffalo. Mormon women actively protested for their right to vote and so also began the Suffrage movement in America. Cattle, cowboys and cattle trails soon replaced the land of the buffalo - like the Gold Rush before it, the railroad was to bring an even greater and lasting transformation to the West. Episode six (1874-1877): \"Fight no more forever\" (84 mins) - By 1874 railroads had brought millions of settlers to the West, Washington was to launch yet another assault on the Mormons, and the Government began forcing many Indian tribes to surrender their claim to the land and confining them to reservations where they were dependent on government rations and on the whims of government agencies. Between 1874-1877, the remaining Indian tribes including the Lakota, the Cheyenne and the Nez Perce made their last stand against the Americans. General George Armstrong Custer, Sitting Bull (Chief of the Lakotas) and Joseph (Chief of the Nez Perce) were each to play a leading part in this important period of America's history. Narrated by Peter Coyote."
