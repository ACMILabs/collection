        "This dark-humored comedy drama explores perverse sexual obsession in a marriage based on mutual hatred. While on a luxury cruise to Istanbul a repressed English couple, Nigel and Fiona, (played by Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott-Thomas) meet a crippled American writer and his beautiful French wife. As the American entertains Nigel with elaborate accounts of the sexual power games he and his wife play (related in lengthy flashbacks), the English couple's curiosity is aroused. Gradually they become drawn into their twisted and ultimately destructive relationship as unwitting observers and participants in a tragedy with the most extraordinary outcome. Cast also includes Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner."
