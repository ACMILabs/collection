        "Hermione, a laundromat worker from Baulkham Hill, and her friend Joeline, decide to hit the road and head for Tamworth for the annual rodeo show. Hermione has an absolute obsession for all that is Texan and so when she meets Alfie John Morrison, champion bull rider, country and western singer and part Texan, Hermione is totally swept off her feet - all her dreams have come true. Joeline, in the meantime, has paired off with Buddy L, new up and coming rodeo champion. This charming romantic comedy with its occasional black moments and its tongue-in-cheek look at the Australian rodeo scene was a finalist in the Sydney Film Festival and won an award at the St Kilda Film Festival. Cast includes Ruth Caro, Helen Buday, Lorna Lesley, Justin Monjo, Todd Boyce."
