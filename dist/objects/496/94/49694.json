        "The story of a menage-a-trois in the years around World War I is distanced by the narrator who makes the viewer continually aware of the artifice involved in its telling. Truffaut drew on incidents in his own life in developing Roche's novel in a personal way. He identified Jim with Roche and Jules with himself. Their discovery of Catherine is symptomatic of the confusion between art and life which pervades the protagonists' lives. The narrative, punctuated by cinematic allusions, is marked by a wide range of techniques and rapid shifts in mood from pathos to whimsy. Cast: Jeanne Moreau, Oscar Werner, Henri Serre, Marie Dubois. From the book by Henri-Pierre Roche."
