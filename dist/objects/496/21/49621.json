        "Discusses the global issue of commercial exploitation of children and the various forms this abuse can take, eg prostitution, slave-trade, pedophilia, internet pornography. Mentions some of the causes as being poverty, homelessness, consumerism, absence of child protection, cultural and traditional practices and a growing child sex tourist trade. Also talks about positive strategies that can be taken at all levels, local, regional, national and international. ECPAT is an international network of organisations committed to ending the commercial exploitation of children. Formed in 1991, ECPAT now reaches to over 50 countries globally and closely works with various government departments, such as Tourism and Child Welfare. Cast: Michael Brakensiek, Sarah Hill, Michael Williams, Afshin Nikousheresht. Narration: Patrick J. Bonello, Damian Nicholas."
