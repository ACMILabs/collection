        "After seeing Allan (Tony Harvey) in hospital the viewer is taken through some disjointed scenes that describe Allan, his social life, community life and friends from a small seaside South Australian town. More deeply, the film goes to describe the violence that underpins Australian society and particularly the Australian youth culture. After leaving the hospital with brain damage, Allan soon discovers that the stigma of his injuries doesn't win him many friends and in fact ostracizes him from his social group. The cowardice that is synonymous with violent behaviour is tackled here, best exampled by his 'mate' Darryl (Paul Gleeson) who provides light on the meaning of 'mateship' understood in this social group. Although Allan sees life differently there is no hope or means of escape, he always seems to see things when it's too late. Written and directed by Keiran Weir."
