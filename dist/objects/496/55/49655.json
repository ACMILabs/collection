        "In 1893 New Zealand women were the first in the world to achieve the right to vote. One hundred years later, \"The Nineties\" looks at the lives of seven women - Madge Wallscott, Kuini Te Tau, Sister Eustace, Grace Patterson, Ellen Hopkins, Minnie Martin and Margaret Dean - all in their nineties and full of vitality, who have lived through the changes of the last century. With the use of rare photographs and archival film footage, this documentary is a piece of women's history, of universal appeal, telling of the hardship and struggles, determination and achievements of these women. Their lives and stories tell of their family background, their teenage years, marriage, children, the Depression years, World War II, their involvement in community work and finally, their 'nineties'. This documentary celebrates the extraordinary lives of these women. Interviewer: Monique Oomen."
