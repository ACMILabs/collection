        "Episode of Series \"Geometry\". Introduces the eccentricity definition, then focuses on projective definitions devoid of metric notion implying the construction of a conic by straight edge alone. Shows methods of construction developed by Pascal, Malaurin, Braikenridge, Poncelet and Steiner. The logical relationship between the methods is demonstrated."
