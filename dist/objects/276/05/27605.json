        "The most important thing a projectionist does is present a film, not just run a projector. The film presumes the student projectionist has a knowledge of the equipment which they are to operate. Stress is on the relationship between the audience and the elements of projecting - seating, screen, loudspeaker, projector and the projection procedure - rather than on the purely mechanical aspects of projection."
