        "Traces the history of aviation from the 15th Century when Leonardo da Vinci realised that flight was not an idle dream, through to air travel today. Traces the history of human's attempts to imitate the bird from Icarus' feathered wings to the Supersonic Transport system, focusing on Leonardo Da Vinci, Santos, Dumont, the Wright Brothers, and the significant technological advances made during World War I and III that have led to increased availability today. Also depicts renewed interest in simple forms of flight."
