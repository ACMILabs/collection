        "A promotional film aimed at interesting overseas companies in opening up industries in Victoria. Shows the Stock Exchange, the efficient public transport system, freeways, Tullamarine international airport, shipping facilities, resources of water, brown coal, natural gas and oil. Cultural and living conditions are also shown. Features a humourous narration by Frank Thring, as a very young Sue Donovan (Mackintosh) traverses Victoria (in fashionable 70's gear) seeking artefacts to illustrate its attributes."
