        "Episode of Series \"Man Alive\". How does the oldest girl in a family look after her brothers and sisters when the mother has died or gone away? This film is about two such cases. Seventeen-year-old Carole who lost her mother through cancer a year ago, now looks after six young brothers and sisters on her own. Frances, who comes from a family of twelve however, has a father who works and provides for the family, and a Home Help who also does a lot of hard work for the twelve children, but Frances is the only mother the younger children will ever know."
