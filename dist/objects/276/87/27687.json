        "A general picture of the Royal Navy pointing out that its efficiency as a fighting force comes from mastery of self through discipline and training and mastery of science. A picture of the royal Navy, stressing that its efficiency and effectiveness rest upon three things, mastery of sea, self and science. The sea has been mastered by the inherent skill in handling ships and a knowledge of the ways of the sea traditional in British people. Mastery of self is achieved through discipline, the result of self-confidence and control, required in every training establishment. Finally mastery of science is needed, for the Royal navy of today is a highly technical force, and employs many scientific devices and weapons."
