        "Episode of Series \"Office Supervisor's Problems\". The office manager has been called on to make a recommendation for promotion and decides on a younger employee because of his ability to get on with people. The older man who has been with the company for fifteen years is passed over. He is disgruntled and resigns although the supervisor tries to explain the situation to him. Discussion is on the question of whether the office manager was right to make the decision that he did."
