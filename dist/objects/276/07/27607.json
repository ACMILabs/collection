        "'Defence of peace' was commissioned by the United Nations Department of Public Information being made shortly after the organisations formation in 1945. The film is about the creation of the United Nations and provides historical context to the organisation's formation. 'Defence of Peace' contrasts the organisation with it's non-political predecessor \"The League of Nations\". It explains why the league failed and how the UN as an organisation was designed to be politically effective. Also discussed is the structure and fundamental operations of the UN."
