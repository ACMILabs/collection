        "A look at the art of trampolining, with Paul Luxton champion British trampolinist demonstrating the skills that make him a champion. There are six categories of movements in trampolining, and three body shapes tucked, pike and straight. Trampolinists have modified many established dives by landing on the back or the chest, and these modifications are demonstrated. Luxton finally demonstrates a sequence of double and triple somersaults with any number of twists, showing that trampolining, like gymnastics, proceeds into art and does represent an aesthetic achievement."
