        "A dramatisation of the search by Nullandi, an Aboriginal youth, for \"the everlasting waters\", with allusions to the experiences of a person living in another (non-Aboriginal) culture. Nullandi has grown up in today's society and culture, but still feels traces of his past. He works his way through southern Queensland as he searches for the key to life."
