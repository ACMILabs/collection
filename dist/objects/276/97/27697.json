        "Treats in a new cinematic manner man's unequal struggle to gain an intellectual grasp on the idea of time, its origin, measurement and place in theoretical physics. An exploration of the concept of time reduced to a human scale and ranging through the major historical developments; mans first notion of time; its relation to movement and more recent concepts of biological time, time in relativistic terms."
