        "The Queen in Australia is a landmark in Australian history. It not only records the first visit by a reigning monarch to Australia, it was also the first colour, feature-length documentary made in this country. This historic program provides nationwide coverage of the 1954 Royal Tour by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and HRH the Duke of Edinburgh - a two-month journey that took in every facet of Australian life: garden parties at Government House, dancers at the Tivoli, racing at Randwick, tennis at Kooyong with Rosewall and Hoad, cricket with the Don, even a meeting with Papua New Guinean tribal chiefs. The young royals visited every state in the nation, and the result is a remarkable and revealing insight into our nation in the 1950s."
