        "H.M. the Queen's tour of Pakistan, 1961. Her Majesty's welcome by President Ayub Khan preceded a round of engagements during which she saw the country's transitions as well as present-day developments. These included a visit to the great Warsak Dam; the gift of sheep by local leaders at the Khyber Pass; the Lahore Horse Show; the bare acres on which Islamabad, the new capital, will be built; a torchlight tattoo; the Badshahi mosque; and the lovely Shalimar and Gulistan-I-Fatima Gardens in Lahore, in which Pakistan's National costumes and folk-dancing were displayed. The worlds largest jute mill, a trip by river boat, and a final tribute of rose petals."
