        "Shows management and employees that there is a guard to protect workers on every type of punch press and that protection is provided only when the guard is properly adjusted. The punch press has a record of producing more permanent disability injuries than any other industrial mechanical equipment. Shocking accidents are shown followed by examples of guards available and a clear statement of the foreman's responsibility in preventing accidents."
