        "The film is designed to present simply and in easy-to-understand laymen's language, the different reasons why people choose to practise family planning. Appealing to audiences in a broad range of age levels and economic circumstances, it combines dramatization with voice-over narration to show real people in different situations as they learn about planning a family. Among the motivations for choosing to practise family planning shown in this film are health, emotional maturity, economic stability, and the need to provide each child with individual love and attention. It provides invaluable information about the positive aspects of family planning, giving the viewer an opportunity to learn, discuss and to arrive at very carefully considered decisions."
