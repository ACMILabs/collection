        "The one-year crusade of the schooner Norma and Gladys sent by Canada to illustrate to the world that new concepts and ideas are needed if the oceans are to survive the onslaught of man. The boat stopped in New York where the Law of the Sea Conference was debating the issue. As a result of these actions, on June 4, 1976, Canada was able to proclaim her sovereignty over a 200 mile fishing zone."
