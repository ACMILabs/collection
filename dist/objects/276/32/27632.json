        "One-fifth of the merchant ships afloat consists of tankers which form a floating chain between the oilfields of the world and the consumer. The film centres round a single tanker - the \"Liparus\" - on her normal run, introducing her officers and some of her crew. The modern takner is a large and handsome vessel and special care is devoted to ensuring good living conditions for officers and men. Because of possible danger there is a fixed routine of weekly boat drill, and fire-drills are taken seriously. As a result tankers are \"the best bet there is on the insurance market\"."
