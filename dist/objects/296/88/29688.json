        "A view of Montreal as seen from the helicopter of one of the radio stations that reports on rush-hour traffic movement. Spread out below are the ant-runs of the city--freeways, interchanges, bridges, downtown arteries--and on them the thousands of vehicles, like so many dinky-toys, moving with the flow or jammed in massive tie-ups. It is a seething, teeming spectacle, a unique view of the city, artfully filmed, with comments by the traffic guide, Len Rowcliffe."
