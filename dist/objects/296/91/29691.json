        "An account of the operation of British Railways. The integration of goods and passenger services calls for a constant review of time-tables to meet the varying local needs. A sudden demand for extra locomotives in West Cornwall may effect tin plate traffic from South Wales and fish from Scottish ports rushed to the markets potentially affects rail demands in the Midlands. Shows how coal wagons are sorted in Toton Marshalling Yard and how London's evening rush to the suburbs is dealt with. Music composed by Edward Williams."
