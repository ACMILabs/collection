        "Episode of Series \"Man builds - man destroys\" Mass transit is an alternative to traffic-clogged city streets, but most urban transit systems are losing passengers. Two cities are actually attracting new riders:  Hamburg, Germany, through reliable, efficient service, and Toronto, Canada with expanding service, which will soon include fast, noiseless, non-polluting magnetic suspension trains. Also surveyed is the innovative mass transit technology being tried in other cities."
