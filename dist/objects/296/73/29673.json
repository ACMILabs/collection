        "A graphic illustration of how the science of town planning can be directed towards the re-planning of a city so that the mistakes of the past may be corrected and a result achieved in which business, residential and industrial areas are properly zoned. The film contrasts random growth with systematic direction that can produce a beautiful, efficient and comfortable city."
