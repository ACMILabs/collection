        "Here the Czech film-artist Bretislav Pojar amusingly reflects on our habit of looking before we leap. What he shows us is the little person inside each of us, the cautious character we all know, who acts to keep us out of trouble but also in a state of defeat. Is there a cure for this reluctance to face up to life in the raw? The film shows there is. With the Pojar charm working for you, your worst fears suddenly look plain silly."
