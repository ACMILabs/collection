        "This humourous hand-drawn animation is in response to the theme washing machine. A meowing cat (Howard Tal van Kleef) is locked in the laundry as a disciplinary measure by its owner. The cat's curiosity for the outside gets the better of him when a dog frightens him into a free-fall from the window ledge towards the operating washing machine. The cat has a near death experience, his important memories flash by as he falls."
