        "It begins with the faces of children outside a toy store window at Christmas--but then the war toys appear and we realize that some games are played for keeps. This film has no commentary, but it is easy to see what it aims to show: war toys do not necessarily make warriors, but it is possible that they give a false glamor to the deadly pursuit. With toys that keep up with the times, this film creates a battle that is all too real and frightening."
