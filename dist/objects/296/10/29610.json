        "This film documents the construction of C.N. Tower in Toronto Canada, which is the world's tallest freestanding structure, built as a link for nation wide communications. The first 1500ft of the tower is concrete, followed by an observation deck and atop of this a 300ft antenna. The film explains in detail the construction techniques used to build the tower from the ground upwards assisted by the use of cranes and a helicopter. Excellent use of time-lapse photography shows the progression of construction, where 22ft of the tower is added on to every 24 hours. The challenge made by the builders to make this tower is even made harder by the freezing temperatures and snow. A 70's score accompanies the superb photographic views with the inclusion of some nice chunky base riffs and a stummy divergence, which is reminiscent of the theme from The Love Boat."
