        "A film record, suitable for schools, of the war years of 1939 to 1945, showing major developments from the rise of Nazism in Germany to the first atomic bomb at Hiroshima. It does not minimize the brutality of war, but shows how this \"total war,\" unlike wars of the past that engaged only the men of the fighting front, involved in varying degree almost every individual of every nation."
