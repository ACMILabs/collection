        "Two \"talking\" animals - Warty Bliggens, a true toad and Cactus Clyden, a horned toad - describes the characteristics of their bodies, their behaviour and there natural habitats. Close up photography reveals the differences between the two animals, and the viewer soon learns that the horned toad is not a toad at all, but a horned lizard with entirely different characteristics from those of the true toad"
