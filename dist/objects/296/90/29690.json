        "An experiment in creating a dramatic biography from a painter's work. The film covers a great deal of Leonardo de Vinci's activities, explores his sketch books and notebooks, his extraordinary designs for machines of war, his correspondence, his drawings and paintings and his unfinished statuary. \"The Tragic pursuit of perfection\" is the theme of the film illustrated by the history of \"The Last supper\"."
