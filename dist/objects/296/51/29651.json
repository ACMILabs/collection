        "Tells the story of one of America's richest treasures - the thin layer of topsoil on which the people of America depend for most of their food, clothing and other necessities of life. Topsoil takes centuries to produce; it is one of nature's most delicate and most precious gifts; yet it may be totally destroyed in a few years by improper farming methods. This film points out the difference between the topsoil and the less productive subsoil, and ends by showing how precious topsoil may be conserved while still being used for maximum production."
