        "Describes the manufacture of Laconia woollen blankets as seen through the eyes of a little girl who cares for her own flock of sheep and wonders what happens to the wool after her sheep are shorn. Shows the fleece being scoured, dyed, carded and spun into yarn; weaving, milling, piece dyeing and mothproofing processes; and the drying, cutting and finishing of each blanket."
