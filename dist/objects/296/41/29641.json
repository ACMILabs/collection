        "The film describes the joint program of the Canadian and British Columbian governments to protect and strengthen stocks of Pacific salmon on which depend, either directly or indirectly, the jobs of 75,000 people and a $250 million industry. Well-documented and visually satisfying, the film alerts its audience to the necessity of sound conservation practices."
