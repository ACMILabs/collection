        "One of a series of film designed to show the rest of the world the problems facing the Control Commission of the Western Zone of occupied Germany. This film deals with the forming and running of a new German police force. Against flashes of the past, when the police were a terror to every citizen, the promotion of a new police force under British and American guidance is traced."
