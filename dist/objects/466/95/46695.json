        "Classic Howard Hawks' comedy sees Cary Grant play Captain Henri Rochard, a French officer who falls for an American army official staioned in Europe. Following the chaos however, and bureaucratic red-tape that marked the cessations of hostilities in World War 2, the pair find it almost impossible to make their union legal. Circumstances force Rochard to pose an a 'war bride' in order to secure happiness, which of course leads to no end of strife and embarrassment for the eager groom."
