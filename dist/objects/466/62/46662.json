        "Set in Craiglockhart military hospital during World War I, this is based on a real life encounter between military psychologist Dr William Rivers (Jonathan Pryce), and the poet Siegfried Sassoon (James Wilby) who has been institutionalized in an attempt to undermine his public disapproval of the war. It is also about the young poet Wilfred Owen (Stuart Bunce), who with support from Sassoon, starts to write his great war poems. Gilles MacKinnon's highly praised adaptation of Pat Barker's novel is a powerful study of war and its long reaching effects."
