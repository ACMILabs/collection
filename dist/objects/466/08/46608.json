        "Loosely adapted from the classic 1932 horror film starring Boris Karloff, this version is set in Egypt, where over 3,000 years ago the high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was given the all-important assignment of preparing the recently dead for their journey into the afterlife. However he made one fatal mistake - he became smitten with Anck-Su-Namun, the mistress of the Pharaoh. Driven mad by jealousy and love, Imhotep murdered the Pharaoh, and his punishment was to be buried alive and suffer the torment of an eternal life in his wretched tomb. In 1925, a band of adventurers seeking fame and fortune - led by Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), an American expatriate who has joined the foreign legion, and Evelyn Carnarvon (Rachel Weisz), an amateur archaeologist - find a previously unknown burial site in Egypt. The team starts to dig, hoping to find lost riches but instead they disturb the tomb of Imhotep, causing him to rise from the grave to wreak vengeance on humanity."
