        "Hen pecked Arthur Earthliegh (George Brent) has a respite from one woman - his wife, only to end up in the arms of another, the drunken yet voracious Olive (Ann Dvorak) who accompanies him home one night. Unbeknownst to Arthur, Olive has a heart condition and Arthur, thinking he has killed her, places the body on the next door neighbour's patio - all under the watchful eye of 2 elderly female residents who alert the police. By the time the police have arrived, next door neighbour David has decided to extort Earthliegh into helping him dispose of the body in exchange for Earthliegh dropping the case against having David and his dog, Rabelais (who is prone to digging up the Earthliegh's zinnias) evicted. Cast also includes Carole Landis and Turhan Bey. Based on a story by Vera Caspary."
