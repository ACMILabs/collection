        "For the first time since he was a young boy, teenager Morgan Stewart (Jon Cryer) is invited by his parents to make the move from boarding school to home. Packing up his dorm room, Morgan sets out with high hopes that are swiftly quashed as it becomes apparent that his parents invited him home as a political move, eager to impress voters with the \"family\" push. When he meets the down to earth and wrong side of the tracks girl, Emily (Viveka Davis), Morgan is forced to choose between pursuing his own interests and maintaining the awkward sense of family. In the process Morgan discovers corruption by his father's campaign press secretary (Paul Gleason) which also challenges his sense of familial loyalty. Cast also includes Nicholas Pryor and Lynn Redgrave."
