        "A young tourist, Billy Hayes (Brad Davis), travelling in Turkey is arrested for possession of hashish. The film traces his experiences, often violent and terrifying, in a foreign jail and his attempts to escape and cross the border into freedom. The cast also features John Hurt and Randy Quaid with a script by Oliver Stone. The film is based on Billy Hughes' book of the same title relating his jail experiences."
