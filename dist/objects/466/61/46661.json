        "This clever 'mockumentry' profiles a large range of shoppers and their affectionate relationship with that all-Australian icon: the shopping jeep. Using the South Melbourne market and Station Pier as a background, director Michaela French reveals the many faces of this Australian icon, from traditional brown vinyl to fully customable vehicle able to accommodate every usage and need, including pet limousine. Features an interview with a jeep manufacturer who enlightens the viewer as to the options available on the market, as well as interviews with jeep owners who describe how they have personalised the handy carrier."
