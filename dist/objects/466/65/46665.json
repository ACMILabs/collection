        "This documentary re-enactment made following the 1973 student rebellion which toppled the military junta in Thailand, is based on the experiences of a farmer from the poverty stricken north eastern region. It portrays the political and cultural gap that exists between peasant realities and the good intentions of the intelligentsia. In Thai with English subtitles."
