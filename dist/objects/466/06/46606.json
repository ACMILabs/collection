        "Washington Irving's classic tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman is given a few new twists in the hands of director Tim Burton. Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a New York City detective whose unorthodox techniques and penchant for gadgets makes him unpopular with his colleagues. He is sent to the remote town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of bizarre murders, in which a number of people have been found dead in the woods with their heads cut off. Crane refuses to believe the local legend that the ghost of a sadistic Hessian soldier rides through the woods on horseback, lopping off the heads of the unbelieving and is convinced there is a logical explanation. This disturbing tale of suspense, murder and mysticism also stars Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Christopher Lee and Christopher Walken."
