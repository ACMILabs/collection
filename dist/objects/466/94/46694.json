        "A saboteur known as \"The Wrecker\" is attempting to destroy the L&R railroad company in order to bolster an airline competing for the same route. When Larry Baker (John Wayne), a young air transport pilot finds out that his father, the railroad's chief engineer, has been killed in one of a series of train wrecks, he is determined to track down the culprit. The villain's talents as a master of disguise make his apprehension extremely difficult as a number of other characters come under suspicion. After a series of hair-raising attacks on the Hurricane Express, Baker eventually saves the day and the damsel (Shirley Grey) he loves. Originally conceived and filmed as a twelve part serial, this version was truncated to a feature-length film for cinema release."
