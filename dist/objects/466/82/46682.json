        "Based on the novel by Louis L'Amour, John Wayne's own favourite movie features the actor in the role of Hondo, a half-Indian cavalry scout. Set in 1874 against the unrest and hostility caused by the white man's violation of the treaty with the Apache Nation, the plot concerns Hondo's protection of a young woman and her son whom he discovers living alone in Apache territory. The film extends liberal respect to the Indians and even implicitly endorses the inter-racial romance that develops between the white women and the half-breed Hondo. With impressive cinematography by Robert Burke, the film was restored and re-released by the John Wayne estate in 1995. Cast includes Geraldine Page. Ward Bond and Michael Pate."
