        "Writer/director Sayles once again takes his audience to a place they may never have been before - both psychologically and geographically. Traumatized by a boating accident that killed two friends, Joe Gastineau (David Strathairn) has given up hope for a life beyond the odd jobs he takes to support himself. Everything changes when struggling singer Donna De Angelo (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and her troubled teenage daughter enter his life. Both mother and daughter fall for Joe, increasing the already-present friction between them. The tension continues to build until Joe's fast-talking half-brother Bobby returns to town, sparking a chain of events that will change all of their lives forever. This is an engrossing movie with engaging characters, overlaid on the extraordinary setting of the rugged Alaskan wilderness."
