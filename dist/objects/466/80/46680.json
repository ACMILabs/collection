        "'Entertaining Angels' is based on the true life of Dorothy Day, a radical journalist who lived in New York writing about the plight of America's homeless. She has an early love affair with a co-worker which results in a traumatic abortion that sees her move to the coast to be alone. While staying at the beach Dorothy (Moira Kelly) comes across and old friend and the two fall in love. It is at this time that Dorothy begins to question her faith after some close contact with one of the nuns who runs a shelter for the disadvantaged. Dorothy falls pregnant to Foster and although happy for a while, she refuses to give up her religion and he refuses to marry, once again Dorothy is alone but ready to move back to the city. Dorothy and her daughter are baptized Catholics and Dorothy resumes her career as a journalist, only this time starting her own paper, \"The Catholic Worker\" after meeting Peter, a French social activist. Dorothy combines her journalism and charity at home, offering the homeless a soup kitchen, shelter and office where she can work on the paper. This is an inspiring film that was made on a relatively small budget by Paulist Pictures who also brought us 'Romero'."
