        "This fast paced exciting crime story was originally released as a B-movie filler but has, through the years, acquired a reputation as one of the most effective and most impressive of Hollywood film noir. Edmond O'Brien plays an insurance man, unsure about his life and his feelings for his girlfriend Paula (Pamela Britten), who on a weekend trip to San Francisco finds himself the victim of a bizarre poisoning. His attempts to unravel the mystery while counting down the clock to his death lead him to a reappreciation of his own life. Directed by Rudolph Mate who was the cinematographer for Carl Dreyer's \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" and \"Vampyr\", the highly evocative cinematography, chilling musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin, and the desperate central performance by O'Brien all contribute to making this a truly suspenseful and dark piece of filmmaking."
