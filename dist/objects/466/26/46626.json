        "An illustration of Pavlov's theories of how human skills and instincts may have developed from his ape-like ancestors. The responses of monkeys and their ability to learn and to work out problems are demonstrated, with their implications about human behaviour. Research materials used in this film were provided by the academic Ivan Pavlov and Professors Voronin, Gerasimor, Ladygina-Kots, Roginsky, Semyonov, Tikh and Yakimov."
