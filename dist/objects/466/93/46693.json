        "Attacked but unharmed by a masked assailant, Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in mortal fear that the unidentified man will strike again - especially since he knows where she lives. Her attacker (James Russo) breaks into her home again and subjects her to a night of terror and sexual humiliation, however Marjorie manages to turn the tables on him, knocking him unconscious and rendering him helpless. She is then faced with a major moral dilemma, should she turn him in to the police or should she mete out her own punishment, and if so, what would be a fitting form? This is a film about random violence and the focus of the movie is on the moral dilemma Marjorie faces, the depiction of graphic violence in the film is shocking at times, but a standout, harrowing performance by Farrah Fawcett makes it compulsive viewing."
