        "Illustrates nature's methods of making food chains which tie together all the living creature in a community, making one dependent on the others for its existence. The film includes close-ups of tadpoles eating algae, crayfish catching and eating tadpoles, links in the food chain through green bass, fish eggs, a Polythemus moth is hatched from its cocoon and a spider builds its web - to trap some other creatures and complete the \"chain of life\"."
