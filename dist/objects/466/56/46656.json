        "Robert Altman's \"Buffalo Bill and the Indians\" sardonically explores the gap between western history and legend in show biz-obsessed America. Megalomaniac \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody assumes the legend created for him by writer Ned Buntline, aided and abetted by his producer and his publicist, perpetuating myths of white triumph over savage \"Injuns\" in his Wild West show, as audiences cheer him on and buy his merchandise. But when Sitting Bull joins the troupe with his interpreter, his request for authenticity threatens to throw a wrench into the proceedings. Regardless of how Bill may feel about the facts, he must bow to the preferences of the paying public. Cast includes: Paul Newman, Joel Grey, Kevin McCarthy, Harvey Keitel, Allan Nicholls, Geraldine Chaplin, Burt Lancaster, Frank Kaquitts."
