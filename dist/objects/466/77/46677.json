        "A satire of the tabloid-press industry, \"The Naked Truth\" focuses on a scandal-sheet publisher, Nigel Dennis, who gets rich by disclosing lurid details of the private lives of wealthy prominent people. Several of his victims attempt to do away with the blackmailing publisher, all to no avail. But when they all join forces, the final plan is brought into play, with each piece slowly falling into place. Cast includes: Dennis Price, Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Shirley Eaton, Peggy Mount, Georgina Cookson, Joan Sims and Miles Malleson."
