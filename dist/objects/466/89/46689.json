        "Shot in Technicolour, this rousing swashbuckler set in the 17th century tells the story of Blackbeard who, while pillaging the high seas kidnaps the adopted daughter of Sir Henry Morgan, a high official in Jamaica, much to the dismay of her lover, an officer in the British navy. Swordplay and derring-do abound as the timid officer must fight to win back his love, even as Blackbeard duels with his arch-enemy Morgan, who is also a reformed pirate."
