        "Christopher Walken stars as a drug lord turned good guy in this crime film directed by Abel Ferrara. Frank White is released from prison, a reformed man and sets out to take over New York City, in order to prevent the closure of a hospital in the South Bronx where he grew up. With the help of a few gangster friends, he begins to take over the entire drug industry in the city, killing those standing in his way. As his takeover begins to succeed he brings in more recruits, but unknowingly starts a underground war between crime groups in the city. Cast also includes Larry Fishburne, Wesley Snipes, David Caruso and Steve Buscemi."
