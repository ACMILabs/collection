        "A personal and compelling journey into the lives of the Hegedus family whose patriarch was the Prime Minister of Hungary during the bloody Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The documentary's creator and Hegedus's grandson, Peter, travels back to Hungary to determine whether his grandfather is really the man responsible for the deaths of those killed in the revolution. The documentary acts as Peter's personal diary with entries including interviews with his grandfather and Hungarians who blame Hegedus for the deaths of relatives and friends during the revolution. (Awards: Winner of five international awards including Crystal Heart Award, Grand Prix Award - 22e Festival International du Film Independent and Grand Prix for Best Television Documentary - 14th Parnu International Documentary Festival)."
