        "Sixty seconds is all it takes for professional car thief Maindrian Pace (H.B. Halicki, who also wrote, produced and directed) to steal a car, and he's in the perfect position to fuel his habit - working for an insurance adjustment firm. With a script boasting real life stunt drivers who also happen to be associates of Halicki, this film features a 40 minute Mustang car chase sequence where it is reported that over 93 cars were destroyed. The film received mixed reviews, however it also received a cult following from those amongst the community who like mustangs, car chases, the seventies and a stunt co-ordinator let loose with a film camera."
