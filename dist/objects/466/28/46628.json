        "Made by Irish Television, this is an account of President John F. Kennedy's visit to Ireland in June 1963. It is a straight record of President Kennedy's return to the land of his forefathers - we see the welcoming ceremony, the motorcade through the streets of Dublin, visits to other principal cities and the informal visit to the family home."
