        "Episode number 5 of Series \"World in action\". In 1964 a team from Granada Television set out to test the following theory - are children's lives already mapped out for them by the age of seven? This was the start of a remarkable series which documents groups of children from childhood through puberty to adulthood. Of the original 14 subjects, 11 remain. Now halfway through their lives, how close are they to realising their dreams and ambitions? This enthralling film also starts asking grander questions common to all humans - what is love, what is character, what is success?"
