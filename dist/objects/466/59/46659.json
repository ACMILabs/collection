        "A four-part television documentary presented by Rolf Harris, with accompanying book, about the life and journeys of Captain William Bligh. Captain of the ill-fated Bounty, Bligh was also a navigator, surveyor and explorer. The series covers the story of Captain Bligh from his birth to his death, and follows his voyages from England through the Canary Islands, the Caribbean and Canada to the South Pacific. The 112 page book 'Mutiny on the Bounty' presents an in-depth historical survey of the Mutiny, its causes and its consequences through essays, articles and colour illustrations."
