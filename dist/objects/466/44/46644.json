        "Michael Chambers (Peter Gallagher) is a gambling addict who returns to his Texas home town to celebrate his mother's re-marriage. The past is quick to catch up with him in the shape of his jealous brother and Rachel (Alison Elliott), a former girlfriend now married to the local 'big man', Tommy. Michael and Rachel rekindle their affair and soon plot to elope with the proceeds from a bank robbery. For the plan to succeed, Michael needs to involve his father-in-law to be and Susan, the bank manager who happens to be a former fling. Marking Soderbergh's re-emergence following the early success of 'Sex, lies and videotape', 'The Underneath' combines the classic elements of film noir with an added spin on the deceptive nature of modern relationships. Filmmaker Richard Linklater and Shelley Duvall appear briefly in this film. 'The Underneath' is based on the novel 'Criss Cross' by Don Tracy. It is a faithful re-make of the film 'Criss Cross' directed by Robert Sidomak and starring Burt Lancaster (1948). This video is a modified version of the originally filmed in Cinemascope film."
