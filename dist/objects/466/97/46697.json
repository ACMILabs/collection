        "A farcical comedy involving professional gambler Harold (Rip Torn) and cabaret singer Bonita (Bette Midler) who spend their time moving from state to state in pursuit of Willie (Ken Wahl), a jinxed croupier who earns them a number of small fortunes. When Bonita and Harold meet and fall in love, the stakes change and a plot to murder Harold ensues. The plot unravels when Harold accidently dies. One is left wondering whether it is Bonita who is really jinxed?"
