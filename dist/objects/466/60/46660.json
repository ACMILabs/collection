        "An account of the construction, in Algonquin Park, Ontario, of a radiotelescope designed by Canada's National Research Council. Working simultaneously with the telescope of the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory at Penticton, British Columbia, it was used to measure the first arc of a quasar (quasi-stellar radio source) at the outermost fringe of our universe. The success of this probe opened up new possibilities of astronomical enquiry."
