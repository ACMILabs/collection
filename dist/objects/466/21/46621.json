        "Based on the novel of the same name by Jim Harrison, this sweeping period saga of three brothers, their powerful father and a beautiful women loved by them all, is set against lush Montana scenery. The film covers decades in the lives of Alfred (Aidan Quinn), Tristan (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry Thomas) Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins). Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grew up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fiancee, Susannah (Julia Ormond). After Sam's death she attracts the attentions of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart forever."
