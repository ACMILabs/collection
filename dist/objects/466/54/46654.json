        "Episode of Series \"Insight profile\". Novelist and poet Libby Hathorn shares her inspiration and ideas which influence her writing. Life experiences, landscapes and locations are the focal point of her discussion, as she explains how being a writer does not just mean putting words on paper. A good writer is one who can explain an image so that it can become anything once it is published. A poem can become a painting, a novel can become a film. She explains that she sees the writer as the artist, and the reader as the audience."
