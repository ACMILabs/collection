        "Director Victor Fleming's final film features Ingrid Bergman as a vivid and luminous Joan of Arc, the 15th-century French peasant girl who led the French in battle against the invading British and was consequently burned at the stake for heresy. Based on the stage play 'Joan of Lorraine', by Maxwell Anderson. Cast includes Ingrid Bergman, Jose Ferrer, Ward Bond and Francis L. Sullivan."
