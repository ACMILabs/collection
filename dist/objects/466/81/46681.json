        "This film was intended by Chaplin to be a two-reel film, but to his annoyance additional material was added after he left Essanay, the Production Company of the film. It is a parody of two contemporary films based on Bizet's opera, by Cecil B. De Mille (starring Geraldine Ferrar) and Raoul Walsh (starring vamp Theda Bara). Chaplin plays Darn Hosiery (Don Jose), the Corporal of the Guard who is seduced by Carmen (Edna Purviance) so that gypsy smugglers can get their swag through the city gates. His chief rivals for Carmen's affections are Escamillo, the toreador and a fellow soldier of the guard, Leo White."
