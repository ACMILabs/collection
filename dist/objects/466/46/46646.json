        "This tape contains two episodes of the cult TV series, starring Steve McQueen as Josh Randall, the bounty hunter with a heart. In Episode 5 : \"8 Cent reward\", on Christmas Eve a little boy seeks out Josh in a bar to search for a very special man, Santa Claus. Since he doesn't want to disappoint the boy he tries to at least help him in some way - but even the best laid plans can fail. In Episode 6 : \"The Choice\", Jane Koster asks Josh for help - her husband Frank is also a bounty hunter, but he isn't as young or as fast as he used to be. He is trying to settle a score with a dangerous criminal and his wife fears he may be killed, sooner rather than later."
