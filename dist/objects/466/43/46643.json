        "Handsomely staged adaption of Emile Zola's celebrated novel about a Parisian coquette who becomes a music hall star. Fame and fortune bring her little happiness however, as two brothers both vie for her affections, leading to a bitter rivalry that ends in tragedy. Director Dorothy Arzner's only film for Goldwyn also marks the debut of Russian-born actress Anna Sten in Hollywood. Cast also includes Lionel Atwill and Richard Bennett."
