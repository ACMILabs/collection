        "This martial arts action film stars Bruce Lee as Chen Chen, returning to his former school in early 20th Century Shanghai to learn that his beloved teacher has been murdered. While probing the man's death and seeking vengeance, Chen discovers that a drug smuggling operation, a rival school, and simmering racial tensions between Chinese and Japanese locals are factors in the nefarious dealings at his school and in his master's murder. Poorly dubbed into English. Cast includes: Bruce Lee, Robert Baker, Miao Ker Hsiu."
