        "Niccol's debut as a director, a year before he wrote the script for 'The Truman Show', is set in a near-future where the lives of the majority of citizens are determined before birth through genetic engineering of their genes, and the 'natural-born' minority of 'In-Valids' is shunned. Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is one of the latter, who, in order to pursue his goal of travelling into space, assumes the identity of a member of the genetic elite (Jude Law). His cover is threatened when he becomes a suspect in a murder investigation. With a relentless investigator in pursuit and the colleague he has fallen in love with beginning to suspect his deception, his dreams begin to unravel. Cast includes Uma Thurman, Ethan Hawke, Alan Arkin, Jude Law and Ernest Borgnine."
