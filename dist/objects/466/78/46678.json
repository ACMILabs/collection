        "Adapted from the play by Gore Vidal, \"The Left Handed Gun\" is the story of William Bonney, the hotheaded gunslinger known as Billy the Kid. Avoiding the usual Hollywood glamourisation of this controversial character, Paul Newman portrays Billy pretty much as he was: an illiterate, homicidal youth. Treated with kindness for the first time in his life by rancher Tunstall, Billy becomes devoted to the rancher. After Tunstall is killed, however, Billy is prompted to go on a murderous spree avenging the death of his former employer. Cast includes: Paul Newman, James Best, Lita Milan, Hurd Hatfield, and James Congdon."
