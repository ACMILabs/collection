        "With the attack on Peal Harbour in 1942, Prime Minister Curtin announced that Australia faced the gravest hour in her history, with the frightening possibility that war would break out on Australian soil - a fear that appeared proven when Darwin was attacked. Australian war correspondents fearlessly captured the action of Australian troops in the Pacific, and this 70 minute compilation features Movietone News and Cinesound Review of footage from campaigns in the Coral Sea, Kokoda, New Guinea, Finchaven, Burma and Milne Bay."
