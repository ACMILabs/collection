        "Triumph of the will is the official film record of the Sixth Nazi Party Congress (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter-Partei. Reichsparteitag) held at Nuremberg, Germany, September 4 to 10, 1934. It was created by Leni Riefenstahl at the order of Hitler. The purpose of the film was propagandistic, and as propaganda, it is an historical landmark which may never be equalled. It is also a visually beautiful film - showing the supreme pageantry of the Congress and capturing the enthusiasm of the huge crowds (men, women and children of all ages) who took part. This version is rather disjointed owing to the editing of the original version which ran for over two hours. As an example of German filmmaking of the period, it is unequalled. The various parades and ceremonies are shown and many of the leaders of the Party who later became so well known are seen. Hitler is also shown giving some of his speeches which receive a startling reception. German dialogue with some English subtitles."
