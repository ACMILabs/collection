        "The Question that drives us all - What is the Matrix? \"Do you believe in fate?\" \"No, I don't like to know that I am not in control of my life\" \"You feel that something is wrong but you don't know what it is. The world that has been pulled over your eyes, that is to blind you to the Truth. I am offering you \"The Truth\" - nothing more\". These are the questions at the beginning of a film which stretches the imagination, makes you contemplate your own reality and sense of self. Just like Alice in Wonderland following the white rabbit, so too do we follow Neo (Keanu Reeves) to a new and different reality led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Along this path we meet Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Switch, Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), The Oracle (Gloria Foster) and the ubiquitous Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), all who assist/interact with Neo to make sense of the original question - What is The Matrix? No-one can conceive it, no-one can be told what it is. It has to be seen to be understood."
