        "Episode of Series \"International Zone\". Traces the tragic history of the Namibian people from before World War I to the present. Once a German colony, later a mandated territory under the League of Nations, Namibia (South West Africa as it was then called) instead of progressing towards independence has been swallowed up into South Africa in defiance of the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. The South African race system has been applied in the territory, where ninety per cent of the population is black."
