        "This film, made in 1972, shows the life of an Inuit family in the settlement of Pelly Bay inside the Arctic Circle. Under a federal government scheme, permanent heated housing, a school and a store are provided for the community. This film affords a glimpse of the Inuit adaptation to these changed conditions."
