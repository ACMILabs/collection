        "A parable in which two men, neighbours, quarrel about a flower that springs up exactly over the boundary line that divides their gardens. The quarrel grows intensely fierce, each liquidates the other's family and finally each other. The final scene shows their adjoining graves above which the flower grows again. In this film McLaren has used his \"pixillation\" technique in which the principles of animation, normally used to put drawings or puppets into motion, are used to animate the lives of human beings. The film has neither dialogue nor commentary, the visuals being accompanied by synthetic music, drawn directly on the film base, and sound effects."
