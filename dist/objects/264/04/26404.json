        "The story of Albert Namatjira, who once worked as a cook and camel-boy for the landscape painter Rex Batterbee. Namatjira became interested in painting and under Batterbee's tuition, began to use watercolours to reproduce on canvas the Central Australian landscape. This vintage film, made at the height of Namatjira's popularity shows the painter at work and discusses the influence of the environment on his beautiful original landscapes. Rich with illustrations of his work, this film is a tribute to the painter. Original ed. [307974]."
