        "The famous painting of the \"Nativity\" by Piero della Francesca (1416-1492) is in the collection of the National Gallery, London. Sir Philip Hendy talks about the painting which is seen alone, as a whole and in detail, without any other effects. The \"Nativity\" was among della Francesca's last pictures, executed shortly before he gave up painting due to failing eyesight. Its unfinished appearance is due to harsh restoration of a later period. Narrated by Sir Philip Handy."
