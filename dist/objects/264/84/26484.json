        "An example of a German teaching film designed for use at University level. Detailed close-up views of the methods used by the spider show his technique of \"spot welding\" individual strands of the web. Various experiments on destruction of the web show the repair work undertaken by the spider. The film concludes with views of the spider eating the web he has so carefully constructed. Silent film with German subtitles."
