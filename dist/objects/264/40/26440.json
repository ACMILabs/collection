        "An experiment with chimpanzees. One animal is placed in a compartment with a wired cage source of milk, a \"wire mother\", another is placed with a similar wire source of milk but this is covered with a furry material and is known as the \"cloth mother\". Experiments contrast the social behaviour and the amount of affection which grows with each animal and \"mother\". Towards the end a human baby is shown to be attracted to a cloth mother. The University of Wisonsin Department of Psychology, Primate Laboratory with Dr. Harry F. Harlow."
