        "This survey of America's mental health problem reveals the startling fact first brought to light by the Army's draftee examinations namely, that nearly 7,000,000 citizens suffer from some mental disorder. This film shows the facilities of the nation's largest training centre in Topeka, modern therapy and types of treatment for the mentally ill, and the work of the National Association of Mental Health in helping communities to set up Mental Health Clinics."
