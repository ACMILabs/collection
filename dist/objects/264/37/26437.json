        "Documented case from infancy onward. A chain of accidental circumstances provide a unique opportunity to obtain a visualised record of the gradual unfolding of the psychotic process in childhood. Contains material from three excellent sources, a family album of still photographs that tell the change in a series of static steps, a motion picture, filling in the gap between the stills with greater dynamic effect and a detailed and strangely objective diary kept by the mother. Research directed by James Anthony."
