        "Photomicrography investigates single-celled and multi-celled organisms - how they produce or absorb food, convert food to energy, respond to their environments, and reproduce. Simple experiments seen through a standard microscope demonstrate the functions of cell structures; an electron microscope reveals smaller cell structures."
