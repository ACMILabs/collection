        "Colour is explained as mental reactions to varying wave lengths of visible light, and the application of scientific colour principles in the arts, colour printing, and photography, is studied. (Optimum projection conditions are necessary if this film is to be a really useful teaching aid, as it relies very largely on the fact that it is a colour film to make its thesis clear.)"
