        "This programme concentrates very largely on the propagandist character of film materials; there is much less scope than in some of the other programmes for the study of film as \"unwitting testimony\". These political messages of the Nazi regime were put in the newsreels and documentary shorts which were a compulsory accompaniment of any feature film show during the war years. The film shows samples of various types of propaganda materials produced."
