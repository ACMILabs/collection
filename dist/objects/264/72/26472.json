        "The decision of the English colonists in the seventeenth century to use Africans as slaves would eventually challenge the most fundamental tenets of American life. This film analyses the institution of slavery, shows how it came to divide the nation, and how it helped to create some of the tensions that exploded in to the Civil War."
