        "Young people from 110 different schools in Britain, take part in the annual National Youth Theatre production. Established in 1956, it has formed 85 other youth theatres all over Britain. Its aim is to help young people enjoy the theatre by participating in it and finding out what goes into making a play and its production. Shows rehearsals leading up to a full scale production of \"Coriolanus\" in the West End theatre. Some lovely footage of London in 1965."
