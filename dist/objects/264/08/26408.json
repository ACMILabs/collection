        "A dramatization about a nine-year-old girl Missy who is persuaded by her peers to throw a stone at an old lady. She later discovers that the old lady is dying and a personal awareness of having done an unloving act weighs heavily upon her. Her mother's loving response to her torment and instinctive gestures of consolation even as she lets Missy know the seriousness of her action, frees Missy and she finds her own special way to express her sorrow. The dramatic tension traces the dynamics of the sacrament of Penance, as Missy experiences sorrow, guilt and the peace that comes with forgiveness."
