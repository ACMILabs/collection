        "Discusses the impact of the theory of evolution, emphasizing the concept of nautral selection. Shows how studies by biologists carried out on moths, mosquitioes and plants provide evidence of natural selection. Reports on three experiments concerning the role of natural selection in evolution: a study in bird predation as a factor in the survival of variant species of moths at Oxford University; a study of natural selection among plant populations at Carnegie Institute; and a study of the resistance of mosquitoes to modern insecticides at the University of Western Ontario."
