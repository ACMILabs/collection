        "The film deals with eight identical production lines in a factory each doing the same work using the same machinery employing the same number of workers and each receiving the same flow of materials. Theoretically each production line should produce at the same rate but this does not prove to be the case. The film endeavours to find the correct solution by tracing from the managing director's office right through to the works for the cause of this unequal production."
