        "Flowers and their place in Japanese life, art, customs and tradition. A love of flowers is taught from earliest childhood and influences much of Japanese culture: in landscape gardening, growing \"bonsai\" plants, the \"ikebana\" style of arranging flowers, in works of art, in designs for the kimono. Different blossoms mark the rhythm of the seasons in the parks and gardens of Japan."
