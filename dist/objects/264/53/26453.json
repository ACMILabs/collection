        "This film describes the water cycle as Nature's plan for providing all living things with life-giving water. Describes how water form the ocean is drawn into the air by evaporation, formed into clouds, condensed to water, delivered to the earth and returned to the ocean. Natural and time-lapse photography combine with animated drawings to clarify the mechanics of the water cycle and to describe and contrast various water cycle patterns in North America."
