        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Why we fight\". This unnerving film examines the growth of Hitler's Nazi Party, which became mankind's single most destructive force. Includes Hitler's closest aides and key figures, the denouncing of all religious belief as weak and petty, and the atrocities which promised German world domination. Concludes with the invasions of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland. This film was originally intended for the orientation of members of the armed forces during the war. Narrated by Walter Huston and Captain Anthony Veiller. Editing, Major William Hornbeck. Music, Dimitri Tiomkin."
