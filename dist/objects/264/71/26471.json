        "A portrayal of families whose children have come under the protection of community authorities as a result of abuse or neglect. It demonstrates that skilled techniques can change patterns of dangerous and unhealthy family relationships and help unstable human beings achieve acceptable standards of parenthood. The operation of the Child Protective Services is shown, stressing the relationship between supervisor and caseworker. It throws light on the subtle and complex aspects of poverty and shows how these characteristics contribute to the poverty cycle. Points a possible way to break this vicious cycle through the rehabilitation of families."
