        "Produced with the assistance of the Australian Womens Archival Project, Women's Program of the Australian Film Commission, the interview filmed over two days in September 1988 when Monte Punshon was nearly 106 years old. The retired teacher of Japanese talks about her life and philosophy. She lived through two World Wars and two sightings of Hailey's Comet. She was born in 1882 and died in 1989 at the age of 106. Monte squeezed several lifetimes into one, working as a governess, radio announcer, detention camp commander and author. She had a sixty year association with Japan, including being awarded one of Japan's highest honours. A biographical guide to her life is included inside the video cover."
