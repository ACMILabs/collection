        "Episode of Series \"Videos on Australian Writers: archival writers series II\". Poet, journalist, author and academic, Dorothy Green speaks of her early childhood in England. She recalls the atmosphere of Sydney University in the 1930's and her early success as a poet which led to a career in journalism. Green worked as a teacher and university lecturer in 1972, a grant enabled her to devote herself to writing. Green reads and discusses several of her poems and speaks of her spiritual beliefs and attitudes towards death. Interviewed by James Murdoch."
