        "This opera, sung in Italian, was written by Claudio Monteverdi under the commission of the Duke of Mantua, who wanted the legend of Orfeo, revived in the previous century, set to music. Monteverdi combines dramatic tension, eloquent expression of human passions and formal variety in his setting of Alessandro Stiggio's libretto. The direction, staging and design is by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle. Features singers Pillippe Huttenlocher (Orfeo), Dietlinde Turban (Euridice), Trudeliese Schmidt (Musica/Speranza), Roland Hermann (Apollo), Glenys Linos (Proserpina), Werner Groschel (Plutone), Hans Franzen (Caronte), Suzanne Calabro (Ninfa) and the Monteverdi Ensemble of the Zurich Opera House conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. No English subtitles."
