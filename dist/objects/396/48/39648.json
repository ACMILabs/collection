        "Starring Kolos Kovats as Bluebeard and Sylvia Sass as Judith, with Sir Georg Solti conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, \"Bluebeard's Castle\" is a parable on trust and communication. Bluebeard brings his new wife into the hall of his castle. Despite the gloominess and the rumours she has heard about the disappearance of his previous wives, Judith has chosen to join her husband. She discovers seven large doors and asks why they are bolted. Bluebeard replies that no-one is to see what is behind them. Judith manages to get into the first door and sees that it is a torture chamber. Behind the second door is an armoury, the third, a treasury and the fourth, a secret garden. Behind the sixth door, Judith sees still water, she asks what it is and Bluebeard tells her that it is tears. The seventh door reveals Bluebeard's former wives and in silence, they step forward. Bluebeard introduces them to Judith. The first he found in the morning, the second he found at noon and the third, he found in the evening. Judith is the wife he found at midnight. He proceeds to weigh her down with a cloak and jewels and now she must join all the other wives. As she does so, Bluebeard returns to the hall alone and in darkness. Opera in one act by Bela Balazs and music by Bela Bartok."
