        "Steam trains predominate in this unique and exciting video which features rare archival footage together with more recent material. Amongst the railway lines appearing are Little Kimble, Marlow, Colnbrook and Epping. A4's and A2's feature on the Kings Cross line, N2's appear on suburban trains to Moorgate. Class 76 Electrics are shown on the Woodhead Line and in action in Holland for the last time in 1986. Witness the re-opening of the Isle of Man Steam Railway and the Kingsmoor Depot near Carlisle in 1966 which featured many steam trains."
