        "The ABC and the Australian Ballet Foundation present the Australian Ballet in a production of this ancient tale. With scenario, choreography and production by Laszlo Seregi,and directed by Lindesay Dresdon, the ballet shows episodes from an uprising of slaves in Ancient Rome. The dramatic effects of this action are played out by: Apartacus, leader of the revolt; his wife Flavia; and Crassus, commander of the Roman army. Music by Aram Khachaturian, performed by the State Orchestra of Victoria and conducted by Ormsby Wilkins. This magnificent production features the talented duo of Steven Heathcote and Lisa Pavane."
