        "John Le Carre's character Smiley is bought to life by Sir Alec Guinness in this acclaimed dramatisation. Compulsive viewing to the end, Smiley is called out of retirement to the aid of the Circus. He returns with a vengeance. The assassination of an emigre Soviet and British agent, General Vladimir, sends Smiley delving into the past on a twisted trail across Europe that moves inexorably towards a final showdown with his old adversary and arch-enemy, Karla - leader of Moscow centre."
