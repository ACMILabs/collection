        "Episode of Series \"Videos on Australian Writers: archival writers series II\". As a founder of the \"Angry Penguins\", Max Harris was at the forefront of the modernist movement in Australian poetry. He recalls the ferment in the artistic community as writers, painters and musicians struggled to find an authentic Australian voice and the uproar surrounding the Ern Malley controversy. Harris remembers his friendship with Sydney Nolan and the journey they made together which inspired the artist to paint his Ned Kelly series. A poet, author, publisher and social commentator, Max Harris gives a unique overview of a vital period in Australian cultural history."
