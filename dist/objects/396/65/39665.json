        "From the team who created the award-winning 'Police State' and 'Police Crop' comes the gripping story of the jury deliberations which followed the 1991 trial of former Queensland Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. On trial for perjury, Sir Joh, the man responsible for shaping the cultural ethos of Australia's 'Deep North', would now be judged by his peers. Based on extensive research, 'Joh's Jury' is about twelve ordinary people struggling to come to a unamimous decision on a case which was bound to end in controversy. It is a dramatic interpretation of real events using Court transcripts and interviews with key participants in the trial of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, including members of the jury. Stars Gerry Connolly as Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Penny Cook, Noah Taylor, John Jarratt Norman Yemm and John Clayton."
