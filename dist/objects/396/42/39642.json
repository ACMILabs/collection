        "Hilarious performances from the great radio superstars who were household names before the advent of television. Director Bruce Leonard has used his encyclopaedic knowledge of radio history to create a fascinating look at the world of adventure and romance serials and the comedy and music programmes which are a part of everyday Australian's entertainment heritage. Packed with great gags and stories which have never been seen on video before, the programme reveals some wonderful gems from the likes of Jack Davey, Bob Dyer, Willie Fennell, Mo, Ada and Elsie, Smoky Dawson, Hop Harrigan and many more."
