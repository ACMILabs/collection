        "Episode of Series \"Cricketing legends\". Richie Benaud and Jim Laker examine the cricketing achievements of one of the greatest all-rounders - Ian Botham. A controversial and colourful figure both on and off the field, Botham was a talented player who took some unbelievable catches in the slips and at the time of this programs' production, was the only cricketer to score 5000 runs and take 300 wickets in Test Matches. Botham played for England and for the counties of Somerset and Worcestershire, making his debut in first-class cricket in the 1977 winning Ashes series. The highlights of Botham's career are interspersed with an interview between Botham and Benaud."
