        "Filmed in 1967 at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, Puccini's opera is performed here with Mirella Freni (Mimi) and the chorus and orchestra of the Teatro alla Scala. It is set in the students' quarter of Paris, where gaiety and pathos rub elbows. The opera is seen to laugh as well as weep. It achieves balance between the gay and the pathetic, the realistic and the impressionistic, due to its solid theatrical foundations. Designed and directed by Franco Zeffirelli."
