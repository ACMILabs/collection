        "Norma, the opera by Bellini, libretto by Felice Romani, based on a drama by Alexandre Soumet and directed by Sandro Sequi, is set in Gaul during the Roman occupation about 50 BC. Norma, the Druid High priestess, sung by Dame Joan Sutherland, breaks her vows of chastity with the Roman Pollione, sung by Ron Stevens. In a tangled tale of love and tragedy, the two lovers pay the ultimate sacrifice for their love and die together. Features singers Clifford Grant (Oroveso), Trevor Brown (Flavio), Margreta Elkins (Adalgisa), Etela Piha (Clotilde), and The Australian Opera Chorus. Also features The Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra conducted by Richard Bonynge. Recorded at the Sydney Opera House on 1 August 1978 and produced for television in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Restored and released in 1991 by The Australian Opera. Sung in Italian with English subtitles."
