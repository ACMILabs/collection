        "Everyone has a favourite moment from the many films of Peter Sellers. Reacall many moments from the classic Pink Panther films, where Sellers protrays his most celebrated character - that of the incompetent Inspector Clouseau. See rare footage and Goon-like antics with Spike Milligan. All these moments and many more, captured in almost one-hour of non-stop entertainment, showing the screen's finest clown at his most brilliant and comic best."
