        "A video adaptation of Guiseppi Verdi's operatic interpretation of Shakespeare's Macbeth is a melodramatic libretto in four acts starring Leo Nucci as the ill-fated Macbeth, Shirley Verrett as the opportunistic Lady Macbeth and Veriano Luchetti as the voice of the nobleman Macduff and Samuel Ramey as the voice of Banco, a general of King Duncan's Army. The orchestra, Coro del Teatro Comunale di Bologna is conducted by Riccardo Chailly. Filmed on location at the fortified castle of Godefry De Bouillon in the Ardennes, Belgium, this dark and moody version of the classic tale of greed and ambition, cuts straight to the core of the story."
