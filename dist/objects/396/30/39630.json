        "This is a story of Nomes. Nomes are four inches high and they crashed to Earth 15,000 years ago. To them, a year lasts as long as ten human years, so in their eyes, humans move in slow motion, their voices booming like the mooing of monster cows. As generations of Nomes come and go, the countryside in which they settle becomes full of dangerous motorways where the Nomes are forced to scavenge in bins for food. Fearing extinction, ten Nomes, led by newcomer Masklin, escape in the back of a lorry, taking with them a mysterios black box called \"The Thing.\" Based on the very successful novel by author Terry Pratchett."
