        "It is August 1939, and Helena and Richard Cuthbertson with their young niece, Sophy, are preparing for the annual visit to Cornwall, where they meet with Richard's other nephews and nieces - Oliver, Calypso, Polly and Walter. Sophy is resented by her aunt and has little in common with her invalid uncle, who lost a leg in the trenches. The cousins plan to run the 'terror run' - a fearless night-time dash along the cliff path. Helena and Richard invite Max and Monika Erstweiler - Austrian refugees to the ritual dinner before the 'terror run'. Max is a renowned classical violinist, and he and Monika believe their only son is now in a concentration camp. The night is brought abruptly to an end by news from Polly and Walter's father that the hospital where he is a surgeon is about to be evacuated. War must be imminent... Based on the novel by Mary Wesley. Stars Felicity Kendal and Paul Eddington."
