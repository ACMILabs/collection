        "Gaetano Donizetti's opera \"Lucrezia Borgia\", based on the play by Victor Hugo, is a story of love and intrigue set in 16th Century Italy. A young man, Gennaro, meets the despised Lucrezia Borgia (Joan Sutherland) and is attracted to her. Lucrezia's husband, Alfonso, is jealous and plots his revenge on Gennaro. Just before he dies from poisoning, Lucrezia tells Gennaro that she is his mother. She too drinks poison and dies with him. A superb performance by the Australian Opera, directed by George Ogilvie and conducted by Richard Bonynge, and featuring the wonderfully rich voice of Joan Sutherland - this is a must for opera fans. Recorded live at the Sydney Opera House on July 8, 1977 and sung in Italian."
