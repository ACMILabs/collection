        "Bette Davis delivered a superlative performance as a neurotic spinster fighting to free herself from the shackles of a tyrannical mother. Pushed into a nervous breakdown, the dowdy Davis is cured by a psychiatrist (Claude Rains) and emerges as a poised and beautiful woman - only to be trapped in a doomed romance with a married man. Also stars Paul Henreid. Based on the novel by Olive Higgins Pronty."
