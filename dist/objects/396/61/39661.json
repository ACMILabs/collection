        "Sung in Italian with English subtitles, this opera combines comedy and tragedy to produce the story of Don Giovanni. The central character of Giovanni is the anti-hero, a brilliant, irresponsible villain, an amourous libertine who receives his comeupances by refusing to repent. Performers on the tape include Lisa Gasteen, Gilli Sullivan, Fiona Janes and David Hobson. The performance was part of an Esso night at the opera,recorded live at the Sydney Opera House, January 1991 and was directed by Lindy Hume. Featuring the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra, conducted by Gyorgy Fischer, this performance was based on the production by Goran Jarvefelt."
