        "The Western Front 1917: Captain Blackadder, finds himself crammed into a trench, only twenty yards from heavily armed people who want to kill him. Worse still, his brother officer Lieutenant George (Hugh Laurie) is a man whose family brain cell is gathering dust in a pawn shop in Dunstable, and Baldrick (Tony Robinson) is in charge of the cooking! \"Captain Cook\": When General Haigh unveils his new strategy to conquer the fearful hun, Blackadder volunteers to be Official War Artist. \"Corporal punishment\": As orders for Operation Insanity reach Blackadder, he breaches regulations by eating the messenger. Can the Flanders Pigeon Murderer avoid the firing squad? \"Major Star\" finds the great cynical one faced with even greater problems as the Russian Revolution produces two more appalling results: an offensive by Germany and a really offensive Charlie Chaplin impersonation by Baldrick. Guest stars Gabrielle Glaister as Driver Bob Parkhurst, the world's worst female impersonator."
