        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Understanding maternal grief\". It is difficult to imagine the full impact of neonatal death on those women who are mothers for the shortest time. This video discusses the effects of the death of a baby on women's mental and physical health. The grief process is viewed within the context of a wide range of stresses experienced by a woman and her fanily during this major life crisis including the impact of a premature birth: the stresses associated with having a seriously ill baby in neonatal intensive care: the difficulties in decision-making related to medical interventions: the consideration of siblings and their inclusion in the bonding and grief experiences."
