        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". Enter the world of the Dwarf Mongoose, one of Africa's most appealing and fascinating creatures. Living in a highly organised and sophisticated society, every group of between 12 and 14 members is a single extended family run by one female. Seeking a safe retreat from their many deadly predators, such as hawks and cobras, the Dwarf Mongoose make their home in termite mounds, communicating with each other through a series of distinct calls. Each member of the family has a job; only the leader has young and subordinate females act as babysitters; whilst others forage for food; every member takes turns at being a lookout for predators; and all join in to confront predators with great skill and courage, and lightning speed which has to be seen to be believed."
