        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Understanding maternal grief\". Infertility is perhaps the most unacknowledged and painful grief in our society - truly the death of a dream. While addressing major psychological issues encountered by infertile women, this programme also discuuses the option of medical intervention by outlining the benefits, the additional stress it can cause and the impact on relationships."
