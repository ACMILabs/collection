        "The Zig Zag Railway is regarded as an engineering marvel and a mecca to students of engineering the world over. This fascinating video follows the Zig Zag's colourful history from its early days in the great commercial steam era, to its closure in 1910 and through to its restoration as a tourist railway in 1975. This program uses the Zig Zag Railway as a working model to bring to life the romance adventure and style of the Great Australian Steam Era. Highlights include: complete stereo soundtrack, breathtaking footage shot entirely on 16mm film and loads of steam trains to see and hear!"
