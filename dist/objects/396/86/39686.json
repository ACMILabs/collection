        "Episode of Series \"Videos on Australian Writers: archival writers series II\". Author and historian Manning Clark recalls the events of his early childhood, the attitudes of his family and how they influenced his writing. He speaks at length about the process of researching and writing his multi- volume History of Australia and how his outlook changed over the years of writing it. He speaks candidly about the public reaction to his work and addresses his critics. Interviewed by James Murdoch during Australia's bicentennial year, 1988, Clark reflects on the past and expresses his hopes for the future of Australian society."
