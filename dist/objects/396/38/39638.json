        "Ranging from the early 30's to the late 80's, this video utilises archival film to re-create the golden days of railway. In this volume Southern Railway trains are shown on their way to the seaside, Carlisle Station appears with electric locos followed by a collection of steam locos in 1966. Visit the Longmoor Military System in 1968, the Swindon Works in the 30's followed by a visit in 1975 during the diesel- hydraulic era and a final visit in 1987. Witness the 150th Anniversary of the Festinog in 1986 capturing a gravity slate train in action and the 150th Anniversary of the London and Greenwich Railway in the same year. Also included is the famous Flying Scotsman from Kings Cross in 1968 and its USA trip."
