        "Imagine being able to experience the world through animal senses, to go on a unique journey into the heart of the animal kingdom. Using recently pioneered breakthroughs in filming and special effects photography, that journey is now made possible. This cassette contains three episodes: \"Super scents\": Smell - it is the territorial signal of gazelles, the alarm system of impalas, the aphrodisiac of moths and salamandas. Stil more astounding, it is the sense that guides the salmon back to its birthplace where it travels to spawn and die. \"Sense of timing\": A shrew lives its life thiry times faster than an elephant, the body clocks of marine animals measure tidal cycles... this innovative program reveals, as if by magic, the different time worlds in which creatures live. \"Making sense\": Draws together the threads of the series and shows how the mind influences an animal's view of the world."
