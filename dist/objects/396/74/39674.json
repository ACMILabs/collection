        "Episode of Series \"Australian women's archival Series\". Born in 1904, working class politics surrounded Edna Ryan as she grew up in New South Wales. As a young adult she worked for the newly formed Communist Party until she was expelled. As a socialist in wartime she eventually found a new home in the Australian Labor Party. As a feminist, she became active in the industrial courts, in 1958 she became the first woman Deputy Mayor of NSW and played a significant role in 1974 in the fight for equal pay for women."
