        "Olive Cotton who began her career in the 1920's is one of Australia's most accomplished photographers. Her bold images, often associated with the \"modernist\" paintings and photographs of the 1930's and '40's, strike a strong chord with contemporary interests. Unlike many other female photographers of the period, Cotton did not restrict her work to portraiture but tackled a wide range of commercial subjects. This archival interview provides a unique look at the artist and her opinions of her work."
