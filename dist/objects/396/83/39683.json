        "Episode of Series \"Videos on Australian Writers: archival writers series II\". Researched and interviewed by James Murdoch, author Olaf Ruhen recalls a life travelling throughout Australia and the South Pacific gathering materials for his books. He speaks of his love of the sea and his affinity with the Tongan people. Ruhen recalls his friendship with the painter, Albert Namatjira. A visit to a writers' conference in New York inspired Ruhen to create a forum for Australian authors, the Australian Society of Authors."
