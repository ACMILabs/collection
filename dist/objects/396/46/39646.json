        "This is an opera based on the Henry James story \"Turn of the screw\" written by Benjamin Britten. Performed by the Royal Opera at Covent Garden, it features Magdalena Vasaryova, Juraj Kukura and Dana Medricka. The story revolves around a governess who looks after two orphaned children in the country on the proviso that she would never write to their young guardian, their uncle."
