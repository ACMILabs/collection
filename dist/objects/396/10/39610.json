'Cherry Pie' - Nipper, Aku, Paul and Poss visit Grandma's and Grandpa's farm. They go on a treasure hunt and are treated to Grandpa's cherry pie. 'Aku and the Dinosaur' - Aku pretends to be a dinosaur, but she upsets her friends when she goes too far. 'EC belongs to everybody' - Nipper locks EC away and won't let Aku play with the doll. But when he finds out that he's left out of everything, he shares EC again. 'Aliens above' - When Aku and Nipper hear strange noises from upstairs, they decide an alien lives there. The older kids don't believe it, so the two of them go to find out the truth."
