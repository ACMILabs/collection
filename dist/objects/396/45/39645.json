        "Sidney Reilly, said to have been the inspiration for James Bond, was probably the greatest spy the world has ever known. A rogue, womaniser, and brilliant tactician, he thrived on danger, performing extraordinary feats that changed the course of history. Reilly's first mission involves undertaking a dangerous journey to Baku to investigate the Russian search for oil in the Middle East. Stars Sam Neill and Leo McKern."
