        "A magnificent production by the Bayreuther Festspiele, under the direction of Daniel Barenboim and Jean-Pierre Ponnelle. Tristan, sung by Rene Kollo, and Isolde by Johanna Meier tells the tale of two fated lovers who are caught up in a web of intrigue. Ultimately the fulfillment of their love comes through death and transfiguration."
