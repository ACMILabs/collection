        "Recorded live at the Sydney Opera House, March 2, 1989 this operetta by Gilbert and Sullivan is considered one of the best Savoy Operas. Marco and Giuseppe Palmien are two Venetian gondoliers, one of whom is also the rightful King of Barataria, since no-one knows which of them is the rightful King, they both have a chance to put their republican principles into practice by sharing the throne. But it is then revealed that in fact neither of them is truly the king. This operetta satirises republican principles and the libretto has been modified to contain present-day references. Performed by The Australian Opera Chorus and The Elizabethan Philharmonic Orchestra. Performers include: Stephen Bennett, Jeffrey Black, Gillian Sullivan, Donald Shanks, David Hobson. The Australian Opera Chorus conducted by Gyorgy Fischer. Recorded as part of Esso night at the opera."
