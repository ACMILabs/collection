        "The history of Victoria's steam trains runs parallel to the history of the state itself. As the railway tracks made their way into the countryside, the state began to develop. Steam locomotives puffing their way into country towns were the life blood of the state, bringing in supplies and visitors and taking away produce and goods. Today the steam locomotives have been replaced. Many were left to rust and decay but a number of them have been restored by dedicated groups of volunteers, determined to preserve this exciting part of our heritage. Steam trains are alive again in Victoria and this magnificent videotape is a tribute to those groups who have kept the locomotives on the tracks to give pleasure to those who love steam travel. You can enjoy the thrill of the journey, the heat of the firebox and the shrill of the whistle as you watch \"Steam Alive in Victoria\"."
