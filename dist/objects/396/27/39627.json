        "Episode of Series \"Cricketing legends\". One of cricket's greatest bowlers, with his thick moustache and bristling aggression, Dennis Lillee was both brilliant and charismatic. His new ball partnership with Jeff Thomson was, perhaps, the most feared in the modern game. Courageous, controversial, and always determined, Lillee overcame serious injury to complete a very distinguished career. This program includes a contribution from Rod Marsh who caught 95 catches from Lillee's bowling."
