        "With anarchists lurking, Blackadder suggests Prince George make a sympathetic speech towards the proletariat. They hire two actors to help with public speaking, until Baldrick uncovers what appears to be a plot to murder the Prince. It is really a combination of \"Sense and Senility\" as Blackadder tries to win the day. Broke as usual, Prince George must supplement his income by marrying a wealthy woman. In \"Amy and amiability\" he tries to do just that, however it is Blackadder's attempt at becoming a highwayman which reaps monetry rewards. When Prince George is not engaged in illicit liasons with the Duke of Wellington's neices, he is being challenged to a duel by the same gentleman. Blackadder, taking advantage of his look-alike cousin McAdder, \"the most dangerous man to wear a skirt in Europe\", offers to take the Prince's place."
