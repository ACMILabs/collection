        "Two of the leading figures in opera today, Placido Domingo and Julia Migenes-Johnson, star in this sumptious and true interpretation of Bizet's carmen. The ingredients of this romantic opera are a film-maker's dream: a torrid love story, a tempestuous score, set against a backdrop of glorious Spanish sunshine. Added to this production is the authenticity of Andalusian dance."
