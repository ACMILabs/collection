        "Three more ripping yarns from the fertile minds of ex-Monty Python members Michael Palin and Terry Jones. \"The Testing of Eric Olthwaite\" is a ripping Northern yarn set in the dark days of the depression, before the Last of the Summer Wine started bringing jobs to the area. Eric's tough mining parents find their son so boring that they run away from home. Eric, torn between love for his parents and lack of brain cells, becomes involved with a hardened criminal. The rest is history. \"Winfrey's last case\" tells the story of the dashing, debonaire Gerald Winfrey who saves his country twice a week. A knockabout tale of international intrigue. \"The Curse of the claw\" is a gothic yarn of fear, tragedy and terror. It is a timely reminder of what happens when men dabble in the dark world of oriental superstition."
