        "Mary McDonnell is May-Alice, star of a popular day-time soap, who was on her way to a leg waxing session when she was knocked down by a mad taxi-driver. Now confined to a wheelchair, she has only one option left - to return to the Bayou she so defiantly left as a sassy teen. Hiding out in the house of her long dead parents, May-Alice becomes the patient from hell, terrorising a series of nurses and driving each and every one of them from the house. Then Chantelle, a no-nonsense nurse from Chicago, arrives. Chantelle couldn't be more different than May-Alice and it seems she too will be given her marching orders. Then, unexpectedly, differences are put aside, secrets emerge, old friends drift into their lives and each finds an unlikely romance as they give themselves up to the forces of fate and friendship. Brilliant performances by the cast make this film a rewarding and worthwhile experience."
