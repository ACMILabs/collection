        "Episode of Series \"Videos on Australian Writers: archival writers series II\". Jack Lindsay speaks about his relationship with his father, Norman Lindsay, and their shared interest in the classical world. He recalls the cultural life of Sydney in the 1920s and his memories of writers Kenneth Slessor, Christopher Brennan and Henry Lawson. Lindsay left Australia in 1926 and remained in England for the rest of his life. A poet, novelist, translator, historian, critic and biographer, Lindsay discusses the influence of political thought on his writing and his involvement in the anti-Facist Union of Poets and the Authors' World Peace Appeal. He remembers his friendships with fellow poets Dylan Thomas, Edith Sitwell, Aragon, Tristan Tzara and Paul Eluard."
