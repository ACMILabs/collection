        "This spectacular and elegant documentary series, written and presented by Bamber Gascoigne, tells the dramatic story of the rise and fall of the Moghul Empire. Filmed in some of the most beautiful locations in the world it features an astonishing dynasty. Over six generations, father to son, they captured, consolidated, profoundly influenced and then lost control of the vast sub-continent of India. The discovery of the six great Moghuls as individuals, together with their fantastic achievements will come as a revelation. While the storyline is more akin to \"Dynasty\", the visual treats are in the league of the legendary television arts series \"Civilisation\"."
