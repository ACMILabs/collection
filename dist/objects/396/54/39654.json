        "This version of George and Ira Gershwin's folk opera in three acts, has music by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Simon Rattle, and is based on the original Glyndebourne Festival Opera stage production. The story is based on the novel by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, this is the story of an ill-fated love affair between two strong-willed African-Americans in the deep south of America in the early 1900s. Willard White shines as Porgy and Cynthia Haymon is brilliant as the headstrong Bess. Damon Evans gives a wonderful performance as Sportin' life."
