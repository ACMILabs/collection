        "Imagine being able to experience the world through animal senses, to go on a unique journey into the heart of the animal kingdom. Using recently pioneered breakthroughs in filming and special effects photography, the journey is now made possible. Three episodes on this one cassette. \"Sixth sense\": Animals showing special powers have often been regarded as 'supernatural' but this film reveals that creatures which possess a sixth sense are very much a part of the natural world. \"Seeing sense\": Vision may be man's best sense, but four-eyed fish which see above and below water simultaneously teach us that our sight is not the most sophisticated. \"Sound sense\": Until now, we have been unable to hear the high-pitched squeaks of mice or the low-frequency calls whales use to communicate across hundreds of miles of sea. This episode opens our ears to a whole register of sounds. A natural landmark in natural history filming, this video is an extraordinary viewing experience."
