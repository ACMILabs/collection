        "Glenn Close narrates Hans Christian Andersen's story of the Chinese emperor who discovers that the song of a free nightingale, is more beautiful and more valuable by far, than the finest and cleverest, bejewelled mechanical singing bird. The exquisite illustrations are by Robert Van Nutt and the evocative music is by Mark Isham."
