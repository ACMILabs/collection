        "Episode of Series \"Australian women's archival Series\". An archival interview in which Patsy tells of her childhood, the inspirations for her books, her philosophy on oral history, her working methods, the adventure of her life at sea and her thoughts on love, children and marriage. Most of her books focus on the lives of 'ordinary' Australian working people, uncovering the unique history, folklore and lifestyle - the 'real' history of Australia, often lost in the overview of traditional history. Tagged as an 'unconventional woman', Patsy ignored the social rules of her day, and blithely worked in, sought out and wrote about the worlds in which women traditionally had no place."
