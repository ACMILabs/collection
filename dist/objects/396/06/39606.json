        "How do we appear to the animals who share our lives? From the two million dustmites that inhabit our beds every night to the macaque monkey picking 800 coconuts a day - animals are an integral part of human life. As well as providing companionship and food, they live on our bodies and influence the climate and the very air we breathe. But what do they see? What is the influence of our actions on their behaviour? This unique six-part BBC TV series provides the answers using innovative film and video techniques to truly show how our lives appear through animal eyes. Part 1 contains three episodes - \"Home life\", \"Seeds of life\" and \"Partners for life\". Narrated by Andrew Sachs."
