        "Episode of Series \"Videos on Australian Writers: archival writers series II\". John Morrison remembers his childhood in Sunderland, England, and how his ambition to write and travel brought him to Australia. A basic wage earner all his life, Morrison wrote prolifically in his spare time and used his work experiences in the bush, as a council worker and on the Melbourne waterfront, as background for his stories. He recalls his association with the trade union press and the Communist Review. A member of Realist Writers, he speaks of his friendship with Frank Davidson and Alan Marshall."
