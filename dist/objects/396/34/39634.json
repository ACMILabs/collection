        "Michael Palin, confessed train buff, introduces unique footage from the BBC archive: Branchline Railway and two historic newsreel sequences - a splendid requiem for the steam railway. \"Branchline Railway\": the late Sir John Betjeman presents this little known film which perfectly captures the atmosphere of a 24 mile stretch of the now vanished Somerset and Dorset railway. It celebrates a working, living railway, complete with dirty locomotives, clean stations decked with flowers, and austere gas-lit waiting rooms. It all belongs to a vanished age but the film remains to delight and inform (broadcast 1963). \"Britannia under her own steam\" looks at the naming of the first magnificent Class 7 4-6-2 Standard locomotives 'Britannia' (broadcast 1951). \"Atlantic Coast Express\" is a footplate journey on Merchant Navy Class No. 35016 'Elder Fyffe' as it heads the 'Atlantic Coast Express' (broadcast 1960)."
