        "Dramatised for television by Arthur Hopcraft, this acclaimed adaptation of John Le Carre's gripping novel of international espionage and betrayal stars Sir Alec Guinness in a superb portrayal of George Smiley, retired spymaster of the Circus - Britain's spy control. He left the Circus in a storm of controversy with some saying he was sacked after the Czech scandal and others saying he is in innocent retirement. However, all agree nobody leaves the Circus without some unfinished business. Brought in to trace an infiltrator in the Department where he was once the prize employee, the self-effacing master of espionage resolutely moves in to spy on the spies and finds himself going over very old ground. This film is part of the Le Carre Trilogy. The other parts are \"Smiley's people\" and \"A Perfect spy\"."
