        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Understanding maternal grief\". Miscarriage, although not uncommon, is a cause of deep grief and shock among women who have experienced it. With stillbirth, the grief often runs deeper for those women who are already mothers. In this video woman is interviewed who has experienced miscarriages and a stillbirth. Through her story we are able to understand more clearly the psychological needs of bereaved women and the resultant impact on women's health when these are not met."
