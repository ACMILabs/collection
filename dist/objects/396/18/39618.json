        "Three exceptionally ripping yarns starring Michael Palin whose enormous acting talents are captured in a variety of remarkable comic characters. \"Tomkinson's schooldays\" is set in the Edwardian era, the heyday of school stories and it has lashings of adventure, excitement and bullies. \"Escape from Stalag Luft 112B\" is a tale of valour behind the enemy lines in the Kaiser's Germany. In \"Golden Gordon\", the superfan Gordon Ottershaw supports a team that hasn't won a match in six years. But worse is yet to come as Gordon and his bicycle clips are reunited in a last desperate bid for glory."
