        "England 1558-1603. The filthy genes of the Blackadder dynasty bubble to the surface of the melting pot of history as Lord Edmund, arrogant peer-about-town, swaggers with a big head and small beard in search of grace and favour from stark raving mad Queen Bess (Miranda Richardson). Blackadder is hearing \"Bells\" and police sirens as he falls in love with his manservant Bob, who is not all he seems to be! Guest stars Rik Mayall as the dashing Lord Flashheart. Blackadder is appointed Minister in charge of Religious Genocide and Lord High Executioner, where his time saving measures cause more than a few people to lose their \"Head\". Blackadder sets off unwillingly to seek out a new \"Potato\" and to boldly go where Sir Walter Raleigh has been before. Written by Ben Elton."
