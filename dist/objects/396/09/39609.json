        "David Attenborough reveals the stunning beauty of Antarctica. At one and a half times the size of the United States, it has a population of only 800 people. Three quarters of the world's fresh water envelops it in a layer of ice so thick it conceals mountain ranges as vast as the Alps. With temperatures below 70 degrees C. and winds of 120mph, Antarctica is the coldest, loneliest place on Earth. However, it is also a place of majestic beauty which can support astonishingly rich and varied forms of wildlife. Incomparable standards of natural history filming trace Antarctica's seasonal cycle from the long winter months when the formation of ice almost doubles its surface area, to the brief summer when the race to breed accelerates. With scenes of sheer beauty, passion, comedy, aggression and sadness, this documentary is an unmissable opportunity to experience the last true wilderness on Earth."
