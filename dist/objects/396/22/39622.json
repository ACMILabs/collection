        "Written by Ben Elton and Richard Curtis. The scene is England 1586-1603, Lord Edmund Blackadder swaggers back with a big head and a small beard, constantly trying to curry favour with the mad Queen Bess. Accompanied by a small rabble of beruffed riff-raff - bottom-breath Baldrick and pea-brained Percy - the serpentine Lord Blackadder lowers the tone of England's Golden Age. \"Money\", finds Blackadder in deep to the baby-eating Bishop of Bath and Wells, (guest star Ronald Lacey). Can he raise the cash to pay back the loan and manage to avoid having the red hot poker torture? \"Beer\", with Miriam Margoyles as Lady Whiteadder, sees Blackadder frantically trying to impress his puritan aunt, while trying to live up to his macho image - an inheritance hangs in the balance! \"Chains\", with Hugh Laurie as Ludwig, an evil German master of disguise captures Blackadder and Cardinal Melchett, (Stephen Fry), and is determined to hold them for ransom, the only problem is that Queen Bess has decided she will no longer pay ransom demands - two lives hang in the balance!"
