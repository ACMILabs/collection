        "For most passengers, a trip on the Somerset and Dorset, (affectionately known as the 'Slow and Dirty'), meant seaside holidyas. It ran from Bath, up over Mendip Hills, before dropping down to Evercreech, the junction for Burnham-On-Sea, and onto Bournemouth. Before its unexpected closure in 1966, the Somerset and Dorset was filmed in colour by railway enthusiast, Ivo Peters of Bath. This is a vivid record of the steam age and the railwaymen who worked on the line"
