        "In 1994 the ABC chose to broadcast the annual Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade live on Australian television. The decision generated much controversy but the public broadcasting of the event allowed all Australians to witness the joy and imagination involved in what is now one of the world's leading festivals. This video of the broadcast includes footage not shown on the original screening. The Mardi Gras is a street festival in which lesbians, gays, queers and deviants can celebrate their communities and their determination to not be hidden from the public face of Australian culture. The theme of the 1994 Mardi Gras was \"We Are Family\" which aptly defines the strength of the Australian gay and lesbian movements in forging new forms of communal relationships which are working to challenge and destabilise homophobia. Testament to the Parade's success is its ability to bring almost a million people onto the streets of Sydney to join in the celebrations."
