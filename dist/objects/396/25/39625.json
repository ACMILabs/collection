        "The Western Front 1917: Captain Blackadder joins the British Army and has to take orders from two homicidal maniacs - one called the Charge of the Light Brigade 'a victory for common sense', and the other called Darling. \"Private Plane\" sees the German machine guns in front, British firing squads behind - the only way out is to tiddly-up-up! Guest starring Rik Mayall and Ade Edmonson as two dashing arch-rivals. \"General Hospital\", guest stars Miranda Richardson as a Florence Nightingale-type ordered to find a spy in a military hospital. Blackadder spots a man with a strong German accent, a beautiful nurse and a chance for three weeks in bed. \"Goodbyeee\" guest stars Geoffrey Palmer is a megalomaniacal Field Marshall when the big push is finally looming and with the help of two pencils and a pair of underpants, Blackadder goes stir-fry crazy!"
