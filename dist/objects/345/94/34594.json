        "Cold Comfort is a lively and incisive documentary on the local and global consequences of the decision to export Australian uranium. It presents statements by those who support the mining of uranium for nuclear energy purposes, alongside those who oppose it. The program incorporates archival footage, and contemporary interviews to chart Australia's participation in atomic history. Presented in four sequences. \"The Uranium debate\", \"The History of the bomb\", \"Transportation of radioactive waste\" and \"Fallout from Chernobyl and Three Mile Island\"."
