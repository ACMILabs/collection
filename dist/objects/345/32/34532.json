        "Tell the story of women in the coal mining town of Elkford, British Columbia and their attempts to get manual jobs in the open-pit coal mine. Many talk about their initial shyness and the pressure they felt to prove themselves on the trucks and bulldozers. A useful resource to aid discussion and analysis of the changing role of women in the workplace - particularly in relation to non-traditional roles."
