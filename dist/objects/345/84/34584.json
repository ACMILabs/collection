        "The story of the 1946 Aboriginal Pastoral Workers' Strike. Eight hundred aboriginal station workers walked off sheep stations in the north west of Western Australia, marking the beginning of a strike which lasted more than three years. The strike was more than a demand for better wages and conditions, it was a struggle for basic human rights."
