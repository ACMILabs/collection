        "Dramatisations of episodes from the long-running children's radio serial of the 1940s, performed with kitschy aplomb, are juxtaposed with scenes of everyday life in early postwar urban Australia in such a way as to underline the racism and sexism of the time. Cast includes Jojn Flaus, Alistair Forge, Sue World, Don Munro, Jim Howard, Christine Kerner, Peter Lane."
