        "Episode of Series \"Protecting Our Greatest Asset\". It should be noted that this video is made by a chemical company that manufactures herbicides. Intensive cropping and continual cultivation stresses the Australian soil dramatically. This video looks at alternative methods to soil tillage by machinery, namely herbicides. Crops which require no tillage as conservation are also discussed."
