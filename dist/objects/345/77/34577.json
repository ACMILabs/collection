        "Peter Carey is one of Australia's most talented writers. All four of his published works have won major literary awards. This film, takes a journey through his life and work and looks at the way he transforms his native country into a bizarre land of nightmares and surreal comedy. Throughout the film, an interview with Peter Carey is interwoven with lavish dramatisation. An intriguing and illuminating film about a remarkable writer."
