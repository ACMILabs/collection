        "Episode of Series \"The Storymakers\". This program shows how the writer-artist team, Percy Trezise and Dick Roughsey came to produce their brilliant award-winning picture book series based on the Aboriginal legends of Cape York. The program follows Kylie Belling, an Aboriginal actress, as she takes a trip to Quinkin country to meet Percy Trezise in North Queensland where he takes the viewer to see the Aboriginal rock paintings that inspired him. We also learn of his blood brother relationship with Dick Roughsey, the Aboriginal artist."
