        "Episode of Series \"Visions of War\". It was the most gruelling, the most harrowing, and in many ways the most tragic of all battles fought in Europe during the Second World War. It was also the most international - soldiers of sixteen countries fought and died there. It has become, too, a battle to be mulled over, puzzled out, and re fought, not just by professional soldiers and historians, but also by armchair strategists, for it is full of controversy, not the least the bombing by the Allies of the historic Benedictine Monastery on the summit of Mount Cassino. Combines unique archival material from both sides with newly filmed sequences of the rebuilt town and monastery and interviews with participants."
