        "As wheat crops decrease in value Rapeseed farming is flourishing. This video examines not only the financial advantages of Rapeseed crops, but also those apparent to the wheat growing industry when crops of wheat are grown in paddocks where Rapeseed was produced the previous year. Not only does a higher yield occur, a 30% increase is evident, but there are less weeds, insects and wheat root diseases, the cycle of the latter having actually been broken by the planting of Rapeseed the previous year."
