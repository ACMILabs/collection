        "This informative documentary looks at the six species of falcons found in Australia. Dramatic high-speed camera sequences capture the power and speed of the falcons in flight and during hunting. Despite their speed and power, survival for young falcons is still not an easy task. Approximately 70% of the young birds do not survive their first year."
