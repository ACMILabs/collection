        "Episode of Series \"Visions of War\". Hell is a very small place is how one survivor described the Vietnam siege at Dien Bien Phu in early 1954. Like Midway and Stalingrad it ranks as one of the most decisive and seminal battles of this century, one which led directly to America's involvement in Vietnam - with all that that entailed. Survivors tell the tale of arrogant western generals and ingenious eastern peasants, a pattern which was to be repeated in the Vietnam War. Using interviews and archival footage, this documentary examines the events leading up to and including the actual battle of Dien Bien Phu."
