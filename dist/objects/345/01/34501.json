        "Sarah, (Nadine Garner), a 15-year-old girl, who has a hearing impairment, is entering a crisis period in her life. Her future depends on the ability to emerge from the sheltered world her mother has created for her. In doing this she puts aside the self-imposed isolation of her deafness, and learns the value of her own identity."
