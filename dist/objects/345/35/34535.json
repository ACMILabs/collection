        "This video looks at the changes taking place in home ownership and rental accommodation throughout Australia. the desire to own their own home is strong in most Australians and places tremendous pressure on housing prices. with high interest rates, increased cost of land and housing, the Great Australian Dream is fast becoming a nightmare. Housing development does not reflect the changes occurring in Australian society and a fresh approach to effectively meet these needs is required."
