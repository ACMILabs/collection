        "This program shows us the vital search for mineral deposits. We have to mine deeper, in an environment as alien and hostile as space. We are taken possibly the deepest that cameras have ever filmed - capturing a strange world of machines that mine without explosives, that process rock underground, lifting only valuable payload to the surface. Above ground is a new breed of technology, extracting every mineral particle for the least energy consumption."
