        "An excellent political documentary about more than three thousand Americans who joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to fight in the Spanish Civil War from 1936-1939, although their participation was frowned upon in many quarters in America at the time. Newsreel clips, anecdotes from veterans, and a Hollywood film, \"Blockade\", are deftly edited together to produce this valuable ennobling history lesson. Rated: G"
