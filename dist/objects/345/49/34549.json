        "Since the days of the First Fleet, Australia has been inevitably dependent on the sea - first for much needed supplies, later for trade. As Australia's wealth was recognised and trade increased, the question of the country's defence became more important, making the establishment of a Navy vital, and in 1911, the RAN came into being. An archival compilation narrated by Ronald Coleby."
