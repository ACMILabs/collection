        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Black futures (A)\". Until recently, the 150,000 Australians who are of Aboriginal descent had little hope of ever owning a home or getting a permanent job. Now, young Aboriginal building apprentices are putting up first class new homes for their own communities. Better living conditions are helping Aboriginal people to maintain their own distinct sense of identity and boosting their self-confidence."
