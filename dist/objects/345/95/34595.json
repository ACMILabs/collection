        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Visions of War\". December 1944 witnessed the last German offensive of the Second World War. The Battle of the Bulge, as this campaign in the Ardennes forests of Belgium and Luxembourg is now more familiarly known, was the biggest single pitched battle of the Western Front - more than a million troops took part. It was Hitler's most desperate gamble of the war, he in fact planned its every move. This film uses current location filming and authentic historical film clips to document this battle. Portrays the heroism, as well as the confusion and humiliation, that characterised both the Allied and German troops."
