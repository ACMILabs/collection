        "Despite several decades of communist rule in China, the peasantry in many places and in many ways remained nearly as backward and poor as before \"liberation.\" This drama is about a young girl from a poor family, trapped and trying to escape from that way of life and an arranged marriage. One of the most important films of the Chinese new wave. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
