        "Many of the most interesting Australian animals are never seen in their natural habitat even by Australians. Perhaps its because many of them are nocturnal or, even more likely, because the animals are shy or live in such remote places that seeing them is usually by accident. \"Wild Australia\" reveals many little-known facts about `well-known' Australian animals, like the koala, platypus, echidna, Tasmanian tiger, numbat, kangaroo and crocodile, filmed in their natural habitat."
