        "Horse Thief is a magnificent saga of survival, filmed on location in Tibet by one of China's most innovative young directors. The film incorporates images of many of Tibet's great Buddhist ceremonies and festivals; traditions that were almost eradicated in the \"Cultural Revolution\", but which are now again observed as they have been for hundreds of years. The film neither endorses nor attacks Buddhist philosophy, but it does offer the most respectful view of Tibetan culture yet seen in Han Chinese art. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
