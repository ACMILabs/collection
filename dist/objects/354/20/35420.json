        "Fast, funny and furious, Rossini's \"Barber of Seville\" boasts a torrent of sparkling music, while John Cox's production adds its own distinctive lustre to this comic masterpiece enhanced by John Rawnsley's fine comic acting portrayal of Figaro and Maria Ewing's bewitching Rosina. The London Symphony Orchestra is conducted by the young French conductor, Sylvain Cambreling. Sung in Italian. No subtitles."
