        "This is a documentary examining the political struggle in the Philippines. It focuses on the life and exploits of Bernabe Buscayno, alias Kommanda Dante, legendary figure, founder of the New People's Army, and long time defender of the people. This gripping film looks at Dante's recent efforts to bring about political and economic change by establishing the People's Livelihood Foundation - an open co-operative for rice farmers in Capas, which represents the people's struggle to earn from their land ... so far the struggle has been peaceful."
