        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Orchestra Series\". The Orchestra series describes the evolution of the modern symphony orchestra from its beginnings in the 17th century to the present. Part One traces the beginnings of the orchestra in the wood-wind bands used for open air music. It shows how the development of opera in the 16th century prepared the way for musical interludes of descriptive and dramatic power, and the program includes a passage from Monteverdi's \"Tancredi and Clorinda\"."
