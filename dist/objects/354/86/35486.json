        "As World War II draws to a close, Ward X is a haven for a group of emotionally wounded men and their warm, sensitive nurse, Sister Langtry. However, peace can be shattered so easily and this is the story of a woman's obsession to duty, and the obsession she unwittingly nurtures in the men she cares for - an obsession that is inescapable. Starring Wendy Hughes."
