        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". The final part of a series which examines the main themes in world architecture today. The series looks at the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate, and introduces some younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. Which will be the seminal buildings of the 1980s and 1990s? This final program looks at some of the big projects for Paris, and asks whether the change that architecture is undergoing throughout the world will produce a more humane environment."
