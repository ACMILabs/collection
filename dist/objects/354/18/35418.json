        "In 1938 three Australian patrol officers, Jim Taylor, John Black and Pat Walsh set off on an extraordinary journey into the unexplored highlands of New Guinea. Their major purpose - to make contact with stone age tribes who know nothing of the outside world and explain to them that their lives were about to undergo incredible change. Fifty years later, Jim Taylor's daughter, Meg, sets out on her own journey of discovery, retracing the footsteps of her father's epic journey."
