        "In the early days of the French Revolution, a mysterious flower-brandishing Englishman, known affectionately and notoriously as the Scarlet Pimpernel, is leading a daring band in the timely rescue of aristocrats from the guillotine. Unbeknown to his beautiful French wife the Scarlet Pimpernel is, in reality, none other than Sir Percy Blakeney who feigns poetry-reading foppishness as his disguise. Based on the popular romantic novel by Baroness Orczy, a richly detailed historical background and splendid plot make \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" a first-class period adventure. Stars Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon. Rated: G"
