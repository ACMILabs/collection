        "From farmer's daughter to political prisoner, Anne Devlin has remained on the periphery of formal history - hers is a history of kitchen and children, fetching and carrying, the quiet heroism of a woman who recovers and buries the dead, who withstands protracted torture. She speaks through the 'lost' diaries she kept while in prison. This is the second feature of Irishwoman Pat Murphy and the first all-Irish feature. Cast includes Brid Brennan and Bosco Hogan."
