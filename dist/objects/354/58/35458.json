        "Dancing in the Moonlight tells the story of the Fifth Festival of Pacific Arts held in Townsville in August 1988. Amid celebration and performance, indigenous Pacific peoples shared and debated ideas and and concerns which inform life in the region today. Many South Pacific peoples are struggling to achieve the right to self-determination, to reclaim lands lost to the colonisers, fisheries invaded by big business and peaceful societies threatened by superpower deployment of nuclear weapons throughout their ocean. \"Dancing in the Moonlight\" is testament to their struggle to maintain their own languages and culture in the face of political, economic and cultural imperialism."
