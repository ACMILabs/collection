        "This is a film of a journey to the source of Western civilisation in the ruins of the historical site at Delphi. The music of the Classic Greeks has not survived but in the form and harmony of Mozart's music the Apollonian concepts are given complete expression. In 1985, the Australian Chamber Orchestra travelled to Greece to perform in Athens and at Delphi as part of the Cultural Capital of Europe Festival 1985 to honour this classic heritage. Rated: G"
