        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Orchestra Series\". Part Six of the Orchestra series which describes the evolution of the modern symphony orchestra from its beginnings in the 17th century to the present. Jane Glover looks at the work of an orchestra in detail. Taking the score of Ravel's \"Bolero\" she works through it with the London Symphony Orchestra. Today the conductor is as much a \"star\" as the orchestra itself. Jane Glover discusses just what the conductor does to deserve this stardom."
