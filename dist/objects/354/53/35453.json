        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". This moving drama series on important figures from Australia's past brings Australian history to life. Errol Flynn's natural charm and good looks saw him become a screen legend as Hollywood's greatest swashbuckling lover and matinee idol. This film takes an irreverent look at the nineteen year old Flynn's escapades in Sydney as he sets off on the path to notoriety."
