        "'A winter tan' is based on the book \"Give Sorrow Words: Maryse Holder's Letters From Mexico\", published in 1979 after Holder's disappearance and presumed death. The result is a film of astonishing direct frankness, which reveals a woman on a quest for love, sex and freedom but determined to tell all to us as an audience. She is prepared to reveal her humiliations as well as her highs. She drinks. She dances. She goes through intense periods of promiscuity and self-examination, telling us every detail of her triumphs and disappointments with the men (and boys) of the bars, beaches and backstreets of Mexico. Cast includes Jackie Burroughs, Erando Gonzalez and Anita Olanick."
