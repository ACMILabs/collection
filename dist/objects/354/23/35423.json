        "This Bach concert is a very special one. Given as part of a tri- centenary tribute to Johann Sebastian Bach, it features the first encounter of the world's most beloved violinist, Yehudi Menuhin, with a major young talent of the opera stage, 27 year old French baritone, Nicolas Riveng, who, on this occasion, was making his debut and the English Chamber orchestra. The program includes four of Bach's most popular works. NOTE: Program cuts out at the end."
