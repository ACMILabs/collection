        "Kevin Saunders, a builder in the small country town of Badigeri, decides to import a Filipino bride, but in doing so he also imports a few problems. At first it seems as if his marriage to the pretty Ampy has potential, but the local townspeople are both racist and sexist and Ampy, struggling to find her place in the town, finds difficulty in dealing with the conflicting pressures. Cast includes Ray Meagher and Charito Ortez."
