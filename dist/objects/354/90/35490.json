        "Produced for the Australian National Botanic Gardens, this video explains the functions and uses of trees. It starts with the main parts of a tree, (the roots, leaves and trunk); the processes of photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration and the important part trees play in the water and air cycles, as well as helping to prevent soil erosion. The video then goes on to identify the role trees play in providing food and shelter for birds and animals, and timber, paper and food for man. The message is clear: Care for trees."
