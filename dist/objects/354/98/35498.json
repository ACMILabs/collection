        "Perhaps the best loved of all animal films, \"Born Free\" is based on the real life adventures of Joy Adamson, her husband, and the lion cub, Elsa. Filmed in spectacular African settings, accompanied by an Oscar winning score, \"Born Free\" is a movie for the entire family. The film sensitively portrays the painful conflict faced by the Adamsons who find they are no longer able to keep the growing Elsa as a pet. Rather than send her to the zoo, they decide to train her for a return to her natural life. Rated G"
