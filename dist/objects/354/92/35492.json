        "This documentary, that tells of one of Australia's most successful efforts to fight drug addiction, is a \"no holds barred\" view on Odyssey House in Sydney and its drug rehabilitation program told by the residents undergoing treatment. It shows the progressive degradation of people through drug addiction to the depths of despair and hopelessness and the way in which the Odyssey program rebuilds shattered lives. The story addresses the cynicism of many people to the problems and reasons of addiction and cure."
