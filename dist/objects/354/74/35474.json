        "A romantic Casbah thief (Charles Boyer) makes the mistake of falling in love. Hollywood romantic drama based closely on the French original, Pepe le Moko. laughed at for years because of the alleged line `Come with me to the Casbah' (which was never actually said), it holds up remarkably well in its fashion. Rated: PG"
