        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". Part Seven of a series which examines the main themes in world architecture today. The series looks at the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate, and introduces some younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. All over the world people are fighting the tendency to destroy the old. Stations are being turned into museums, factories into concert halls. Everywhere old buildings have been given new life. Part Seven looks at the reconstruction of the historic centre of Frankfurt, the new museum in Paris and the revitalised shopping malls of America."
