        "This video is based on two classic s/m novels; \"Venus in Furs\", and \"The Story of O\". \"Venus in Furs\" portrays the insatiable desire of one man to submit to one very cruel woman - indeed his love-ridden slavishness is so demanding that it takes a considerable toll on her. This is one sub-plot of this video. Wanda is the cruel woman, and through the course of the video, all Wanda's primary relationships change, and yet the show, the performance art of sado-masochism, goes on. English subtitles."
