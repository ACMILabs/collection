        "The Sydney Dance Company presents choreographer Graeme Murphy's BOXES. Music composition by Iva Davies and Bob Kretschmer of \"Icehouse\". \"Boxes\" has immediate visual appeal as a high-tech display of theatrical wizardry. It embraces all manner of popular dream images from contemporary mythology. Murphy moves his dancers through their strange rituals with endless imagination, probing at boxes - in minds, compartmentalised emotions and imprisoned spirits. Rating: G"
