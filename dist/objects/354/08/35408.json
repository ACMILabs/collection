        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Orchestra Series\". Part Three of the Orchestra Series which describes the evolution of the modern symphony orchestra from its beginnings in the 17th Century to the present. By the middle of the 18th Century the \"wind band\" has become part of the classical orchestra, and the newly invented clarinet was all the rage. European orchestra owed their existence and development to patronage, but in England public concerts had been provoked commercially as early as 1672. A century later subscription concerts were held in London, creating a musically literate public. In this program the English Chamber Orchestra plays in the Assembly Rooms, Bath."
