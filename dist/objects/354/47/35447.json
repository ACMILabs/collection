        "Boomalli is an artists' co-operative - a collection of photographers, painters, sculptors, designers and filmmakers, who are urban Aboriginal or Koorie artists. The work presented ranges from that of fashion designer Bronwyn Bancroft, the sand sculpture of Fiona Foley, Tracey Moffatt's film, \"Nice coloured girls\" and the paintings of Raymond Meeks and Jeffrey Samuals. This visually rich and inspiring film is about their work. Their achievements speak for themselves."
