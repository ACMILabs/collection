        "Kakadu is the jewel of the country's national parks and the home of the Gagadju people. \"Kakadu Man\" is the story of Bill Niedjie, the traditional custodian of this land - a role passed down to him through countless generations. In 1979 he gave the land to the people of Australia. Translated through the use of actors and puppet characters, and scenes of Kakadu, \"Kakadu Man\" unfolds into a sensitive and often humorous portrait, weaving together the figurative and the abstract, the past and the present. The message of this important documentary is of vital concern to people everywhere."
