        "Based on the Grimm Brothers' fairy tale, this is a wonderfully fanciful motion picture filled with a host of stunning special effects. Soar away on the wings of your imagination to a world of forest spirits, where puppets come alive, where starcrossed lovers have their fondest dreams come true - where Tom Thumb will dance his way right into your heart."
