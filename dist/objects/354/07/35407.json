        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Orchestra Series\". Part Four of the Orchestra series which describes the evolution of the modern symphony orchestra from its beginnings in the 17th century to the present. The centre-piece of this program is composer, innovator and orchestrator, Hector Berlioz. Jane Glover conducts the London Philharmonic Orchestra playing excerpts from Berlioz's \"Treatise on Orchestration\". The Romantic Movement, with its emphasis on \"man's free will\", brought about a radical shift in the composer's use of the orchestra, changing its role to that of storyteller."
