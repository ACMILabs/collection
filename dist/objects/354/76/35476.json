        "The philanthropic director of a small savings and loan association on the verge of bankruptcy in a small American town thinks he is a failure and contemplates suicide. His guardian angel attempts to convince him that his life has been far from worthless. A comedy-drama in a fantasy framework which recapitulates Capra's major themes: the fragility of good and virtue and the ever threatening encroachment of evil. (Awards: nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor)."
