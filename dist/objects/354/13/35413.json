        "In September 1970, a British war correspondent is distracted from his coverage of the conflict between Palestinians and Jordanians when he rescues a young lady from a PLO patrol. Named Friendship, she claims to be an extra terrestrial robot sent to Earth on a peace mission and accidentally diverted from her original destination, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Is she insane, a spy, or telling the truth? Wollen's film comes across as a two-set Dr Who for adults, complete with political, philosophical and personal problems. Rated: M"
