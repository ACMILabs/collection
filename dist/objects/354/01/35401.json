        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". Part Eight of a series which examines the main themes in world architecture today. The series looks at the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate, and introduces some younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. Part Eight deals with domestic housing. Most famous architects are concerned with commercial and institutional architecture. Ordinary people have to live in \"junk\" but there are signs that housing design is undergoing a change for the better. In the suburbs of Paris and London, a more humane architecture is beginning to emerge which challenges the monotony of the \"new town\" ideal."
