        "Peter Grimes, the opera by Benjamin Britten, libretto by Montagu, directed by Sir John Tooley is based on George Crabbe's long narrative poem, \"The Borough\", and is set on the East Coast of England in a small fishing community dominated by the sea. The theme is universal - conflict between an individual and a society that sees him as an outsider. Features performers Jon Vickers (Peter Grimes), Heather Harper (Ellen Oxford), Norman Bailey (Captain Balstrode), The Royal Opera Chorus and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House conducted by Sir Colin Davis. Recorded at The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden."
