        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". Part of a series which examines the main themes in world architecture, the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate and introduces younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. Part Nine deals with Texas, which issues more building permissions each year than any other State. Houston and Dallas have consequently become the most exciting cities in which to look at architecture. These \"pop-up\" cities are like a blackboard on which the problems of modern architecture are being chalked up. They show the 21st Century in the making - a prospect that is intriguing, daring and deeply disturbing."
