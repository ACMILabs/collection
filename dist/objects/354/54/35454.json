        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". This moving drama series on important figures from Australia's past brings Australian history to life. Lottie Lyell was one of Australia's most successful actresses. Although she often played the damsel in distress in her early films, Lottie was no helpless heroine in real life. As well as starring in her films, she worked behind the cameras as script writer, art director, costume designer, editor and business manager. She was part of an excellent team with Raymond Longford, Australia's best known silent film director with whom she had a long and enduring relationship."
