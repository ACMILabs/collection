        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Bush tucker man series\". The fascinating Bush Tucker Man series shows how even in remote deserts and on sandy beaches, fresh water can be found - if you know where to look for it. This video, containing the last four episodes of the series, follows Major Hiddins through the most northern rainforest in Australia at Iron Range, the northern Queensland coastline and the Gulf Country, through to the west coast of Cape York where the first known sighting of Australia took place by Europeans."
