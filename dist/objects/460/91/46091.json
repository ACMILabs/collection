        "Lumsden, Saskatchewan, is a town of 850 citizens on a river called the Qu'Appelle. In the spring of 1974, the river doubled its volume and threatened to flood the town. The townspeople organized themselves and the whole province stood behind them. It is the story of an incredible battle against impossible odds."
