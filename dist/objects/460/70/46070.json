        "Disney brings Edgar Rice Burroughs' story 'Tarzan' to life in this full length animated film. Tarzan is a baby boy, adopted by a gorilla named Kala, following the death of her own child. She brings him into the group against the wishes of their leader, a large silverback gorilla named Kerchak. Tarzan quickly makes friends with a gorilla named Terk, and an elephant named Tantor despite his obvious differences. Tarzan grows up believing he is one of the gorillas - until he meets Jane. This event changes Tarzan's life as he learns about who and what he really is. Featuring five songs written and performed by Phil Collins including the Oscar winning song \"You'll be in my heart\", and the voices of Glenn Close, Rosie O'Donnell, Minnie Driver, Wayne Knight, Nigel Hawthorne and Alex D. Linz as the voice of young Tarzan."
