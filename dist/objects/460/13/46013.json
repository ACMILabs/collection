        "Episode of Series \"Carry on\". It is 1895 and the British occupation of India is threatened by revolutionary uprisings. In order for the revolutionaries to attack the British troops they need to cross the notorious Khyber Pass. The history and politics of the British Raj, however, is simply a convenient background for the Carry On team to conduct their regular mix of hilarious slap-stick and tongue-in-cheek camp. Cast includes Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims and a large supporting cast of British comedians."
