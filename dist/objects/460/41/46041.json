        "The weather conditions represented by isobars, fronts and other symbols of the weather map are explained in this film. The journey of a disturbance is seen both as an animated plan and in cross-section, until the final occlusion over the North Sea. The film ends with a study of cumulus and strato-cumulus clouds which follow in the wake of a disturbance."
