        "Aborigines come from all over Australia to compete in this unique and colorful event - the annual indigenous surfing contest at Fingal on the East Coast. Kyle Slabb, the narrator, is a young aboriginal surfer whose clan are hosting the event. He guides the viewer around the spectacular rivers and idyllic coastal reserves of his homelands, offering insights into traditional ways, dance and ceremony, and an understanding of his struggle to preserve these values in his modern life. The film is a lively and uplifting look at the positive steps taken by an indigenous community as it strives to achieve cultural continuity for future generations."
