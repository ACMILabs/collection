    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"Problems in Supervision\". A factory foreman discusses with the supervisor the \"problem\" of supervising women workers in his department. The fact is brought out that the same rules apply in supervising both men and women; but, \"as women often have not had as much industrial experience as men, and in most cases have more home responsibilities than men, these factors must be taken into account\". Note that this film was made in 1944 and uses such terms as \"breaking in\" the female workers and \"the eternal feminine\". Interesting from a historical point of view."
