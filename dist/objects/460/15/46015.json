        "An informative look at tarot cards and tarot card reading, centering around the mysterious origins of the cards themselves, and the way their meanings and usage have changed over the centuries. Tarot card readers, historians, and parapsychologists discuss the appeal of the tarot, and offer anecdotes and theories as to why people are so drawn to this ancient craft. Also explores the symbolism behind the artwork, the different spreads that can be used in a reading, and the meanings of the major and minor arcana. Narrated by Christopher Lee."
