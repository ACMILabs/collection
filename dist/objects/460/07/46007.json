        "Samantha is having a hard time getting used to the idea that she should not only keep herself neat and tidy, but she should also take care of her room, as she say, \"Why should I clean things when they just get dirty again?\" Suddenly, while she is pondering this age-old question, her stuffed penguin comes to life and shows Sam the value of keeping yourself and your surroundings clear and clean. This video examines the important topics of personal hygiene, grooming and keeping things neat and in order, as well as family teamwork and respect for family members. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included. No other credits available."
