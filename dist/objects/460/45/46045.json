        "A brief history of the Suez Canal, showing the way the Suez and Panama Canals shorten trade routes. Superb use of animation based on ancient Egyptian art, illustrates how the Pharaohs dug several canals in the area. Oil prints show work of De Lesseps in financing and building the present canal. Live photography briefly shows how the canal is operated and maintained."
