        "Episode of Series \"Carry on\". The 26th 'Carry on' film is one of mistaken identities and secret lives. Highwayman Dick Turpin - Big Dick (Sid James), is also the town rector, ably supported by Harry and Tom (Barbara Windsor and Peter Butterworth) - his parlour maid and the man who pumps the church's organ. There is only one weak link in the chain - a noticeable birthmark on Turpin's privates which will require the assistance of a bevy of busty women to bring to light. The charge will be led by Captain Fancy and Jock Strap. Cast also includes Kenneth Williams, Hattie Jacques, Bernard Bresslaw and Joan Sims."
