        "An account of the work being done to maintain the trout population of Victorian lakes and streams. Shows the initial trapping of adult fish, stripping of eggs from the female fish, and subsequent hatching of young fry at the Snob's Creek hatchery, keeping the young fish in brooding ponds, and finally the release of the trout to replenish lakes and streams. Various trout fishing techniques are demonstrated, and the film concludes with scenes of anglers in action in many parts of the State."
