        "Episode two of a provocative three part ecological history of Australasia based on Dr Tim Flannery's best selling book of the same name. It focuses on the exploitation for food of flora and fauna resources, firstly by the indigenous populations of Australia and New Zealand and then by European colonists. This episode looks at the impact of hunting and fishing by Maori before European colonisation. The primeval forests of New Zealand were home to many unique creatures which they devoured to extinction. They also rapidly depleted marine life until they no longer had enough to eat. The result was war over resources, followed by conservation measures to preserve food sources, some of which continue to this day. Written and presented by Dr Tim Flannery.
