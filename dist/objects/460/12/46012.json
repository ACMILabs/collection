        "Episode of Series \"Carry on\". The 23rd \"Carry on\" film finds a gang of prim and proper British tourists on a disastrous holiday. This is despite the reassuring name of the tour organisers and their location - Wundatours on a package tour of the Paradise island of Elsbels on the Costa Plonka. Their dreams of a luxury hotel quickly disintegrate when they discover the hotel is still being built, there's faulty wiring, a leaky roof, all staff look suspiciously alike and there's a disgruntled cook. Add to this the usual carry on shenanigans surrounding beds and showers and we are in for a holiday like no other. Cast includes Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Kenneth Connor and Hattie Jacques."
