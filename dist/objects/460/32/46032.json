        "Joyce Rasmussen and her 25-year-old daughter Lorna have both chosen to live without partners. Joyce is divorced; Lorna has chosen to remain single. But they are friends and they talk openly about coping as \"singles\" in this couple-oriented society, and about their attitudes on such issues as monogamy and collective households."
