        "In the first of three episodes on this tape, 'Umi\", Pete's mind is trapped in Gribble's body and vice versa, due to a particularly realistic video game they played. While Pete is spending a nasty night with Matron Gribble, Gribble is trying to convince Tony to sell the lighthouse. In 'Truth hits everybody', Linda loses out to Gribble as the host of the Port Niranda High School Broadcast, so she decides to do her own show. Anthony, Fiona, Pete and Linda find a magic microphone that makes everyone speak the truth, which is not always a good thing. In \"Niranderthal Boy\", the tradition in the Twist household of the razor being passed on from father to elder son is broken when Bronson uses it before Pete - thus chaos is unleashed and the consequences can only be dangerous."
