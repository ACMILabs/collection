        "An embittered Confederate soldier returns to his Arizona homestead after the end of the Civil War, only to find it occupied by pioneers sympathetic to the Union war effort. Desperate to rebuild the life he once knew, he is forced to re-consider his loyalties and join forces with his Union adversary to make a last stand for the one thing left worth fighting for - his family."
