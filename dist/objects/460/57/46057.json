        "Episode three of a provocative three part ecological history of Australasia based on Dr Tim Flannery's best selling book of the same name. It focuses on the exploitation for food of flora and fauna resources, firstly by the indigenous populations of Australia and New Zealand and then by European colonists. This episode looks at the introduction of European farming methods and feral creatures by colonists and their catastrophic effect on our local eco systems in the form of the extinction of many native fauna and irreversible damage to much of Australia's land. Written and presented by Dr Tim Flannery. Further information available at www.abc.net.au/science/future."
