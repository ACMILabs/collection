        "Just when we thought technology was under control the millennium bug fear sent shockwaves throughout the world with repercussions from PC's to computers controlling aircraft and technical hospital equipment. The computer glitch known as the millennium bug threatened to come into being if all computers weren't made compliant by the December 31st deadline. This episode of \"Insight\" looks at the crisis facing airlines and, in particular, Ansett's strategy management of the problem. It looks at the financial cost of compliance, the formation of the millennium taskforce and the legal ramifications. Explains why technology failed us and an anthropologist, minister and historian thrash out millennium fears - which proves quite interesting in hindsight. Originally screened 28 May 1998."
