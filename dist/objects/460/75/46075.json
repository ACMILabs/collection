        "The production of gin from cereal grains - wheat, barley or maize, pure water, and aromatic herbs. Shows four main stages - the cleaning and grinding of the grain; cooking and fermentation with the addition of malt and yeast; distillation of gin by adding juniper berries and other exotic herbs. Bottling, sealing and labelling completes the process. Shows constant quality control tests."
