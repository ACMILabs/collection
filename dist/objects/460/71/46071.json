        "This tape is the first episodes in the third series of the perennially popular children's series, with all the favourite characters (and twisted situations) that we have come to expect - then some more for good measure. In the first of three episodes, 'The Big Burp', Pete finally meets the girl of his dreams. He can't believe his luck - Jeannie is the most beautiful girl in Port Niranda - even if she is a tree spirit. Pete is also very surprised to find that he has somehow fallen pregnant. In 'The Viking book of love', a long boat of ancient Vikings, led by chef Snorri, emerges from an eerie fog which is enveloping Port Niranda, however the real trouble begins when the chief's son, Snorrisen, falls in love with Linda after he reads to her from the Viking Book of Love. 'The Whirling derfish' sees Bronson swallow a rare whirling derfish, causing his willy to spin like a propellor turning him into a human outboard motor known as \"The Port Niranda Porpoise\"."
