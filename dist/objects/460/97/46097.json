        "A biographical film on the life of Louisianna's infamous governor Huey Long. Using photographs and archival footage, this documentary focuses on his political career as Railroad Commisioner, Governor of Louisianna and US Senator and touches on his aspirations for the US presidency. Promoting himself as an enemy of large corporations and a champion of the 'common man' his social platform revolved around public works programmes and social services. Allegations of bribery and corruption instigated actions to remove him from local and national politicals. Long was assasinated in 1935 by Carl White, a young doctor who's family had been persecuted by Long. The archival film that was sourced for this documentary include footage of Mardi Gas and jazz scenes of New Orleans in the 20's; armed police supporting Huey Long; Louisianna's political heavyweights during Long's reign; and a memorable performance by Huey Long singing his election song 'Everyman a king'. Commentary by Mike Wallace."
