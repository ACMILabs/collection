        "Moretti's intimate and hilarious film diary, which follows the idiosyncratic Italian director's personal experiences over 18 months, was received rapturously at Cannes where it won the Best Director Award. The film is divided into three chapters: in the first, we follow Moretti on his Vespa through the streets of Rome; in the second, he escapes with a friend to the beautiful Eolian islands; and in the third we see his dealings with conventional and alternative doctors. In Italian with English subtitles."
