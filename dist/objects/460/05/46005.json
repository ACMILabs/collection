        "Episode of Series \"Families of the world\". Twelve-year-old Yoshiko Matsuda lives in Sakaiminato, a major fishing port on the west of Japan. We spend a week with Yoshiko and her family and learn about life in this island nation, where the modern and traditional mix in everyday life. Learn about her father, who teaches English at the local high school and trains the school's judo club. Her mother teaches calligraphy in their home and her two brothers attend college. Yoshiko explores the local fishing trade, and we share a traditional meal of sashimi with the whole family."
