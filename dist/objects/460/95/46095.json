        "The story of two typical well-meaning parents who provide everything they possibly can for the physical well-being of their children; consequently, they fail to understand why their children are so often disobedient, defiant, and generally unmanageable. In desperation, the mother seeks the advice of the headmistress of the children's school; both parents later attend a meeting of the Parents and Teachers Association, and learn something of the methods and aims of modern education. They apply what they have learned to their relationships with their own children, with gratifying results."
