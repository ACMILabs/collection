        "The film shows human tumour cells which have been removed from a patient with carcinoma of the stomach. The cells are contained in the ascitic fluid drawn off from the patient and are observed in this fluid for several hours after removal. A phase-contracts microscope is used with a magnification of 900 times. The conditions for the continued growth and division of the cells are not the most favourable and, in general, only preparations for divisions are observed. However, a normal cell division has been recorded and also a case of tetra-polar division. Silent, with captions in German."
