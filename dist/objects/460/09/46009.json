        "Mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) is having trouble sleeping on the eve of a planned meeting between rival Mafia gangs. His anxiety soon turns into a full blown panic attack prompting the tough guy to contact psychiatrist Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal). The neurotic Sobel initially refuses to take Vitti on as a patient but soon finds that the desperate criminal doesn't take rejection well. Director Harold Ramis uses this comedic premise effectively, parodying the mobs 'tough guy' ethos, while lampooning an assortment of familiar gangster films. The casting of DeNiro is a joke in itself as the actor sends up his previous film incarnations as the quintessential Mafia 'wiseguy'. Cast also includes Lisa Kudrow, Chazz Palminteri and Joe Viterelli."
