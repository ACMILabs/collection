        "More than any other director, Fredrico Fellini has created a coherent universe compounded of his personal vision and anxiety, where each work is held together by filaments of memory and imagery. All his films are picaresque and fragmentary, representing a subliminal search by the protagonist(s) for a life more fulfilling than the one lived now. The Rome of his Satyricon is borne out of his imagination. In it the costumes, lighting, architecture, gestures, eating habits, all forms of behaviour, conspire to startle and disorient the viewer. For years Fellini had contemplated a film version of Petronius' book, a fragmentary account of a group of Roman students on a seemingly meandering journey, its unfinished quality appealing to his open-ended, fractured style of filmmaking. Cast includes Martin Potter, Max Born, Hiram Keller, Capucine, Lucia Bose, Gorden Mitchell and Alain Cuny. In Italian with English subtitles."
