        "Annie, with the help of her alien friend Cosmo, learns that all things in the universe fit into one of three categories - animal, mineral or vegetable. For her science project she must explain an example of one thing which fits into all three categories, and through investigating the world around them Annie and Cosmo discover water is such an element - it can exist in three states - solid, liquid and gas. Through examining water, Annie develops a greater appreciation for the value of water to all life on earth. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's guide included."
