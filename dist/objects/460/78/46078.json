        "The incidence of varicose veins and chronic ulcerations are given, and diagrams explain the venous supply to the legs and the abnormal conditions which can develop and cause trouble. The film explains pre-operative treatment. The operation itself is followed step by step and explanations are given of the various processes. The film ends with some close-up views of the instruments used, some of which were obtained from the Mayo Clinic."
