        "The lives of the inhabitants of a Swedish seaboard village that becomes a resort in summer are contrasted with those of visitors. The atmosphere of a little fishing village is beautifully caught - the impact of trippers on it equally well described. The film has all the best of Sucksdorff's qualities - a strong pictorial style, human observation, and a simple flowing narrative."
