        "Another fine contribution from renowned Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, who returns to the comedy of his earlier works in this humorous yet moving film about a woman in the throes of a creative and emotional crisis. Years of writing bestselling romantic fiction under the pseudonym Amanda Gris have started to take their toll on Leo (Marisa Paredes), who yearns to express herself through a blacker style of writing. Bound by her contract, and immersed in denial over the disintegration of her marriage to Paco (Imanol Arias), she spirals dangerously toward a total breakdown. Her only salvation appears in the form of Angel (Juan Echanove), who offers her a job as a critic for a national arts supplement. Leo's first assignment - to write a critique of her alter ego, Amanda Gris - sets in motion a chain of events which force her to face reality, and sever ties with the fears of the past. In Spanish with English subtitles."
