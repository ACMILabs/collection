        "Traces the consequences of a state of imbalance in nature. The destruction of a community as a consequence of one element getting out of hand is carefully traced in regard to both forest and grassland. The results of overgrazing and hunting are illustrated and the point made that only by intelligent management can we secure the heritage of the soil."
