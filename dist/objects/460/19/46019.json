        "Hired killer John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat) has one last job to complete to free himself and his family from being blackmailed by drug baron Mr Wei. Wei has hired Lee for a hit on the son of the policeman (Michael Rooker) responsible for killing his son. Using an eye for an eye justice mentality, Wei assumes the death of another will replace his own loss. Lee is unable to bring himself to kill the young boy and ditches the job, thus earning the wrath of the man who hired him. His action also causes Lee to become the target of assassins hired to rid the drug baron of someone who couldn't do the job, and to complete the task of killing the policeman's son. Fearing for his family in China, Lee seeks unconventional means - including the help of passport forger Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino) to get him back to China and protect his family, and to save the life of a young boy his conscience wouldn't let him kill."
