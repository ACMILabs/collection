        "Episode one of a provocative three part ecological history of Australasia based on Dr Tim Flannery's best selling book of the same name. It focuses on the exploitation for food of flora and fauna resources, firstly by the indigenous populations of Australia and New Zealand and then by European colonists. This episode looks at the reasons behind the extinction of Australia's megafauna, the giant marsupials that roamed the continent before human habitation. Presenter Dr Tim Flannery believes that they were wiped out by the Aborigines upon their arrival in Australia 40-60,000 years ago. The extinctions were the catalyst for environmental meltdown, from which the Aborigines made a triumphant recovery. Written and presented by Dr Tim Flannery.
