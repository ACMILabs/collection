        "Notorious for being rapper turned actor Tupac Shakur's final film appearance before being gunned down in 1996, 'Gang related' is a tense crime drama about corruption, gangs and drugs. Detectives Divinci (James Belushi) and Rodriguez (Tupac Shakur) are two bent street detectives with a flourishing byline drug scam which involves Divinci's girlfriend, Cynthia (Lela Rochon) as bait. The partners have vastly different motivations behind their actions - Divinci wants to retire while Rodriguez has a gambling debt to repay. Both are united by their belief that the men they kill deserve it. Their plan quickly unravels when one of the punters turns out to be an undercover D.E.A. and they are not able to wash their hands as cleanly for the murder with their usual \"gang-related\" dismissal. Cast also includes James Earl Jones, David Paymer and Wendy Crewson. Includes bonus footage including the last ever interview with Tupac Shakur."
