        "In the first of three episodes, 'Mali Boo', Tony discovers an old Malibu surfboard in the garage, and Pete is keen to make a splash at the Port Niranda surf carnival, that is until the board's real owner shows up. In 'Brainless', Bronson teams up with resident geek Anthony for a science project that ends up with Pete and Linda having their brains sucked out their noses. While Bronson is searching for their brains at the local tip, Linda and Pete's bodies become Gribbles' personal slaves. In 'Toy love', Linda's old Veronique doll comes back to haunt her, refusing to leave her alone, and neither will Gribble who has heard Linda read from the Viking Book of Love."
