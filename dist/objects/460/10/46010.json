        "This is the story of two gifted sisters who grew up in England in the 1950s and competed for musical accolade and love. Hilary was a talented flautist, but it was her sister, Jackie, who was the musical genius who went on to become one of the greatest cellists of the 20th century, while Hilary chose a simple family life in the country. The film follows their sibling rivalry in musical competition and romance, and in spite of their differences they both share common emotions, including jealousy. As Jackie struggles with her rapid rise to fame, her journey would have incredible and devastating consequences on both hers and Hilary's lives. Cast includes Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, James Frain and David Morrissey."
