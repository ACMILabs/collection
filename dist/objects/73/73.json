        "A documentary video tape about the 'Suicide Box' - a motion triggered camera developed by the Bureau of Inverse Technology (a private information agency) and installed in range of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Fransisco. This vertical-motion triggered device is designed to capture a video record of anything that falls from the bridge in order to provide an accurate measure of the suicide rate at the bridge. Accuracy of measurement is often compromised by the presence of seagulls and brought into question by ironic observations about the contradictory roles played by technology within contemporary culture."
