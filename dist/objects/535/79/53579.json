        "This wonderful nostalgic film celebrates not only the Hollywood musical but more importantly and historically, it was also the first film that Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire teamed together and set the world alight with their magical dance movements. On-screen dancing would never be the same again. Electrifying, mesmerising, Rogers and Astaire outshone even the top-billed stars Dolores Del Rio, Gene Raymond and Raul Roulien. Forget the plot, just enjoy the whole musical experience."
