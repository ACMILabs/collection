        "Mid-life crisis, bored with work, his wife and his life, Nick Bailey (Harold Hopkins) begins to fantasize about the young and rather attractive Donna (Kerry Mack), who works at the hamburger stand near his office. Nick's wife Liz (Jeanie Drynan) confused and disturbed by Nick's strange and secretive behaviour, especially his long showers, finds herself fantasizing about a former lover after a chance meeting. Can their marriage survive? Does anyone care? A low-budget film with a pretty ordinary plot. Cast also features Kate Fitzpatrick."
