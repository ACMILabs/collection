        "A rich and lively blend of great songs, great dances, great comedy and plain old period charm, Rosalie is the kind of zany musical they just don't make anymore. Starring Nelson Eddy as Dick Thorpe, star footballer and West Point cadet and Eleanor Powell as Rosalie, the woman he loves. Cast also includes Frank Morgan, Edna May Oliver, Ray Bolger, Ilona Massey with words and music by Cole Porter. Based on the play by William Anthony McGuire and Guy Bolton. The film is introduced by Bill Collins."
