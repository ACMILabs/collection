        "This compendium of animated shorts features three stories: \"Winnie the Pooh and the honey tree\". Anytime is the right time for honey, according to Pooh. This film follows him through a series of misadventures brought about by his fondness for sweet treats, showing how Pooh gets himself into - and out of - several sticky situations. In \"Winnie the Pooh and the blustery day\", Pooh visits his Thoughtful Spot and then, because of the wind, joins in some antics with Piglet. In \"Winnie the Pooh and Tigger too\" Rabbit, Pooh, and Piglet plan to unbounce Tigger, but discover they like a bouncy Tigger best. Features the voices of Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Sebastian Cabot and others."
