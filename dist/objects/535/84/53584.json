        "Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman take us through this selection of Rolling Stones classic hits in their own offbeat quirky way interspersed with interviews, concerts, opinions and newsreel footage. Also includes some memorable moments of interviews by Australia's very own Norman Gunston (Garry McDonald) and some uncut uncensored versions of \"She was hot\", \"Too much blood\" and \"Undercover of the night\". Contains some b&w scenes."
