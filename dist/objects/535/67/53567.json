        "Based on Hubert Osborne's play \"Shore leave\", this romantic comedy musical features that wonderful dancing duo, Fred Astaire as Bake Baker, a sailor, and Ginger Rogers as Sherry Martin, a dance-hall hostess. Although playing more of a supportive role to Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard, the Fred and Ginger team put in an unforgettable performance with \"Let's face the music and dance\". Cast also includes Betty Grable and Lucille Ball. Lyrics and music by Irving Berlin."
