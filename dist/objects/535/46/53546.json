        "Television adaptation of English playwright and poet John Drinkwater's play \"Abraham Lincoln\" which features a cameo role towards the end of the program by James Dean as a reluctant Union soldier sentenced to death for sleeping on guard duty. This live television drama documents a part of Lincoln's life from his nomination for presidency through to his attendance at Ford's Theater where his eventual assassination took place. Stars Robert Pastene as Abraham Lincoln and Judith Evelyn as Mary Lincoln. Also includes classic Westinghouse ad-breaks at intervals throughout the program. NB: Picture quality and sound is variable."
