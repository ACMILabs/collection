        "Cleopatra is illustrative of the conception of historical epic as charade in which the stars are not only cast as famous historical figures but historical figures are cast as stars (Cleopatra as Colbert). What is absent here is De Mille's characteristic combination of spectacle and morality play. Instead, the spectacle of a sexual extravaganza, (epitomised by the seduction of Mark Antony on the Royal Barge), verges on self parody. This is held in check only by De Mille's commitment to conventions of realist stage melodrama, (from his formative years in the theatre), allied with a strong pictorial sensibility. Stars Claudette Colbert, Henry Wilcoxon, Warren William. From an adaptation of historical marterial by Bartlett Cormack."
