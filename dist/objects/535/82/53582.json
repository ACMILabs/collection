        "A live on stage performance in England of Alice Cooper's \"Welcome to my nightmare\" including some of his all-time classic songs \"Only women bleed\", \"Department of youth\", and \"School's out\". Alice Cooper is at his macabre best, sensuous and morbid in this elaborate rock production. Also features the voice of Vincent Price as the spider. Music conceived by Alice Cooper, Dick Wagner, Bob Ezrin and choreography by David Winters."
