        "To fight the good fight, British soldiers in Southeast Asia will need to laugh the good laugh. That's where Major Giles Flack (John Cleese) and his morale-boosting theatrical troup led by the gloriously high-camp Acting Captain Terri Dennis (Denis Quilley) come in. The war and the show must go on! A farcical musical comedy underscored by the realities of war. Screenplay and lyrics by Peter Nichols based on his own play \"Privates on parade\", music composed and conducted by Denis King. Cast also includes Nicola Pagett, Patrick Pearson, Joe Melia, Simon Jones, Michael Elphick, John Standing. Executive producer - George Harrison (Beatles). Contains b&w scenes."
