        "Looks at the world of six first generation Australian children from different national backgrounds who have formed genuine friendships across cultural boundaries. The film suggests that at this level many of the prejudices that have existed in the Australian community are being broken down and the concept of a genuine multicultural society is quite possibly becoming a reality. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
