        "Based on the famous O. Henry short story, this humorous film captures the atmosphere of the 1920's in its settings and spirited music score. Two shabby and inept con men think that kidnapping the banker's son in a sleepy Alabama town and holding him for two thousand dollars ransom will be easy money. But young Johnny (Red Chief) drives them to distraction with his antics. Cutting short the kidnapping, they rush to the designated spot to pick up the money - only to find the tables again turned."
