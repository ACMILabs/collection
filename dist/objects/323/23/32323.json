        "Ida decides to make a film about garbage and enter it in a children's filmmaking festival. She receives a notice that her film has been selected as a finalist, but the jury has decided that Ida's film is about war. She is in a dilemma - should she tell the awards committee the truth or remain silent? She decides to go to the awards and take her chances. When she wins first prize she steps forward and tells the audience and the judges the true story. Truth and Ida both win."
