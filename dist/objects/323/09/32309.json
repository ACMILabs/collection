        "It was one of the most sensational get-rich-quick schemes heard of in a long time, but it eventually burst over the head of its originator, John Law. This \"rags to riches to rags\" story, in which the plan was to open a bank and exchange banknotes (paper!) for gold at wildly inflated share prices, ends when John Law, having been cleaned out as a result of a rush to cash in the notes, is left broke and broken-hearted. Animated by Richard Condie, Sharon Condie, Gordon Manson. Music by Patrick Godfrey. Sound by Bill Eakin and Ken Page. Voice and Narration by Stanley Jackson. (Award: Tampare)"
