        "Episode of Series \"Stories Round the World\". Upon her mother's death a young Chinese girl is left alone to care for her infant brother. Against a background of the colourful city of Hong Kong, this film depicts their travels to reach an unknown aunt, only to discover that family struggling to make ends meet. In desperation the girl is driven to theft, but through the efforts of an understanding Confucian scribe she is saved from disgrace and learns a valuable lesson in human relations."
