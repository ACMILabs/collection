        "The problems of inner city redevelopment. Change has become the hallmark of older cities, as old buildings are demolished to make way for the new high-rise edifices of today's developers. However many citizens are appalled by the change and have formed Citizens Actions Groups to let the administrative officers know of their opposition. Details of some action groups are shown in Sydney, Montreal and Brussels"
