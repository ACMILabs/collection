        "Kenneth Carr, a young executive in a multinational company, is facing the prospect of divorce. The audience is invited to become involved with him and to participate in a story centred around his emotional and sexual life. This expectation is frustrated when Kenneth's solicitor jumps out of his fictional role and, adopting the manner of a neutral, authoritative expert, invites the audience instead to absorb useful facts. These are mainly to do with family law and finance; the Carr's marriage is treated as convenient case history. The solicitor's account is supplemented by various images and by short interventions from people connected with the couple. These are introduced as if their purpose was illustrative but rather than reinforce his words, they begin to contradict them and to offer alternative interpretations. Through the couple, interest is focused on the complexities of a hierarchy determined both by class and sex."
