        "This film, designed primarily for teachers in training, has been compiled to demonstrate the possibilities of film as a teaching tool. It consists of excerpts from 18 films, selected because they illustrate the properties peculiar to film for communicating information and ideas. The excerpts are arranged in four groups which illustrate the contribution film can make to four kinds of educational situation: demonstrating practical skills; providing a visual description; organising knowledge and stimulating the imagination."
