        "Louis James hated school, and never learned to read or spell. All he wanted to do was get a job and make a lot of money. Into the rubbish bin went his books and he headed to town to find a job. He applied as a pilot for a skywriting company but he soon found that his spelling mistakes were too big and too apparent. His job hunting went from the embarrassingly bad to the horrendous as the determined dropout discovers for himself the real value of reading and spelling, whether in school or out. Animated film."
