        "The film examines the positive, creative process of an art project with 4th, 5th and 6th grade students, handicapped and non-handicapped. An honest instructor expresses his initial doubts about teaching a \"mainstreamed\" class. Deaf and blind students participate with the aid of sign language interpreters and sighted students' oral descriptions. Students are given information on the historical usage of clay through slides and a trip to a local museum. An artist, Maynard Fishler, visits the classroom to discuss his work. Throughout the project, a multi-sensory approach is used. The students decide to interpret transportation with clay, each student developing his own personal communication. The clay sculptures are the visual, concrete expression of a successful learning experience for all. Communication and creativity on may levels are results no less important."
