        "Nigeria has the highest death rate in the world. 90% of children die from preventable diseases - fever (malaria) convulsions, diarrhoea, vomiting, bronchopneumonia, measles and malnutrition. In mothers, the majority of deaths are related to pregnancy and child-bearing. Written in a feminist perspective, the film explores the subject of male dominance in the home and the re-education of both men and women in informed decision-making to help save children's lives. The film also shows the primary health care services available in various parts of Nigeria which use specially trained community health workers in an expanded role. Discusses what needs to be the focus for any health-planning. Narrated by Professor O. Ransome-Kuti."
