        "Looks at Yaacov Agam, one of the world's foremost Kinetic artists, who uses modernistic and moveable geometric designs in free moving metals, to depict his concept of life and of Judaism. Also deals with Agam's unique concept of space and reality. Filmed in Israel, Paris and New York, his paintings and sculptures are shown. Music by Abraham Kaplan."
