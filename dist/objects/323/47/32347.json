        "Wendy Herstead, an eager teenager, is sure her beautiful sorrel horse Kick would win the Barrel Race event in the August rodeo, but her mother refuses to allow Wendy to enter. Wendy desperately schemes to raise the money for the entry fees and refuses to believe that Kick really isn't a good barrel horse. Both mother and daughter learn important lessons about forcing people and animals into undesired roles."
