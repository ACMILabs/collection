        "The trees which protect us are in imminent danger. If we don't speak now in defence of our remaining forests, we betray our own future. Judith Wright This program deals with the importance of forest preservation in all parts of the world as they are the life support systems for tree dwelling animals. By saving the trees we are also savings the various species which inhabit them. Groups of monkeys, apes and primitive lemurs at the Royal Melbourne Zoo are intimately observed feeding, caring for their young, grooming and communicating with each other. These primates are contrasted with Australia's tree dwelling animals, the koala, lace monitor, the grey-headed fruit bat and the green tree frog. Photographed by Frank Few and Rob McCubbin, narrated by Desley Blanch and featuring music composed and performed by Don Burrowes and aboriginal music by the Bwung-Gul Aboriginal Culture Group. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
