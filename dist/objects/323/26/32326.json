        "Episode of Series \"Learning to be human\". Follows the progress of a group of senior high school students who undertake a marriage course lasting one semester. After being arbitrarily assigned a marriage partner, the couples are required to work out a suitable budget, undertake shopping trips to price basic items and generally come to terms with differing likes and dislikes. Each \"family\" must also meet a crisis: a baby, a loss of job, or a prison term for theft. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
