        "A non-narrated look at the manufacture of nails, juxtaposing highly mechanised factory production with the slower outputs of a small business and a single blacksmith. The blacksmith is seen labouring at his forge, shaping nails from single strands of steel rods. The scene shifts from this peaceful setting to the roar of a twentieth century mill, where banks of machines draw, cut and pound the steel rods faster than the eye can follow. These diametrically opposed scenes emphasise the changed relationship between the individual and his work. (Awards: New York, Chicago, Toronto)"
