        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". Part One of a series which examines the main themes in world architecture today. The series looks at the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate, and introduces some younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. Against a background of disenchantment with modern architecture throughout the world, and the justifiable belief that modern cities are a failure, the series starts by outlining the exciting changes that are now taking place, and examining what has brought them about."
