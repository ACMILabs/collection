        "A lucky combination of talents gave this romantic thriller, set in war-torn Vienna, an almost poetic quality and an excitement which has kept it vivid. The photogenic ruins provided a suitable background for the four star actors: Joseph Cotton, Valli, Trevor Howard and Orson Welles. Graham Greene wrote a bitter, well-timed script adapted from his own novel, Robert Krasker lovingly photographed and Carol Reed directed every scene with the surest of touches and then there was the insistent zither music by Anton Karas."
