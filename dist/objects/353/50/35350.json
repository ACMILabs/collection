        "Shrouded in darkness and fog is the huge mansion called Xanadu. We pass through the iron gates which forbid our entry and approach the grotesque structure. In a dark room, an old man, the master of the extravagant folly, lies dying. As his life ebbs away, a crystal ball containing a snow scene crashes to the floor and is shattered. He utters one plaintive whisper \"Rosebud\". Now we are beginning one of the most fantastic experiences of all time - the masterpiece and first feature written, produced and directed by Orson Welles. Rated: PG"
