        "In the suspenseful tradition of \"The Naked City\", and drawn from the documented files of L.A.P.D. Homicide files, \"He Walked by Night\" is a first class suspense thriller about a desperate burglar who turns into a cop killer and is hounded down by the police. Richard Basehart is brilliant as the fearless fugitive."
