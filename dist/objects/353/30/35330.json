        "The magical world of Brigadoon casts a spell in this exuberant Scottish village that rises out of the Highland mists for just one day in every century. Gene Kelly and Van Johnson star as two jaded New Yorkers who come to Scotland on a hunting expedition and stumble upon the elusive 18th century village. There Kelly falls in love with Brigadoon's prettiest lass, Fiona, played by Cyd Charisse, and he must decide whether to stay with her forever or return to civilisation. Rating: G"
