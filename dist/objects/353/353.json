        "This humourous 2D hand-drawn animation is also a hard-luck story of a man locked in a fortified jail in the middle of the ocean. He receives instructions on how to escape and sets about to dig himself out. Bearing a strong resemblance to the animated character, Mr. Garrison from Southpark, the prisoner crawls through his tunnel to find he's landed on a deserted and barren island and is no better off, a possible play on the plot-line of Pappillon."
