        "Here is a cavalcade of the most hair-raising pursuits in film from the silent era: features sequences from \"The Great Train Robbery\" by pioneer Edwin S Porter; D.W.Griffith's \"Way Down East\" with Lillian Gish; \"The Mark of Zorro\" starring Douglas Fairbanks Snr; Buster Keaton's \"The General\" and many others. It is an exciting, funny and classic treat for young and old alike about the silent era. Rated: G"
