        "Alan McGilvray has been Australia's most celebrated cricket commentator for the best part of three generations. He retired at the end of the 1985 Australian tour of England, having broadcast 225 test matches in a unique career in radio, which began in 1935. To millions he was simply the voice of cricket, a symbol of the Australian summer. McGilvray toured the world with Australian teams and for half a century he made cricket on radio an integral part of the Australian way of life. Rated: G"
