        "This landmark film, based on Margaret Mitchell's mammoth novel, won eight Academy Awards. The siege of Atlanta and the hardships of the South during the Civil War are masterfully unfolded in this terrific spectacle. Vivien Leigh's performance as the headstrong Scarlett O'Hara is magical, and Clark Gable makes the ladies' hearts flutter as Rhett Butler. Supported by Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, the stars make this part spectacle, part history an epic entertainment."
