        "This production of Verdi's much-loved masterpiece was a triumphant success when it opened at La Scala in December, 1985 and Luciano Pavarotti's long awaited performance as Radames was greeted with rapturous applause. In this live recording of that production Pavrotti heads an exceptional cast, with Ghena Dimitrova, Maria Chiara, Nicolai Ghiaurov and Juan Pons, all in peak form. Lorin Maazel conducts the Orchestra of La Scala, Milan. Rated: G"
