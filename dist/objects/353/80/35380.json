        "James Stewart stars as naive young Jefferson Smith, the well-loved head of a chain of boys' clubs, who is unwittingly set up by a group of unscrupulous politicians and sent to Washington as a Senator. He is expected to vote as the party machine dictates and so ease the passage of a fraudulent Bill. Jeff discovers the double-deal and the normally mild mannered good guy turns into a veritable \"house on fire\" to attack the web of corruption that surrounds him."
