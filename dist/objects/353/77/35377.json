        "parlor, Bedroom and Bath, stars Buster Keaton in one of his rare talkies, a masterpiece of comedy in which our disaster prone hero is mistaken for a rich playboy and becomes romantically involved with two high society sisters. Largely filmed in Keaton's own home, \"Parlor, Bedroom and Bath\" typically depicts Keaton's knack of portraying the wacky side of life."
