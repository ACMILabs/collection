        "In the eaves, the tunnels, the trap doors and the back stairs of the Paris Opera House a menacing figure watches. Captivated by the beautiful diva, Christine, the Phantom of the Opera is trapped by his hideous appearance hidden behind his cloak and mask. A beautifully animated adaptation of the ageless classic tale for children of all ages."
