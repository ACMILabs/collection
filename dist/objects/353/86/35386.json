        "Joe Leahy's Neighbours is a film of truly compelling interest, one of the greatest documentaries made in Australia in recent years. Fashioned from the material shot by Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson during an extended stay in the Papua New Guinea highlands, it presents a portrait of a society only slowly adjusting to the demands of a modern world - a society caught between ancient tribal loyalties and the sharp business practices of the twentieth century. Rated: G"
