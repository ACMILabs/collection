        "This is a companion to the documentaries 'Stockman's Strategy' and 'Collum Calling Canberra'. Sunny Bancroft, the Aboriginal manager of a co-operative cattle station in northern New South Wales is the central 'character' in what is the most narratively-oriented of the trilogy. We follow Sunny as he indulges his passion for horses by acquiring and training a galloper for the picnic races."
