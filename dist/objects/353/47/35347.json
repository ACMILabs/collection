        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". A comedy with two main plots. One concerns the love affair between Beatrice and Benedict, the other deals with the conspiracy against Claudio who is engaged to Beatrice's gentle cousin, Hero. Don John, who hates Claudio stages a pretended assignation between Borachio, one of his followers, and Margaret, Hero's maid, who is garbed as her mistress. Claudio, who witnesses the scene and suspects Hero's virtue, rejects his bride at the altar, but the matter is finally cleared up, with the help of the good Friar Francis."
