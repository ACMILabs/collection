        "Based on Charles Dickens great novel, \"A Tale of Two Cities\" is a tale of turbulent times - the French revolution, recreated in breathtaking scale and painstaking detail. And it is a timeless tale - the story of two men in love with the same woman. Ronald Colman stars in what is perceived as the best role he ever played. \"A Tale of Two Cities\" is a tale of romance and revolution, politics and passion, but most of all it is a true classic for all time."
