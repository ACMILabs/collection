        "A hunter lies wounded in Africa and while waiting for help looks back over his life and loves. Hollywood version of a portable Hemingway, with reminiscences of several novels stirred into a lush and sprawling mix of action and romance, open spaces and smart salons. A big popular star film of its time. Starring Gregory Peck, Susan Hayward and Ava Gardner."
