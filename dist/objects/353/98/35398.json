        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". Part Six of a series which examines the main themes in world architecture today. The series looks at the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate, and introduces some younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. Part Six introduces Japan's thriving architecture industry. Isozaki and Maki are building throughout the world. Other Japanese architects are creating a minimal architecture which is both personal and beautiful. What can be learnt from their cerebral designs?"
