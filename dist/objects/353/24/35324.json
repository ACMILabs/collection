        "The cornerstone of success relies on the ability of divers to perform, in competition, the required dives with excellence and precision. Dives are required to perform a certain number of fundamental dives and selection of these dives is very much luck of the draw. There are several basic groups from which selection is made, Forward, Backward, Reverse, Inward, Twisting and each diver is expected to demonstrate the simplest dive from whichever group is chosen. Tim Moore, Cindy McIngval and Chris Loock demonstrate basic and more advanced dives."
