        "This film charts the rapid rise to fame of Maria Callas and offers a glimpse into the private life of this remarkable woman - her marriage to Meneghini, her disastrous and humiliating affair with Aristotle Onassis, and her emotional collapse in the last ten years of her life, which she lived more or less silently, in desperate loneliness. The film includes extensive archive film, location filming in Athens, Rome, Milan and New York and London and interviews with those who witnessed her rise and fall. Rated: G"
