        "Five marriageable daughters! What's a mother to do? What's a father to do? What are we to do? Laugh, cry and become totally entranced by \"Pride and Prejudice\", Jane Austen's classic comedy of manners. Adapted for the screen by Aldous Huxley, this energetic film stars Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. Also starring are Edmund Gwenn, Mary Boland, Maureen O'Sullivan and Ann Rutherford. The beautiful costumes are by renown designer Adrian."
