        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". Part Five of a series which examines the main themes in world architecture today. The series looks at the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate, and introduces some younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. Part Five deals with Berlin. The International Architecture Exhibition in Berlin in 1987, was a most important event in modern town planning, and the exhibition had a theme - the city once again as a space for living."
