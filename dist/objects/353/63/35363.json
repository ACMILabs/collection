        "Includes excerpts from \"The Bank Dick\" this is WC Fields at his best. Portraying small town inventor Sam Bisbee whose works (eg. a keyhole finder for drunks) have brought him only poverty. His daughter is in love with the son of the town snob. Events conspire to ruin his bullet-proof tire just as success seems near. Another of his inventions prohibits him from committing suicide, so Sam decides to go on living."
