        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". Part Two of a series which examines the main themes in world architecture today. The series looks at the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate, and introduces some younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. Part Two looks at the most influential buildings and architects of the 1980s, loosely grouped under the new architectural expressions such as \"post-modern\", \"high-tech\", and \"rationalism\"."
