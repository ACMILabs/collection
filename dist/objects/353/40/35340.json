        "H.G. Wells' classic vision of the future comes strikingly to life in \"The Time Machine\", one of the best science fiction films ever made, and winner of an Academy Award for its extraordinary special effects. Rod Taylor is the time traveller who aims his machine into the distant future, only to find a civilisation thoroughly devitalised by centuries of endless wars. Filled with action and thought-provoking ironies, \"The Time Machine\" is without doubt a superb, fascinating and timeless adventure. Co-starring Yvette Mimieux, Sebastian Cabot and Alan Young. Screenplay by David Duncan, based on the novel by H. G. Wells."
