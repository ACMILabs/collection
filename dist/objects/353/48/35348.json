        "When Bernard Shaw saw this film of his play Pygmalion, he said to Wendy Hiller who plays Eliza Doolittle, \"You've nearly wiped my old play off the map.\" And you will be impressed and moved by her wonderful portrayal of one of the most famous characters in 20th century theatre. Leslie Howard who co-directed the film with Anthony Asquith, gives a fresh, witty and incisive performance as Professor Higgins."
