        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". Part Four of a series which examines the main themes in world architecture today. The series looks at the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate, and introduces some younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. Part Four deals with \"communal spaces\". All over the world pedestrian precincts, shopping malls and hotel lobbies are replacing the traditional village squares. Architects have realised that more places are required to satisfy people's love of spectacle. From America are coming new atrias, open spaces for people to gather. Everywhere new museums are being built that are no longer just housing the treasures of the past: they have become places for social and community activities."
