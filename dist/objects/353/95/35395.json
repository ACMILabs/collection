        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Architecture at the Crossroads Series\". Part 3 of a series which examines the main things in world architecture today. The series looks at the work of architects who are at the centre of the current debate, and introduces some younger architects who are beginning to make a name for themselves. Part 3 looks at the Arab world and into new architecture and in particular, at Kuwait, Doha and Jeddah, where architects from all over the world are creating Universities, Parliament Buildings and Stock Exchanges. Gradually second rate Western imports are being replaced by indigenous architecture that is helping these countries to find their own identities."
