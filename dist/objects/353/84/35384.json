        "One of the most acclaimed Broadway musicals of all time is brought to the screen with the aid of the brilliant and electrifying Liza Minnelli. For entertainment as its very best you can't go past \"Cabaret\" - a scintillating musical with pure gold of human drama beneath its surface glitter. A one-of-a kind musical. Based on Christopher Isherwood's Berlin stories."
