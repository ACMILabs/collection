        "Zeus and Hera's son, Hercule's is stolen by the henchmen of the evil Hades. He manages to survive and is sent to earth to live as a mere mortal, his parents watching from the heavens. Life on earth isn't happy for Hercules, he's ridiculed about his strength and nicknamed 'Jerkules'. On a journey to discover his identity he finds out that he is a son of the gods, but to regain a place in heaven he has to prove himself a hero on earth. The task is not as easy as he first thought, with a beautiful damsel, Meg, manipulated by Hades trying to make him fail. Through attempting to prove himself a hero, Hercules discovers that being famous may gain him a place in heaven but love on earth is more rewarding. Features the voices of Tate Donovan, Danny De Vito, Susan Egan, Rip Torn, Samantha Eggar, Bobcat Goldthwait and Charlton Heston as the narrator."
