        "So that people who have had no opportunity of seeing Shakespeare's plays staged may see leading English actors in a full-scale stage production, these excerpts from \"Julius Caesar\" have been filmed, sponsored by the British Council. The cast includes Leo Genn as Marc Antony; Felix Aylmer as Brutus; and John Slater, Emrys Jones, Frederick Cooper, Ben Williams, Grqace Allardyce, Arthur Hambling and Sydney Monckton among the other players."
