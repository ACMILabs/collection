        "One day a man walks into a house where his innocence, his youth and his life are at stake. Within the house is an exceedingly beautiful young girl and her mysterious, alluring and dangerous mother. A powerful husband. A hired killer. A threatening atmosphere where nothing is as it seems. Sex and power; possession and manipulation; desire and despair; death in a French garden. In French with English subtitles."
