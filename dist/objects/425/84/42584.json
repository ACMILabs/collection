        "This program documents the impact of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. It particularly focuses on the role of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo. He believes that he should be outspoken about the atrocities suffered by the people of East Timor because of the Indonesian occupation. The video comments on the feelings of East Timorese people and attitudes and methods of control used by the Indonesians. The format consists of film footage depicting life in East Timor: a commentary and interviews with Bishop Belo, the Indonesian General Herman Mantiri and East Timorese people. Suitable for Middle-Upper Secondary students. A longer version of this program is held in the collection as title: A Portrait of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo"
