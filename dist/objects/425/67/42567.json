        "A behind the scenes look at Peter Combe's video clip, \"Mr Spook\" (produced by Carol Combe). You get to see the make-up, lighting, how the spooky special effects are created, as well as meeting the children who appear in the film clip; Fergus, Christopher, Rosie, Alice, Emily and Thomas. Mr Spook is superbly accompanied by The Australian String Quartet and filmed on location at the Carclew Youth Youth Arts Centre, North Adelaide. An entertaining program for Peter Combe fans as well as those children interested in the technical side of film making."
