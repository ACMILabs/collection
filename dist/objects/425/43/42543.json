        "Baz Luhrmann, director of \"Strictly Ballroom\" tells the greatest love story of all time in our time. William Shakespeare's classic tale of star-crossed lovers is set in Verona Beach; a violent modern city of guns, money and greed. In this opulent world of hate, rival gangs, and families at war Romeo and Juliet are ignited by the passion of forbidden first love and Verona Beach explodes. Shakespeare's heart wrenching tale of doomed love is told with passion, beauty, wit and furious energy. It's a film that will kick you in the heart."
