        "Augusto's best friends are the birds that he talks to in the park while seeking refuge from his crazy and constantly arguing parents. After his father kills himself by jumping off the local bell-tower, Augusto reluctantly takes over the management of his family's Mother-of-Pearl button factory, which in accordance with his own ecological beliefs, he refuses to industrialize. In his new workplace he is seduced by the ambitious Palmira, who he eventually marries, and who has him committed to a lunatic asylum where he meets the woman of his dreams, the ecologically-minded Serafina. In Italian language with no English subtitles."
