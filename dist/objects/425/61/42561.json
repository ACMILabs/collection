        "This tape features three films from the award winning Estonian animation director and political cartoonist, Priit Parn. An artist who uses animation to satirise and parody the old Soviet system and the conflicting outcomes of Perestroika. His films are rich with repetition and allusion, and as with much Eastern European animation, is laden with symbolism. \"Time out\" follows the antics of a hero cat (produced by Hille Koosk); \"Breakfast on the grass\" provides a parallel with Manet's work and reveals bureaucracy at its most malign (produced by Tallinnfilm); \"Hotel E\" explores the process of Glasnost, using a hotel setting as a metaphor for East and West (produced by Olav Osolin)."
