        "Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale) seeks assistance from her family after being left a high society orphan. After much deliberation and offers she decides to accept the offer from the Starkadders of Cold Comfort Farm. With romantic notions of writing the great novel, Flora moves to the ramshackle farm for inspiration. What awaits her is a surprising but entertaining household of eccentrics, led by the appropriately named matriach, Ada Doom. Flora keeps in touch with the society she left by regular correspondence with her friend Mrs Smiling (Joanna Lumley) and is able to exert a positive influence over the farm as love, fortune and a new attitude towards life are discovered. This culminates in a surprising wedding. Based on the 1932 novel by Stella Gibbons and with a screenplay by Malcolm Bradbury this uplifting comedy of manners also features Eileen Atkins, Sheila Burrell, Stephen Fry, Ian McKellen and Rufus Sewell."
