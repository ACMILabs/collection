        "Ida Nudel, played by Liv Ullmann in one of the finest performances of her career, is a Russian scientist, a violinist and a Jew. She dearly loves her sister Elena, and Juli, a young poet interned as a dissident. She loves the synagogue, she even loves her ex-husband. But most of all she loves Russia, and does not want to leave. As the Jewish persecutions grow more violent she finally decides the time has come to leave Russia, for her personal safety. Through all her trials and tribulations her old spirit remains unbroken and she becomes an inspiration to a whole generation of Russian Jews."
