        "Celebrated author Margaret Clark discusses this most fundamental topic. Margaret reads from one of her books to illustrate key points. Also helping to provide interest in what can be perceived as a boring topic, is a leading Melbourne comedian and mime artist, Richard Jones. The program is funny, highly informative and definitely not boring! Suitable for Primary-Lower Secondary level students."
