        "Carlo, a self-employed industrial engineer is held at gunpoint by a gang of hoodlums while he is queueing at the local post office. In a struggle to conceal his money from the thugs he is beaten senseless, abducted, and left for dead in their abandoned getaway vehicle. When the local police fail to act on his behalf, Carlo decides to take the matter into his own hands, firstly through his lawyer (who is helpless to assist him), then by his own less legitimate devices. Cast includes Franco Nero and Barbara Bach. In Italian with no English subtitles."
