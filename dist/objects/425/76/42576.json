        "Flavia, a rich and beautiful young society woman flees from an outlandish party, when she discovers her presence there served only to secure a business deal for her violent over-bearing lover Danilo. Attempting to leave her predicament on the first available train, Flavia seeks refuge in a small railway station where she meets Domenico, a shy and modest station-master who offers her both moral support and shelter from the impending storm. While spending the night together awaiting the arrival of the morning train, the pair become hopelessly drawn to each other despite their apparent class differences. In Italian language with English subtitles."
