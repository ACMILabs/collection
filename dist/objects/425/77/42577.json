        "The High Court's Wik and the subsequent action by the government to, as the PM said, restore the pendulum, has caused great division in the Australian community. Unfortunately, much of the heat in the debate has been caused by ignorance and widespread lack of understanding of the Aborigines' case. In this high quality video, the basics of the Wik Decision and the federal government's answer: the now infamous 10 Point Plan and the legislation introduced into parliament late in 1997 are explained simply and concisely. Suitable for Middle Secondary to Tertiary level students."
