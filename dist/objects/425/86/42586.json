        "This is a three-part tour de force featuring three of Italy's best known comic actors coping with the trials and tribulations of love and sex. In the first story, Paolo Villagio plays an Italian immigrant who unwittingly becomes an entertainer in an Amsterdam porno parlour to make ends meet. The second story tells of a middle-aged man (Nino Manfredi) who is introduced to the permissive world of today's youth by his teenage dughter and the daughter of an overnight visitor from Sweden. The third story features Roman comedian Alberto Sordi as a Monsignor and Stefania Sandrelli as a young lady who become accidentally locked in an elevator together on a warm mid-summer's bank holiday. In Italian with no subtitles."
