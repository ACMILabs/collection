        "Animated version of the classic novel by Anna Sewell. Black Beauty has a good start in life. He is raised in the scenic English countryside, is taught by his mother to be a friend to man, and has a good master, Squire Gordon, and stableman, John Manley. Beauty's view of the world is tarnished by Ginger, the mare who shares the stable, who is bitter and disappointed with mankind and urges Beauty to believe her sentiments. When Beauty is sold it appears that Ginger was right, as his new owners treat him as a job horse. It is only through Black Beauty's courage and faith, instilled in him through his upbringing that Beauty learns to appreciate mankind again. Features the voices of David Gregory, Laurie Mann, Mike Evans and Barbara Stevens."
