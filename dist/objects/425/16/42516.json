        "Since the space age began, the U.N. has been concerned with using \"outer space\" technology for the benefit of the developing, as well as the advanced nations. As examples of peaceful applications of the new technology, the film shows how orbiting satellites bring instructional television to India, survey a rain forest and search the Altiplano for minerals in Bolivia and monitor a typhoon in the Phillippines."
