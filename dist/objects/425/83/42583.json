        "The central objective of this program is to encourage students to develop their analytical skills in visual literacy. The program looks at how to analyse the non-print text of newspaper images. Using \"The Age\" as a case study it examines the production of photography, cartoons and graphic design, the process of choice and editorial decision making, how to critically analyse the meaning of these images and what shapes that meaning. It also informs students about the way media images are generated and deepens theit appreciation of the selective way the world is represented through newspapers. Suitable for Upper Secondary-Tertiary students."
