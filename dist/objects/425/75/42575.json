        "John Knot is a man of the world and a lover of freedom and adventure. After years of reporting on wars, he devotes himself to reporting on the \"plague of the century\", AIDS. Years ago while working together in Lebanon, John and Massimo, a young Italian photographer, met a woman photographer, Joelle. She and John had an affair and then suddenly one day she disappeared. Whilst travelling the world with Masimo, pretending to be HIV positive in order to record reactions from different people, he meets Joelle again in a Paris newspaper office. They make a vow never to separate again, but fate has other plans for them. Starring Rutger Hauer, Natassja Kinski, Faye Dunaway, Peter O'Toole and Lorraine Bracco. Costumes designed by Gianni Versace."
