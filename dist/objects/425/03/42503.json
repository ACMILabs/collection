Part one 'Length' sees Al investigating the \"The Case of the missing running shoe\" to solve the mystery of length, using only a metre stick. Part two 'Mass' has Al investigating what mass is. He learns to measure Mass and Matter using a tool for this, a balance. He learns that matter has mass and weight, but weight may change depending on the location of the matter.
