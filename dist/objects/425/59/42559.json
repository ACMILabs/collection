        "Screenwriter George Baxt combines the \"Psycho\" gimmick of killing the apparent heroine at the beginning of the film with elements of the Salem witches story thrown in for added spine tingling suspense. Professor Driscoll (Christopher Lee) sends Nan (Venetia Stevenson), one of his students, to Whitewood, Massachusetts to research local legends of witchcraft. In the decaying village she is used as a human sacrifice by the witches coven. Nan's boyfriend and brother go to look for her, and discover an entire village full of zombie-like creatures dressed in monastic habits. The finale is so full of intrigue that you must see this ghoulish epic for yourself."
