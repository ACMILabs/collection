Alex managed to escape to Australia with 1 million dollars and PC. Before his death Alex attaches a computer disc to PC's collar and sends him off to a friend. PC ends up in the care of her neighbour, Zac. Through the assistance of a computer which translates dog noises into a human voice, Zac and PC become quickly become friends as they try and avoid Anja and find the 1 million dollars before her. Also starring Norman Kaye, Sandy Gore, Caroline Gillmer, Emilie Francois and Billy Connolly as the voice of PC."
