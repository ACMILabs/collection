        "The story of two elderly sisters-in-law, Mollie and Jessie Brereton who have lived together most of their adult lives. Through necessity rather than choice, for the most part. Each year they make a Christmas Cake for their families. This is a very touching portrait of love, hate, compromise and companionship, lovingly compiled by two grandchildren of the ladies."
