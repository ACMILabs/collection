        "Fear eats the soul is prolific German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder's unsentimental interpretation of Douglas Sirk's \"All that heaven allows\". In this tough blend of social realism and Hollywood melodrama, Fassbinder examines racism and class in the love affair between an elderly German widow (Brigitte Mira) and a young Arab immigrant (played by Fassbinder's lover at the time El Hedi ben Salem) which is met with hostility and derision from their family and friends. Considered the leading director of the 'new German cinema', Fassbinder had already dealt with this subject matter in his 1970 feature \"The American soldier\". Winner of the International critics prize, Cannes Film Festival 1974. In German with English subtitles."
