        "In the 1930s and 11-year-old Sicilian boy, Acla, is sold to a sulphur miner, and for five years from Monday to Saturday, the boy is made the miner's property, spending the whole week down the mine, going home on Saturday and Sunday. There he experiences the inhuman world of the sulphur mines, the stifling, choking tunnels and the physical and sexual violence that everybody indulges in by unspoked agreement. He attempts several escapes, but each time he is caught and beaten. Until the last attempt, when finally he reaches the sea. And freedom... In Italian language with English subtitles."
