        "Ingrid Bergman plays Karin, a World War II refugee who marries and Italian fisherman to escape a displaced persons camp. As they set off for his home, the Meditteranean island of Stromboli, her head is filled with romantic notions of an idyllic paradise. When they arrive, however, her dreams are immediately shattered as she is faced with a desolate, barren landscape and the dominating presence of a threatening volcano. The atmosphere from other women in the village also adds to her depression, as they make it clear that her immodesty disgusts them. Filled with unforgettable images and a fishing scene that ranks as one of cinema's greatest."
