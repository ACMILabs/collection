        "In this film Godard appears fascinated less by the Rolling Stones' rebel-rock image (the Stone-as-product) than he is with their process of composition. Through its hovering concentration, the camera tracking and panning acrosss each member of the band, this emerges as one of the most detailed, revealing rock documentaries ever made. The film is a collage of the Rolling Stones rehearsing the song \"Sympathy with the Devil\", Black Power revolutionaries and a TV interview with one Eve Democracy, is a key film from the period following the '68 uprising when there was 'something in the air' and stands as a model of political film-making during changing times."
