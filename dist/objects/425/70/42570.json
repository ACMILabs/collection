        "Oceans make up about four-fifths of the Earths surface, and there are many kinds of birds that spend their lives roaming these vast expanses between continents, seldom finding themselves even within sight of land. Many come ashore only to nest. In size these ocean wanderers range from the albatrosses - some with wingspans nearing three metres, among the largest birds that fly - to the tiny storm-petrel, little bigger than a starling. This video tells the story of a cross-section of some of the more common and representative of these fascinating ocean wanderers. Birds discussed are: Wandering Albatross; Providence Petrel; Black-winged Petrel; Flesh-footed Shearwater; Wedge-tailed Shearwater; Australasian Gannet; Masked Booby; Sooty Tern; Grey Noddy; Brown Noddy; White Tern; Red-tailed Tropicbird."
