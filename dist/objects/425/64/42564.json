        "The classic story of Dorothy who is swept away to the magical land of Oz with her uncle and a couple of hired hands by a cyclone on her 18th birthday. Here they meet weird and wonderful characters and enjoy the adventure of a lifetime. This classic children's story by L. Frank Baum was adapted for this early silent feature film by the author's son, five years after his father's death, along with top Hollywood comedian Larry Semon. Unlike the famous Judy Garland version of the story, there are no witches in Semon's film, and the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman and Cowardly Lion are only disguises for other characters to don."
