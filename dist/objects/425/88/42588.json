        "Four humorous vignettes starring and directed by top Italian comic actor Alberto Sordi which take place on the same day. The first tells of a conservative married couple in search of a movie theatre which take place on the same day. The second is about life in a successful magazine company. The third deals with the increasing popularity of sex magazines in Italy. The fourth and final story tells of a 'primadonna' actress constantly throwing tantrums in a film studio. In Italian language with no English subtitles."
