        "This early film by Milos Forman tells the story of a young girl's(Hana Brejchova) infatuation with a pianist (Vladimir Pucholt) with whom she has spent the night. She then leaves the provinces and goes to search for him in Prague. Forman uses this simple theme to present a realist and comic view of 1960's Czechoslovakia, in which he examines young love, the generation gap, and the working of bureaucracy. His unflinchingview of the everyday gave the film a unique quality at the time, but he also observes his characters with warmth and affection, revealing their inner strength in the face of adversity. Besides finding humour in the everyday, he also draws on the traditions of silent comedy. Miroslav Ondricek's (long time Forman collaborator on both his Czech and American features) images have a remarkable resonance and Forman's cast of non-actors provide him with a marvellous gallery of faces. Co-written with Czech filmmaker Ivan Passer. In Czeck, with English sub-titles."
