        "This charming and quirky British romantic comedy stars Hugh Grant and Andy Macdowell as the two lovers who belong together...perhaps! An excellent cast, including an hilarious cameo by Rowan Atkinson as the tongued-tied vicar, \"Four weddings & a funeral\" is unashamedly sentimental, but at the same time reveals not only the \"funny side\" of relationships, but their fragility. As Hugh Grant catapaults from one emotional and social disaster to another, due to an excess of good manners and a very British tendency towards \"keeping a stiff upper lip\", he eventually discovers that the course of true love diverges from his expected course down the altar."
