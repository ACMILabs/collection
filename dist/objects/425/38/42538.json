        "Ren MacCormack (Kevin Bacon) moves to Bomont, a small Midwestern town with his mother (Frances Lee McCain). The town is autocratically run by the local minister, Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow). A fatal car accident has caused the reverend to prohibit music, because of the corruptive influence it has over teenagers. His daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) is opposed to her father's views and is drawn to Ren because of his life in another place where music isn't banned, and for the possibility that he could take her away from Bomont. Ren pushes the boundaries of the Bomont community when he tries to convince the council to allow them to have a dance. Features a great soundtrack with songs from Kenny Loggins and Bonnie Tyler."
