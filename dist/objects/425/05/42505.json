        "Based on Frank Herbert's cult science fiction novel, \"Dune\" follows the fortune of Paul Atreides (Kyle Machlachan), whose family is persecuted by the Emperor (Jose Ferrer) and the evil Baron Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan). Paul and his mother (Francesca Annis) seek refuge in the deserts of the planet Arakis. They join the Fremen who live under the desert sands. Soon the prophecy of a messiah becomes true as Paul leads the Fremen in battle against the forces controlling and manipulating their planet and the precious spice Melange. David Lynch manages to create a sense of the complex dynastical world which Frank Herbert had created in his popular novel, whilst retaining Lynch's love for the bizarre and disturbing. A large international cast provides substance to this film, including Linda Hunt, Sian Phillips, Dean Stockwell, Jurgen Prochnow, Patrick Stewart, Sting and Freddie Jones."
