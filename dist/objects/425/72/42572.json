        "A 'documentary' portrait of the capital which can variously be described as an 'essay' or a 'journal' (an interesting comparison could be made with Jarman's 'essay' - The Last of England). Images of London in 1992 are accompanied by an unnamed fictional narrator, a friend and former lover of Robinson. The latter is attempting to research the city's artistic past and support alternative paths that the city's history might have taken. The film is made up of three 'expeditions' and other mini-journeys on foot. The paths taken are inspired by literary-historical concerns but contemporary political events intrude. The two reflect on how political decisions might impact upon the city's future."
