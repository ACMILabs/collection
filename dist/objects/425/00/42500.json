        "When children need to settle an argument it seems they devise inventive ways of resolving the issue. Take the two groups of children in this film, they resort to a snowball war! They are not restricted by their environment in the use of weapons either, as they grab wooden spoons, garbage lids and anything else at hand. It's a fiercely contested battle as one group of kids takes cover in an enormous snowcastle while the opposition tries to break in. Who will win the war? Original screenplay by Danele Pantenaude and Roger Cantin."
