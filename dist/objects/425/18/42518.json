        "Japan in winter is a busy time of the year with preparations for the celebration of the New Year (Japan's equivalent of Christmas time). This is the time when the most colorful festivals take place all over the country and the people make great preparations for the ceremonies. On New Year's Day the shrines and streets are crowded as millions of Japanese take part in winter celebrations."
