        "In this film Fellini uses the metaphor of a journey to explore what was to become one of his favourite themes - the search for meaning and purpose in life. Gelsomina (Giuletta Masina), a simple-minded peasant girl is sold to the circus strongman, Zampano (Anthony Quinn). As she accompanies him on tour through the countryside, she bercomes the victim of his constant abuse until their meeting with a circus performer (Richard Baseheart) dramatically changes their lives. This was the film that established Fellini as one of the leading lights of European Cinema."
