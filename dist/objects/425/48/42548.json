        "This film follows the drama of an Australian entertainment family, the Wildes. Kit Taylor and June Salter star as mother and son with a domain that stretches beyond the circus tent, encompassing the theatre, a wild animal park and the boardroom jungle. The future of the family seems stable, with the children being groomed to assume a position in the entertainment business. Their future is threatened by an unsavoury affair and a visiting Russian ballet troupe. Also starring Martin Vaughan, Lenore Smith, Warwick Moss, Alan Lee and Ivar Kantis."
