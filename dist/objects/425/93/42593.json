        "The Roman Emperor Tiberius, living in paranoid isolation on the island of Capri, instructs is lieutenant Taurus to go to Palestine and find the missing body of Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified three years earlier. The word is out that Jesus has risen from the dead and Tiberius is both adamant to dispel potentially dangerous rumours and discover the truth for himself. The arrival of the Emperor's inquistor throws the local authorities into alarm since it appears that everyone in the township has a reason to fear abd something to hide, especially the local governor Pontius Pilate. What is the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of the corpse of Jesus? Starring Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel."
