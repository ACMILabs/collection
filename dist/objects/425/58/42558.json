        "The Australian continent has been isolate for a very long time and its animal inhabitants have evolved in isolation to produce a wildlife community very different from that found anywhere else in the world. This video is a sample of Australias unique fauna, with 60 seconds of footage on each animal. Some of the animals will be familiar to everyone, others are not so familiar, but all are distinctively Australian. Animals discussed include: Lyrebird; Cassowary; Bilby; Bandicoot, Gang-gang and the Quoll."
