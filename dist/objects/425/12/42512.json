        "Agent No 326 (Willy Fritsch) a.k.a Det. Donald Tremaine is ordered to stop a spy-ring, but he falls in love with one of the spies, Sonja (Gerda Maurus). No 326 tries to find the head of that organisation. He doesn't know that this is banker Haghi (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), with whom Sonja bets, that No 326 will identify him, because she has fallen in love, too. So Haghi tries everything to confuse the secret service and to neutralize No 326. The granddaddy of all espionage movies. All the elements are here: government secrets, phony disguises, masterful strategies, sabotage, revenge, secret codes, hidden microphones, beautiful female spies, exciting chases and murder! Behind everything is a deranged but brilliant master spy in control of the entire spies network. Director Fritz Lang dishes up a delightful combination of suspiscion, terror and paranoia - a chilling reflection of the nightmarish atmosphere of pre-Hitler Germany. Silent film with English intertitles. Adapted by Thea von Harbou (a long time Lang collaborator and author of \"M\" and \"Mabuse\") from her novel. (Edgar G. Ulmer worked as an uncredited set designer)"
