        "The Southern Ocean is the harshest place on earth. It is the Everest of the oceans and, for centuries, it has been the mariner's ultimate challenge. This documentary reveals Tony Bullimore's struggle to cling to life in the darkness of the freezing hull of his capsized 60ft yacht, Exide Challenger. He was two months into the Vendee Globe Around the World Yacht Race, 1300 miles south of Australia when disaster struck and his yacht overturned in 60ft waves. So began the biggest air sea rescue in the history of the Royal Australian Air Force. It would involve four aircraft, six air crew and one hundred and ninety hours of flying."
