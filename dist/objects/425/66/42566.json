        "Matilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson) is a very special girl with an unfortunate family. While her elder brother goes to school, (Matilda doesn't go to school because her parents think she is 2 years younger than she actually is), her father goes to work as a shonky car salesman (he's being investigated by the FBI) and her mother plays bingo, Matilda educates herself at the local library. Reading provides her with some assurance that she's not alone, but she longs to go to school and meet other children. Matilda's loneliness disappears when she begins school; she makes friends and has a lovely teacher, Miss Honey. The only problem is Miss Honey's horrible aunt, Trunchbowl, headmistress of the school. Matilda is drawn to the kind Miss Honey and together they set about changing their unhappy lives so that they're both in a loving family. With Matilda's magic power that allow her to move objects, anything is possible. Look out nasty parents and evil Trunchbowl! Based on the book by Roald Dahl this is a heartwarming story about how life can change for the better. Starring Mara Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz and Pam Ferris."
