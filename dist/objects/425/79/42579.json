        "The cloning of Dolly the sheep focused world attention on the future of human cloning. Suddenly the possibility seemed much closer. But, as we see in this program, cloning has been going on for years. In 1966 Dr. Joshua Lederberg first cloned tadpoles and since then cloning in the plant and animal kingdom has proceeded at a rapid pace. This program looks at the advantages and disadvantages of cloning and the moral and ethical issues surrounding the scientific possibilities. Includes teachers notes."
