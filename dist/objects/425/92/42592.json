        "When aspiring playwright Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli) is called in as script doctor on a film of The Odyssey, he is caught between a director (Fritz Lang) who wants to capture the reality of Homer's world, and crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance) who just wants more mermaids. As his artistic integrity gradually succumbs to the power of Prakosch's chequebook, his wife Camille (Bardot) regards him with increasing contempt. This video includes the original cinema trailer."
