        "Introduced by Chelsea Brown this tape includes 3 stories. \"Cinderella\"; the classic story with the inclusion of a bumbling knight and an absentminded godmother makes this story an hilariously funny one; \"A Christmas tree\"; based on the Charles Dickens story this tale is about Peter and Mary, two children out to recover the spirit of Christmas; \"Robin Hood\"; Robin Hood is captured by the mean sheriff of Nottingham."
