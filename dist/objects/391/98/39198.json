Five delightfully entertaining tales with unexpected twists are captivatingly told in this selection of animated stories written by David McKee. \"Not now, Bernard\": Bernard's parents are always far too busy to listen to him, even when he tries to tell them that a monster is going to eat him. \"Elmer\": the story of a very special elephant called Elmer. \"The Sad story of Veronica who played the violin\": Veronica is determined to play the violin so she practices day and night until she plays so beautifully that everyone cries. \"The Hill and the rock\": a very strange chain of events begins when Mr. Quest removes the rock from outside his kitchen window. \"Two can Toucan\": a little black bird with no name is ridiculed by all the other jungle animals."
