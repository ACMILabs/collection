        "An air of excited anticipation is everywhere as Pop trims the huge tree with tinsel and lights while the rest of the family festoon the house with paper chains and Christmas baubles. It's a time of peace and goodwill to all men and everything should be right with the world. For some in the village, however, there's little sign of either as Christmas draws near. The Larkins, though, are about to bring happiness to at least one family and put smiles on the faces of two sad little children, with the timely assistance of a certain red-robed and whiskered old gentleman. It's a time for celebration and everyone is invited to share a truly 'perfick' Christmas with the Larkins. Based on the books by H. E. Bates."
