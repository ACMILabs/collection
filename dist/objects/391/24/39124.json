        "Episode of Series \"We all have tales\". Half-alligator and half-snapping turtle with a touch of earthquake thrown in, Davy Crockett is the ultimate backwoods American legend who, at the Alamo, literally brags himself into American history. Nicolas Cage's rip-roaring characterisation of this frontier hero is perfectly matched by the rousing, knee-slapping music of David Bromberg, although smaller children may be frightened by some of the exaggeratedly grotesque illustrations."
