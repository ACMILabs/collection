        "A fascinating tribute to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio and its films, stars and perhaps most importantly, the two perfectionists who were the starmakers and overseers of this movie kingdom - the patriarchal Louis B. Mayer and the \"Boy Wonder\", Irving G. Thalberg, whose foresight and talent shaped the evolution of motion pictures. This programme takes an amazing look at the dream factory which in its heyday produced approximately fifty-two motion pictures each year, created some of the biggest stars in Hollywood history and stayed true to the company's motto of 'art for art's sake'. This definitive history of MGM unfolds through film clips, interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and inside information never before made available. The programme is broken into three segments: part one - \"The Lion's roar\". Part two - \"The Lion reigns supreme\". Part three - \"The Lion in winter\". Hosted by the ever suave Patrick Stewart."
