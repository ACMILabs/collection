        "Tom, a lonely young man who lives in a cramped apartment with his mother, spies on the beautiful Magda - an older woman who lives in a high-rise apartment in the next block. Tom's fascination with Magda turns into a loving obsession and he is determined to meet and be consumed by the object of his obsession. Based on an episode of his acclaimed television series, \"Decalogue\", Kieslowski has crafted a beautifully melancholy movie about the fragility and pathos of love: though of different ages, classes and circumstances, both Tom and Magda share the desire to escape the banality of their lives through the transcendence of human communion."
