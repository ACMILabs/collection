        "Glenda Jackson, a career woman separated from her husband, and Peter Finch, a Jewish doctor, are caught in a love triangle with a young bisexual designer. Although the arrangement appears ideal, the trio must deal with the jealousy, fear and self doubt they encounter. This absorbing character study, originally shocking, is regarded as a forerunner of cinema's increasingly mature treatment of homosexuality. Also stars Peggy Ashcroft."
