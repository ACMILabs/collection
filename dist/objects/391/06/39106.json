        "Featured in this collector's set are two famous films adapted from the works of H. G. Wells. \"Things To Come\": Wells' futuristic vision of impending global war and it's strange effects for mankind. When world war erupts a brilliant scientist decides to start a new 'Scientific Order\" governed by scientists. Stars Ralph Richardson and Raymond Massey. \"The Invisible Man\": This version starring Claude Raines in his film debut is the most faithful to Wells' novel. As with the original novel the film retains the unique blend of horror, strange pathos, sublime black humour and the ever-engaging curiosity. Includes a talk by Orson Welles on \"The War of the worlds\"."
