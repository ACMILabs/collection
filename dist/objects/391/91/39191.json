        "Based on the international best-seller by James Hilton, this Hollywood classic made 'Shangri La' a household word. Ronald Colman, one of the few stars to successfully make the transition from the silent era to \"talkies\", stars as a British consul who, together with a planeload of American and English passengers, flees war-torn China only to be hijacked to Tibet where he is taken to a remote idyllic Utopian community in the Himalayas where he has been chosen to become the next High Lama."
