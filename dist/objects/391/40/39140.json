        "Selected by the Library of Congress as one of the most important films of all time, this multi-Oscar winning classic recounts the problems faced by three veterans returning home after World War II, as they attempt to pick up the threads of their civilian lives. Fine performances by Fredric March, Dana Andrews and real-life amputee Harold Russell, and sensitive direction from William Wyler help to make \"The Best years of our lives\" an unforgettable film experience."
