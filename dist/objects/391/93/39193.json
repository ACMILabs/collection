        "Episode of Series \"Travel, Travel\". Take an armchair ride to Los Angeles - \"City of Angels\", so many images and more than a city it's a lifestyle. From the affluence of Beverley Hills to the ethnic mosaic of old L.A., 50 million visitors a year cannot resist its allure. From this capital of make believe and dazzling attractions, travel to Southern California, to the home of Disneyland - more magical than ever where unexpected pleasures provide thrills for all the family and finally visit Long Beach and see the largest aircraft ever built and attempt to discover the mind behind the man - Howard Hughes."
