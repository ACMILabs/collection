        "Despite knowing her own heart, Anne Elliot allows herself to be \"persuaded\" into rejecting the proposal of Captain Wentworth. After an eight year separation, they meet again. Although still eligible and now prosperous, Wentworth is still bitter and courts the attention of Louisa Musgrove. As is typical of all Austen novels, as Anne and Wentworth undertake the road to matrimony, a small section of a long ago society, with its social mores is exposed. Adapted by Julian Mitchell, this BBC production has the flavour of authenticity and features Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall as the two lovers."
