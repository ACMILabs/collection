        "This unique film, shot when Picasso was 91, (the last pictures taken in his lifetime) reveals many unknown aspects of the work and personality of the greatest painter of our time, and contains over 600 of his works, many never seen in public. Using intimate and exclusive home movies and photos, the film shows Picasso as if he were going through the scrapbook of his life. With many flashback sequences showing the mutations and evolution of his work in progress, we chronologically follow his works and the episodes of his life in parallel. The film is in two parts: 1881-1937 and 1938-1973."
