        "Episode of Series \"Human development: the first 2 1/2 years\". Emphasises individual differences by depicting a wide range of normal physical growth and motor development. Discusses ways in which environmental factors such as nutrition and the mother's health habits during pregnancy affect development. Traces developmental patterns and norms by examining the role of crawling in simultaneously developing both parts of the brain and the sequences of development across cultures and between genders."
