        "It's Christmas Eve in Pontypandy but it's no holiday for the Fire Service! A fresh fall of snow means that Fireman Sam has a busy day. Trevor's bus runs foul of a snow drift, and the children's toboggan ride nearly ends in disaster ... just as well Sam is always on hand to help his friends, and make sure that everyone has a happy and peaceful Christmas. Told by John Alderton."
