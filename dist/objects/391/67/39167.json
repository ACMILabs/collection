        "Episode of Series \"Sweat of the sun, tears of the moon\". Jack Pizzey visits Colombia in 1984. It is a country conquered by the Spanish four centuries before, recovering from a bitter ten year Civil war, \"La Violenza\" and torn by the tensions between an extremely rich upper class minority, and the majority, a poverty stricken underclass who see government as a tool of the rich. Pizzey visits with Colombia's \"peasant\" President, Belisario Betancur, who is faced with the daunting prospect of reform in a country with feudal rural systems, corrupt cocaine barons, economic dependence on a single product (coffee) open to fluctuations in world prices and an alienated population who doubt whether there will be a better tomorrow for them."
