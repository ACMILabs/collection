        "Brum is a miniature 1920's style vintage car. Too small to travel on the roads, Brum prefers the safety of the footpaths and byways. Full of fun - and just a little bit naughty! - Brum's curiosity leads him into all sorts of adventures as he journeys out into the big world. Meet Brum in the following four delightful episodes contained in this video: \"Brum to the rescue\" - Brum rescues a little girl from two bullying children. \"Brum and the kite\" - Learning to fly a kite leads Brum on a funny chase all over town. \"Brum and the car breakers\" - Brum breaks down in a rubbish dump, and is taken to the car breaker's yard. \"Brum at the Opera\" - Brum accidentally finds his way on to the stage during an opera performance."
