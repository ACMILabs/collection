        "An animated celebration of women's biology, its rhythms, power and mystery. Double X presents the concept that biological differences between women and men have shaped our history. Male rituals, according to this view, evolved as a compensation for the inability to bear life. Examines the nature of time, its connections to the rhythms of the body and soul, especially signifigant when examining the role of women in pre-patriarchial society. Thus, women are seen as a creative force in pre-history, in the development of rituals and civilisation. Winner of the Fiction Category, Greater Union Awards, 1986, Sydney Film Festival."
