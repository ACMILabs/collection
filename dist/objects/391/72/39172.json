        "In Stockholm, a trial for murder takes place - the accused is Anna Holm, a notorious woman believed to have murdered her former lover and partner in crime. The story which unfolds is intense, suspenseful and gripping. The climax is riveting. Joan Crawford will amaze you as Anna Holm, a multi-layered characterization posing intriguing emotional and psychological suggestions. The strange relationship between Anna and the sardonic Jorsten Barring is excitingly brought to dramatic life by Joan Crawford and Conrad Veidt. Melvyn Douglas plays Dr. Segert, the plastic surgeon who turns the scarred Anna Holm into a beautiful woman without erasing the scars of her soul. From the play \"Il etait une fois\" by Francis De Croisset."
