        "Joan Crawford stars as prostitute Sadie Thompson, in this version of Somerset Maugham's story of lust in the sultry Pacific. From her first entrance, ring-studded hand on a door jamb, followed by an undulating body in a skin tight checked outfit, Crawford dominates the film as she goes on to seduce Walter Huston's stern straight-laced missionary. The variable quality of the soundtrack is due to the quality of the original film and is not the fault of the video."
