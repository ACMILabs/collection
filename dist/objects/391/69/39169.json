        "Episode of Series \"Sweat of the sun, tears of the moon\". The Amazonian jungle, the largest in the world, covers almost half of South America. For the white man the jungle is a mysterious realm, an El Dorado, that has attracted adventurers and missionaries in search of wealth and souls, ever since the time of Columbus. Jack Pizzey travels through three countries to assess the impact of loggers, gold miners, ranchers, road builders and missionaries on both the Amazonian jungle and the Indians who inhabit it. The question remains, is Western civilisation turning this Eden into Hell?"
