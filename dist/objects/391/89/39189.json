        "After electrifying New York audiences with his stage performances, Marlon Brando excited - even offended the world in the screen version of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" - instantly becoming a Hollywood legend, later accorded the greatest actor of his time. But the image that theatre and cinema made of him did not coincide in anyway with Brando the man. Capture the real Brando in this expose of the significant events that shaped \"the wild one's\" life including interviews with his family, friends and fellow Hollywood stars (Anthony Quinn, Jane Fonda, Susannah York...). Plus rare footage from his social life as well as highlights of all his legendary screen performances."
