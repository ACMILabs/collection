        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". In the center Saint Anne: she wears her hair braided, her eyes are lowered and she is smiling. Seated on her knees, the Virgin Mary, wearing a low-necked dress, is leaning toward the infant Jesus. This mysterious painting is a fine example of all the qualities, which make Leonardo da Vinci's work unique and recognisable. The video explores Leonardo's techniques, the chromatic range he used, the composition and symbolism of the picture as well as its history and the life of its creator, whose \"hand could not match his intellect\", resulting in very few completed works."
