        "Episode of Series \"We all have tales\". Kathleen Turner deftly retells this popular Grimm's fairytale in which a young woman is forced to promise her firstborn child to a mysterious little man in return for the ability to spin straw into gold. Germany's own Tangerine Dream provides the haunting musical score."
