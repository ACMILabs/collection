        "Trains, planes and critical paths expands on the problems of the previous program, by looking at \"The Travelling salesman problem\", i.e. the best route for including all the proposed stops with the lowest possible mileage. This problem can be applied to other circuits, such as telephone services, building construction and constructing a computer circuit, but all can be solved using algorithms and graphs, demonstrating yet again that practical problems are often best tackled with pure maths."
