        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". In this fourth program Theresa M. Amabile introduces us to smoothing out histograms with density curves, and normal curves, to the 68-95-99.7 rule and to the powerrful tool of standardizing. These techniques can be applied to normal distributions, which are common and follow strict rules. Examples used are the effect of changes in age distribution in the population of the United States on social services, how tall women can meet tall men, and baseball hitting statistics. Standardizing may lose irregularities in data, but is useful for giving a simplified, overview."
