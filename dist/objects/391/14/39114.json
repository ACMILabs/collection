        "Two episodes of the popular television series starring Rowan Atkinson. In the first episode \"Mr. Bean\" he experiences every students worst nightmare - sitting for an exam in which you don't know any of the answers. He then experiences every beachgoers' nightmare - being on a beach with other people and nowhere to change. Finally he experiences every churchgoers nightmare - a general lack of concentration. His solutions to these problems must be seen to be believed. \"The return of Mr. Bean\" sees him shopping with his American Express Card. Together, these episodes provide the ideal instruction manual for would-be idiots everywhere. Includes material not previously seen on television."
