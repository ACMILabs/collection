        "Episode of Series \"Dance: Videos of Australian dancers and choreographers\". As a dancer, ballet mistress, choreographer and director, Betty Pounder's name is synonymous with musical theatre in Australia. She recalls the diverse and vital theatre scene in the heyday of \"J.C. Williamson's\" and gives an insight into the working lives of musical performers. Pounder was responsible for presenting the work of America's greatest choreographers and was associated with the Australian productions of landmark musicals such as \"The Pyjama Game\", \"Man of La Mancha\", \"Camelot\" and \"My Fair Lady\". Pounder discusses the impact of developments in technique and training on dance in Australia and comments on current trends in musical theatre. Research and interview by James Murdoch."
