        "Episode of Series \"Human development: 2 1/2 to 6 years\". Between the ages of 2-6, two major developments occur. Children learn to co-ordinate their body movements and to function independently in basic living skills such as eating and dressing. Physiological development displays a greater spectrum of individuality but generally the stomach doubles in size, although appetite is often reduced, the brain grows and the immune system develops. Muscle strength is related to maturation, however at this stage there is minimal difference between genders in motor performance. In this stage of development, children learn to explore concepts such as depth, size, height and develop spatial awareness."
