        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Ethnic language schools have been a part of Australia's educational history since the 1850's. However, until the advent of multiculturalism in the early 1970s, ethnic language schools were treated with disdain by the mainstream educational authorities who believed in assimilation programs for migrants rather than a continuing of cultural and linguistic ethnic traditions. In this video, the South Australian model for ethnic schools is investigated, including sources of financial assistance; the important work the schools do in maintaining respect for langauge and culture; and the role the schools now have in teaching new languages to children from English-speaking backgrounds."
