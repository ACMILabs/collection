        "Episode of Series \"The World of Peter Rabbit and friends\". The enchanting story of an old tailor who sets to work to make a magnificent coat for the Mayor of Gloucester's wedding on Christmas morning was Beatrix Potter's own favourite. When the tailor falls ill with a fever, the coat is mysteriously completed by secret helpers who leave only one clue to their identity - a tiny note pinned to one unfinished buttonhole saying \"No more twist\"."
