        "Episode of Series \"Human development: the first 2 1/2 years\". This episode looks at how young infants acquire language. Chomsky's theories about innate language competencies are examined as are the theories of operative conditioning and modelling where environment rather than herditary factors are seen to be more influential in the process of language acquisition. Babies use talking movements from birth and the program illustrates the processes whereby \"babbling\" becomes articulate speech."
