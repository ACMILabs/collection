        "Based on Mary Norton's classic novels, we step into the miniature world of the Clock family - Pod, Homily and their daughter Arietty. Living under floorboards, in secret corners of the house, they \"borrow\" everything they need from \"giant\" human beings. Their greatest fear is is to be \"seen\". Arietty is bored with the life of confinement, and longs to go outside , despite the terrible story about the fate of her cousin Eggletina. When Pod teaches her to borrow, Arietty enters the wide world and encounters two sorts of humans - George, her schoolboy friend, and Mrs. Driver, the evil housekeeper. This production has excellent special effects and is a delight to watch."
