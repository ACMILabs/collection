        "Manganinnie, fleeing the Aboriginal genocide of 1830 in Tasmania, rescues a tiny lost white child. Together they find compassion, love and a bond that delivers them from desperation, loneliness and the terror of pursuit. Based on the novel by Beth Roberts with music by Peter Sculthorpe and a script by Ken Kelso."
