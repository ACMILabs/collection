        "Episode of Series \"Human development: 2 1/2 to 6 years\". Describes the social and emotional stages of development of the toddler, up until the end of the pre-school years. These include self-awareness, interacting and socializing with others, developing self-control, learning new roles and skills. Looks at the theories of Erikson for this age level as well as issues of discipline, developing empathy and the child's natural curiousity about their body."
