        "A production of Peter Tchaikovsky's much-loved ballet, featuring Rudolph Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn at the height of their partnership with the Royal Ballet in London. This fairy-tale, which began in Tchaikovsky's imagination as a piece of fun for his nephews and nieces, is really the first thoroughly considered dance music drama, with a much more symphonic score than his other ballets. Over the years the ballet was savaged by cuts and substitutions, but with Nureyev's choreography and Nicholas Georgiadis's sets and costumes the underlying dramatic unity has been restored. The Wiener Symphoniker plays under the direction of John Lanchbury."
