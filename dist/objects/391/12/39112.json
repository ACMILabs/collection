        "Two further misadventures with the irrepressible Mr Bean. \"The Curse of Mr Bean\" sees Mr Bean visiting the local swimming pool. Excited about the prospect of a dive from the top board, he discovers he hasn't got the nerve for it. He rapidly loses his cool...and his bathers! In \"Mr Bean Goes to Town\", Mr Bean brings home a new television set. Having trouble with the reception, he devises a unique solution. Includes material not previously seen on television."
