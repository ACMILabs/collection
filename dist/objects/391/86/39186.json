        "Episode of Series \"Hollywood remembers\". Speak softly and carry a big gun...that's the attitude that has made Clint Eastwood one of the biggest box office stars! And this video looks at his entire film career, from the early \"Spaghetti Westerns\"made in Italy to his Hollywood superstar years with \"Dirty Harry\" and beyond. Featured are rare film clips, original coming attractions, previews, and more, including footage never released to television. It's a treasure trove featuring Eastwood's best work, and the first serious retrospective of his lengthy acting career. Whether you're an Eastwood fan, a film buff, or an action-adventure afficionado, this is a video you'll want to watch over and over again."
