        "Classic Hollywood comedy starring Judy Holliday and William Holden. Judy's riotous performance as Billy Dawn, the clever 'dumb blonde', won her the 1951 Academy Award. Billy, her shady boyfriend and all his thugs move to a Washington hotel to begin wheeling and dealing in the political scene. To get her out of his way, and make her a little more cultured, and dignified, Billy's gangster boyfriend (Broderick Crawford) hires Holden to teach her. Hilarious scenes and famous lines dot this film which has remained unforgettably and indelibly in the minds of audiences the world over. Based on the stage play by Garson Kanin."
