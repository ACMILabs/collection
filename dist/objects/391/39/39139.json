        "Episode of Series \"Dance: Videos of Australian dancers and choreographers\". Sir Robert Helpmann trained with the legendary ballerina Anna Pavlova and had a successful career in musical comedy in Australia before travelling to England where he became a star of both the \"Sadler's Wells Ballet\" and the \"Old Vic.\". Helpmann remembers his association with Ninette de Valois and his first meeting with Margot Fonteyn, the beginning of a twenty-seven year partnership. Helpmann combined his successful international career in ballet, theatre and film with his commitment to the development of the \"Australian Ballet\". He discusses the background to his ballet, \"The Display\" and his collaboration with Rudolf Nureyev on the film of \"Don Quixote\". As a dancer, choreographer, actor and director Sir Robert Helpmann has made a unique contribution to the performing arts in Australia."
