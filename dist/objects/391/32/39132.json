        "Episode of Series \"Dance: Videos of Australian dancers and choreographers\". Laurel Martyn trained in London with Phyllis Bedells and was awarded a choreographic scholarship under the auspices of Ninette de Valois. In this interview, Martyn recalls the highlights of her performing career with the \"Sadler's Wells Ballet\" in England and the \"Borovansky Ballet\" in Australia and discusses her teaching method and philosophy. Through her company, \"Ballet Vistoria\", Martyn encouraged the development of a distinctively Australian style of dance and introduced ballet to thousands of school children. Researched and interviewed by James Murdoch."
