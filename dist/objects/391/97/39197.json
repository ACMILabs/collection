        "John Lennon was one of the most talented and prolific songwriters of our time. His music is as timeless and relevant today as it was a generation ago. His songs revolutionised our music and culture. In this unique tribute to Lennon, over 23 of the world's greatest performers bring a little bit of magic to Lennon's songs as they perform their own interpretations of his classics. From Lenny Kravitz singing \"Cold Turkey\" to Hall and Oates singing \"Don't let me down\" to Elton John performing \"Imagine\" we are moved by the strength of the emotions Lennon's words still evoke today. Hosted by Michael Douglas, these memorable songs are intercut with rare archival footage of John Lennon and The Beatles."
