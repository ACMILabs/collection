        "Narrated by Grace Jackman, with poetry and readings inspired by Venice, read by Richard Levine, viewers are taken on a journey through Venice - a city of breathtaking beauty and a thousand years of colourful history. A conglomeration of landmarks ranging fron the Byzantine San Marco to the pink marbled Palazzo Ducale, the famous Campanele in Piazza San Marco to the canals and bridges, Venice has inspired great artists and writers throughout the ages. Despite the state of \"gorgeous decay\", Venice remains a jewel to be treasured - a perpetual source of wonder and mystery."
