        "Often insensitive, but ever well-meaning, Emma Woodhouse, one of the most beloved of Jane Austen's heroines, turns her hand at matchmaking the local vicar Mr. Elton with her friend Harriet Smith. Despite the disastrous consequences, it is Emma herself who finds happiness with long time friend Mr. Knightley, one of the few people who acts as the voice of reason and restraint. This splendid BBC dramatisation brings to life all the wit and humour of the novel. Stars Doran Godwin and John Carson as Emma and Mr. Knightley with Mollie Sugden and Fiona Walker."
