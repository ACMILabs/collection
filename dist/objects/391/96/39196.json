        "Based on the Terry Jones fairytales and contains two wonderful stories: \"The Island of purple fruits\": A shipwrecked sailor finds a magical tree and when he eats the fruit, he dreams wonderful dreams. One day, when he is an old man he is rescued and returns home. He agrees with his wife that his dreams were not really good dreams because they didn't include his family who remained unhappy during his absence. \"The Fly-by-night\": A strange Peter Pan-like creature who rides on the back of a giant cat, taps on a girl's window and invites her to fly with him into the skies. They visit a magical night club in the sky and are entertained by a chorus of stars. When the girl awakes, she wonders if it was a dream or not and longs for the fly-by-night to come tapping on her window again, but he never does."
