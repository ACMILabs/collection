        "Based upon the novel \"After the funeral\" also published as \"Funerals are fatal\" by Agatha Christie. Mr Enderby, a wealthy and elderly man, dies unexpectedly and his not-so-bereaved relatives gather for the reading of the will. The speculation that he may have been murdered intensifies when another relative is slain, begging the question, \"Who will be next?\" Starring Margaret Rutherford, Robert Morley, Flora Robson and Stringer Davis."
