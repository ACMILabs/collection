        "This video explores the creative movements of the early twentieth century. The first part documents the activities of artists such as Picasso, Matisse and Braque who were working in Paris at a time when the city was the centre of European art and bohemia. The video traces the revolutionary breakthroughs in art initiated by these painters, including Cubism and Fauvism. The second part examines the activities of German and Russian artists in the early twentieth century including the development of the Expressionist movement. Close attention is paid to the work of Kandinsky and Klee."
