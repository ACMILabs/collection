        "Episode of Series \"Dance: Videos of Australian dancers and choreographers\". Dame Margaret Scott talks about her experiences touring England with the \"Sadler's Wells Ballet\" and \"Ballet Rambert\" during the Second World War and her association with choreographers John Cranko and Kenneth MacMillan. When a recurring back injury ended her dancing career, Scott moved to Australia and became a teacher. She offered to help Peggy van Praagh prepare dancers for the formation of the \"Australian Ballet Company\" and went on to establish the \"Australian Ballet School\". Scott discusses the relationship between the school and the performing company and her desire to produce dancers with both a sound classical technique and an ability to adapt to the demands of contemporary dance."
