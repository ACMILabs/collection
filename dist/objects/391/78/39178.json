        "Episode of Series \"Human development: 2 1/2 to 6 years\". Young animals use play in order to develop the skills they need to survive. Children, through role playing and interaction with others, develop cognitive skills, creativity, self awareness and identity as well as becoming socialised. Play must meet certain criteria. It must be pleasurable and enjoyable, it has no extrinsic goals, the motivation is internal, for children play serves no practical purpose, it must be spontaneous and voluntary and there must be active engagement. Studies have shown some gender differences in the way children play but whether this is due to environmental or hereditary factors is unresolved."
