One of Australia's most admired and acclaimed dancers, Kelvin Coe speaks about his long association with the Australian Ballet, which began when he was employed as a student apprentice at the age of sixteen. He recalls the many dancers who inspired and influenced him, including Erik Bruhn, Rudolf Nureyev, Kathleen Geldard and Lucette Aldous and his partnership with Marilyn Rowe Maver. Coe discusses the relationship between the dancer and the choreographer and his work as a teacher with the Australian Ballet School. Research and interview by James Murdoch."
