        "Featuring the voices of Megan Follows, Keifer Sutherland, Phyllis Diller and Peter O'Toole, and set to Tchaikovsky's score, this is a story of magic, adventure and romance. When Clara finds a nutcracker in the form of a soldier boy under the Christmas tree, her uncle tells her the story of the Nutcracker Prince turned to wood by the evil Mousequeen. The young Prince can only reverse the spell by fighting the terrible Mouseking and winning the love of a beautiful maiden."
