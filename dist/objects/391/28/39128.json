        "This animated story of the thrilling adventures of a toy mouse and his child is based on the modern classic of children's fiction written by Russell Hoban. From their home in the toy shop window, the mouse and his child find themselves cast into a rubbish tip where they become prisoners of the slimy rat, Manny (voice of Peter Ustinov). Helped by their friends, a fortune-telling rat, an actress parrot, a performing seal and a pink elephant, the mouse and his child plot to escape Manny's evil clutches and discover how they can become self-winding."
