        "At last, the Blues Brothers are back! John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd star in one of the most popular musical comedies of all time. Jake and Elwood Blues, two hoodlum brothers searching for redemption, set out to locate and re-enlist the members of their defunct rhythm and blues band in order to fulfil a \"mission from God\". In their quest they are joined by an impressive array of guest stars including James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Carrie Fisher, John Candy, Ray Charles, Twiggy, Cab Calloway and Steven Spielberg. This madcap film has everything from exciting soul and blues music to one of the most amazing car chase scenes ever filmed, a film not to be missed."
