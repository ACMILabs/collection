        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Not suitable for adults\". A lighthearted exploration of the confusion and uncertainties surrounding adolescence through the eyes of 16 year olds from diverse backgrounds. Introduces the characters Tube, Gull, Curtis, Joey, Rosetta, Angela, Pepper and Gloria. Vignettes address \"finding yourself, liking yourself and being your own person\", independence vs. limitations, the \"real me\", friendships, peer group pressure and the physical/emotional changes occuring during the early teenage years. Similarly, the pressure of uncertain job prospects, school stresses, youthful dreams and concern for the world's future."
