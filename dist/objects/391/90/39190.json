        "The program opens with the choreographer, Graeme Murphy, discussing the origins of the work and how he changed it, illustrated with extracts from the performance which follows. The performance opens in a garden which is overseen by the God Pan. Innocent Daphnis falls for Chloe, but he has a rival, Dorcan the Herdsmen. They vie for her hand in a dance competition; the winner to receive a kiss."
