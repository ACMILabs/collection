        "A sharp critique of Hollywood greed and power, director Robert Altman hits nails on heads as this Faustian black comedy unfolds on the screen. This cynical story begins with Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), a smarmy young studio executive who is being threatened by a disgruntled and previously rejected screenwriter. Griffin decides to take the law into his own hands and accidentally kills the writer. Will he get away with it? Whoopi Goldberg is hilarious as the unconventional detective investigating the murder, Greta Scacchi is strange and seductive as the dead writer's girlfriend and Peter Gallagher is truly slimy as the rising young star executive. The film also includes cameo appearances from sixty-five of Hollywood's biggest names."
