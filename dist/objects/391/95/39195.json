        "Feisty Helen Hanff (Anne Bancroft) just loves rare books, the sort you can't get in New York. Little does she know that a letter to a small second-hand bookshop in London will lead to a twenty year love affair with the staff and the city. Helen strikes up a particularly affectionate correspondence with Frank Doel (Anthony Hopkins) at Marks & Co. in '84 Charing Cross Road. Her letters are soon followed by food parcels to the food-rationed staff, and insights into life across the Atlantic. A heartwarming, charming film based upon the memoirs of Helen Hanff and the play adapted from her book."
