        "An extensive cross section of people relate their experiences of termination and unemployment. Participants provide ideas to assist viewers in obtaining employment including the role of the CES, regularly scanning newspapers, networking with colleagues/mates and especially emphasising the importance of word-of-mouth. Addresses depression vs. motivation, preparation of an up-to-date resume, the importance of pre-interview research and interview tips, particularly selling yourself. Stresses not to give up despite the discouragement of rejection and maintain confidence by adopting a positive and open attitude towards re-education or career direction changes."
