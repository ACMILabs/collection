        "Maidenhead is a series of chamber-fictions inhabited by a young woman named Alice. Linked in an oblique, dream like way, these short, sharp stories describe Alice's survival in an everyday world of bizarre logic and strange emotions. It's a place where miracles unfold in the bathroom and desire appears on a bus; where menacing joggers roam the suburbs and there's something sinister about hats. Vibrant like musical, Maidenhead is at once funny and disquieting, poignant and absurd."
