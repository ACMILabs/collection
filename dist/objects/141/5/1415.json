        "A catalogue of assorted Sydneysiders pose for the camera \"at home\". A photographic mosaic of faces and places, Living Room exposes the myths surrounding home ownership and the shrinking potential of home ownership and reveals surprising values and attitudes. The program raises questions about the lack of services and isolation associated with outer suburban life. It looks at our treatment of the elderly and the way the nuclear family and the dream of \"owning your own home\" have shaped our living environment."
