        "Being a teenager is hell. But in your private space, your bedroom, you can be yourself. In My Room enters the bedrooms of three teenagers: Kristy, a 17 year old who lives with her mum in a St. Kilda flat; Will, a 16 year old, boarding in a room with three other boys at Melbourne Grammar; and Jyka, a 14 year old Koorie who lives with his family in Broadmeadows. This film tells the story of their private places, filled with possessions that represent their past and future and the changing perspectives and passions affecting their lives."
