        "After forty years of service in India and Africa, Colonel Hilary Hook returns home to England. We follow his journey from his Kenyan home and servants to an England very different from the one he left in 1948. This is a documentary about a dying breed of colonials. Colonel Hook represents those who once thought it was their responsibility to civilise the world, or a good part of it, only to find the world changing too fast for them to keep up. The pride with which Hook was prepared to cope, and the occasional despair when things proved too difficult, make him an absorbing central character and a remarkable microcosm of the fading British Empire.
