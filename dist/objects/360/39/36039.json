        "Episode of Series \"Keating on Painters Series\". Tom Keating shows how Turner, in his opinion, is the greatest of water colour artists. A reverse version of Turner's famous work \"The Fighting Temerara\" is the subject of this program and we learn the techniques used by the artist to achieve the desired texture of the sky and the new Thames."
