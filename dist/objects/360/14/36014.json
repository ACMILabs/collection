        "Sergeant Jack Falen (Dennis Hopper), an American soldier returning from Vietnam, is accompanying the coffined corpse of his best friend on a train ride across America. Arriving at the train he starts to make the acquaintance of some of the passengers, getting to know their personal habits and obsessions. Among the passengers is a young college student, Stephanie, to whom Falen is attracted. Gradually a series of strange occurrences unfold as Falen's post-war nightmares surface. \"Tracks\" was one of the first films to deal with American conscience concerning Vietnam and is a film which constantly breaks societal perception of limitation in mind, body and spirit."
