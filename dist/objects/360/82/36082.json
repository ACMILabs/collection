        "Join Scott Lambert and three other Australians, along with a Greek skipper, for a month among the beautiful Greek Islands. Visit the island of Mykonos with its wonderful Cubist architecture, Rhodes with its castles of the Knights of St John built over 500 years ago, Siftos and Santorini. Legend has it that Santorini, the island on the rim of a giant volcanic crater, and believed to be the home of vampires, is the site of the lost city of Atlantis. Then travel with the group to Turkey, home of the traditional enemies of the Greeks, and visit Effasis the second largest city of the Roman Empire, and then on to see the reputed house of the Virgin Mary."
