        "Take a look at New Zealand as you have never seen it before. Soaring like a bird in low altitude light aircraft and helicopters, swooping down from the clouds occasionally to watch New Zealanders at work and at play. From your viewpoint in the sky you will see the natural forces that shaped New Zealand's rugged beauty still at work reshaping the land. The history of New Zealand's Maori and Pakeha peoples also comes vividly alive. Rated: G"
