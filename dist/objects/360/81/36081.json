        "A fascinating documentary looking at two very different mountain ranges and how they are conquered by a small group of Aussie adventurers. The group flew to India to trek into the hidden kingdom of Zanskar, far north of Delhi through the highlands, to altitudes over 10,000 feet above sea level. They then rafted down white water rapids to Shingo La Pass at the Zanskar - before travelling to Kashmir. The second leg of this extraordinary journey took them to the New Zealand Alps, where they were caught in the worst weather experienced on Mount Victoria over 45 years. An amazing rescue sequence follows."
