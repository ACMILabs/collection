        "A journey through the outback by Cobb & Co coach. Cobb & Co have a unique place in Australia's past. The growth of the company went hand in hand with the development of rural Australia. In many ways it made development possible, providing an essential fast transport system on which the rural areas depended. By 1870 Cobb & Co were harnessing 6,000 horses a day to haul their coaches over 28,000 of track every week."
