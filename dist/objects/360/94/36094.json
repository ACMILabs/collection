        "The vast Australian Outback has been described as a land of heroes and dead men. Join Scott Lambert and seven Australian army commandoes who are all recipients of the green beret on a three week rafting expedition, where enough provisions for one week have been taken, with the idea of \"living off the land\" for most of the time. Setting out from Darwin, the journey will take these adventurers down the Katherine River through the Katherine Gorge, then back through the Clarevale Crossing and the Daly River Crossing, back to Darwin. A fascinating adventure amongst some of the most beautiful wilderness in Australia."
