        "A journey through the Middle East, from Israel to Egypt. This fascinating adventure takes you through the Judean Desert to the ancient biblical city of Jericho, across the Sinai Desert to the Dead Sea, then to the Gulf of Aqaba to scuba dive amongst the wonderful coral reefs and on to Eilat. After Jerusalem, \"the focus of the law of God and the hatred of Man\", we visit a Kibbutz and travel along the Suez Canal to Cairo to marvel at the pyramids on the banks of the Nile. We then travel to Aswan, to see the incredible Aswan Dam and Abu Simbel then on to Luxor, The Valley of the Kings, and the \"Tomb of Tutankhamen\"."
