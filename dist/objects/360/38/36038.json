        "Episode of Series \"Keating on Painters Series\". Tom Keating, art forger explains the importance of \"plein air\" painting to the Impressionists and paints pictures in the style of Rousseau, Boudin and Pisarro. While recreating the a Rousseau he talks about the palette of the painters, the techniques of painting trees and skies, and the different sense of values when painting outdoors or in a studio. He paints a \"seaside\" painting of Boudin using an initial wash and then making a simple figurative statement."
