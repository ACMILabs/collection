        "Episode of Series \"Keating on Painters Series\". Tom Keating, an English artist and television personality shares his enthusiasm for Rembrandt. In a practical demonstration he illustrates some of Rembrandt's techniques by painting an imitation of the double portrait of Rembrandt and his son Titus. Keating explains Rembrandt's early life, how he created his works of art using the chiaroscuro effect, his use of directional brush strokes and his love for a bright colour range in his work."
