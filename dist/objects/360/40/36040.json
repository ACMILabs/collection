        "Episode of Series \"Keating on Painters Series\". Tom Keating, imitates and analyses the work of some of the world's greatest artists and in this episode introduces Cezanne. He describes the incredibly slow pace at which Cezanne worked, both in arranging his compositions and painting them. Keating then gives biographical details of Cezanne, who was the son of a wealthy man, and he paints a still life in the style of Cezanne."
