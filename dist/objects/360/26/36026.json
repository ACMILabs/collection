        "A young couple live in an almost hallucinatory world. Through the death of the girl's father a sense of the infinite develops between them. Their love gives both of them enough self knowledge to become highly alert and sensitive. They become free and detached from the normal anxieties, pressures fears and hopes of society. \"Illuminations\" makes an attempt at extending consciousness beyond the limits imposed by our ego. Man always underestimates the power of the mind and confuses it with his own man-made illusions. Cast: Gabriella Trsek, Anthony Llewellyn Jones Norman Kaye, Sheila Florence, Athol Smith, Tibor Markus."
