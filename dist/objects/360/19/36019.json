        "Hollywood star, Lorenzo Lamas, partners martial arts champions Cheryl Wheeler and Peter Luljuraj in a world first tape that features both aerobics and instruction in twelve basic moves of self defence. It's the perfect way for men and women to have fun working out and learning stimulating self defence exercises. You will feel the power grow as you come to grips with the basic art of blocking, punching and kicking - and how to defend yourself against knife attack, or a sudden grab to the body or head."
