        "Episode of Series \"Keating on Painters Series\". Tom Keating, art forger explains how Constable always initiated his work from a black and white sketch, working on this to produce his final work. He examines \"The Hay Wain\" describing Constable's use of shading techniques and his love of greys. Keating explains how Constable was never afraid to paint over yesterday's work and suggests that Constable, although a rapid worker, would repaint until satisfied."
