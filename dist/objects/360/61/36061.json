        "Eddie Monsoon - written by Adrian Edmondson - star of \"The Young Ones\", is a mock documentary about a South African TV host who's a lush - and very violent. He's a slightly quieter version of Vivian from the \"Young Ones\", but set in the real world. The film includes excerpts from Monsoon's under- standably few TV appearances, and interviews with his ex-wife (played by Jennifer Saunders of Saunders and French) and ex-manager (played by Peter Richardson). \"Didn't you kill my Brother\" - written by Alexei Sayle, Pauline Melville and David Stafford. It tells the story of twin criminal brothers, Carl and Moss Sterling (both played by Sayle). After five years in prison, Carl emerges with 428 academic qualifications, a gentle manner and a Liverpool accent. He sets up a legitimate bicycle-making business at the local youth centre. Carl's brother Sterling is meanwhile running a racket where the kids steal every bicycle in sight so that he can respray and resell them. Eventually the brothers clash, with fatal results. Rated: PG"
