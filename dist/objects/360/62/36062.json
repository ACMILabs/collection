        "The 2nd Vatican Council, held in Rome in the 1960s, saw a massive restructuring of how Catholics approach their faith. For Australians this has meant a great deal of alteration in externals, for example the Mass today is spoken in English rather than Latin, - plus there has been a reassessment of the role of the individual Catholic in the modern world. The Roman Catholic faith has entered tumultuous times and few Catholics can idly stand by and watch the church disintegrate. However, there is an increasing mood among many Catholic lay people of assertiveness which promises well for the church's future. Rated: G"
