        "A poetic debate between Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson ran over several weeks in the Bulletin magazine of the 1890s. The subject of the debate was the Australian bush. Paterson, who spent most of his life in more affluent surroundings than Lawson, saw the bush as a place of romance and adventure. Lawson saw only the hardship and struggle. To earn themselves some money they convinced the Bulletin to print the poems they each wrote disclaiming the other's point-of-view. The story is filmed entirely in contemporary settings with Paterson and Lawson, in their period costume, as the only references to the time-frame of the Bulletin articles."
