        "In this program Robert Cumming, Director of the Christie Fine Art Course, Norbert Lynton, Professor of Fine Art at Sussex University, and Alistair Smith, Keeper at the National gallery, help us look into paintings rather than just at them. They take us through some famous paintings, sometimes with the help of other experts, always with new ways of approaching the pictures, and with added insights, from contemporary artists, into the art of painting."
