        "This is an absorbing political fable for the 90's. Its a pacy thriller about an attempt to destabilise a fictitious British government. Harry Hopkins is an ex-steel worker from Sheffield who wins a General Election and becomes Prime Minister on a manifesto committed to radical policies. he is a man of the people who has a way with one-liners which fool the press but not the Opposition. Once inside Number 10, Harry enters a world of political intrigue and comes face to face with the media, the Civil Service, the armed forces, his own party and the Opposition. As each problem arises, Harry solves them in his own inimitable style. Cast: Ray McAnally, Alan MacNaughtan, Keith Allen."
