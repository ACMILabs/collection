        "Stop Laughing This is Serious explores the comedy of our past. From \"Dad 'n' Dave\" to \"Crocodile Dundee\", the distinct Australian humour is reviewed on film. \"Hooray for the Radio\" follows the development of the radio world through the unique Australian voice. \"The Other Film Industry\" explores the important role of the documentary in recording events and images as they were. \"You gotta be kidding\" is a delightful review of film and radio from a child's eye. Watch for \"Kid's Stakes\", \"Bush Christmas\", \"Storm Boy\" and others."
