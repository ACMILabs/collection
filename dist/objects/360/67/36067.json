        "Mr Jolly Lives Next Door - The inappropriately named hit man \"Mr Jolly\" (Peter Cook) rents an office space next door to the alcoholic incompetents Rik and Ade (Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson), proprietors of \"Dreamytimer Escorts\", London's seediest escort service. Through a catalogue of mistakes and misunderstandings the deranged Mr Lovebucket (Peter Richardson), purveyor of wines and spirits to most London off-licences, he finds he has paid Rik and Ade 3,000 pounds to \"take out Nicholas Parsons\". Murderous implications arise behind Mr Lovebucket's back. \"Consuelo\" - John (Adrian Edmondson) returns to his ancestral home, \"Brownstokes\" with a pretty new wife, Jessica (Jennifer Saunders)."
