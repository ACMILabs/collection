        "On April 15th, 1978, Bill Belcher, lone yachtsman in a race from New Zealand to Australia, was shipwrecked. His self-designed and built craft was wrecked on a coral atoll some 600 kilometres from the coast of Australia. From that time, until his rescue on May 13th, Bill survived in an inflatable rubber life raft. This is the recreated story of his extraordinary experience."
