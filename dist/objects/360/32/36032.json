        "Documentary film maker Aviva Ziegler turns the camera on herself in this personal exploration of what being Jewish means to her and why she calls herself a Jew despite not maintaining a Jewish lifestyle. She speaks with family and friends about growing up in Sydney, commenting on religious practices from the past, pondering why her brother has maintained his Jewish heritage and Aviva has gravitated towards other groups in society. Aviva reaches the conclusion that the effects of the Holocaust have made her feel Jewish, regardless of whether she is living within the tradition or not."
