        "A country as enigmatic as any in the Orient is the location for this adventure trip of a lifetime, where we see first hand the roots of modern Thailand. Starting in Bangkok, travel north upstream to Aeutia in the Chao Phraya River in search of the incredible Hill tribes of Northern Thailand, who are found in one of the most remote areas in the country between the borders of Burma and Laos. Upon arrival witness a wedding ceremony - a magnificent display of clothing and jewellery, highlighting the fascinating rituals and traditions of these ancient people. Further on the journey, visit Naoon Suan - one of the largest rice markets in the world, along with Subotai and Chiang Mai, two of the most fascinating cities in Thailand."
