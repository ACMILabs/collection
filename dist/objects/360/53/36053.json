        "Saltwater crocodiles are the largest reptiles in the world and one of the deadliest hunters - an amazing survival story from the age of the dinosaurs. Northern Australia is one of the last places on earth where large numbers flourish in close proximity to the human population, and in the Northern Territory a unique experiment is being carried out which could lead to long term conservation of this otherwise endangered species."
