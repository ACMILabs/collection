        "The Jungles of Borneo - one of those rare places where nature has reached her greatest complexity of design. This program follows an expedition that went in search of the Purnam, lonely wanderers in Borneo's vast jungle. Unchanged for thousands of years, the forests are the home of this tribe, their future looking increasingly bleak due to jungle clearance and the spread of civilisation. The aim of the expedition was to study the Purnam and document their way of life before it is too late. Their search took them into the heart of darkest Borneo - a trek fraught with dangers and discomforts, their quest driving them deeper and deeper into the wilderness."
