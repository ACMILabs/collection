        "High productivity at the coalface means increased dust, a major health hazard to the miner. Using diagrams and an actual lung a doctor explains how and what diseases are caused by prolonged exposure to coal dust, and answers key questions of concern to every miner. Strong emphasis is given to suppressing dust at source through effective ventilation and water sprays, combines with statutory monitoring of dust, regular X-Ray and medical examinations. Protection today prevents pneumoconiosis tomorrow."
