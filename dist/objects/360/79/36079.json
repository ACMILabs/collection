        "Kay is frightened of the future and the present, of life and death of loneliness and love. She's frightened of trees that wither and die, frightened of shadow and light, frightened of giving herself up to her dreams and memories. When a clairvoyant describes, minutely, the man of her life, Kay abruptly interrupts the constant stream of monogamous relationships which had been her pattern, to set up home with Louis, the ex-boyfriend of a colleague. After a year of apparent happiness, her fears are rekindled, she turns away from Louis and withdraws inexorably into herself. that's when her sister, Sweetie, appears. Sweetie is impulsive and untidy, a fat adolescent who, her father believes, is the artist of the family. She loses no time in turning Kay's ordered world upside down with her capricious demands, voracious sensuality, enormous appetite and terrifying rages. Cast: Genevieve Lemon, Karen Colston, Tom Lycos."
