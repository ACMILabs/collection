        "Everyday French: easy, entertaining and effective. This unique learning technique was evolved by Dr Dickinsen, PhD, extensively researched at the University of London and produced at the Manchester University Television Centre. The course consists of two videos (each accompanied by a with its own \"viewers guide\" booklet), containing 17 programs. You'll be involved in amusing conversations and funny dramatic and romantic episodes. In next to no time it seems, you find that you will have absorbed the feel of France and can converse fluently in French."
