        "Danny (Henry Jaglom) invites his friends to a St. Valentine's Day party in a disused cinema which is about to be demolished to make way for commercial development. Danny, an unrelenting romantic, in the early stages of a relationship with Helen (Anrea Marcovicci) is investigating why people feel alone. Some of the participants play themselves, others play roles. They are an assortment of Danny's/Jaglom's friends - actors, singers, musicians and artists. As he turns the camera on his friends and himself, the film takes an off-beat and hilarious persona akin to Gestaltian LA of the '70s. Orson Welles makes his final screen appearance as the omniscient bearer of wisdom."
