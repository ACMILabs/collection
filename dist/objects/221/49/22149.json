        "A dramatised documentary, made for the Ministry of Fuel and Power, aiming to reassure miners about the proposed nationalisation of the coal fields. Revolves around the dramatic tale of a disaster which involved the loss of many lives almost 100 years earlier. The seam located under the sea floor is opened up again for working, and with modern equipment and safety devices, there is little likelihood of a repetition of the old tragedy. Many of the roles are performed by the actual workers, Nimmo is played by a mining engineer and Stephenson is one of the mine leaders. Cinematography, Chick Fowle. Music, Arthur Benjamin performed by the Philharmonic Orchestra. Made in collaboration with the United Steel Companies and the National Union of Mine-Workers."
