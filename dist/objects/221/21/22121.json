        "Episode of Series \"Basic woodwork\". Both sides of the wood are veneered to prevent warping. The method of making this is demonstrated through an example of a door made of laminated wood. It is explained how to veneer the face of the door to match the edges and when a piece of veneer is not wide enough to cover a surface, how a joint must be made."
