        "In 1924, during one of the periodic slumps in the British film industry, Adrian Brunel amused himself and many others by producing a series of burlesques. This film tells of Holmes, Sweet and Holmes' voyage by sea to Africa where they then set off, on camels, across the desert to finally arrive at the famous Cascara of Sagrada falls. A comic travel film of the silent era."
