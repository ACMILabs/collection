        "Made by Painleve, famous French scientific documentary filmmaker, this film is a close study of a number of types of starfish. It deals with eating methods, breeding habits, movement on the ocean floor and in the water of some beautiful sea creatures. The film uses high speed and microcinematography to great advantage in this study of marine life."
