        "A documentary account of a typical day for the Bozo tribe in Mali, West Africa. Environmental demands are met through a classic division of labour determined in large part by the annual fluctuations of the River Niger. Shows the people as they wash, weave, fish, cook and eat. Without narration - natural sounds only."
