        "An animated film by John and Faith Hubley in which everything moves to music and where a juke box is the center of everything. It is a fable of our times, about people and numbers and chance, set on a cruise ship where everything is most correct until a maverick passenger decides to flout the rules. Animation by Phil Duncan, Gary Mooney and Les Drew. Music by Benny Carter."
