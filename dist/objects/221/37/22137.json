        "The filming of magnified forms of crystals of common solutions as they are seen forming and then melting in polarized light captures the natural evolving shapes in a kaleidoscope of colour and in an infinite series of abstractions. Visually fascinating, all process were filmed at low magnification. Music by Phil Bishop, microphotography/crystalography by Robert R. Forrester and narration by Marguerite Ray. Suitable for upper secondary level."
