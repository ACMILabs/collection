        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". Crystals have plane faces, sharp edges, sharp melting points, and may cleave easily to give new plane surfaces. They also interact with x-rays to produce well-defined diffraction patterns. Experiments are performed in a ripple tank on an unknown crystalline array so that the student sees the principles and measurements by which actual crystal structures are determined. Suitable for upper secondary level."
