        "In the rivers and billabongs of Northern Territory the aborigine hunts small fresh-water crocodiles using spear and canoe, to provide food for his family. But, in recent years, a new industry has become established in these regions - the hunting of the crocodile for his skin, which brings a high price in the south when manufactured into hand-bags, shoes, wallets and ornaments. Teams of hunters make their camps by the rivers and estuaries where fresh-water and salt-water varieties are found. Photography by Frank Bagnall."
