        "Episode of Series \"Basis for Decision\". Operational research calculates the probable results of alternate courses of action for planning purposes. Many problems of organisations have similar structures and can be solved by similar methods of analysis and similar mathematical models. One simple structure, the input-service- output situation, is discussed and applied to different queuing problems."
