        "Dandenong, Victoria, named after an Aboriginal tribe, is a fast growing town. As the gateway to Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley, it is important for agriculture. But even more significant is the development of big industrial plants manufacturing goods such as carpets, trucks, cars and fruit cans. Such decentralization of industry is bringing prosperity and a high standard of living to Dandenong and Australia as a whole."
