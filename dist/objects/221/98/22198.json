        "Progress is in a dead heat with destruction as the nuclear industry tries to keep ahead of its own waste, all of which is radioactive and therefore highly dangerous. The horrors of radioactive overexposure - possible genetic damage, increased incidences of cancer and leukemia, and others, are further heightened by an apparent inability of both government and industry to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem."
