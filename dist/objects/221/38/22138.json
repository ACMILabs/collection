        "This film shows us the various processes by which crystals are formed, including that of salts in solution by evaporation; of rock formations by percolation of water through the earth; of the melting and cooling of minerals; and the crystallisation of substances in solutions contained in the cells of various plants. Actual crystallisation is recorded by means of time-lapse micro-cinematography."
