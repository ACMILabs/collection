        "Shows how the newspaper \"The West Australian\" is set up and printed. The film shows all stages of production, from setting of type which is then checked in the reading room to the final printing on rolls which contain over 120 miles of newsprint. Demonstrates how a big newspaper works, and its reliance on other world sources of news."
