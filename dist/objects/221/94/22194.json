        "The unique Australian lyrebird, this most elusive of all birds, is observed in its natural habitat. A long sequence, excellently photographed and brilliantly recorded sound, shows the bird performing its famous courting dance. The long hours of patient photography involved have been rewarded with the following awards - Australian Film Awards, Nature Section, Gold Award \"for nature shots, lyrically observed and creatively connected.\" Kodak Silver Medallion for best black and white photography."
