        "Records the Forestry Commission's achievements at afforestation on the sandy southern shore of Moray Firth, Scotland. This area was completely buried by sand in the late 17th century. In 1921 the Forestry Commission began their work by introducing marram grass to bind the sand. This proved unsuccessful so a thatched cover of brushwood was laid over the sand. Now nearly the whole area has been planted with Corsican pine which is proving effective in checking sand drifts."
