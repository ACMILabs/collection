        "Episode of Series \"The World We Live In\". A comparison of the ecological changes brought about by the dam building activities of two species of mammals - humans and the beaver. It shows that all life is interdependent and points out how humans are damaging the ecological balance of nature whereas the beaver, although bringing change to its area, is not. Shows beavers in north America and engineers in Africa. Narrated by Joseph Julian."
