        "This film is an encounter with geometrical shapes which children can readily understand and enjoy. As the title suggests \"Dance Squared\" employs movement, colour and music to explore the symmetries of the square. Every movement of the square and its components presents an opportunity to observe its geometrical properties in a way that is intriguing to young minds. With basic concepts firmly grasped, the young student is then prepared to experiment on his own. No dialogue, set to square dance music, suitable for all ages. (Five awards, including Chicago and Toronto.)"
