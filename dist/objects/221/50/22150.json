        "The story of the arrival in Cummington, USA, of a group of refugees from Europe and the manner in which they were accepted by the community. They are greeted by the minister of the local church, who has assumed the responsibility for their adjustment to a strange country, and has found a place for them to live. Then began the process of gradually breaking down the barriers between the new arrivals and the townspeople. Strangeness falls away, the minister implies, when people live and work and meet together. The story of this exercise in human relations is told with sympathy, understanding, and humour."
