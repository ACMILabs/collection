        "The film focuses on an interview with Fidel Castro interwoven with aspects of Cuba. Castro speaks about differences with the United States which led to severed relations, about changes in Cuba since the revolution, about socialism and capitalism. He defends Cuba's \"coercive\" society on economic grounds as a necessity during a transition period. The camera follows him on tours of inspection, particularly to a new housing project where he visits an apartment that overflows with residents. The film shows the contrasts of old and new, industrialization and poverty."
