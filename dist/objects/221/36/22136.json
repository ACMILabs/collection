        "Marshes are the breeding grounds of millions of water-birds and untold numbers of interrelated wildlife. These precious wetlands are being drained, victims of man's relentless search for more farmland and urban space. The film captures the poetic beauty of marsh life, then the terror and awesome finality which results when man reclaims a marsh for his purposes."
