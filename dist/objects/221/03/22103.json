        "Made to show students the fundamentals of good batsmanship, with demonstrations by Len Hutton and coaching by H. P. Craptree. The film falls into three sections. Part one \"Forward Defence and Attack\": The forward defence stroke is analysed; the stance, grip of bat and method of making the stroke are illustrated in shorts of Hutton practising at the nets. The forward attack stroke is similarly analysed."
