        "Episode of Series \"Social Security\". This film deals with the problems faced by the Cruickshank family living on the land - insecure employment, lack of constant medical benefits cover, and the need to continue in unpredictable work in a rural environment. They are aware of their own powerlessness against accident, sickness, and the economic forces governing their lives and they can only hope for the best."
