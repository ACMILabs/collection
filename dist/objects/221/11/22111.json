        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Commonwealth of Nations\". This film reviews the tumultuous past of India, Pakistan and Ceylon up to the events in recent history that saw these countries attain full independence. We meet the heroes of the independence movement - Mahatma Gandhi, Prime Minister Nehru, and Muhammed Ali Jinnah - and see how their work bore fruit. Edgar McInnis delves into the commonality of Commonwealth aspirations as exemplified in the free choice of these three nations to remain in the Commonwealth after their colonial ties with Britain had been cut."
