        "An analysis of past and present human folly in exploiting and destroying the vitality of the soil. The film commences with the story of the fall of ancient civilizations. To avoid the disasters of the past, humans, as an integral part of nature, must obey the laws of life. The film claims that husbandry, based on an awareness of our inseparable partnership with nature, leads to the promotion of health and vitality in soil, and so in plant, in animal and in humans thereby completing the \"cycle of life\"."
