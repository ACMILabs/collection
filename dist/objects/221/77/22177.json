        "Shows how organising the routine of the day in the primary school aids teachers' curriculum and cognitive goals, and how a consistent routine allows children to predict the sequence of events, experience different time lengths and the concepts of beginning, middle and end. The film also illustrates how activities and drama during specific times of the day reinforce cognitive goals."
