        "Made to show students the fundamentals of good batsmanship, with demonstrations by Len Hutton and coaching by H. P. Craptree. The film falls into three sections. Part one \"Forward Defence and Attack\": The forward defence stroke is analysed; the stance, grip of bat and method of making the stroke are illustrated in shorts of Hutton practising at the nets. The forward attack stroke is similarly analysed. Part two \"Backplay\": Introductory shots of a school match lead to a complete analysis of back play to an off-ball and to a leg-ball. Hutton demonstrates the strokes and Crabtree coaches a class, correcting their mistakes. Part three \"Cut, Hook, and Glide\": Les Hutton demonstrates the use of the square cut, the late cut, the hook, and the leg glide strokes in match play and in practice at the nets. Schoolboys practice the various strokes with their coach."
