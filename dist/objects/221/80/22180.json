        "South of Hyderabad, India, astride the mighty Krishna river, stands the most massive masonry dam ever constructed. In an architectural feat which parallels the building of Egypt's Pyramids, 30,000 men, women and children worked day and night for 14 years to complete it. Nagarjunasagar is three miles across, 400 feet high and forms one of the largest man-made lakes in the world."
