        "The life, education and activities of crofter children against the impressive background of the Scottish highlands. Shows how the coming of electricity to the crofters' homes, the development of local industries and the mechanisation of agriculture, are gradually changing the traditional pattern of life. Local school-children at Gairloch and Poolwe in Western Ross appear in the film, with Kenneth Mackenzie, a crofter's son, as the main character. Commentary by James McKechnie."
