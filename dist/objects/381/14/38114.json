        "In 1930, Amy Johnson was the first woman to fly solo to Australia and she became the idol of the masses. In 1941 she mysteriously vanished. This fascinating BBC production dramatises her life, from being \"the most famous woman in the world\" to marrying Jim Mollison, a pilot who is envious of her triumphs to the final and tragic end. Features Harriet Walter as Amy Johnson."
