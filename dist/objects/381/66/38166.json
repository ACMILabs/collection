        "Episode number 3 of Series \"I couldn't put it down - hooked on books. Classroom classics\". The two parts of this video use clips from films of the books to illustrate their themes and discussion points \"To kill a mockingbird\" depicts life in a small Southern United States town during the depression, through the eyes of a six year old girl whose father is defending a Negro in a rape trial. The novel deals with courage, prejudice and the people and events that shape our lives. \"The Miracle worker\" tells the true story of the early life of Helen Keller, blind and deaf, through illness and the attempts of a young girl, Annie Sullivan to discipline her and develop her abilities. Teachers notes accompany the video."
