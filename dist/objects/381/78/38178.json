        "This program looks at differences between the two genders, both real and perceived, and the new discoveries by researchers into the brain, which suggest that these differences are due to physical differences in the male and female brain. How much of our behaviour is predetermined and how much can be learnt or modified should perhaps be reassessed in the light of these discoveries, and new attitudes to difference and equality formed."
