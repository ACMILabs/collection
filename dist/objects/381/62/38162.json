        "70 million years ago, the last of the dinosaurs disappeared from the earth. These dinosaurs (\"terrible lizards\") ruled the world for over 130 million years. This storybook style program introduces children to the evolution of dinosaurs and their development over four periods - the Triassic, the Jurassic, Cretaceous and the end of the dinosaurs. Young viewers are introduced to the names and terminology used in the study of dinosaurs and all terms are simply explained and illustrated."
