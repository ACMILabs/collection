        "In 1979 English director Ron Peck released his first feature, \"Nighthawks\", a low-budget exploration of the London gay club scene. Using a combination of new scenes shot on video and out-takes, loops and production notes from the original film, Peck has created a sequel which examines not only the personal struggles of a film-maker to come to an understanding of his sexuality, but also documents the struggles of young film-makers to gain funding and encouragement to create their visions on screen. Part autobiography, part film-making journal, part a history of the contemporary gay movement, \"Strip Jack naked\" celebrates an aesthetic and a personal sexual expression which are not represented in mainstream cinema: this film is an encouragement to any artist working from the margins."
