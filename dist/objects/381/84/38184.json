        "Winner of 7 Australian Film Institute awards, \"Proof\" is a provocative and engrossing film about a man's obsessive search for truth. Martin (Hugo Weaving) has been blind from birth. He trusts no-one, except for the camera which has replaced his eyes. His photos are proof that the world he senses is the same as other people see. Then he meets a young kitchen hand, Andy, whose honesty and kindness allow Martin to trust for the first time - until Martin's jealous housekeeper, Celia, sets out to destroy this relationship. Written and directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse who won a 1992 Victorian Premier's Literary Award for her screenplay. Cast also includes Genevieve Picot, Russell Crowe, heather Mitchell, Jeffrey Walker, Saskia Post, Frankie J. Holden."
