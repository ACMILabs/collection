        "This is the true story of the Lovegrove family. It is the story of Suzi, a loving wife and mother stricken with AIDS. This documentary poignantly deals with this tragic and deadly virus, and seeks to educate the viewer about the debilitating effects of AIDS not only on the victim, but on those who love her. This film sensitively brings home the reality of AIDS. It won't easily be forgotten."
