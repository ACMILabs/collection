        "In 1988, in conjunction with EXPO, a series of bronze sculptures and paintings, considered masterpieces of French art from the 16th-19th centuries, and which are housed at the Louvre, were exhibited at the Queensland Art Gallery. This video is a potted art history from the Renaissance to Rodin. It looks at famous patrons such as Louis XIV, the Sun King; well regarded artists and sculptors of the time; and gives a brief explanation of the key movements in Art History during that time."
