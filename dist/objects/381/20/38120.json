        "Visit Egypt 'the gift of the Nile\" with a recorded history of more than five thousand years and experience the antiquities of Egypt such as the Sphinx and Great Pyramid in Giza. Travel to Cairo with its contrast of most modern city in the Middle East, but also mirror to an ancient past in bazaars, antiquities and museums. Visit also Alexandria once ruled by Alexander the Great and Cleopatra. In Turkey, visit Istanbul and the Turquoise Coast. Istanbul spans two continents and has been the capital of three empires: Byzantine, Holy Roman and Ottoman. Walk through the city's old sector to see the monuments of these cultures."
