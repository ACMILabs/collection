        "This video provides a unique opportunity to explore the ideas and works of the Australian born artist William Delafield Cook. Produced in conjunction with the artist's Retrospective at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, it covers the stylistic development of his art from the 1950's to the present day. Delafield Cook lives and works both in England and Australia. Widely travelled, his art embodies an exceptionally diverse interest in art history, photography and films."
