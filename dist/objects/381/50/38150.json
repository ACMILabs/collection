        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Top end\". Elisabeth Stenhouse, trained as a sausage maker, emigrated to Australia from Berlin in 1956 at the age of 24. In the 60's, she met and married stockman, Des Stenhouse, and now lives on a large Northern Territory cattle station, Helen Springs, which her husband manages and where she works as the supervisor of domestic staff. This half hour profile of the Stenhouse family shows how Elisabeth and Des work as a team to produce a sense of community in this isolated part of Australia, a place Elisabeth now definitely sees as her home."
