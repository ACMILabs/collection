        "This video is the first comprehensive obedience, behaviour and temperament training program designed especially for puppies. Emphasising family participation, this video shows owners how to teach their puppy basic obedience commands such as \"come\", \"sit\", \"heel\", and \"stay\". Through daily handling and calming exercises, your puppy can also be taught to overcome biting, barking, and housetraining behavioural problems. The aim of the video is to train dogs to be good companions and a joy to live with."
