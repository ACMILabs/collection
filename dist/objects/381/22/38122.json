        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Marketing / Coast Community College District\". Good marketing is based on a few basic concepts: know your customer, believe in your product, be committed to quality and exploit changing circumstances in innovative ways. The Disney empire is an outstanding example of this. Very early on Walt Disney recognised that his customers wanted to be entertained and he set about satisfying and exploiting this wish in a variety of ground-breaking ways, from feature length animated films, licensing agreements, theme parks and co-sponsorship to the Disney cable TV channel. A fascinating case study in high powered marketing."
