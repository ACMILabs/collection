        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Australians, from all ages, from all backgrounds, discuss mythologies and stories connected with birth, mothering and pregnancy. The video utilises the imagery of water to represent the foetal world of the womb. By contrasting stories of pain and joy; accounts from mothers and accounts from adults who have undergone re-birthing; and by contrasting different cultural experiences of birth, \"Birthdays\" ultimately is a testament to the crucial role, ideas surrounding birth and mothering have on forming individual and cultural identity."
