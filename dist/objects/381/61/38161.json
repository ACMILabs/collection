        "This documentary features interviews with veterans of the Gallipoli campaign. Through recollections, photographs and archival film, the history of Australia's involvement in World war I is explored. The video includes interviews with Turkish veterans of the battle who offer their own stories of tragic loss. The documentary concludes by following a group of Australian veterans who return to the Turkish coast to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign. The video includes footage of the official Dawn Service at Gallipoli on the 75th Anniversary of the dawn landing attended by Prime Minister Hawke."
