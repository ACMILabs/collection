        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Newcomers to Australia experience isolation and loneliness, but when a newcomer does not speak English and comes from a non-Anglo culture, this isolation can be even more intense, particularly in rural areas. \"Country Women\" looks at the work of Sunraysia Multicultural Women's Association in Mildura and its role as a meeting place for isolated migrant women. Five women share their experiences of adjusting to a new country - German plant breeder, Luise Mock; landscape painter, Petronella Cavallaro; Turkish vineyard owner, Emine Simsek; Hong Kong Chinese student, Teresa Yin Mai Kwok; and South African Indian, Bharti Purchase."
