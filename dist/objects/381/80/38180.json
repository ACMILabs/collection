        "Western Australia is one of the oldest areas in the world and contains the earliest fossilised evidence of life walking on earth. This video follows Australian palaeontologist, Dr John Long, and the Dinosaur Club of the Museum of Western Australia (which includes hundreds of children) on their hunt for fossils, bones and footprints of the dinosaurs who once lived in that state. Computer and model animation are used to illustrate the dinosaurs whose relics have been unearthed, some of which are unknown in the Northern Hemisphere, which possibly suggests Australia was the last home of the dinosaurs before their extinction."
