        "Episode number 3 of Series \"When the war came to Australia\". The Americans arrive and the Australians welcome them into their homes and into their lives. The Australian women are charmed but when the Australian soldiers arrive home from Europe they are less than pleased. General MacArthur takes over the Pacific war which causes some resentment. Normal life is put on hold as the men are away and women work longer hours. Life is hard with little leisure and the mounting toll of the dead and wounded is making an impact."
