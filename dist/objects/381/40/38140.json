        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". Teresa M. Amabile, a psychology professor and therefore also a statistician explains why statistics is fundamental to scientific method. Although it is possible to manipulate numbers, on the whole the statistical analysis of data puts reason back in charge. Statistics is divided into three processes, describing data, producing data and drawing conclusions from data. This program shows how statistics are relevant to almost all aspects of life, from business, delivery of public service and welfare to all kinds of research, including the humanities."
