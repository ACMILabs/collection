        "More than a hundred years after the Tasmanian Aborigines were declared extinct, their descendants set out to reclaim the lost graves of their ancestors on Flinders Island in Bass Strait. The neglected burial site at Wybalenna was, in the 1830's, Australia's first segregated Reserve, under the directorship of George Augustus Robinson and is now the battleground which divides a community. The film raises difficult questions about what constitutes Aboriginality today, and how colonial attitudes still linger on. Winner Best Australian Film at the Melbourne Film Festival."
