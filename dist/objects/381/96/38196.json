        "The term 'Cyberpunk' was first used to describe a new genre of science fiction literature, inaugurated by the publication of William Gibson's book 'Neuromancer'. A self confessed computer illiterate, Gibson's visions began shaping the way people thought and spoke about future technologies. This program examines the concepts central to the Cyberpunk movement and interviews Cyberpunks, young people determined to use technology against those who would otherwise control that technology. The program covers computer animation, hacking and piracy, Virtual Reality and various technologies that have emerged or are being developed, influenced by Gibson's literary visions."
