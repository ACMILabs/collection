        "Eight women artists from the Papunya community were invited to Queensland Art Gallery to create a groundpainting that would enhance and extend the exhibition \"The Inspired dream: life as art in Aboriginal Australia\" This video documents the making of the painting, explanations of its symbolic meaning and the dancing ceremonies which are traditionally performed when the work is finished. The artists were Emma and Mali Nungurrayi, Topsy, Mary and Jeannie Napaltjarri, Mavis Napangati, Phylis Nakamarra and Mavis Nampitjinpa."
