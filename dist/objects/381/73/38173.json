        "Endometriosis is a condition that affects about 15% of women between the onset of puberty and menopause. \"Endo\" occurs when the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, migrates to locations outside the uterus. This misplaced endometrium is most commonly found on the ovaries, uterus, bowels, bladder, ligaments, and on the Pouch of Douglas. This tissue bleeds every month and causes cysts and adhesions to form, sometimes binding organs together. Endometriosis often remains undiagnosed by doctors - the average length of time before a correct diagnosis is made is eight years. This short film features interviews with women of all ages and backgrounds who relate their experiences with \"endo\". This video dispels the myths about endometriosis and offers positive suggestions for coping effectively with this condition."
