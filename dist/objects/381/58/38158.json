        "Episode number 4 of Series \"When the war came to Australia\". In this final episode, Australians must face the consequences of over six years of war - a toll of shattered limbs, lives and unrealised dreams. After victory in the Pacific, it is a weary nation that welcomes its soldiers home. The war years have changed for ever the way Australians see themselves, both individually, particularly with respect to the relationships between the sexes, and as a nation looking to America and Asia instead of to Britain. Individuals comment on what the war meant to the average Aussie and how it affected their lives."
