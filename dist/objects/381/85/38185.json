        "This excellent BBC adaptation of the Dickens' novel stunningly captures the power of the original. Pip, played by Gerry Sundquist, grows to maturity thanks to the help of a mysterious benefactor whom he believes to be the vindictive Miss Havisham (Joan Hickson). He falls in love with her cold- hearted niece, Estella, and seems to have successfully discarded his humble past - until the mysterious convict, Magwitch (Stratford Johns), re-enters his life."
