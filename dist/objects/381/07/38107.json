        "A Global Forum of Women was held in Dublin in 1992, a gathering of women leaders from around the world, assessing together the gains already made by feminism and the ground still to be covered to eliminate prejudice against women. The women discussed the need for, and importance of, a diversity of women in positions of leadership to serve as role models, the problems of balancing career and family, and women as an economic and political force. Those interviewed include Mary Robinson, President of Ireland, Dr Anne Summers, women's adviser to the Australian Prime Minister, Betty Friedan, author of \"The Feminine Mystique\", Bella Abzug, former US Congresswoman, Devaki Jain, Indian economist, Dame Jocelyn Barrow, UK broadcaster, Iola Mathews of the ACTU, and Ruth Bamela Engo-Tjega from Cameroon who works for the UN."
