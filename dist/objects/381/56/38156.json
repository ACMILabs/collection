        "Episode number 2 of Series \"When the war came to Australia\". The true horror of war hits Australia as the Japanese attack and bomb Darwin. Britain's failure to defend Singapore betrays Australia's long held belief that the Mother Country will always come to her defence. Prime Minister John Curtin begins to rally the nation and the Americans arrive. Features reminiscences from those who lived through the experience, including Russell Braddon and Dorothy Hewett."
