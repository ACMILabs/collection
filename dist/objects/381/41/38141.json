        "It is May 1968 and the student revolt in Paris is beginning to spread throughout France, but in a large villa in the south-west of France where a family has gathered for the funeral of the grandmother, the division of the estate and a generation of new romances appear to be more important considerations. This delightful comedy was nominated for four Cesar awards and stars Michel Piccoli as the disorganised Milou and Miou Miou as his efficient niece. Louis Malle wrote the script in conjunction with Jean-Claude Carriere. Music is by Stephane Grappelli."
