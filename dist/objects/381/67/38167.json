        "Episode of Series \"I couldn't put it down - hooked on books. Classroom classics\". Classroom Classics utilises material from film versions of literary works to encourage students to seek out, read, and analyse intelligently books they are studying in class. In this episode two important political novels of the twentieth century are discussed. George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" is a caustic satire about the corruption of idealism. John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a powerful novel about the effect of the 1930's Depression on the American poor. Both novels are analysed in relation to the historic conditions that fed the writers' art, passion and anger."
