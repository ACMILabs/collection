        "Morrissey's post-Warhol feature film about gang violence in New York's Alphabet City. Marilia Pera is outstanding as the Brazilian leader of the Mercentanos gang. She is a drug-dealer and pimp, but also mother to a group of teenage boys who obey her every command, be it shooting a rival or doing the laundry. \"Mixed Blood\" is violent and disturbing but it maintains a comic tone throughout that refuses sentimentality and cliche. This is a drug \"exploitation\" movie scored to a festive, breezy Latin beat."
