        "Married women who are in paid jobs spend an average 36 hours a week on unpaid household work, whereas married men do an average of 18.1/2 hours a week of unpaid work. This dramatised story explores one family's conflict of sharing the load between both partners working fulltime and the responsibility of running a home and caring for their young daughter. On this particular Tuesday evening, Bridget (Karen Vickery), tired and rather tense, finally turns on her partner Mark (Richard Healy) over the matter of washing the dishes. She feels he is not sharing the full burden of domestic duties preferring to participate in the easier and more pleasant tasks and leaving her to the real housework such as cleaning the toilet, preparing dinner and doing the dishes. What is fair to both in balancing and sharing paid work, housework and childcare? Booklet included with video."
