        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Visit vast Alaska and its Northern lights, active volcanos, mountains, lakes and rivers. Alaska is the country of the unexpected. People can sometimes be found fishing at midnight and sunset can be at noon. Take a cruise through the inside passage, home of whales, seals and thousands of birds. Visit Ketchika where the people have largely kept to their traditional ways, and Sitka and its Russian architecture. At Juneau, visit the Red Dog Saloon and at Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, watch a canoe race and ride a hot air balloon. Meet the locals of Alaska, the Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts."
