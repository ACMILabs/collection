        "Narrated by Christopher Plummer, this program offers a kaleidoscopic view and history of the city which is an important centre for three of the world's great religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The old city is divided into four quartes - Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Armenian, where about 26,000 people live. The video profiles residents of old Jerusalem including a Jewish family of Yemeni jewellers; a Belgian refugee from Nazism; a Muslim artisan and television performer, Halil; Father Timothy, private secretary to the Greek Orthodox patriarch and finally, an Armenian Christian, survivor of Turkish oppression, who now works as a photographer."
