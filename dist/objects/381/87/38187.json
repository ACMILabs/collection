        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Trade unions in Australia are very much Anglo-Saxon male dominated. Migrant women wanting to participate in the labour movement have sexual, language and cultural barriers to overcome and very little is being done to rectify this situation. In this program various women speak about their situation; factory workers and outworkers contribute their opinion about the difficulties in getting what they need out of their union."
