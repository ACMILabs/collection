        "A sexual assault counsellor debunks myths about rape describing women's responses and both short and long term effects. Explores the diverse reactions of women who have been sexually abused or assaulted through vox pops, professional advice, interviews and non-exploitative reconstructions. Outlines the healing process and support for the victim and those close to her. Accompanied by a 24p. booklet for partners, friends, family members or professional workers."
