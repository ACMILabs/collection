        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Alcheringa (A)\". Aborigines from central and coastal districts trade their specialities among themselves, in particular weapons of the hunt and of war. Leaving his family at their inland mia-mia, the man travels through dense bush to barter with another Aborigine, so that each may benefit from the other's skills. They sit face to face and test each weapon for strength before returning with their new possessions. With Bill Onus."
