        "Within two years of the end of World War II, the alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union was shattered and for the next 40 years global affairs were dominated by the battle for ideological and material supremacy between the two superpowers: a battle fought through espionage and propaganda. The Cold War resulted in the nuclear arms race and in the \"space race\", as well as entrenching either Soviet or US domination throughout the developing world. The video explores the Cold War from the beginning of President Truman's policy of \"containment\" in Greece; to the formation of NATO and the Warsaw Pact; through the Korean, Vietnam and Afghanistan wars; through the Cuban Missile Crisis; the revolts against Soviet domination in Hungary and Czechoslovakia; to the destruction of the Berlin Wall which symbolised the end of the Cold War and totalitarian Communism."
