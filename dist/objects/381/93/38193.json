        "Conservator of artworks on paper, Linda Black, demonstrates a series of conservation treatments used to slow or prevent future damage to artworks. Damage may have been caused by the use of inappropriate materials by the artist, undesirable procedures used by those preparing works for framing, or inadequate care of artworks through time. This video provides a \"behind the scenes\" look at the conservation operations at the Queensland Art Gallery."
