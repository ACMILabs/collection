        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". This video examines the problems encountered by Aborigines and overseas born Australians when dealing with the health care system. Health care professionals discuss the importance of providing interpreting services, of the need for cross-cultural communication training, and the need for health services to encourage the employment of staff from a variety of cultural backgrounds. The video dramatises some of the drastic consequences of doctors and health professionals not communicating effectively with patients from other cultural backgrounds."
