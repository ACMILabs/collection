        "A history of the anglo-saxon gay and lesbian movement scored to the liberating popular tunes of the last 25 years. Moving from the initial struggle for gay law reform, to the revolutionary politics spurned by Stonewall to the homophobic policies initiated under Thatcher and the New Right, this film is a celebration of the achievements and struggles of gay and lesbian activists. Funny, inspiring and bound to get your feet tapping \"The Gay Rock and Roll Years\" is a great introduction to queer history. Songs featured include Doris Day singing \"Secret Love\", The Kinks doing \"Lola\", Sylvester singing \"You Make Me feel (Mighty Real) and Culture Club asking \"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me?\". From rockabilly to soul to glam to disco to punk to house: we're gay, we're proud, we don't ever stop the dance."
