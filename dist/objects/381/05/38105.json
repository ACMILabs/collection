        "In an effort to break down existing myths about HIV/AIDS and present the information in a way that was culturally appropriate for Aborigines, the Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Service in Broome commissioned a play entitled \"No prejudice\" and sent it on tour throughout the Kimberley region. This video follows the touring company of five actors and advisers and highlights the importance of why alternatives to the written word are necessary to a people whose culture is essentially oral."
