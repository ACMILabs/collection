        "Inspired by the life and works of Jean Genet, this short video includes interviews with four contemporary gay film-makers/writers - Derek Jarman, Neil Bartlett, Constantine Giannaris and Robert Chevara - to investigate the pleasure, the danger, the joy and fear involved in homosexual love and sex. Interspersed with the interviews are scenes set in a prison: gay romanticism and eroticism are linked to a social history of sexual repression and oppression."
