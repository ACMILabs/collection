        "Episode of Series \"Famous authors\". William Wordsworth was born and lived for most of his life in the beautiful lake district of England, and it was his attachment to the grandeur of the scenery and the simple people who inhabited it, coupled with his fervour for the French Revolution which was to be his inspiration. His personal life was characterised by close relationships with his wife Mary, his sister Dorothy, the writer De Quincy and perhaps most significantly, the poet Coleridge, with whom he co-wrote \"The Lyrical ballads\" which contained much of their best work."
