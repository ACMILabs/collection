        "Our chromosomes are decided at conception, and shortly thereafter hormones start to play their part in determining sex. This program investigates the role that hormones play in determining sex and sexual characteristics, including behaviour patterns. Can hormones change brain structure? Does the brain determine gender related characteristics? The program looks at studies of children who suffer from Turner's syndrome and CAH syndrome as we attempt to unravel the roles of nature and nurture in patterns of behaviour."
