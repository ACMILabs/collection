        "Garbo - the undefinable mystique. The most elusive, seductive and enigmatic actress the cinema has ever known, this Swedish star attracted audiences like no other. Her intense desire for privacy became legendary, vanishing from the screen - and the public - at the height of her commercial success. Hosted by actress Glenn Close, this video presents an insight to the mysterious Greta Garbo, including clips from such films as \"Grand Hotel\", \"Queen Christina\", \"Anna Karenina\", \"Camille\" and \"Ninotchka\", plus some rare behind-the-scenes glimpses, screen-test footage and foreign film clips - all of which only add to enhance the legend of one of Hollywood's most elusive screen love goddesses."
