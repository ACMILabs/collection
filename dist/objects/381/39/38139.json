        "In this first program, \"Overview\", Sol Garfunkel introduces the concept of optimisation, of ensuring that a particular project is completed in the best possible way, within the restraints of cost, performance and schedule. Using examples such as the Apollo moon shot and ensuring customer satisfaction at Disneyworld, the program introduces the mathematical concepts of scheduling, queuing, and critical path analysis and shows how the application of mathematics is vital to the management of any enterprise."
