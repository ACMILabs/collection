        "Episode of Series \"I couldn't put it down - hooked on books. Classroom classics\". Clips from the film versions of these two seminal novels help students understand the plot, characters and essence of the stories. The narrator poses questions which hopefully stimulate the student to think more deeply about the issues tackled in the novels. \"Lord of the flies\" is described as, simultaneously an adventure story and an exploration of human nature, and good and evil, posing the question \"Is human goodness an individual matter?\". \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" could be seen as the true beginning of American literature, and poses questions about freedom, responsibility and individuality."
