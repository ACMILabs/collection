        "Made for the National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation. Provides examples of unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature which may or may not be sexual harassment and invites discussion. It attempts to assist managers to recognise the consequences of sexual harassment to an organisation, suggests how an organisation might respond to the issue and provides guidance to managers and supervisors on the skills required to handle the problem. Accompanied by an 18p. manual of the same title."
