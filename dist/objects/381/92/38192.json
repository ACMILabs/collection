        "This video explores the history of the surrealist art movement. The first half, \"Crisis in the Concept of Reality\", investigates the social conditions in Europe that led to surrealism. The human misery caused by the first World War led to many European artists taking on a nihilistic opposition to the values of Western civilisation. Influenced by the psychoanalytic theories of Freud, Dada was a precursor to Surrealism, in which the artist declared him or or herself as anti-art, anti-establishment. The second part, \"A Torrent of Dreams\" concentrates on the work of surrealist painters such as Miro, Dali and Magritte, musicians such as Erik Satie and the film-work of Cocteau, Dali and Bunuel. The onset of World War II led to an artistic exodus to America. New York City displaced Paris as the capital of the art world and painters such as Pollack and Johns, and musicians such as John Cage were influenced by the immigrant surrealists."
