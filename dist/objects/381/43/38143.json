        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Business file.\". Alex Burton leads a discussion with Professors Jerome McCarthy and William Stanton and Jeff Jones of Procter and Gamble on the topic of product strategy. Products can be either consumer goods or industrial goods and need different marketing approaches according to the end market. The marketing strategy, and hence the product strategy is also affected by the product life cycle, which passes through introduction, growth, maturity and decline. The general discussion is illustrated by examples from the business world, in particular the development of \"Pampers\" disposable nappies."
