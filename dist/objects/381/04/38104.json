        "1n 1967 Aborigines, were finally given equal rights and pay, but paradoxically this has meant that many Aboriginal stockmen are now considerably worse off. This film documents the struggles of the Watson brothers and their sons to reclaim the abandoned Mount Anderson Station in the Kimberleys for the Looma Community. Not only do they have to deal with threats to their land from mining companies, but they also struggle against the lack of support from their own community whose culture is under threat from the evangelical Assembly of God and alcohol."
