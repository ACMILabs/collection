        "Activating dissent, part two of this inspiring profile on leading US linguist and political activist, Noam Chomsky, continues with him on his travels through Canada, Japan, Europe and across the USA as he informs, challenges and confronts the public and the press. He further develops his analysis of media manipulation and neglect in coverage of Cambodia and East Timor and vehemently defends his controversial support for the democratic right to free speech of the French academic, Robert Faurissson, who maintains there were no Nazi death camps. Part two concludes with Chomsky praising the journalism practised by alternative publishers and public broadcasters."
