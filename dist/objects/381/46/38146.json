        "Genetic engineering is the process of taking a copy of genetic material from one living thing and putting it to work in another. This can be achieved by mixing in a test tube, by injecting DNA into the nucleus or by using a virus or bacterium to carry the DNA into the new organism. Examples are shown of these techniques in use. The program then moves on to canvas the views of notable interested people on some of the issues associated with genetic engineering. Those interviewed include, Gus Nossal, feminist Robyn Rowland, Carmel Travers, Peter Singer - a philosopher, Peter Garrett and Merilyn Sleigh - a genetic engineer."
