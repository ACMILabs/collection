        "ABC \"Science Show\" host, Robyn Williams, narrates this fascinating program on the ethics of scientific research and a recent case of major fraud involving internationally renowned geologist, Professor V. J. Gupta, of Punjab University. Gupta's falsification of research spread over a 25 year period in 400 published papers. The fraud was unearthed due to the tireless detective work of Australian paleobiologist, Professor John Talent, of Macquarie University. The scandal generated by his findings resonated at a national level with the Indian government imposing a media ban in a cover-up attempt, but Talent's perseverance meant the truth was finally made public."
