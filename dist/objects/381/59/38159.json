        "A comprehensive two part program examining the successes and failures of the Australian Business Migration Program. The first part examines the history of the ABMP which was set up in the early 1980's to entice successful entrepreneurs to Australia. Seventy percent of applicants to the ABMP were from Taiwan and Hong Kong and two years into their residency in Australia, close to half the applicants were still not involved in creating business opportunities for themselves in their new country. The second part of the program examines some of the problems encountered by business migrants including language difficulty, encountering a different commercial culture in Australia and negotiating an indifferent government bureaucracy."
