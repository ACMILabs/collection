        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Faces of culture\". Culture is the set of beliefs and practices which enable us to adapt to our circumstances, but it is more than a survival tool as it circumscribes, filters and gives value to reality. Patterns of culture are passed on from one generation to another through symbols, example and ceremony, but as the world shrinks in size and communication with other cultures becomes commonplace, some cultures are in danger of disappearing, destroyed by other more dominant cultures. Their preservation or careful assimilation is of vital importance. Narrated by David Carradine"
