        "David Sproxton and Peter Lord began making films together at school, and in 1972 set up Aardman Animations in Bristol, specialising in model animation and claymation. This selection from the studio includes \"Barefootin'\", an early pop-promo with a track by Robert Parker; \"Next\", a witty 5 minute condensation of the entire Shakespearean theatrical canon; \"Late Edition\", a warts-and-all look at a \"right-on\" newspaper; \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\", a feline interpretation of the Nina Simone song; \"Sledgehammer\", the celebrated Peter Gabriel clip; and the 1991 Academy Award winning interviews-at-the-zoo, \"Creature Comforts\" plus its highly successful follow-on, the Heat Electric TV commercials."
