        "Noam Chomsky has literally transformed the study of linguistics and at the same time has emerged as a consistent and active critic of power politics and the media which support it. \"Manufacturing consent\" explores the political life of this controversial author, linguist and radical philosopher. Part one, \"Thought control in a democratic society\", focuses on \"democratic\" societies, especially the US, where populations are controlled not by force but by more subtle forms of ideological control. Chomsky extensively analyses and exposes the disparity in media coverage of two recent \"genocides\" - the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia and the Indonesian invasion of East Timor."
