        "Judith Wilkes (Greta Scacchi) is an ambitious journalist on the trail of a story every reporter dreams of - a refugee in crisis in Malaysia with international repercussions. The officials have shunned Judith and the authorities have barred her from investigations. Her only hope lies in befriending the exotic Minou Hobday (Joan Chen), the wife of a high ranking diplomat and a woman with connections. Co-starring Jack Thompson and Art Malik. From the original novel \"Turtle Beach\" by Blanche d'Alpuget."
