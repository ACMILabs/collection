        "The romantic plight of two generations is captured here in this filmed adaptation of Sloan Wilson's novel. Teenagers Molly (Sandra Dee) and Johnny (Troy Donahue) fall in love the moment they set eyes on each other during a holiday at the Maine resort of Pine Island. Molly's family have chosen the location as her father, Ken, was a lifeguard there 20 years ago and still has fond memories of the place where he once fell in love. Molly's mother is resistant to her daughter's relationship with Johnny, and as Molly becomes closer to Johnny her relationship with her mother deteriorates. The development of the young relationship is set against that of their parents, and in particular the history between Molly's father and Johnny's mother (Richard Egan and Dorothy McGuire) who once had a brief affair but are now trapped in loveless marriages. As they witness their children discovering the joy of love they once shared with each other, the old feelings return and they resume an affair. Cast also includes Arthur Kennedy, Constance Ford and Beulah Bondi."
