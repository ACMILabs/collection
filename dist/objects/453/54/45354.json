        "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 95, 98 or 3.1/Mac OS 7.1 or higher. Featuring Aaron Pedersen and Justine Saunders as your guides, this CD Rom showcases the work of more than 100 of Australia's Indigenous artists. Learn about different artists and aspects of Indigenous culture Australia wide by exploring this well presented and highly informative CD Rom. A tip: This CD Rom contains visual, audio and textual information about many Indigenous artists, some of whom are deceased. If you think these details may be distressing and you would like to hide this information about certain artists, choose the \"List of Artists\" options in the opening menu. A teacher's guide accompanies the disc and covers the following areas: introduction; using Moorditji; links with curriculum framework; teaching strategies and terminology, planning a unit of work; general worksheets."
