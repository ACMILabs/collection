        "Elvis Presley plays a dual role in this film - Airforce Lieutenant Josh Morgan, and a countrified Jody Tatum. Morgan is sent by the Government on the unenviable job of trying to secure hillbilly land for a proposed missile base. Much to Morgan's surprise he is faced with a blonde, country version of himself which means double the songs and women. Cast also includes Arthur O'Connell, Glenda Farrell, Jack Albertson and Pam Austin. Includes the following songs; \"Kissin cousins\", \"Barefoot ballad\" and \"Tender feeling\"."
