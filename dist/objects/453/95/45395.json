        "Professor Henry Jarrod is a renowned wax sculptor who is plunged into madness when an arsonist burns down his wax museum. Jarrod loses his life's work and, having lost the ability to use his flame-scarred hands, comes up with a new way of stocking his reformed House of Wax in New York. Aided by his mute assistant (Charles Bronson), he dips his victims in wax! Cast includes Vincent Price, Frank Lovejoy, Phyllis Kirk and Carolyn Jones."
