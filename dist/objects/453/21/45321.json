        "Jean-Guy Moreau is a Quebecois impersonator and political satirist who rises far above the level of being merely funny. In this film he prepares to perform in English before a Toronto audience. He will impersonate Premier Rene Levesque conducting a press conference. Moreau becomes so caught up with his subject that at times his personality merges with that of Levesque, as he fends off the questions of an equally involved audience."
