        "A discussion of the position of the arts in the 1960's, particularly in the U.S.A. and Canada. Speakers such as Jonathan Miller, Peter Ustinov, Elke Sommer and Jean Renoir consider various viewpoints such as artistic standards and values (art as an antidote for the drabness of standardised modern life), popular taste and interest(as a response to the ancient urge to create something of beauty), the business side, patronage and government support, and the place of art in society (the essence of art as being sensual and intuitive and beyond the reach of any \"culture explosion\")."
