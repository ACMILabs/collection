        "We know a few things about Biff Grimes (James Cagney) - he's married to Amy (Olivia De Havilland), he's a dentist, he often comes off second best, and he is a one time convict with a short fuse. One Sunday afternoon (the name of the play on which the film is based), a gentleman (Jack Carson) turns up to have his tooth extracted, this sparks an adverse reaction in Grimes, triggering a flashback sequence in which it is revealed that the patient was responsible for sending Grimes to jail, but more painfully that he stole Biff's girlfriend, Virginia Brush (Rita Hayworth), the eponymous strawberry blonde. As Biff relives the events of years gone by he is forced to re-evaluate his marriage to Amy, a suffragette and best friend of Virginia, and makes a startling discovery. Cast also includes Alan Hale and George Tobias."
