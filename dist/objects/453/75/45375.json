        "Pop Boyd (Scatman Crothers) owns a thriving karate school near downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately it sits on a piece of land upon which the local mob wants to build its own 'civic centre'. When the gangsters' muscling of Pop leads to tragedy, Black Belt Jones (Jim Kelly) steps forward to exact his own brand of lightning-charged revenge. Filmmaker Robert Crouse, who showcased Bruce Lee in 'Enter the dragon' and Jackie Chan in 'The big brawl', serves up masterful action sequences in which every move is choreographed like a ballet. Cast also includes Gloria Hendry, Eric Laneuville, Alan Weeks, Andre Philippe and Vincent Barbi. See also 'Game of death' (1978), 'Enter the dragon' (1973), 'The big brawl' (1980)."
