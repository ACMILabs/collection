        "Science - a specific way of thinking and acting, manifesting itself in the \"scientific method\" - allows legal personnel to reach the truth. Following the example of an arson case, this short documentary follows the process as police gather evidence, conserve evidence, conduct interviews, debrief, hypothesise and consult experts (in this instance a chemicals analysis expert) who will either prove or disprove their theories. At the heart of the investigation is experience, ideas and the importance of not assuming any presupposed truths. Also discusses the necessity of integrating changes in technology using DNA fingerprinting as a specific example."
