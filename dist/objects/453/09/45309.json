        "In Cassavetes' films the meaning behind love, relationships and identity cannot be easily apprehended because characters are always placed in the thick of things. \"Love Streams\" is about a brother and sister with different approaches to love, who come together to ease each other's trouble. Robert Harmon doesn't know how to establish lines of communication with his son, girlfriend and ex-wife. On the other hand, his sister, Sarah Lawson, repels her daughter and husband with her obsessive love. In an early scene Sarah states to the court that \"love is a continuous stream\". The saying informs the rest of the director's work, where the characters' personal dilemmas perpetuate their own life."
