        "It is the end of the nineteenth century and the future lies in the wild west. Judy Garland is a young woman attracted to the work opportunities along the great Sante Fe railway. Of all opportunities available there is none more alluring than Frank Harvey's chain of hotels and restaurants. Making her way out west she joins Anglea Lansbury, Marjorie Main, Cyd Charisse and a great Hollywood cast to become one of the \"Harvey Girls\". This opulent and sunny film is a great example of the Hollywood musical genre and features an outstanding musical score by Johnny Mercer and Harry Warren (songs include \"Oh, You Kid\", \"On the Atchison\", \"Topeka and the Santa Fe\"). Cast also includes John Hodiak, Ray Bolger, Preston S. Foster."
