        "A con artist arrives in River City, Iowa with the intention of duping the townspeople into forming a marching band and acquiring band equipment and musical expertise from him - at a price. He does not have a musical bone in his body however, so the band is unlikely to reach fruition. His plan begins to unravel when he falls for Marion (Shirley Jones), a librarian living in River City. This is the rather simplistic plot that provides a backdrop to the many song and dance routines. Robert Preston reprises his Broadway role as con artist \"Professor\" Harold Hill. Shirley Jones plays the role performed on stage by Barbara Cook. Includes hits such as \"Ya got trouble\", \"Till there was you\", \"Marion the librarian\" and \"Seventy six trombones\". Cast also includes Buddy Hackett, Hermione Gingold and Paul Ford. The tape also includes a documentary about the making of 'The Music man' - \"Right here in River City: the making of 'The Music Man'\", as well as the original theatrical trailer and an introduction by Shirley Jones."
