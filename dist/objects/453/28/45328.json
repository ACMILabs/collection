        "Two people are drawn together in Cornwall during World War II by their shared misfortune. Lissa (Margaret Lockwood), a brilliant concert pianist suffering from a potentially fatal heart condition becomes romantically involved with engaged RAF pilot Kit (Stewart Granger), who is slowly going blind. Neither of the two knows of the predicament of the other, and keeps secret their personal drama. When Lissa learns of Kit's blindness, she tries to convince him into having a dangerous and experimental operation to restore his sight. Conflict ensues when Lissa and Kit's financee are at loggerheads as to whether Kit should have the surgery. Cast also includes Patricia Roc, Tom Walls and Reginald Purdell. Screenplay by Leslie Arliss and Doreen Montgomery from a short story by J. W. Drawbell. \"Cornish rhapsody\" composed by Hubert Bath, played by the National Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Sidney Beer. Solo pianoforte by Harriet Cohen."
