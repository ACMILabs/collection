        "Clark Gable reprises his role as the hunter to become the hunted in this lusty remake of the 1932 classic, \"Red dust\". Gable is a game hunter in Kenya who becomes involved in an explosive love triangle involving the respectable (yet also emotionally volatile) wife of a British anthropologist (played by Grace Kelly), and a rather forward Broadway show girl, Eloise \"Honey Bear\" Kelly (Ava Gardner). Marswell (Gable) hooks up early with Honey Bear who he meets while she's waiting for an African steamer. She misses meeting up with a maharajah, and decides to stay with the rugged hunter instead. Enter anthropologist Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden) and his wife Linda (Grace Kelly), who harbours a secret desire for Marswell who is also instantly taken by her - much to the disappointment of Honey Bear. Nordley has enlisted the help of the professional safari guide to take them on a gorilla documenting hunt. Women are not the only things causing Marswell trouble however, as the native African wildlife and a potential native uprising throw more perils into the mix. Based upon a play by Wilson Collison."
