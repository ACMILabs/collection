        "Friends and pilots Mike Edwards (Elvis Presley) and Danny Burke (Gary Lockwood) find themselves hitchhiking a ride with a Chinese farmer and his niece who are on their way to the World Fair in Seattle. They leave in their wake creditors, the welfare board, smugglers and a gangster, while still finding time to woo women, gamble and croon along the way. Although this is not one of Elvis' best features, it still includes a few memorable songs such as \"One broken heart for sale\", \"How would you like to be\" and \"Take me to the fair\". Cast also includes Joan O'Brien."
