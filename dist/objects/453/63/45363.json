        "Cleopatra Jones is dedicated to wiping out drug dealers on an international scale, with her personal anger directed at the pushers who operate in the ghettos. One such operator is her arch-nemesis, the black leathered 'Mommy'. When the drug traffickers's deadliest and most beautiful enemy oversees the torching of a poppy field in Turkey, she leaves Mommy feeling pretty burned up. Mommy's revenge is first directed at the ghetto's anti-drug headquarter and Cleo must take on Mommy and her offbeat stooges Doodlebug, Pickle, Snake and more. Cast includes Tamara Dobson, Bernie Casey, Brenda Sykes, Antonio Fargas, Bill McKinner and Shelley Winters."
