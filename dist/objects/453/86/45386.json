        "Based on the novel by Rafael Yglesias, Peter Weir's \"Fearless\" is a moving examination of the effects of surviving an airline crash. Max Klein (Jeff Bridges) is a successful San Fransiscan architect with a strong fear of flying. When he survives an airline crash his life changes completely. He believes he is invincible - he becomes fearless. Max emerges as the hero of the crash when he helps people out of the wrecked plane, but afterwards he becomes estranged from his wife (Isabella Rossellini) and son. Despite attempts by airline psychologist Bill Pearlman (John Turturro) to get Max to participate in his group therapy sessions, Max is happy to defy fate at every turn. The only person he can share his experiences with is Carla Rodrigo (Rosie Perez) who lost her young son in the crash. Max tries to 'save' Carla, who has lost the will to live, but who can save Max from his need to test the limits of his existence? A remarkable and riveting film with an excellent cast. The scenes of the planecrash are eerily realistic - don't watch this before flying!"
