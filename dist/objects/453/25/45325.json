        "It's 1942, and Flight Lt. Michael Quinn (Dirk Bogarde) finds himself in Delhi to participate in a Japanese language course for interrogators of prisoners of war. His instructor is the beautiful Suzuki San (Yoko Tani), and the two fall in love and secretly marry. Tragedy befalls the newly wed couple when Michael returns to Burma and is captured and tortured by the Japanese. He is painfully reminded of the tenuous nature of their inter racial romance when he hears her voice broadcasting anti British propaganda. At first heartbroken, he vows to be reunited with his love when he discovers she is suffering from a terminal illness. Using love as inspiration, Michael vows to escape from prison and see his wife one more time before death separates them forever. Cast also includes John Fraser, Ronald Lewis, Anthony Bushell, Ken Okawa and Donald Pleasance. Based on the novel of the same name by Richard Mason."
