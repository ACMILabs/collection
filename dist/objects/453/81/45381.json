        "Members of the now defunct \"Barry Nichols and Les Girls\" musical act (Gene Kelly, Kay Kendall, Mitzi Gaynor) are re-united under inauspicious circumstances. It appears that one performer, Lady Wren, has published a no holds barred memoir, highlighting her years, and the romantic escapades within the cabaret group. A libel suit is brought forward by another member of the troupe, suing for defamation of character. This leads to a courtroom setting in which they attempt to reach the truth behind the story. Through flashback inspired by Sybil's memoirs, stories of suicide, unrequited love, and love spurned are recounted in Rashomon like style to reveal vastly different accounts in this witty, delightful musical. Music and lyrics by Cole Porter. (Awards: Academy award for Best Costume Design, Orry-Kelly)."
