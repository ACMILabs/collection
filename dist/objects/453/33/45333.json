        "Outlines the horrific effects of the two atomic bombs dropped on the small cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. With the aid of some contemporary footage, the film shows the devastating psychological and physiological results on the populace, both immediately and in the following months and years after the war. Includes footage of a visit by Pope John Paul II. Also mentions the huge stockpiling of thousands of far larger bombs in the decades since World War II."
