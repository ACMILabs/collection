        "Joel Goodsen is an industrious, responsible and college bound teen whose parents are going on vacation and leaving him in charge of the house. No sooner do Joel's parents leave when Joel begins to step outside of his conservative and respectable self. Transforming from a straight A high school star athlete to an uninhibited party animal, Joel invites his friends to enjoy his hospitality, as well as his parents' liquor. Things go from bad to worse when he meets a streetwise callgirl, Lana, who lives the theories of free enterprise and high finance Joel's been studying. Cast includes Tom Cruise, Rebecca deMornay, Curtis Armstrong, Bronson Pinchot and Raphael Sbarge."
