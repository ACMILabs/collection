        "Faces concentrates on two scenarios, one where middle-aged businessmen cheat on their wives and the other where the wives bring home a younger man from a nightclub. Both wives and husbands take turns in testing the novelty of the situations, initially improvising to bridge the awkwardness but then risking more and more. While the night out feels liberating, it ends up tearing painfully at their conservative personas."
