        "Eight year old Phillip, the son of a devout Jehovah's witness mother, is staying home while all other children are out trick-or-treating. The next morning their home is broken into by prison escapee Butch Haynes, who needing a hostage to aid his escape from jail, grabs Phillip and flees. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him as they take to Texas highway on the run from the cops. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas border, being more concerned about fulfilling Phillip's prohibited wants and dreams. Texas Ranger Red Garnett is not in any hurry to catch Butch either. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son relationship, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together in time for a final confrontation. Cast includes Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood, Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther."
