        "The Killing of a Chinese Bookie presents a portrait of a man who is so self-sufficient that he cannot become personally involved with anyone. Cosmo Vitelli, played by Ben Gazzara, is a nightclub owner who believes in conducting his personal and business affairs with plenty of flair and professionalism. When the mob threatens him he works desperately to save his face and the club."
