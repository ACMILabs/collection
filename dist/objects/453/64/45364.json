        "Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier star as Dave and Manny, two Chicago crooks who have independently made a bundle ripping off rip-off artists who exploit the poor. But they have no intention of giving to the poor, until ex-Detective Burke pulls a con of his own - he anonymously gives the pair a choice, to donate time to a Community Centre or do time in a federal prison. Scrambling in their off-hours to find out who is blackmailing them, the two spend their working hours in classroom confrontations reminiscent of Poitier's \"To Sir With Love,\" with 30 troubled ghetto kids. Cast includes James Earl Jones, Hope Clarke and Ja'net Du Bois."
