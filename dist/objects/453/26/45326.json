        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Famous women of the past\". Strange and dramatic pages from the lives of the world's most famous women. The Queen of Sheba having heard of King Solomon's wisdom, travels across the desert to Jerusalem to meet him. The journey is one of the greatest overland journeys in history. On her arrival, the King greets her with majestic splendour, cordiality and hospitality. After a six-month stay, the Queen decides to return home. Following a sumptuous banquet in her honour, King Solomon tricks the Queen and satisfies his lust for this woman of great beauty and deep intelligence. The Queen of Sheba returns home and gives birth to a son. King Soloman never sees the Queen again but does finally meet his 16 yeaer old son, who later becomes the King of Abyssinia."
