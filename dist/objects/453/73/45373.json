        "One of the more conscientious and political 'right on' of the Blaxploitation genre, Charles Bail's ('Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of gold') 'Black Samson' stars Rockne Tarkington as Samson, a community minded nightclub owner whose softly spoken voice and peaceful demure doesn't deter him from sticking it to the 'man' when drugs invade his inner city neighbourhood. His saintly like persona is further enhanced by the staff he carries with him everywhere, which also happens to be a deadly weapon when needed. Samson's patience is tested when the mafia begin to recruit some of the black gangs in his hood to help them distribute drugs in the area. Things get personal however when the mob rough-up his girlfriend in order to dissuade him from interfering with their racket. Naturally all hell breaks loose as Samson bands with his neighbourhood to combat the drug menace and settle his personal score. Cast also includes William Smith, Connie Strickland, Michael Payne and Carol Speed."
