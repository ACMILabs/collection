        "Andersonville was the notorious Confederate prison where Union soldiers were kept as prisoners of war. It is a place where men who once fought alongside each other now kill for the shirts off their backs. Sergeant McSpadden (Frederic Forrest) and Josiah Day (Jarrod Emick) lead a fearless band of men against the brutality of the most notorious prison of its time and the savagery of its inmates. Hunted like animals and tortured without mercy, they must trust in each other and be willing to sacrifice their own lives for the chance to escape. Frankenheimer creates a powerful portrayal of the struggle for freedom where the only law is the law of survival."
