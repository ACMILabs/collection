        "During the second world war, president to be John Fitzgerald Kennedy took part in the war effort by skippering a PT (Plywood Torpedo) boat in the Solomon Islands. Cliff Robertson enacts these exploits in 'PT 109', with a plot that centres around the assignment of harassing the enemy to buy time for a U.S Navy still in development, and a daring rescue by Kennedy to save an injured soldier. Kennedy's boat - PT 109 , was sliced in half by a Japanese destroyer in August 1943. Lieutenant Kennedy was in the region on a rescue mission to retrieve Marines stranded upon the Isle of Choiseul. It became imperative for him to devise a plan to get his men, and the rescued marines to safety by navigating a safe path through a potentially enemy dominated area. Strangely enough, the successful plan involved a coconut. Cast also includes Ty Hardin, James Gregory, Robert Culp and Grant Williams."
