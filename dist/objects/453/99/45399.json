        "Set in the West Indies, a young Manuela (Judy Garland) is told by her aunt Inez that arrangements are being made for her to wed the mysterious new mayor of the town, Don Pedro Vargas (Walter Slezak). Manuela is crushed, as it signals an end to her fantasies of being swept off her feet by the legend of the romantic, yet notorious pirate - Macoco. Being a dutiful surrogate daughter to the aunt and uncle who have been like parents to her, Manuel agrees to the marriage, and they soon take a short trip to the Caribbean island of San Sebastian. As fate will have it, a magician and his troupe arrive in San Sebastian at the same time, ready to perform for the locals. The magician is taken by Manuela's beauty, and after a failed attempt to seduce her, convinces her to come along to the show. The magician tries to win Manuela's heart by impersonating the man of her dreams, the pirate Macoco, and during his performance hypnotises then kisses her. Now totally smitten, the \"pirate\" Serafin follows Manuela home to try and convince her to run away with him, only to be discovered by Don Pedro Vargas, who is recognised by the magician as being the \"real\" Macoco. Based on the play of the same name by S. N. Behrman, as produced by The Playwrights Producing Company and The Theatre Guild. Cast also includes Gladys Cooper and Reginald Owen. Songs by Cole Porter."
