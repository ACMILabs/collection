        "Gunnery Sergeant Tom Highway (Clint Eastwood), war veteran and Medal of Honor recipient from details in Korea and Vietnam has one last tour of duty prior to his forced retirement from the U.S Marines - training a bunch of new recruits. The brashness of a youth who have experienced war passively through film and literature is incongruous with Tom's traditional hard nosed ways, yet Tom has proven himself to be a complex character also, as the film follows his attempt to rekindle a past relationship with lines that he too has learnt from books. Tom's skills for preparing men for battle are put to the test when the recruits experience war for the first time during an invasion of Granada. Cast also includes Marsha Mason, Everett McGill, Moses Gunn, Mario Van Peebles and Eileen Heckart."
