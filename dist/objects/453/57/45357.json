        "The marriage between Eddie and Grace (Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid) is about to change big time when Grace catches her husband with another woman. Contrary to the belief that Grace is a meek, mild and passive wife, she does everything she can to draw attention to her cheating husband. Her actions aren't appreciated by everyone however, including her father, a prominent figure in society who is embarrassed by his daughter's public antics, as well as feeling threatened by her willingness to question masculine authority. Grace takes on the plight of cheated women en masse, and exposes the names of all the cheating husbands and their girlfriends in her Charity League meeting. Grace's number one target however remains her husband, the only problem is her family keeps interfering which may help or hinder Grace's plans for revenge, and change the family dynamics forever. Cast also includes Robert Duvall, Gena Rowlands and Kyra Sedgwick."
