        "This low-budget romantic drama marks Paul Oremland's directorial debut. Craig is a 21 year old boxer from Blackpool, making cash from illegal bare-knuckle fights. A chance meeting outside a club leads him to a brief sexual encounter with Matt, a self-assured disc-jockey from London. He flees the escalating violence of Blackpool and turns up on Matt's doorstep where he is introduced to the freedom of Soho, an openly gay world he never imagined existed. As the pair become more involved the illusions on which their relationship is built begins to crumble, not helped by Matt's scheming gay boss (Roger Daltrey) and possessive flatmate, who seek to break them up. Cast includes Steve Bell, Ian Rose and Dani Behr."
