        "Episode of Series \"Quantum\". Narrated by Angela Catterns, this episode from the \"Quantum\" program looks at the most unique signalling device known to man; the face. It discusses what our static face reveals about us, what makes a face \"attractive\", how and why facial expressions have evolved, can be involuntary or masked, and are remarkably universal. Shows the work of researchers who have charted over 10,000 facial expressions according to the muscles involved and features an interview with a Mobus sufferer (\"dead face\" syndrome) to explore the relationship between expression and feelings."
