        "It is the dead of winter and GIs are dug in near the strategic crossroads of Bastogne. They are surrounded, outnumbered and bombarded with a steady barrage of incoming fire. Ammunition is low and it looks as if the fog will never lift. The Germans, sensing victory, demand surrender - and receive a strong reply from the American commander. Winner of the Best Screenplay and Best Cinematography Academy Awards, this movie is a landmark portrait of triumph under fire dedicated to the honour all soldiers and resonates with the humour, fear and bravery of civilian soldiers put to the test in the greatest conflict the world has ever known."
