        "Big hearted, iron fisted and patriotic, Wilder (Wayne) braves dangerous waters pursuing Red Chinese forces as he steers a boatload of Chinese refugees along the 300 mile waterway called Blood Alley to freedom's shores. Joining Wayne is Lauren Bacall who - for the first time - plays a rough outdoor role. Wayne's role was originally meant for Robert Mitchum, but he was fired from the film after an altercation in which he shoved director William A. Wellman into San Francisco Bay. Music by Roy Webb. Written by A.S. Fleischman."
