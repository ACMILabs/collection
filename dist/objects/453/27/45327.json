        "When a father decides that his son needs to be educated in learning about the fairer sex as well as life outside their blue blooded world, they head to the city which epitomises romance, Paris. Thus, Sir Edgar (Alec Guinness) and his 20 year old son begin a combined quest which appears completed when they meet the beautiful and spirited Lizette (Odile Versois). Complications arise when partner swapping appears on the cards. Sir Edgar finds himself falling in love with his son's intended and his son too has fallen for the older woman (Elina Labourdette) he has found for his father. Cast also includes Vernon Gray."
