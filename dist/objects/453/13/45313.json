        "Writer Paul Auster made his solo directorial debut with this romantic drama that combines myth and realism in a form of storytelling that is both simple and complex. Izzy Maurer is a jazz saxophonist whose life is permanently changed when he is hit by a stray bullet. After his recovery, Izzy can no longer play and falls into a depression. He stumbles across the body of a stranger and ends up with the dead man's briefcase. Inside, he discovers a mysterious stone which leads him to Celia Burns, an aspiring actress and listener of his music. Together, they discover the power of the stone and the threat of those who want it, as the story takes a dark and surprising turn into the Pandora's Box of Izzy's soul. Cast includes Harvey Keitel, Mira Sorvino, Willem Dafoe, Gina Gershon and Vanessa Redgrave."
