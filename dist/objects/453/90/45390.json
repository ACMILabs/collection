        "All Steve Grayson (Elvis Presley) wants to do is drive cars and win. The only problem is his gambling manager has lost his money on the horses and drawn the attention of the IRS as well as a $145,000 debt. Fortunately for Steve the IRS manifests itself in leggy agent Susan Jacks (Nancy Sinatra). All is not lost on the financial front either, as Steve gets some valuable driving tips from former driver Abel Esterlake (William Schallert), which may help him win back the money in the Charlotte 500, and keep himself and his manager out of jail. Features the following songs: \"Speedway\", \"Let yourself go\", \"There aint nothing like a song\", and Nancy Sinatra singing \"Your groovy self\". Contains the original theatrical trailer. Cast also includes Gale Gordon, Bill Bixby and Carl Ballantine."
