        "The 1956 Olympic Games held in Melbourne have become etched in Australian mythology as a watershed in our sporting, cultural and civic history. This fascinating documentary examines the era in which they were held, post World War II, and how that influenced both the staging of the Games and some of the extraordinary events which occurred during it (such as the defection of Hungarian athletes). It looks beyond the myth to discover a compelling story of deceit, clashing egos and local and international politics which almost turned the so-called 'Friendly Games' into a national disaster."
