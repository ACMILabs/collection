        "Tamara Dobson reprises her role as special agent Cleopatra Jones, a martial arts crime buster, who's fierce Kung Fu moves are only eclipsed by her outlandish dress sense and heavy eye make up (Dobson is credited as her own make up artist). In her latest adventure Cleopatra finds herself in Hong Kong, taking on the vast drug cartel which is run by the evil and aptly named Dragon Lady (Stella Stevens). Highlights from this blaxploitation action film include Cleopatra's poor attempts at undercover work, a difficult task for a 6'2 black woman in Hong Kong, made even more impossible by her outrageous choice of wardrobe and unbelievable head gear. Cast also includes Tanny, Norman Fell, Albert Popwell and Caro Kenyatta."
