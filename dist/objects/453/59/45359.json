        "Super-slick detective John Shaft (Richard Roundtree) is back in this violent and action-packed follow up to \"Shaft\" (1971) and \"Shaft's Big Score\" (1972). This time, Shaft is persuaded by African diplomats at the United Nations to hunt down and expose the operator of a sinister slave-trading racket. After receiving lessons in African customs from the diplomat's beautiful daughter, Aleme (Vonetta McGee), Shaft goes to Africa and, posing as a native, allows himself to be captured. Things appear to be going smoothly until a traitor in the organisation reveals Shaft's true identity. Forced to fend off attacks on his life using only traditional fighting methods, Shaft is caught in a race against time to bring the ruthless, murderous traders to justice. 'Shaft in Africa' is a bold, fast-paced film featuring memorable dialogue, saucy images, and a funky soundtrack. Richard Roundtree won an MTV Movie Award for lifetime achievement in 1994 for his roles in the Shaft films."
