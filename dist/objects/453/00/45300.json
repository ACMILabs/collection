        "This fun and interactive CD Rom is a great companion to \"The Rugrats Movie\". Using the crazy antics of the Rugrats gang, it utilises the subject areas of English, music, maths and geography to guide children through different levels and activities. On successfully completing each section children can reach a 'prize'. This could be either a game to play on screen, or a clip from the film. Certificates can be printed out after each section is completed. Suitable for children aged 6-12."
