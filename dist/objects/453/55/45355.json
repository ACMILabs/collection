        "A beautifully filmed series of vignettes about the residents of a Melbourne high-rise public housing estate. Wordlessly, through striking imagery and an effective haunting score, we are invited to contemplate an Australian world populated with people from all over the globe. By celebrating the beauty and uniqueness of the residents' and their homes, \"Rise\" emerges as an eloquent and dignified study of contemporary working-class life. This short student film was an international award winner."
