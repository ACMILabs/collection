        "Based on a play by Wilson Collison, \"Red Dust\" is a fiery romance drama set on a rubber plantation in Vietnam. Dennis Carson (Clark Gable) is happy in the 'male' world of the rubber plantation which he runs. Then one day Vantine (Jean Harlow), a brassy blonde floozy escaping from some 'trouble' in Saigon arrives at the plantation. The sparks fly as Vantine wears down Carson's gruff exterior with her special charms. Then Gary Willis (Gene Raymond) a surveyor arrives with his earnest, refined wife Barbara (Mary Astor). Tensions rise as Carson dumps Vantine and begins pursuing Barbara. Directed by Victor Fleming, \"Red Dust\" perfectly teams the masculine and feminine sexual personas of Harlow and Gable. In 1953 the film was remade, again with Gable, as \"Mogambo\"."
