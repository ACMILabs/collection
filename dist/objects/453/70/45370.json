        "Light years ahead of its time, Kubrick's masterpiece has an awesome scope - his special effects border on miraculous. Inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's epic book, 2001 moves from the prehistoric birth of intelligence to the emergence of man as pure thought, somewhere in the future. Cast includes Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood. Contains the original theatrical trailer."
