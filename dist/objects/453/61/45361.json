        "Elvis Presley stars as racing car driver Lucky Jackson, a man determined to win the Las Vegas Grand Prix and triumph over his number one competitor, Count Elmo Mancini (Cesare Danova). The Count is like Lucky in many respects, a determined, thrillseeking ladies man, which makes defeating him even more difficult. To finance his vehicular obsession (and to purchase the most important item - the engine), he performs as a singing waiter, thus giving Elvis the chance to demonstrate his crooning and hip swinging capabilities. The task proves harder than first thought due to the distraction of sexy swimming instructor Rusty Martin (Ann-Margaret), as Lucky faces the prospect of losing love as well as the race. Elvis' fourteenth movie includes hits such as \"The Lady loves me\", \"What'd I say\", \"C'mon everybody\" and \"Viva Las Vegas\". Cast also includes Cesare Danova, William Demarest and Nicky Blair. Contains the original theatrical trailer."
