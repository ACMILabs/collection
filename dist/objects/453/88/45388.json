        "The King's 19th movie is shot on the original 1925 Cecil B DeMille set from \"King of Kings\" and features Elvis as matinee idol Johnny Tyrone. When Tyrone is kidnapped en route to the Middle Eastern premier of his latest film, he is launched into an Arabian Nights scenario, complete with chicks, sheikhs, a hostile political environment, and the obligatory damsel in distress (Mary Ann Mobley). He is also asked to take part in a plot to assassinate an Arab king. Features nine songs including \"Harem holiday\", \"Golden coins\", \"Shake that tambourine\" and \"Go East young man\". Cast also includes Fran Jeffries, Michael Ansara and Jay Novello. The film is alleged to have been made within 18 days."
