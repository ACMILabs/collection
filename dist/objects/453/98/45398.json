        "Acknowledged as one of the best war films to come out of Hollywood, 'Objective Burma' follows the plight of a group of paratroopers dropped into the Burmese jungle to wipe out a Japanese radar station - they are led by Captain Nelson (Errol Flynn). With their mission successfully completed, their arduous journey has only just begun when they are attacked by the Japanese and are unable to be picked up by the rescue plane. Thus begins a harrowing trek to freedom through jungles and swamps where the troops are faced with natural perils, internal demons, as well as enemy soldiers. From an original story by Alvah Bessie. Cast also includes James Brown, William Prince, George Tobias, Henry Hull and Warner Anderson. The film was lauded in the United States but blasted in the British press for minimizing the efforts of British troops in Burma. This led to the film being banned in Britain until 1952, and was only re-released after this with a pacifying prologue extolling British involvement in the campaign."
