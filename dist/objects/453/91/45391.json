        "The Battle of Cable Hogue is a departure from Peckinpah's repertoire of bloodshed and is instead an affectionate tribute to the fading old West which is represented by Cable Hogue (Jason Robards). By 1908 the old west has progressed, and frontiersman Hogue has managed to survive while maintaining his old ways. Hogue makes a living from selling water from a spring he accidentally stumbled across while near death in the desert. He sets up \"shop\" at a rest stop along the stage coach line, however past and present tensions arise when Hogue's livelihood is threatened by the advent of automobiles replacing stagecoaches. Cast also includes Stells Stevens, David Warner, Strother Martin and Slim Pickens."
