        "Tommy O'Haver's upbeat romantic comedy is an affectionate tribute to gay men's affiliation and love affair with the movies and the larger than life screen passions which subsequently inform and delude romantic expectations. Aspiring photographer Billy Coller (Sean. P Hayes) is down on his luck financially and romantically. His unfortunate habit of falling for straight guys lands heterosexual model Gabriel (Brad Rowe) into his path. When Billy enlists his new found lust object into posing for a series of queer themed photos aping classic screen kisses, sexual confusion ensues. Cast includes Paul Bartel, Holly Woodlawn, Richard Ganoung and Meredith Scott Lynn."
