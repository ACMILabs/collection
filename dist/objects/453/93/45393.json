        "Morgan Lane (Errol Flynn), an Australian sheepman arrives in Fort Humbolt, Montana ready to buy some land for grazing - his determination stemming from his father being driven off the land by cattlemen. His mission seems hard to achieve, especially when the suspicious locals are not ready to accept a stranger into their midst, and a sheep rancher at that. Lane faces opposition from cattle rancher Maria Singleton (Alexis Smith), a flame haired beauty who is initially attracted to the new stranger, until she discovers his motives. Singleton has a passionate aversion to sheepmen as her father, and her fiance lost their lives in a sheep and cattle war. Cast also includes Alexis Smith, S.Z. Sakall, Douglas Kennedy, James Brown and Ian MacDonald. Based on a novel by Ernest Haycock."
