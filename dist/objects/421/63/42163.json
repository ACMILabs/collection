        "The Pioneer Health Centre in Peckham was one of the first community health centres in England. This film shows the facilities and follows a family who join the Centre. The father and young son enjoy the Centre's activities, however, the mother is less impressed because the Centre's thorough medical check revealed that she needs to undergo surgery. The mother is gradually won over as she regains her health through the Centre's facilities."
