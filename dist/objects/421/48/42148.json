        "This documentary is an examination of the way the bush myth has been portrayed in such Australian films as \"The Sentimental Bloke\", \"Sons of Matthew\", \"Sunday too far away\", and \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\". It covers the use of the bush motif throughout Australian history and how the interpretations and reactions to the landscape have changed so rapidly. It studies how the theme of nature versus culture has goverened almost all film making depicting the Australian bush until approximately 1982."
