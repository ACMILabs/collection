        "This film stars George Wallace as a disaster-prone stablehand who owns a whistle that can make Cup favorite Hotspur run faster. A sub-plot of the film concerns a high society romance where a young girl has undertaken to marry an ageing suitor if his horse defeats Hotspur in the Cup. Much of the shooting for this film was taken away from the usual studio scene to location scenes at a stud farm near Melbourne, the Flemington racecourse and in the grounds of a palatial Melbourne villa."
