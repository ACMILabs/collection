        "'Hatred' documents various type of hatred and their consequences, beginning with the hatred that led to the filmmaker's father fleeing the Holocaust. This in turn leads to an exploration of hatred in the lives of the poor and the coloured in New York, and then to the complex clash of identity, religion, history and emotions between the Israelis and the Palestinians. This is a personal journey that asks bigger social questions about identity and prejudice in the modern world. It is a challenge for anyone willing to broach the issue of the origins of hatred in contemporary society. Director Mitzi Goldman presents herself with this very challenge by confronting hatred head on in an attempt to reach enlightenment. A study guide accompanies the video."
