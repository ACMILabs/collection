        "A compelling documentary in which eight women and two men, all adult survivors of child sex abuse, talk about how that experience has affected their lives. Each has their own intimate story to tell and they reveal personal anguish, guilt and recriminations experienced. This documentary looks at the memory process involved for many people who have repressed memories of their abuse and the long term ramifications of that abuse including sexual problems and revictimisations."
