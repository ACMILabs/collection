        "'Melbourne Rising' is a video document about the S11 protests against the World Economic Forum at Crown Casino in Melbourne. The protests aimed to shut down the summit in opposition to the injustices of corporate driven globalisation. After its release in late September 2000, Melbourne Rising was screened and broadcast in Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, the Neteherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. It also featured in  numerous film festivals across Australia as well as Korea and India."
