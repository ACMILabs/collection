        "Kalin's short video works, which use literary quotations as starting points, function both as visual poems and as alternative music videos. With their astute conjunctions of image, music and text, these tapes respond to issues of sexuality and human interaction in the 1990s, more than a decade into the AIDS crisis. In Nomads, a brief text by Jane Bowles is the point of departure for a vivid music video that presents an elliptical view of the realities of contemporary urban life. 'I fear nomads. I am afraid of them and afraid for them too.' -- Jane Bowles, Camp Cataract."
