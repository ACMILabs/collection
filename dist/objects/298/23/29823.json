        "Eleven prize-winning television commercials, grouped according to their persuasive intent, provide an entertaining and informative look into the business of advertising. From automobiles to insurance, from cameras to cologne, these vignettes illustrate the manner in which products are promoted all over the world. With no narration other than that contained in the commercials, each segment speaks for itself. Through imaginative animation and creative dramatisation, these messages accomplish their purpose by entertaining, educating, informing, using seductive overtones, etc. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
