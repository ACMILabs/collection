        "For centuries the African has made his home in the tropical rain forests of Nigeria and Ghana, surrounded by giant trees - walnut, mahogan y, agba, iroko and many others - whose wealth lay wasted. This film tells the dramatic story of an industrial enterprise which showed for the first time how these resources could be used."
