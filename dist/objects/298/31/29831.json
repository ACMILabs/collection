        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Critic and the Film\". Arnot Robertson analyses the film \"Twelve Angry Men\", directed by Sidney Lumet, produced by Henry Fonda and Reginald Rose, as a 'writer's play', concerened less with story and action than with character. Uses excerpts from the film to illustrate the development of the various characters and compares the opening and closing scenes."
