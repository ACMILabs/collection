        "The opening pitch of the television salesman pretty well establishes the tone of this pithy animation film: a solid-state model guarantees high-quality entertainment. TV Sale is an entertaining, incisive and horrifying satire on some of the material that is disgorged via the \"boob tube.\" Programs are designed around the product, not the spectator."
