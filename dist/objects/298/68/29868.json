        "This beautiful lakeside city of India attracts tourists from all over the world. Udaipur is a city of palaces, surrounded by hills and lakes essential for irrigation which also enhance the landscape. Wonderful gardens, temples decorated with carved marble and a tower of victory built in the 15th century are examples of the beauty of this city. These religious people love festivals; with a boat procession on the lake and girls wearing colorful saris."
