        "Ubu Roi was written by Alfred Jarry as a schoolboy in 1888. It's first public performance was in 1896 and it immediately gained the notoriety that it continues to enjoy. The bare bones of the story are those of 'Macbeth'. For this animated version, Geoff Dunbar has invented a brutal graphic style and 'language' of sounds to re-create the explosive impact of Jerry's original production. Animated by Geoff Dunbar, Annabel Jankel, Ian Lewis, Ginger Gibbons and assisted by Tony Barnes and Gail Wright. Based on the play 'Ubu Roi' by Alfred Jarry."
