        "A class of young children from the Institute of Rhythmics, Zurich, at work under the direction of Mimi Scheiblauer, who built the Institute on the principles of Calcroze's eurhythmics. Children's natural urge to move around and make a noise is guided by music and used to develop qualities of control and  attention. Miss Scheiblauer discusses some of the principles involved."
