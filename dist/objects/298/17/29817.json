        "This film traces the story of the development of the Australian wheat industry from the days when the first Ridley machine was taken into the crops at harvest time. It shows what scientific research and experimentation are doing today to help the wheat farmer combat rust, low rainfall, wind, weeds, and other pests, and to develop strains of wheat which mature well in spite of adverse climactic conditions."
