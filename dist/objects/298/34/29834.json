    "description": [
        "A record of the Twentieth Jazz Convention held in Sydney from December 26th to 31st, 1966. The main site of the convention was the Railways Institute but some bayside hotels, including the Coogee Bay Hotel, also became part of the scene. Includes some interesting shots of old inner Sydney streetscapes as well as the Opera House under construction. The first Jazz Convention was held in 1946 in Melbourne and features traditional jazz and blues music - 79 bands registered for this 20th convention. Performers included Graeme Bell, Nick Politis, Eric Richards, and the Original Australian Washboard Wackers. A must for lovers of jazz. Photography: Tom Cowan, Nigel Buesst."
