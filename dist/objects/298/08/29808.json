        "Produced to show the distribution, causes, effects and treatment of a form of land surface destruction which, though relatively rare in other parts of the world, is common in Victoria. Animated diagrams explain how such tunnel erosion is the result of movement of water in the subsoil. The latter part of the film gives a detailed account of reclamation methods used on a demonstration area near the Hume Highway at Avenal."
