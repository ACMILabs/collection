        "A comparison of wildlife on the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean's Christmas Islands, two islands although separated by almost 10,000 kilometres, have quite a lot in common. Shows the birdlife on both islands and highlights the phenomenon on the Indian Ocean Christmas Island, of the march of millions of pea-sized crabs from the sea to the jungle. Commentator: Caroline Jones Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
