        "Episode of Series \"Child development series\" The child's personality has developed to the point where he has begun to relate closely to members of the family and their friends. He realises that people and objects have separate existence apart from himself, and that they continue to exist when they are out of sight. The primitive motor reflexes have been replaced with definitive motor actions."
