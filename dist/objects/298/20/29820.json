        "1970 and world population below the age of fifteen has almost reached 1500 million. Of these, only one out of four gets any primary education, and less than one out of twelve achieves secondary schooling. What can be done to bridge the gap of ignorance, and prevent more millions from joining the ranks of the uneducated? Made for International Education Year."
