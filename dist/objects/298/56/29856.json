        "This film provides a penetrating view inside the world of bicycle racing. The colour and excitement of the sport are experienced as the camera follows a race from the exhilarating start to the pressure and frustration of the finish. Dramatic camera angles and comments by the racers involve the audience in strategy and techniques. There is appealing action for the non-bicycler as well as the seasoned racer."
