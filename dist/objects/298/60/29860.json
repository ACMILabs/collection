        "Presents a study of the life cycle of the cross spider showing how the spider builds its web, how it traps food in the web, how the female protects her eggs, and how the young spiders hatch and emerge from cocoons. Includes scenes of a spider trapping a fly in the web, stinging it to paralyse it, and encasing it in a cocoon of silk."
