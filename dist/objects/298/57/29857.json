        "The normal small child is intensely attached to his parents, especially to his mother, and if going to hospital means leaving her care he will fret - no matter how kindly he is cared for by the doctors and nurses. This film is in use throughout the world by lecturers and tutors who wish to illustrate the subtle way in which small children may show or conceal deep feelings of distress. Abridged version of original film made in 1953 by James Robertson."
