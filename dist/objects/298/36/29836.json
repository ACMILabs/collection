        "Hockey star Stan Mikita of the Chicago Black Hawks visits his native Czechoslovakia for a family reunion. During the course of a day and an evening the film accompanies him, his Chicago-born wife, and their daughter to places familiar to him in Prague and in the little village of Sokolce where he was born. There are many glimpses of the life of the Czech people at work, at home and at leisure. Their enthusiasm for hockey is evident throughout the film, especially when Mikita works out with a Czech team."
