        "Television is more than entertainment, it always \"teaches\" children and adults. Experts are interviewed to try and find out the effect of television on children. Broadcasters seem to see TV purely as a sales agent, and children grow up to grade three, implicitly believing all the advertisements as well as everything else they see. Deals with the impact of violence, racial and sexual stereotyping, commercials, and postitive and negative values in programming. Offers some suggestions for television programs as well as suggesting action for change. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
