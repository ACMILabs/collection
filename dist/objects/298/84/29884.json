        "Demonstrates how unconscious motives can influence and direct everyday thoughts. A demonstration of hypnosis of two subjects during which an experimental neurotic conflict is produced, is allowed to manifest itself in the posthypnotic conscious state, and is then relieved by aiding the subjects to recall the implanted traumatic material. Of interest to psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, psychiatric nurses, medical students and students of psychology."
