        "Examines the re-organisation of mental health services in Australia. Presents some of the changes that have shaped the treatment of the mentally ill in the second part of the 20th century. Patients are no longer admitted and forgotten. Modern and renovated hospitals prepare patients to take their place in the world again, whilst early treatment centres and out-patient clinics have been established. We meet patients in various centres and see them preparing for a new start in life. Photographed by Reg Pearse; music by Peter Sculthorpe; sound by Barry Bowden."
