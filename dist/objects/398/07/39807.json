        "Episode of Series \"Faerie tale theatre\". How delicate should a Princess be? According to this tale, delicate enough to feel the presence of a pea - through twenty mattresses! Liza Minnelli is the very sensitive and very lovable Princess in this romantic comedy. Her Prince, provided she can pass the \"Princessness Test\" his domineering mother insists upon, will be the equally lovable Tom Conti. Beatrice Straight and Pat McCormick are the hilariously odd King and Queen. They come together in fittingly magnificent costumes and sets inspired by the work of Aubrey Beardsley and Harry Clarke. This film teaches that what makes a Princess is not her title and stature, but her sensitivity to other people."
