        "New Zealander Vincent Ward's third film is an immensely ambitious and audacious love story spanning 30 years and two continents. Much of it is set and filmed above the Arctic Circle in northern Canada, providing breathtaking scenery. Some journeys have no map to guide them. This is an epic voyage from a kingdom of ice to a world on fire. It is the magical story of Avik and Albertine and a love that survived decades, impossible distances and the ravages of war."
