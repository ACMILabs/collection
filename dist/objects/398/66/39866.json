        "Episode of Series \"Dance Magic\". The Foxtrot originated when Harry Fox introduced a \"trot\" to a ragtime song in the 1913 Ziegfeld Follies. It soon became America's most popular ballroom dance. You can enjoy dancing the Foxtrot in the open ballroom or become close and intimate in a nightclub. The fast Foxtrot is called the Society tempo or Quickstep. Hosted by Terry Leone and featuring Patrick and Wendy Johnson."
