        "Episode of Series \"Dance Magic\". The Waltz originated in Southern Germany and France in the 17th century and was further popularized by the music of Strauss. Today's Waltz is slower than in those glory years but just as popular and equally elegant. The dance is like the music - sweeping, lyrical and romantic - hence its great popularity especially at weddings, balls and formal occasions. Hosted by Terry Leone and featuring David and Carrie Kloss."
