        "Brabham - one of the great names in motor racing history. A great driver who not only became a household name worldwide during the 1950's and 60's for his driving exploits, but who also created a racing team that was still winning in the 1980's. This story of Sir Jack Brabham, told exclusively in his own words and by close associates including Stirling Moss, Roy Salvadori and and John Cooper. Extensive archival material captures the feel of some glorious motor racing while tracing every step of a truly brilliant career."
