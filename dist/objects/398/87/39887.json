        "Last three episodes of a major and controversial international series which looks at the challenges that face medical science today. \"Disordered states\" (Dir: Peter Montagnon): Explores mental illness and how the treatment of patients differs in different countries. India, Italy and the United States are shown as examples. \"Pandemic\" (Dir: Susan Lambert, Stefan Moore): Looks at AIDS programs in the USA where the high-tech approach to medicine is out of reach of most of those who need it, in Thailand, where the entire population is at threat, and in Australia where there has been some success in containing the disease. \"Life support\" (Dir: Henry Singer) The final episode looks at how modern medicine deals with the frail, elderly and the dying, exploring issues such as when is enough life support enough? Warning - some scenes in this video may disturb some viewers."
