        "Bette Davis plays Jane Hudson, an aging alcoholic whose vauderville career as child-star \"Baby Jane\" has faded to obscurity. Her sister Blanche (Jane Crawford) lived in Jane's shadow as a girl but enjoyed a successful adult career as a glamourous film star until an \"accident\" left her wheelchair-bound. The aging sisters live alone in a gloomy Hollywood mansion, with Jane becoming increasingly eccentric and keeping Blanche a virtual prisoner. After a series of horrific incidents, the obsessive relationship between the two draws to a sinister conclusion. Based on the novel by Henry Farrell."
