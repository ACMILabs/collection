        "Jack Nicholson stars in another outstanding performance as a hard-bitten professional Navy-man given the loathsome job of escortinga very young sailor to a military prison for a minor crime. Randy Quaid, as the young man, hasn't begun to live yet, so Nicholson decides to give him a lifetime of experiences in three days!. This results in a drinking, fighting, womanising binge, unparalleled in movie history."
