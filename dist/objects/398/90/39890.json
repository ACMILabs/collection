        "Broadcasting journalist Bill Moyers reports on new insights into mind-body connections, and on some of the people - scientists, physicians and patients - which are describing new ways to think about \"sickness\" and \" health\". \"The mystery of Chi\" is filmed on location in Beijing and Shanghai, Moyers explores the role of the energy force known as chi in Chinese medicine and its implications for healing. \"Mind-body connection\" investigates medical scientists on the frontier of mind-body research. \"Healing from within\" examines Eastern meditation and Western group psychotherapy - methods which can teach people to use their minds to improve the healing capacity of their bodies."
