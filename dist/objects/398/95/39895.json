        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Nargun and the stars\". A television adaptation of Patricia Wrightson's novel of the same name, this series is the story of Simon Brent, a 10 year old city boy who is placed in the care of country relatives when his parents are killed in a car crash. Simon finds life very boring until he explores a nearby swamp, where he experiences some odd happenings and finally meets a strange swamp creature called The Potkoorok. From that time on, life is considerably more exciting, mysterious and dangerous for Simon and his relatives, Charlie and Eddie, as they do battle with a menacing giant rock known as The Nargun."
