        "Woody Allen stars, directs and co-authors this satire of all the prison dramas, chain gang eposes and true crime movies. It is basically a running gag about hero Virgil Starkwell, a master criminal who always bungles the crime (even one as simple as breaking into a gumball machine!), and ends up with more time in gaol than in his pursuit of crime. Full of Allen's wry, dry wit this is one to delight the buffs and break the funny bone."
