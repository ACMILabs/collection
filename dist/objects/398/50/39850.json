        "There's never a dull moment for Fireman Sam and his friends in four more delightful stories. \"Dilys' Forgetful Day\": Dilys loses her memory; and firefighter Penny Morris is introduced to Pontypandy's Fire Service. \"Halloween\": It's Halloween in Pontypandy, with tricks and treats for everybody. \"Spot of Bother\": Norman fakes chicken pox to avoid a spelling test. \"Norman's Pitfall\": Norman falls down an old coal mine shaft - just as well there's more than one way out!"
