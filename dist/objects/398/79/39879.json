        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Animals of Farthing Wood\". Another dazzling animated adventure for the animals of Farthing Wood. \"Are you telling me that you don't want to go on to White Deer Park?\" asks Badger of the tiny fieldmice who have decided not to continue on the journey to the nature reserve. The animals are less than half way through their journey but already their fearless leader, Fox is missing, presumed drowned. It's no surprise that morale among the animals is at an all-time low. So much as everyone loves and trusts Badger, it will need all of his strength and authority to keep the animals together, when even he must secretly doubt whether they will ever reach their destination safely... and if they do make it, will the cost have been too high?"
