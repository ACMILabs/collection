        "The first three episodes of a major and controversial international series which looks at the challenges that face medical science today. \"Conceiving the future\" (Dir: Tim Clark): Looks at genetics and the ethical dilemmas that arise from new technologies and being further able to pinpoint defects and abnormalities in unborn children. Asking questions such as what is abnormal? \"Code of silence\" (Dir: Stephen White): Examines to the heart of the doctor/patient relationship to find some extreme differences in the way physicians talk to their clients. \"Temple of science\" (Dir: Stefan Moore): Looks at the trend towards hi-tech medicine and specialisation, and Australia's lead being the U.S.A. Warning: some scenes may be disturbing to some viewers."
