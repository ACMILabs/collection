        "Broadcast journalist Bill Moyers reports on new insights into mind-body connections, and on some of the people - scientists, physicians and patients - who are describing new ways to think about \"sickness\" and \"health\". \"The art of healing\" introduces health care professionals who recognise that emotional states play an important role in people's vulnerability to disease, and in their recovery. Most people view illness as a mechanical breakdown that afflicts the body and requires technical care, \"Wounded healers\" investigates what it really means to get well."
