        "Doug Jones sets sail with the QE2 for a voyage 'down under' to New Zealand and Australia. He explores Rotorua and its geothermal world of mudpots, geysers and steaming lakes and cliffs, the Tasman Galcier in a ski plane , as well as visiting Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown. In Australia the Sydney Opera House is visited, as is a sheep station while shearing is underway. A behind the scenes look is taken at life aboard the ship from the bridge and the engine control centre to the largest floating kitchens in the world."
