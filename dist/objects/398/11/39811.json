        "This wonderful comedy is the film that catapulted Michael Caine to stardom. Alfie (Caine) is not really a bad sort. He's just a philandering cockney playboy who has this overwhelming desire for the opposite sex. What's more, he likes to brag about his conquests, and he doesn't have to exaggerate, because Alfie gets them all; fat, thin, blonde, brunette, young and even the older 'richer' woman. He's just irresistible, no one can beat him at the mating game! This is Michael Caine at his chauvinistic best. Also stars Shelly Winters as Ruby. Based on the play by Bill Naughton."
