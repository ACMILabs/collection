        "The 12 characters introduced in episodes one to eight continue relating their experiences of the Alcoholics Anonymous 12 step program. Step 9. \"Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.\" 10. \"Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted to it.\" 11. \"Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood him, praying only for knowledge of his will and the power to carry that out.\" 12. \"Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.\" 13. \"Relapse.\" Narrated by John Vernon."
