        "Filmed at Campbelltown Local Court, N.S.W. it follows a number of people from their interviews with a solicitor to appearance before senior magistrate Kevin Flack. Shows the enormous workload and dedication of Legal Aid Solicitors whoo are seen advising their clients. Produced by award-winning documentary maker, Jenny Brockie, the filming took six weeks in total and the makers had secured unprecedented access to Campbelltown local court. All the defendants who feature in this program gave their written consent to be filmed. They include: Heidi - a nineteen year old mother of two, who's been charged with receiving stolen goods; Dean - a young man charged with trying to break into a tattoo shop and trying to steal a tattoo gun; Joy - a 46 year old woman whose relatives are trying to have her put into a place of care under the Inebriates Act; Marietta - who's seeking an order to stop her ex-husband's girlfriend from harrassing her; Robert and Sean - who both face possible jail terms for separate offences of break, enter and steal. We also meet the major legal players at Campbelltown, the Senior Magistrate, Kevin Flack, Legal Aid lawyer - Justin Hutchinson, some private solicitors and the Police Prosecutor."
