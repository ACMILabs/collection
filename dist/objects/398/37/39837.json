        "In \"the Kid\", Chaplin is less of the buffoon and more of the actor but his comedy is ever present and there is not a dull moment once the comedian comes into the picture. Introduced as \"a picture with a smile - perhaps a tear\", it proves to be just that. For while it will move people to uproarious laughter and keep them in a state of uneasing delight, it will also touch their hearts and win sympathy, not only for the star, but for its leading woman and little Jackie Coogan. The little tramp adopts an abandoned Kid in the slums of early New York city, where only the fittest can survive. There are characteristic \"Chaplin touches\". A fine instance of imagination is where he dreams of Heaven. His slum alley is transformed into a bit of paradise, where everybody - including his nemesis, the cop, and a big bully are turned into angels! Includes an episode of those mischievious mites, The Young Rascals, entitled \"Three men in a tub\"."
