        "Martin Sorrondeguy, former vocalist for Los Crudos, is the producer of this powerful and uplifting documentary about the U.S. Latino punk scene and the DIY movement. The video features live performances by bands, including Huasinpungo, Los Crudos, Subsistencia, Sbitch, and many more. \"Beyond The Screams is also beyond the stereotypes. Latino punk bands? Writing from here in Gringolandia, I never knew of such a thing. Wasn't punk the exclusive property of hardcore white guys from the proletariat? Martin Sorrondeguy, lead singer of the Chicago-based band Los Crudos, takes us on a musical history tour, from the roots in the L.A. renaissance circa 1976 and bands like The Zeros, Plugz, and The Brats, to the latter nineties and the post-nihilism of Youth Against, Bread and Circuits, Kontra Attaque, and others. There's a DIY attitude to Beyond The Screams and a galvanizing energy that echoes many of the performances, songs delivered like shrapnel. The bands featured from El Paso, Mexico City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Berkeley testify to the intent of their music as political resistance. This isn't just chunky chords and crackling vocals. Beyond The Screams is the sound of hope mixed with rage.\" - Steve Seid, Pacific Film Archive."
