        "The acclaimed drama from director Bob Rafelson. A brilliant classical pianist from a well-to-do family, Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson), has made a career out of running from job to job and woman to woman. Presently working in an oil field, Dupea spends most of his free time downing beers, playing poker and being non-committal with his sexy but witless girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black). But when he is summoned to his father's deathbed, Dupea returns home with Rayette where he meets and falls for a sophisticated woman (Susan Anspach). Now caught between his conflicting lifestyles, the gifted but troubled Dupea must face issues that will change his life forever. Deceptively simple, but one of the most complex and interesting films of its time, it garnered an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Karen Black received the 1970 New York Film Critics Award for her excellent performance."
