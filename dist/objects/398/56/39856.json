        "This unique film was first produced in England in 1934 with the script written and spoken by Don Bradman. It has been updated with comments by Sir Donald, filmed at his home in Adelaide in May 1993. Provides a rare opportunity for cricket lovers to study the master batsman's technique in detail, and is an invaluable coaching aid to any aspiring cricketer. Bradman's test match career was an outstanding example of sporting brilliance; his career total of runs was 6,996 with an average of 99.9, including 29 centuries. Aggression, initiative and improvisation were the hallmarks of his playing and this footage, filmed on the London Cricket Ground in 1934, captures his style perfectly, shows the complete shot and stroke broken down into successive movements and as such provides an invaluable visual description of how to achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiency of movements when batting in a game."
