        "Episode of Series \"Miss Marple Series\". Miss Marple's keen powers of observation and detection are put to good use at Stonygates, the rambling country house where her friend Carrie-Louise (Jean Simmons) and husband Lewis run a reformatory for young criminals. Shots are fired in a dark room but the victim is discovered elsewhere. Miss Marple soon identifies the killer. Once again, Joan Hickson plays the ever popular Miss Marple."
