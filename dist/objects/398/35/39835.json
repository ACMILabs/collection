        "The incredibly multi-talented Danny Kaye stars as Hans Christian Andersen, a young cobbler with a special gift for storytelling. We first see Hans in his home town of Odense, Denmark, entertaining the village children with his fascinating tales - much to the displeasure of the schoolmaster. Hans takes off for Copenhagen where he falls hopelessly in love with a ballerina, only to discover she is already married. However, this unrequited love inspires a spectacular 17 minute ballet, \"The Little Mermaid\", that is one of the highlights of the film. Finally Hans returns home to the acclaim of his fellow townsfolk. Nominated for six Academy Awards, it is a visual and musical delight with an imaginative score. You will be enchanted by this entertaining and much-loved family film that has delighted both young and old for over forty years."
