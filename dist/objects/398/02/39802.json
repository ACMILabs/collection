        "During World War II, more than 650 Spitfire aircraft were delivered to the RAAF. This is the story of Colin Pay, who rebuilt one of those magnificent machines, a Vickers Supermarine Spitfire HF Mk VIII built in 1944, from the corroded hulk he acquired in 1982. It is now a superbly restored flying machine. Including some of the best air to air colour footage ever shot of a Spitfire in Australia, and archival footage of Spitfires in Darwin in 1943 and interviews with the pilots who originally flew them, this is the ideal video for avaition enthusiasts!"
