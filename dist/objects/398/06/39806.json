        "Based on Mary Hayley Bell's popular novel, this is a charming and thoughtful study of the fragile nature of childhood trusts and beliefs. Hayley Mills and Alan Bates give excellent performances in this story of three innocent children who find a fugitive from the law in their barn and believe that he is Jesus. Produced by award-winning Richard Attenborough, this film is a poignant unveiling of the children's gradual understanding of the truth, which will delight adults and children alike."
