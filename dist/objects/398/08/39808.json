        "In London, 1911, a prestigious London barrister (Laurence Olivier) is defending an ageing actress (Katherine Hepburn), from a breach of promise suit brought by a young gigolo who claims she trifled with his affections and reneged on her promise to marry him. The stiff collar barrister and his client were lovers years ago. Hepburn and Olivier give love a touch of class and received Emmy Awards for their performances. Similarly recognised was the sensitive direction by George Cukor (his TV movie debut) and the writing of James Costigan. Co-starring Colin Blakely, Richard Pearson, Joan Sims and Leigh Lawson. Based on the novel by Angela Thirkell."
