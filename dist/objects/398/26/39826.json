        "Released in 1971 to critical acclaim and public controversy, this modern day classic directed by Peter Bogdanovich garnered eight Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture). It was hailed as \"the most important work by a young director since Citizen Kane\". A frank, bittersweet drama of social and sexual mores in small-town Texas featuring a cast led by Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd in her debut role. Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson each won Oscars for their work in supporting roles. The characters created by Larry McMurty in his compelling novel are vividly brought to life in one of the most engaging coming-of-age stories ever filmed."
