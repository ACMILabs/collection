        "Morph, the favourite children's TV character is back on your screen! The little clay man from Tony Hart's art studio appears on video with thirteen of his best adventures ever. Join in the fun with Morph, the troublesome Chas, the geriatric skateboarder Grand Morph, the two girls Folly and Delilah, the gentle giant Gillespie, Nailbrush - who thinks he's a dog, and the helpful tribe of 'very small creatures'. The legend of Morph lives on, in over 55 minutes of fun. Narrated by Tony Hart."
