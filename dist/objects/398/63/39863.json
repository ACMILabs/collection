        "Episode of Series \"Dance Magic\". The Tango is back! This fiery yet romantic dance has been featured on Broadway and in productions worldwide. The Tango has its origins in the West Indies and was stylized by the gauchos of Argentina and in the Parisian cafes. It became the rage in 1921 after Rudolph Valentino brought the dance to millions in \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\". Hosted by Terry Leone and featuring Patrick and Wendy Johnson."
