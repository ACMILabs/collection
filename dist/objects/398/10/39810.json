        "In 1966, Col Turner was conscripted to fight in Vietnam. He served for 10 months, often in areas defoliated by toxic chemicals. In 1979 he and his wife Lorraine bought a War Service home. The street in which they lived had an unusually high incidence of psychological and family problems, birth disorders and inexplicable illness. Col contracts lymphoma which he and other Vietnam veterans believe is a direct consequence of their war service. After his death, his wife continues to seek acknowledgment by the Australian Government that his death was caused through exposure to Agent Orange. She is eventually successful and shortly after, a Senate enquiry was established, followed by a Royal Commission. Colins' case was used as the basis of the Vietnam veterans' claims. Starring Chris Haywood and Jennifer Cluff. Co-starring Arianthe Galani, Robin Ramsay, Peter Hehir, Peter Kowitz, Pat Evison."
