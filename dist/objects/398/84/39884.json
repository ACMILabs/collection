        "Throughout the 13 episodes, 12 characters are constantly entwined. Their experiences of the Alcoholics Anonymous 12 step program, compellingly told and captured first hand are interspersed with expert opinion for structural cohesiveness and direction. Step 1: \"We admitted we were powerless over our addiction - that our lives had become unmanageable.\" 2. \"Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity\". 3. \"Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood him.\". 4. \"Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.\" 5. \"Admitted to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.\" 6. \"Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.\" 7. \"Humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings.\" 8. \"Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.\" Narrated by John Vernon."
