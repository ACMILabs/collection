        "Episode of Series \"Travel, Travel\". Join Doug Jones on a journey to one of the most romantic cities of the world. For a thousand years \"the most serene republic\" has delighted visitors. Art, literature, and creative thought flourished here while the rest of Europe plummeted into the dark ages. It's streets of water and palaces rising from the sea formed a centre of creative thought that had never existed in the world before. Today Venice faces formidable challenges. This city, which has remained almost unchanged since Renaissance times, is being forced to cope with problems of pollution, overcrowding and art decay. While the problems have by no means been conquered, there is reason for hope. See the grandeur of St. Mark's Square, the Basilica, the Campanile, the bronze horses, the Doge's Palace and magnificent mosaics and art. Ride in a gondola past hundreds of palaces on the Grand Canal, visit Murano and watch glass being blown. The fishermen of Chiogga, the lace makers of Vurano, the factories of Mestre, the markets in the piazzas all join together to form a rich tapestry of one of the world's most beloved cities."
