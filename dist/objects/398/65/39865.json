        "Episode of Series \"Dance Magic\". The Swing is an offshoot of the Lindy which climbed the social ladder with the advent of 'swing' music in the 1930's, and still is the USA's most popular dance today, equally suitable for the ballroom or nightclub. The dance hold for swing is less formal and more relaxed than other dances, in keeping with the spirit of the music. Hosted by Terry Leone and featuring David and Carrie Kloss."
