        "In 1955 the Canadian Pacific Railway inaugurated the 'Canadian', a new train designed to offer the ultimate in rail luxury. It was then and remains today one of the longest train journeys in the world. VIA Rail took on the daunting task of restoring all of the original lounge Park Cars, the observation dome cars and the dining and sleeping cars. The restored cars are now in service on the northern route of the Super Continental. Doug Jones boards the train in Toronto and documents its journey to Vancouver across Canada. A history of the Canadian Pacific Railway is given, as well as a behind the scenes look at the operations of the train. Doug Jones also looks at tourist destinations along the way."
