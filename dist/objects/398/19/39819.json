        "The basis of this film is the National Park and Wildlife Services kangaroo control and management program. The kangaroo is shown, historically, as a source of food for the Aborigines, as game and a source of income for the first Europeans and today as a symbol of Australia. The Kangaroo Management Program is discussed at length. It aims to ensure the conservation of all species of macropods, the investigation of agricultural damage and the best use of product derived from culling kangaroos. Statistical information on kangaroo culling is presented diagramatically."
