        "This film deals with one of Hitchcock's favourite themes - an innocent person being falsely accused. The innocent person is a woman accused of murdering her friend. The jury have sentenced the accused, but one jury member disagrees, which requires the piecing together of a highly complex jigsaw puzzle. Cast includes Nora Baring, Phyllis Konstam, Edward Chapman and Miles Mander."
