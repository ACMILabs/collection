        "This video, presented by Dean Felton, is the second in a two volume set that takes an authoritative look at all aspects of the Great Barrier Reef, from its formation and constant process of dynamic change to its natural and human habitation. This is a remarkable expedition through the magnificent Whitsunday Islands, highlighting the delicate environmental balance that must be struck between man and the reef's fragile beauty. Experience the many worlds that exist within the extraordinary Whitsunday Islands group; the romance of isolated adventure; the mysterious spiritual history of the local islanders; roller-coaster rides on the trade winds across spectacular waters; the sheer indulgence of the most lavish and exotic resorts in the world; and meet the rugged individuals and fascinating characters who have made the reef wilderness their home. This sumptuously filmed documentary also looks at tourism on the reef and asks the question; is it responsible development or an environmental threat."
