        "Exile in the forest: second part of the story that is the very basis of Indian mythology, religion, history and thought. The Pandavas go into the thirteen years exile decreed by the game of dice that concluded episode 1. During this time, many supernatural adventures befall them; but the main thing is that Arjuna travels north alone in quest of Pasupata, the ultimate weapon; and that the Kauravas seeing by magical means him doing so, set off in quest of Pasupata as well. As a result, the universe enters the age of Kali Yuga - death and destruction. On the eve of the great battle, Krishna advises Arjuna - this is the Bhagavad-Gita."
