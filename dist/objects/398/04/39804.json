        "Neil Simon's fast-paced romance set in New York City revolves around the life of Paula McFadden (Marcia Mason) and her precocious daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings). Recently abandoned by her boyfriend, Paula soon discovers that their apartment has been sublet to Elliot Garfield, a confident and self-obsessed actor from Chicago preparing for his New York debut (Richard Dreyfuss in an Academy Award performance). As Elliot arrives to claim the apartment the hate-at-first-sight pair strike an uneasy compromise that has explosive consequences."
