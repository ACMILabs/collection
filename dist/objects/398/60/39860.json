        "Episode of Series \"The wonderful world of Paddington Bear\". Three more enchanting animated Paddington adventures. The \"Goings on at #32\" are enough to arouse suspicion - anyone's but Paddington's. Written by Joe Sandusky. In \"Ride 'em Paddington\" he puts on his cowboy duds and rides wildly through London. Written by Jack Enyart. It's \"The Picture of Paddington Brown\" that earns him the real money though, making the Peruvian native a real Da Vinci. Written by Bruce Falk and Michael Bond. Based on the beloved books by Michael Bond and features the voice of Tim Curry."
