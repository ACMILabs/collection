        "Chrissie is fifteen, homeless and fighting for survival on the street. She desperately needs someone she can trust to give her the chance to claw her way out. Martin and Graham are social workers who run a half-way house in Nelson Street for the kinds of kids that nobody else wants. They're only too familiar with the dark underbelly of damaged childhoods, so they are surrogate parents to six kids like them. Chrissie is friends with one of the kids from the home. She hovers in the orbit of the group home and she's almost tempted in the door, until one provocative act lands her back in the hands of the law. She manages to destroy every gain she's made and Martin is left to pick up the pieces. Conceived and written by one of Australia's most experienced scriptwriters, Emmy-nominated Alison Nisselle, \"Street angels' is a touching portrayal of the difficulties of being a street kid in Australia."
