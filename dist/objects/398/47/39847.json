        "In front of a capacity crowd and television audiences Australia-wide, Allan Border's XI crept home to a last ball win over the International XI. A selection of cricketing legends and sporting personalities were brought together to pay tribute to the man who was one of Australian cricket's greatest captains and all-round star. Due to the nature of the original footage from the National Nine Network telecast of 19 December 1993, some minor technical faults may appear."
