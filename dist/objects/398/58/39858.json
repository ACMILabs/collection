        "Three animated stories about Paddington Bear. Paddington decides that he will toss his floppy hat into the political arena in \"Paddington for Prime Minister\". Next, it's off to the seaside in \"Fishing for Paddington\". Then, only Paddington could turn a simple Brown family outing into a raging three ring circus in \"Expedition Paddington\". Based on the beloved books by Michael Bond and features the voice of Tim Curry. All episodes are written by Bruce Morris with the exception of \"Fishing for Paddington\" which was written by Gordon Kent."
