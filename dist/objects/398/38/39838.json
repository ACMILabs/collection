        "This biographical film, based on the real life of Quentin Crisp, is briefly introduced by Crisp himself. Crisp is an effeminate homosexual, a flamboyant and witty exhibitionist whose conversation is as glittering as the lipstick and mascara he used to effect. The film, drawn from his own book, tells the story of his life: his youth in the 1930's, his volatile relationship with his father, his ill-fated friendships, his encounters with authority in an extremely homophobic and intolerant society, and his rare moments of true happiness. Above all it tells the story of a good and honest man, determined to confront the world with the truth about himself, in order that they can learn to accept that he too is a human being with dreams and feelings just like everybody else. This is a witty and inspiring story of inner strength and fortitude, John Hurt was named Best Actor of 1975 at the British Academy Awards for his performance, and Jack Gold won the Academy's Desmond Davis Award for his creative contribution to television."
