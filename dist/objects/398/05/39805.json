        "Considered to be one of the best western films ever made, director John Sturges explores the relationship between two of the west's most celebrated legends - Wyatt Earp (Burt Lancaster) and Doc Holliday (Kirk Douglas). Earp is a U.S. Marshal in Dodge City and Holliday a dentist - turned gambler - who knows how to handle a gun. When Earp saves Holliday from mob violence, the foes become friends and join forces to rid the west of the lawless Clanton gang. It all leads up to the legendary Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Screenplay by Leon Uris. Featuring a small appearance by a very young Dennis Hopper."
