        "This film is a story of today's teenagers poised perilously on the brink between adolescence and adulthood. When one of them murders his girl-friend, the others must decide for themselves which is more important - admitting knowledge of a dreadful deed, or staying loyal to a close friend. They do not know how to react and their plight is one with which everyone - young and old - can identify. It is an extraordinary document of teen life today, showing how adolescents can seem almost numbed by even the most intense, extreme situations. This film is disturbing, thought-provoking and based on a real-life incident. WARNING: SOME SCENES IN THIS FILM MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME VIEWERS."
