        "During the Civil War a mysterious nomad (Clint Eastwood) enters macabre business partnership with a Mexican gunman (Eli Wallach), a man with a price on his head. Eastwood turns him in to the authorities, collects the reward money, and at the last minute, rescues him so that they can begin the whole process again. They make quite a good living doing this until they form an uneasy alliance with a sadistic criminal (Lee Van Cleef), and this time, the stakes are much higher. This film is the third and arguably the best of Sergio Leone's westerns set during the Civil War. With a memorable score by Ennio Morricone and excellent cast, this is the quintessential \"Spaghetti Western\"."
