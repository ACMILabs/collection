        "The War: third part of the Sanskrit epic that is the origin of a thousand beliefs, legends, reflections and characters, still present and recognisable in contemporary culture. This is the final battle where in effect, the Pandavas and the Kauravas exterminate each other, and most of humanity while they're about it. Yudhisthira arrives at the gate of Paradise, but they won't let his dog in, given which he won't enter either - all the more so on realising that, inexplicably, all the Kauravas are in Paradise and all the Pandavas in hell. We thus end on a note of absolute inexplicability of the divine powers - what was the cosmic war for? Adapted from the play by Jean-Claude Carriere. Adapted from the play by Jean-Claude Carriere."
