        "This warm romantic comedy stars Michelle Pfeiffer as Frankie, a cynical waitress who is wooed by the gentle Johnny (Al Pacino), a recently released pretty criminal who takes a job as a chef in the restaurant in which Frankie works. Set around the working class neighbourhoods of New York City, the film is an engaging comedy about the fears and difficulties involved in learning to trust another person. Terrence McNally wrote the script which is based on his acclaimed play, \"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune\". One of the great joys of this film are the uniformly excellent performances. The cast includes Kate Nelligan as Frankie's fellow waitress; Nathan Lane as her generous spirited gay flat-mate; and the under-rated Hector Helizondo as Nick, the owner of the Greek restaurant in which Frankie and Johnny work."
