        "Rowan Atkinson knows his rubber face and gangly limbs are his tools of trade. The exaggerated gestures, tortured twitch of an eyebrow or deadpan expression guaranteed the phenomenal success of \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\", \"Black Adder\" and \"Mr. Bean\". There is however an art to being funny, and as mime artist Kevin Bartholomew (dressed in a lime green skin-tight body suit) the amazing rubber-faced one shows us, along with fellow comedy masters including John Cleese and Peter Sellers, that there is comedy potential in every part of the human anatomy."
