        "It is Paris, 1942, under the German Occupation, and successful Jewish theatrical director, Lucas Steiner, is forced into hiding. He entrusts the running of the theatre to his wife Marion, who must contend with Daxiat, a pro-Nazi critic. Masterful direction by Truffaut captures the climate of the occupation."
