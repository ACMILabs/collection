        "This is the first of three films that present a survey of the Murray Basin - a basin that includes part of South Australia, northern Victoria, and most of New South Wales, and extends some 400 miles into Queensland - one-seventh of the whole continent. The survey covers both a description of the country and its industries. The film follows the river from its source in the western slopes of the Australian Alps, through the high-timbered country, past the river flats, and on to the Hume Reservoir. The type of country, towns and industries as far as the Rutherglen-Wangaratta region are covered. Commentary by Roger Climpson."
