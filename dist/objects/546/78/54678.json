        "Child molestation is a serious problem. This film will help the child to understand what to do when meeting potentially dangerous strangers. Examples include adult seeking personal information, driver asking child to help him find the way, stranger offering food or gifts, and a false repairman trying to gain entry into the home. The film does not frighten children or encourage a distrustful attitude toward all strangers. However, the point is made that there are some people who would do them harm and who might be difficult to recognize because they look and sound \"nice\". Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
