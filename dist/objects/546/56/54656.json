        "Clouds of early morning mist roll back revealing dew laden plants. A stream ripples down the mountain, bubbling around stones and cascading down the slope. It widens and flows gently on until it reaches the unpredictable sea. Accompanied by water sounds and appropriate background music. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
