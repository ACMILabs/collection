        "Dawn, an Afro-American aged around eight, and her two friends have gone to play in the park.

However on her way home, Dawn collides with a woman running to catch a bus and in the confusion the woman drops a five-dollar bill. The woman boards her bus before Dawn can return the money. Dawn attempts to catch up with the bus but fails and consequently she arrives home late for dinner with money that doesn't belong to her. Before she can explain, her mother begins to scold her - \"Why are you late?\" Helps children see that conflicting feelings are both common and normal. Set in the tenament area of Chicago. Part of the \"How does it make you feel?\" series. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
