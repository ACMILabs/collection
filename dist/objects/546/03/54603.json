        "In this final film of a three-part series, the Murray River is followed to the more northern and drier area where the annual rainfall ranges from ten to eighteen inches. This area is known as the Mallee and is a region of dry, red soil and stunted growth. Cleared and irrigated it is an area of productive farmlands and well-kept orchards, with its eastern section producing much of Victoria's wheat. The irrigation upon which much of this district depends is indicated and the main agricultural pursuits illustrated. These include the citrus and vine-growin areas of Robinvale, Mildura, Merbein and Red Cliffs. The film then follows the river into South Australia and illustrates the industries and activities of the people who depend upon the waters of the river for their livelihood. Little water from the Murray enters the sea. In summer it irrigates the land; in winter it fills the storages. The film concludes with scenes at the river's mouth at Lake Alexandrina. Commentary by Roger Climpson."
