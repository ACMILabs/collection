        "This second film of a three-part series continues the description of the country and industries along the Murray, from Yarrawonga to the Swan Hill-Moira region. Diagrammatic maps indicate the extent of the irrigation systems on both sides of the river and show how these irrigation systems are operated and conrolled. The industries shown include wool, fruit and rice growing, dairying, and the raising of fat lambs; together with associated processing industries in the areas of Yarrawonga, Shepparton, Rochester, Echuca, Kerang and Swan Hill. Commentary by Roger Climpson."
