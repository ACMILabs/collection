        "Episode of Series \"Biology program. Unit 4. Physiology\". A brief resume of muscle histology, and sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. Emphasis shifts to chemical mechanism. The essential contractile element is actomyosin: ATP and calcium ions are also shown to be necessary. Experiments and simple models are used as illustrations. Suitable for upper secondary level."
