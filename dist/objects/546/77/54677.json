        "A collection of five films, each presenting a mathematical idea. The film was part of the exhibition 'Mathematica: a world of numbers and beyond'. The two minute vignettes use a combination of animation, live action and photographic techniques to present five mathematic principles. They are: ERATOSTHENES; TOPOLOGY: JORDAN'S CURVE THEORY; SYMMETRY; SOMETHING ABOUT FUNCTIONS; 2N: A STORY ABOUT THE POWER OF NUMBER. Drawings by Glen Fleck, music by Elmer Bernstein."
