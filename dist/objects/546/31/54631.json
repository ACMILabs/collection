        "Aid given to cerebral palsied children. Private individuals seeing the need established Spastic centres. Basic school syllabuses are slightly modified to suit the physical and mental ability of each child. Special equipment compensates for handicaps. Difficulty in mixing with others can be overcome with specialised aid in the play centres. Teaching them to walk, balance and control movements, and teaching the deaf to speak require highly specialised therapy."
