        "In this film, a broad spectrum of well-known contemporary Melbourne artists comment on their own work, their relationships with other artists, and the nature of Australian art. Focuses on the relationship between art and the environment, contrasting urban with the rural landscape, and realism with modernism and conceptualism. Shows the art of sculpture blending into the city landscape and includes many visual images of Melbourne city and suburbs such as the newly opened Tullamarine Airport, National Gallery of Victoria, the freeways and overpasses and high-rise development constructed during the sixties, local art galleries and museums as well as outer Melbourne bush and bayside scenes. Artists include: Bruce Pollard, John Brack, Kevin Gronow, Alun Leach-Jones, Clifford Last, Ruth McNicoll, Lenton Parr, Jan Senbergs, Guy Stuart, Trevor Kretchmar, Andrew Sibley, Dennis Spiteri, Fred Williams and others. Contains some B&W footage."
