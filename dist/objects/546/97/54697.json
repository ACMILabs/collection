        "This film illustrates the development of the chick embryo, through all stages from germinal disc to hatching, employing animated diagrams and cine-micrography of the living embryo. Normal-speed and time-lapse photographic sequences, and animated diagrams, sometimes superimposed on microscopic views of the embryo, are used to clarify growth processes.
