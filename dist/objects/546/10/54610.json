        "Shows a successful teaching experiment in primary schools in which classes are grouped vertically to include mixed ages, brothers and sisters. Explains how best children can be grouped and taught together so that they all enjoy school, learn effectively and develop their potential ability. Furthermore, it is claimed in the film that a more satisfactory social situation is created where social devlopment is fostered to a greater degree than in single-age groups."
