        "Economically underprivileged children must often be provided with motives for learning. Because the value system of these children may differ from that of the economically satisfied child, behaviour may need to be reinforced with rewards such as sweets, money, clothes, or other material objects. This principle of reinforcement is based on the operant conditioning theory and involves the application of immediate rewards to shape gradually more difficult tasks."
