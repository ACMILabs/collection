        "Episode of Series \"One Mans China\". Covers the theme of medicine in China. Shows traditional medicine, including acupuncture and herbalism. Since the Cultural Revolution many remarkable new applications for the ancient art of acupuncture have been discovered, and some of these are shown. We also see 'barefoot doctors', trained in simple medicine, working in minor illnesses in small villages. With the help of modern techniques being developed, alongside ancient and traditional medicine, the Chinese are among the healthiest people in the world today."
