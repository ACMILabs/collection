        "The myths that perpetuate prejudice against black people in society and the subtle ways that hate is learned are explored in this film. The social and economical differences that do exist between blacks and whites are caused by historical identities in education and economic opportunity - and are in some cases even perpetuated by laws. The riots that erupted in the cities throughout the United States forced basic issues of injustice to the surface for all Americans to face. There are no easy ways to solve the problems caused by prejudice, but examples are given of areas in which government, business, and black and white people are working together to wipe out the hatred and misunderstanding between the races. This film acquaints the viewer with the subtle and sometimes unconscious manifestation of prejudice as well as the more obvious. It will also encourage the viewer to look more closely at their own attitudes. Suitable for secondary years 7-12."
