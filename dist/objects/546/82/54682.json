        "This film shows the wide range of rules of society, from everyday rules to the complex rules of law. Gives two examples: two children decide whether or not to keep a stray dog in an apartment prohibiting animals; and a boy involved in a playground row is torn between the school rule against fighting and his father's order to defend himself. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
