        "Episode of Series \"The Storymakers\". Storymakers is a series which highlights different aspects of the process of creating a book and is designed to develop children's awareness of how books are conceived and created, and to encourage a love of books and reading. In this video, school student, Jonathen Appleton, visits author Colin Thiele to discuss the craft of writing. This program features some scenes from his novels including the classic \"Storm Boy\", \"The Sun on the Stubble\" and the newly published \"Jodie's Journey\"."
