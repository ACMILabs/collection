        "Johnno is 10 years of age, deaf and always in strife. He lives in a small fishing town and he has an affinity with the sea that he shares with Tony, an Italian fisherman, whom the townsfolk also ridicule. Johnno's best friend is his sister, Julie, who is going away to boarding school in the city. When Johnno discovers this news he is devastated and runs away to his secret place - a deserted island. Johnno's running away causes much havoc in the small community and the experience helps him realise that he must learn to live with his deafness and trust those who love him."
