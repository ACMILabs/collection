        "AIDS is the most publicised and least understood disease in Australia. This video may help to clear up some of the confusion as the discoverer of the AIDS virus, Professor Luc Montaginier, joins Australia's most experienced AIDS specialists and community leaders to confront the ethical and social dilemmas created by the disease. Geoffrey Robertson's Hypothetical on AIDS was filmed on August 12, 1986."
