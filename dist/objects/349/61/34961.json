        "The ancient art of Tai Chi has been practised for hundreds of years and is a valuable form of self expression which helps the mind and body to relax. Tai Chi has become increasingly popular in the often stressful framework of twentieth century living. It aims to develop a strong co-ordinated body which is able to function in a relaxed, calm manner at all times. This video methodically guides us through each graceful movement, clearly emphasising the careful attention which must be given to posture. Master Erle Montaigue, one of the foremost authorities on the original Yang style of Tai Chi, demonstrates and discusses the movements with the viewer and reaffirms its healing powers which contribute to that special sense of well-being."
