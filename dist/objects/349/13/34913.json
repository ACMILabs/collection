        "Danny rescues an emu's egg from a marauding goanna. His ingenuity and tenacity in managing to incubate and finally hatch the egg in the face of opposition win him respect and admiration. It's a heart-warming, contemporary story with likeable characters who offer a glimpse of life in a country town. Award-winning drama based on a true story by Jim Badger."
