        "Animated oriental fairy tale. A drought stricken village incurs further suffering when it is attacked by bandits. However, their luck changes when they find a pot of gold. The gold is used to buy some caged birds which, when set free, return to the village with seeds, from which grow a magic orchard. The orchard brings prosperity to the village, and its magic protects them from the bandits. (No narration or dialogue.)"
