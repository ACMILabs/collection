        "This program aims to help pre-adolescents recognise and deal with stress which, according to experts, is the underlying cause of 75% of all illness and disease among children. The video follows the stories of two children, both gymnasts in the school team trying to cope with the expectations and pressures of parents. One child is pushed to perform to the exclusion of all else, and the other child has conflicting demands placed on her."
