        "Upon the cruise ship \"Mara\" - bound for Hong Kong out of San Francisco - an oddly assorted group of travellers dine together at the Captain's table. Here the basis of a developing web of relationships is laid and made all the more intimate and public by the inevitably close world a sea voyage creates. Starring Nigel Havers and Judy Parfitt Based on the original by Noel Coward. Rated: PG"
