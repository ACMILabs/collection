        "A fascinating program that looks at the painting of Australian artist, Arthur Boyd. For the purposes of this peacefully but not passively photographed documentary, Arthur Boyd completed two different paintings of the same scene, an interior and exterior interpretation of bathers and water-skiers who regularly churn up the tranquillity outside his door, explaining as he works, his inspiration and intention."
