        "Custody follows an estranged couple, Christine and Andrew Byrne, down the twisting and highly emotional path that eventually leads to a fully contested case in the Family Court. Along the way it shows the points of view of both parents, and the somewhat different view taken by the lawyers and the Court Counsellors who become involved. Above all, it dramatically shows what it is like to go through the Family Court. The members of the Byrne family are actors. The legal aid representative, the solicitors, the barristers and members of the judiciary all play themselves."
