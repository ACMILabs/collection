        "This animated tale tells a raunchy, rocky, hilarious story of the legendary Ironbark Bill and the Champion Buckjumper, a high-spirited horse who bounces so high in his bucking that rider and horse end up in the clouds. The problem, then, is how to get down. It is based on Australian writer, Dal Stivens' \"Ironbark Bill\" tall tales."
