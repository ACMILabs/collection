        "On Christmas Eve a young boy looks into the gleaming windows where tables are laden with turkey, ducks, geese and cherry pie. Then he peers in a window lit only by candle-light. He sees a grey-haired lady sitting in front of a bare table crying so he offers to share his meagre Christmas dinner with her. The happiest Christmas was shared by candle light."
