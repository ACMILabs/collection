        "MARILYN MONROE: BEYOND THE LEGEND is a documentary tribute to the legendary actress. Numerous film clips show her earliest appearances in DANGEROUS YEARS and ALL ABOUT EVE, and her triumphant performances in BUS STOP and THE MISFITS. The film also features a wealth of rare archival and newsreel footage, as well as in depth interviews with colleagues and friends of the inimitable actress such as Robert Mitchum, Celeste Holm, Shelley Winters, Susan Strasberg, Don Murray, Sheree North, John Springer, and director, Josh Logan. Narrated by Richard Widmark."
