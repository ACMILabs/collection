Using scenes of the railway today, authentic archival footage from Australian and Japanese sources, the drawings of Sir Edward Dunlop, and present day interviews, the film covers the route the railway took up the Kwai Noi Valley, between Rangoon and Bangkok. 116,000 Australians, British and Dutch lost their lives building the railway."
