        "An award-winning adaptation of the book by Michael Morpurgo, this is the story of two London boys evacuated to the British countryside during World War 11. Unaccustomed to the countryside, one boy falls into a fast flowing stream and is rescued by a stranded German pilot. Although the Germans are the enemy one has saved David's life, so the boys, in turn, help the pilot and his wounded companion."
