        "Peter, Margaret and Wayne discover a Roman boat in a cave that contains the manuscript of young Pompey. The discovery changes the tiny little town of Gamma into a brash, hyped-up tourist centre. The children also find that their lives change too - and they don't like what is happening. The manuscript found in the boat reveals that the boat is cursed and, until the boat is destroyed it will continue to curse anyone who comes into contact with it. The children decide that in order to save Gamma they must finally carry out the drastic act of destroying the boat."
