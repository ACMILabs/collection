        "In this humorous claymation dramatisation of Banjo Patterson's famous poem, all of the characters, with the exception of the ill-fated sheep thief, are transformed into animals. Shot on a set designed to replicate Russell Drysdale's Outback paintings, the film brings to life and explains the terminology of the lyrics."
