        "This animated film, featuring puppets, provides children with information to enable them to make their own decisions about smoking, drinking and drugs. The characters explain how the body becomes dependent on tobacco, alcohol and other drugs and how people's health and lives are affected. It provides children with reasons to resist the external pressures to take up these habits."
