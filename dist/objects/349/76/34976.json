        "The Gillies Team takes on numerous national treasures (including Bob Hawke, Andrew Peacock, Wran the Man and Don Chipp) and even the odd megabuck personality such as Rupert Murdoch in this new compilation video selected from the hilarious Gillies Report series. Highlights include Bob Hawke as the Invisible Man: the Maralinga Commission (or Wise After the Event) re-enacted in the form of a cabaret, with Mr. Justice McLelland chairing the proceedings in sparkling silver lurex; and John Clarke - posing as a sports announcer - introduces us to the magnificent game of Farnarkeling. Featuring: Max Gillies, John Clarke, Patricia Cooke, Tracey Harvey, Don Watson, Geoff Kelso, Wendy Harmer & Phillip Scott. Rated: PG"
