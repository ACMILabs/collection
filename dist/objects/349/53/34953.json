        "Based on Alexander Solzhenitzyn's Nobel Prize Lecture - one of the greatest statements of the 20th Century, skilfully interpreted by Tom Courtenay (Best Actor of the Year 1980). Unable to leave the Soviet Union, Solzhenitzyn wrote a speech which was never delivered but was later published in many languages. The prison camp sequences were shot in Swedish-Lapland, and works of art and historic newsreel footage dramatise the issues. The music is by Dimitri Shostakovich."
