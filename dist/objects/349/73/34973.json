        "Episode of Series \"Star Quality : The Stories of Noel Coward\". Lady Cynthia is a woman of wealth and position, but she is touched and amazed at the love and devotion Mr. and Mrs. Edgehill feel for one another. What is it that makes this ordinary couple so content with their life - even on a remote and desolate South Sea island. Starring Judi Dench and Ian Holm and adapted from a story by Noel Coward."
