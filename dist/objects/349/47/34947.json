        "This video outlines the migrations which have made us what we are - starting with the arrival of the ancestors of the Aborigines, approximately 40,000 years ago. The landing on the 26th January, 1788, of the officers, marines and convicts of the First Fleet, started successive waves of mostly European migration whose cultures enriched our nation."
