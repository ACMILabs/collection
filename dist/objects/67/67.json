    ], 
    "description": [
        "In the 'Unknown Series', practical hands work with a sense of urgency to construct curious objects out of everyday things. This is a woman at work - not play. She is alone, assuming different persona, constructing objects that might appear to have no function but somehow reflect a state of mind and heart. Baldino has written, 'Americans will sell you anything, even if they do not know what it is. So, I bought used 'things.' This series uses 30 of these objects in separate scenarios. I film a process that takes place in less than 60 seconds. This brief footage is an excerpt, which is actually the completed work. What happens before and after is unknown. Each piece is shot with different personas, and filmed in the first and final take'."
