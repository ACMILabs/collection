        "A personal account created by a participant in the ACMI Digital Storytelling Workshop \"Against the Grain\" in association with Partners in Grain (PING). Not just a farmer's wife, Jenny Grigg, mother of four and business partner in all ways with her husband on their Mallee sheep and grain farm discovered a group of women who were to change Jenny's life forever. This story is dedicated to that network of women (PinG) who help and support other farming women in grains by providing inspiration and encouragement and a feeling of self-worth."
