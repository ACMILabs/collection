        "A personal account created by a participant in the ACMI Digital Storytelling Workshop \"Against the Grain\" in association with Partners in Grain (PING). Education was always a focus in Nickie Berrisford's life. In this story Nickie tells of her upbringing, her marriage to a Horsham farmer, rural life and her four children. She openly speaks of her role as an educator, wife, and mother, and of her fourth child Laura who was born with Down Syndrome. Nickie has also been a mentor - encouraging, challenging and supporting the other women in the grain industry. This is her tribute to family, friends and bonds that have been formed, hopefully never to be broken."
