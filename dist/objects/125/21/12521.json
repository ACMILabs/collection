        "A personal account created by a participant in the ACMI Digital Storytelling Workshop \"Against the Grain\" in association with Partners in Grain (PING). \"All change please. That's what they say when the train is at the last station.\" Diana Anderson began her journey around 23 years ago when she moved on to her husband's family farm in north-west Victoria. Worked on for generations, Diana and Choco improved and changed the farming business, raising their two boys and enjoying the life for almost 23 years. That is until they were confronted with the distressing news the family partnership was to be sold. For Diana this was the end of one journey and the start of another - a new beginning."
