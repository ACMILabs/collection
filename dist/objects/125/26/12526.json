        "A personal account created by a participant in the ACMI Digital Storytelling Workshop \"Against the Grain\" in association with Partners in Grain (PING). Penny Hendy describes her upbringing, her marriage as a \"townie\" to a \"farmer\" and her involvement with some 23 rural community organisations. As the women in her family before, Penny recognises the need to be resourceful, creative and flexible in response to change. Penny's contribution to, and  involvement with the Women in Grains has played a major role in her own life as well as the women she has mentored. Penny currently holds several high positions on various boards and continues to be a force within the rural community."
