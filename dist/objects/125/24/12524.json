Almost 60 years old, Maureen Barry reminisces about her life, especially the last 35 years, of living on the land with the man she loves. From her youthful dreams as a young rural bride to the often harsh realiities of farm life in the sometimes unforgiving landscape of the Mallee. This story is dedicated to her husband, Brian."
