    "description": [
        "Narrated to a background of archival home movie images juxtaposed with contemporary images of Lake Mokoan and the surrounding landscape, local resident Linton Briggs gives his account of the changes which have taken place since the decommissioning of the Lake. He speaks of a magic place, Winton Swamp, where wildlife was in abundance, where a wet-land ecosystem of bird-life, Murray cod, Red-gums, and every variety of duck imaginable used to exist and of his sadness and apprehension the changing of the lake may make to the ecological balance of Lake Mokoan. Created as part of the \"Bute Utes the Movie\" project in association with Regional Arts Victoria."
