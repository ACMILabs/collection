Merna Curnow, raised on a farm, always wanted to be a teacher. She never considered herself as a farmer, not even when she married a third generation farmer of the Curnow family. Teacher, mother and supportive wife until one day she suffered an identity crisis when helping her husband out on the farm. That day became a turning point in Merna's life."
