    "description": [
        "Using photographic images, this story of the grass trees growing on the ranges outside Wangaratta becomes a poetic meditation on how a person's ideas on place can change with understanding and compassion. European insensitivity and ignorance of the past has been replaced with political awareness and correctness, a sense of the land and the environment and a desire for reconciliation with those who belonged to the land before the invasion of the white man.  A sensitive and thought-provoking piece. Made as part of Regional Arts Victoria's Bute Utes - the Movie program."
