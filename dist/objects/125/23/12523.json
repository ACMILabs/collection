        "This is Maureen Barry's story of her life as a farmer, wife, mother and rural nurse in the dusty bowl of the Mallee in outback Victoria. She tells of the hardships and isolation, but also of the gradual blossoming of the land as both she and her husband keep pace with technology, embracing sustainable farming practices so as to leave the land in a better state for those who follow. This story is part of a project funded by VicHealth and partnership with the women's rural network, Partners in Grain."
