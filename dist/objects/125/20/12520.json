        "A personal account created by a participant in the ACMI Digital Storytelling Workshop \"Against the Grain\" in association with Partners in Grain (PING). Althea Hunt describes her life as a farmer's wife from leaving her beloved family in Queensland to joining her husband and running their independent cereal farm in the Millewa district of Victoria. She talks of the enormous changes - the hard work and dealing with the often unrelenting climate of drought and cyclones whilst also raising three young children and maintaining the family unit. For Althea however, it has been exciting and rewarding to see how far their farm has come over the 30 year journey since she left Queensland."
