        "Based on Michael Ondaatje's Booker prize-winning novel, \"The English Patient\" is a sumptuous romance set during the second world war in the deserts of North Africa and the rolling hills of Tuscany. Hana (Juliette Binoche), a shell-shocked Canadian nurse decides to stay in an abandoned villa to nurse a mysterious English patient (Ralph Fiennes) who is burned beyond recognition and doesn't remember his name. Gradually we learn the truth of his identity and of his doomed love affair with Katherine Mansfield (Kristen Scott Thomas). (Winner of 9 Oscars at the 1996 Academy Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress (Juliette Binoche) and Best Cinematography for Australian John Seale)."
