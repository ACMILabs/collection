But the affair comes to a sudden and tragic end when Henrik is killed in an accident. Several years pass and Mari is now a prima ballerina, but still devastated and heartbroken by the loss. Bitter and without emotion she meets a young journalist, David) who has found the diary she wrote while Henrik was alive. The diary reawakens long dormant feelings and she gradually accepts David's company and sets out to find a new happiness. This is Bergman's first mature film and is a peotic evocation of the burden of memory and loss. In Swedish with English subtitles."
