        "An unnamed child, present only by an adult voice-over recounts the life of his uncle. How he survives his wife's death, his dog's death, and eventually his own inevitable end. The childlike innocence of the reflection is juxtaposed by the adult narration. Narrated by William McInnes and featuring John Flaus as the Uncle. The story is portrayed through animated clay figures. This film forms part of the autobiographical trilogy that includes \"Uncle\", \"Brother\" and \"Cousin\"."
