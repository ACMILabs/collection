        "Samantha Cain (Geena Davis) is a school teacher who for the past 8 years has suffered amnesia. Haunted by bizarre flashbacks, she hires private detective Mitch (Samuel L. Jackson), to discover her true identity. They discover that Samantha is actually a lethal government assassin, presumed dead and that's the way the authorities would like to keep it. Samantha is now hunted by her past and a string of government agents who have placed a contract on her life and kidnapped her daughter."
