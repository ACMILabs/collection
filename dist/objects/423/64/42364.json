        "Sunshine and bird calls herald the start of a new day. All is initially quiet as 3 sleepy occupants, one armed with a tuba, begin the day. Most of the action in this film takes place on a vacant block, as mysterious performers and exhibitionists appear before the bewildered three, bringing with them an explosion of music and sound. Cast includes William Freu, Martha Scott and Nickey Ribush."
