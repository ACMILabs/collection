        "A passionate, probing and honest look at a marriage, its disintegration and the relationship that follows. Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson are remarkable throughout this intimate and often painful portrait which Bergamn originally made as 6 50 minute episodes for television and subsequently edited into a full-length feature. Bergman examines the trauma of a beleagured marriage largely in close-up creating an exhaustive study of the doubt, despair, confusion and loneliness experienced by Marianne on discovering her husband's infidelity with a younger woman. Swedish language with English subtitles."
