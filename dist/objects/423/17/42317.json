        "Filmmaker Trevor Graham documented the only film record of the Mabo proceedings in 1989 in his film \"Land Bilong islanders\" and in the process established a friendship with Eddie Koiki Mabo. This film documents the extraordinary life of a man so passionate about his family and home that he fought an entire nation and its legal system. Sadly, he died five months before the High Court upheld his claim for \"Native Title\". However he cemented a place in Australia's history. This documentary won an AFI award in 1997."
