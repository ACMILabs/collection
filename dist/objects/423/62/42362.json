        "A story of a marine commando exercise; a combined operation of ships, planes, frogmen and commandos. A coastal town with the code name \"Snake's Eye\" is the objective. Frogmen-parachutists drop from the sky and set to work under the sea; waves of strike aircraft are catapulted into action from a carrier; mass troops are landed by naval helicopters and assault landing craft; commandos are seen taking part in a breathtaking cliff-assault. The action demonstrates the astonishing versatility of the men of the Royal Marines as they go into combat on land, at sea and in the air."
