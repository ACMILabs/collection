        "How far would an ordinary father go to spend time with his children? Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is no ordinary father, so when he learns his ex-wife (Sally Field) needs a housekeeper, he applies for the job. With the perfect wig, a little makeup and a dress for all occasions, he becomes Mrs. Doubtfire, a devoted British housekeeper who is hired on the spot. Outrageous, hilarious and often touching, Robin Williams makes this box-office hit a film to be watched again and again."
