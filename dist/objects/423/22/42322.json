        "The second film in his trilogy on faith, \"Winter light\" springs from Bergman's desire to define Man's relation to God - if He exists. A village pastor, unloved and empty of faith, reveals his bitter failure to offer spiritual consolation to his flock. Sombre and poignant, the film sketches a world of half-empty churches - but a world not entirely without hope in God's universe. The story brings together four personalities in a shared quest for siritual reassurance. A susceptible and disillusioned fisherman (Max von Sydow) is urged by his wife (Gunnel Lindboim) to seek solace from his local priest (Gunnar Bjornstrand). However the priest is struggling to regain his own belief - a tragic and intimately depicted conflict, in which he is eventually supported by the cynical resilience of the local schoolmistress (Ingrid Thulin). Swedish language with English subtitles."
