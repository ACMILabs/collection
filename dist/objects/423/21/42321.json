        "Wild Strawberries is justifiably considered a classic Ingmar Bergman film. Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) is 78 and about to be honoured by the University of Lund for his services to medicine. He decides to drive to Lund with his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin). The film follows the events of the day as he remembers scenes from the past, has bouts of troubling dreams, and meets up with a group of young travellers. Victor Sjostrom is marvelous as the rigid professor who is touched by the warmth of the people who he encounters on this pivotal day. This edition comes with Ingmar Bergman's screenplay, which gives a fascinating insight into Bergman's narrative skills, and includes a run-down of the cutting continuity for those interested in the techniques of film-making. In Swedish with English subtitles."
