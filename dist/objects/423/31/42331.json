        "An old country house in Venice is inhabited by four women: Aunt Martha (Eleonora Giorgi), a widowed one-time opera singer; Anna, her adopted niece (Mariangela Melato); Claudia, a school teacher and Caterina, an elderly servant. One weekend they receive a visit from Nicky (Erland Josephson), Aunt Martha's brother who lived there as a child, and his friend Picchio. A collision of characters takes place with frailty, immaturity and rejection all surfacing at once. The death of Aunt Martha provides the catalyst for each individual to re-evaluate themselves and consequently provide the incentive to forget the past and start a new life. In Italian with English sub-titles."
