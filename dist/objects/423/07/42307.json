        "Ingmar Bergman's \"Seventh seal\" deserves its reputation as a benchmark in the lexicon of modern cinema. With striking imagery, captivating characters and deep philosophical arguments Bergman weaves a rich tapestry as only a master can. Set in the middle ages in the midst of the plague, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) is a knight returning from the crusades. When Death (Bengt Ekerot) appears before him he suggests a game of chess to forestall his fate. He travels to his home with an assortment of characters, including his atheist squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) and a troupe of travelling players. Despite it's metaphysical content \"The Seventh Seal\" also includes a heavy dose of Scandinavian humour. In Swedish with english subtitles."
