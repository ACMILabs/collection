        "Dedicated to the director's mother who lost her son at sea, Penny Fowler-Smith uses a family member (possibly her mother), as voice over in this reflection on the death of a child. The opening sequence shows a woman slicing oranges, a painful metaphor for the miscarriage she is describing. The sorrow manages to pass as she gives birth to three further children; 2 girls and a boy. \"At sea\" refers to the tragic journey made to Australia by the director's mother when she lost her only son. Dedicated to her mother and son, Andrew and featuring the voice of Bremer Fowler-Smith."
