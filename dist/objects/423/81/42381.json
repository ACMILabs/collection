        "Molly has moved to California with her Russian Jewish parents who are proud of their heritage and culture. Molly is too young to appreciate her background and wants to be 'normal' like the other kids at school. She attends a friend's birthday party but has to forgoe the cake because it's Passover. Her friends find her clothes and hand-made present \"funny\". Soon it is Molly's birthday and her parents invent a way of preserving their heritage as well as embracing their new one. Designed for younger children, \"Make a wish Molly\" has something to offer everyone."
