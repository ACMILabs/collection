        "When Harry (Lars Ekborg) meets Monika (Harriet Andersson) in a cafe they soon fall in love. Monika leaves home after an argument with her father and the young lovers run away on Harry's father's boat. They spend a carefree summer on the boat until Monika discovers she is pregnant and they are forced to return to Stockholm. As a married couple struggling to make a living Harry and Monika soon find their love disintegrating. Once again, Ingmar Bergman totally engrosses us in this sensitive study of young love, eliciting great performances from Lars Ekborg as the ernest Harry and Harriet Andersson as the wild and willful Monika. In Swedish with English subtitles."
