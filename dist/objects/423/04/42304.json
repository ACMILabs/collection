        "Episode of Series \"Introducing Chemistry\". Three basic types of atomic bonding are clearly and simply illustrated: covalent bonding in which there is an equal sharing of electrons by two or more atoms; polar covalent bonding in which one atom has a greater share than the others; and ionic bonding in which one atom seems to take nearly full control of the electrons from the other atom or radical."
