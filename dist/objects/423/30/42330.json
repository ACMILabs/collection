        "Alfredo Alfredo is a side-splitting comedy about the trials and tribulations of marriage. Alfredo Sbisa (Dustin Hoffman) is a shy young bank clerk who stumbles into a relationship with the girl of his dreams, Maria Rosa. His dreams take on a surreal tone as he is drawn deeper into a relationship with her. Who is this infathomable woman he has married? Alfredo starts to dream of an escape. Pietro Germi cleverly uses Hoffman's gift for physical comedy, minimising his dialogue (which is dubbed by Ferruccio Amendola). In Italian with english subtitles."
