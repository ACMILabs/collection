        "This hair-raiser is a classic Christopher Lee - Peter Cushing chiller guaranteed to give you goosebumps. It is a real blast of science fiction horror which has as its setting the Trans-Siberian Express. Set in 1906, Lee (an explorer) is returning from China with a mysterious crate containing what he believes are the remains of an apelike creature. This missing link is inhabited by an alien force which can assimilate all the knowledge from people simply by staring at them. The process boils their brains, kills the victims instantly, and makes their eyes bleed and turn white. Late the life force takes over the hapless passengers who appear normal, but are actually zombies possessed by the monsters personality. Lee and Cushing team up to defeat the creature. They saw the tops off the victims heads for brain inspections, only to be horrified by their inexplicable discoveries. The dead passengers, now an army of zombies, march through the train toward the petrified survivors."
