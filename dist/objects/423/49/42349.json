        "An impassioned battle between the conscience and corruption set in inner-city Newtown, once the boxing centre of Sydney, domain of the working class immigrants and now ripe for property development and speculation. For Alexander Polonski, owner of the districts most celebrated boxing gym, this means trouble. His gym is prime real estate and many factions are coveting it. As the story moves towards a violent climax, everyone must decide what they want, how they might get it, and just where they would draw the line in the quest for satisfaction. An innovative Australian feature film."
