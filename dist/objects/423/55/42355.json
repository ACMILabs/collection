        "The Universal Appliance Co. factory, 1954: Charles Dibley, an inventor, finally gets a chance to mass produce his latest creation, the space age kitchen appliance - the egg beater. Everyone is gathered to witness the great event. The workers have clocked on and are waiting expectantly. As the invention forms the production line swings into life. A cacophony of haphazard factory sounds urges the watchers to break into rythmic dance. Our hero imagines the bosses wife in a romantic folly and suddenly advertising and romance become distractions... A wondrous soundscape and visual feast this short film will delight and entertain."
