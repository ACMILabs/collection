        "12 year old Nello lives with his grandfather near Antwerp. They manage to eke a living by delivering milk into the city. Nello dreams of becoming a famous artist like Ruebens and is able to satisfy his interest by befriending a painter. One day while returning from a delivery Nello discovers a dog, left for dead in the bushes. They take him home and restore his health. The owner soon turns up to reclaim his dog, fortunately he is unsuccessful. This is only the start to Nello's troubles as his grandfather dies, leaving Nello without enough money to look after himself, let alone the dog. A touching story that will appeal to the whole family. Starring David Ladd, Donald Crisp and Theodore Bikel. Based on the novel by Ouida."
