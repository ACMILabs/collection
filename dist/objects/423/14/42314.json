        "A serial killer is murdering people according to a deranged righteous rationale, punishing people for their indulgence in the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman is Detective Somerset, a police officer who has seen too much crime and has witnessed for too long the savagery of a decaying urban world. Brad Pitt is young Detective Mills, eager to prove his abilities and excited to have landed a fascinating if gruesome case. \"Seven\" is a film that portrays an almost misanthropic contempt for the contemporary world; a world in which spirituality is infused with vengeance and where relationships are tainted by exploitation. The nameless city is always dark and wet, and begins to resemble a vision of Hell. \"Seven\" includes stunning photography, electrifying editing and a meticulous soundtrack. The film confronts the viewer with the hateful extremeties of evil. It remains unforgettable because it also suggests that evil is not the prerogative of monsters. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow and a diabolically good Kevin Spacey. Do not miss the opening credit sequence."
