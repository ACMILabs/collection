        "She afflicts me! She comes to me at night and torments me! She's a witch! In the Puritan village of Salem Massachusetts in 1692, these words provoked fear and terror in the hearts of the townspeople. Behind these accusations lie the covenance of a neighbours land and a girl who will stop at nothing to capture the heart of a married man. This screenplay is penned by Arthur Miller and based on his play of the same name. He skillfully recreates a real-life story, combining intrigue, romance and suspense of the infamous Salem Witch Trials. Cast includes Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Paul Scofield, Joan Allen, Bruce Davidson, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones. A study guide accompanies this tape."
