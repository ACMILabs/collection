        "Abuse in relationships transcends all cultures and is influenced by the media and notions of gender. \"Heart on a chain\" explores the two significant ways in which relationships may be abuse, recreating a physically abusive relationship and an emotionally violent one. The film is particularly instructive in its definition of what constitutes \"abuse\". Aimed primarily at young males this documentary offers an insight into why and how relationships become abusive."
