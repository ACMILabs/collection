        "In 1985, Angelo Tsakos, a young Greek-Australian boy from the depressed western suburbs of Sydney was shot dead while driving a stolen car, by a probationary police constable. He was only sixteen. At the inquiry into the incident, three differing versions of the event were described. This film reconstructs these versions and finds questions still unanswered. His family continue in their efforts to get a full enquiry into the killing of Angelo Tsakos."
