        "Emmet Otter and his mother Alice both enter a talent contest in an effort to win $50 and buy each other the 'best' Christmas present. Entering involve sacrifices, pawning their departed father's tool kit and drilling a hole in Alice's washboard to make a musical instrument. Both Alice and Emmet perform well but not good enough to beat the out of town contestants,'The Riverbottom Nightmares'. Initially it seems that their efforts have been futile but when they combine their talents they discover that they have the best Christmas ever. Based on the book by Russell and Lillian Hoban."
