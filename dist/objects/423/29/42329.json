        "A family travels through the Italian country side to visit their sick grandfather. On the journey two young children hear their father recount the story of their heritage. Spanning two centuries and beginning during the Napoleonic invasion of Italy, it centres around gold and its power to corrupt. A young soldier, Jean, left guarding the regiment's chest of gold has it stolen while he is making love to a peasant girl, Elisabetta. The soldier is charged and will be put to death if the gold isn't recovered. The thief, Elisabetta's brother, will not own up and shame his family, the soldier is killed. This is the beginning of the family's troubles, Elisabetta dies during childbirth and generations after are effected by the curse. Their surname Benedetti, meaning blessed, becomes known as \"Maledetti\", cursed. The effect through the generations is emphasised by actors playing dual roles. Starring Claudio Bigali, Galatea Ranzi, Michael Vartan and Lino Capolicchio."
