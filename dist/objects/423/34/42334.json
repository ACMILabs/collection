        "Bergman's \"Through a glass darkly\" centres on the lives of four characters. Karen (Harriet Andersson) suffers from schizophrenia and has just returned from hospital. She lives on a remote island in the Baltic with her husband Martin (Max Von Sydow) and brother Minus (Lars Passgard). David (Gunnar Bjornstrand), their father, is a novelist who returns from Switzerland to visit them. Gradually the severity of Karen's illness becomes apparent to them all. Despite it's dark subject matter \"Through a glass darkly\" is mesmerising to watch thanks to the outstanding performances by the four actors as well Sven Nykvist's beautiful cinematography. Winner of 1961 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. In Swedish with english subtitles."
