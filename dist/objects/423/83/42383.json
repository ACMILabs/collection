        "Notions of what constitutes rape are explored in this documentary aimed at secondary school students. This is achieved through the story of Jimmy, a teenage boy who commits rape but can't see it. His relationship is contrasted with a positive role model who doesn't use coersion to get what he wants. The issues explored in the drama include; how a woman dresses, what constitues consent, what's involved in accepting a date, and legal repurcussions."
