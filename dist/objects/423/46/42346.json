        "In this short film by Emma-Kate Croghan a series of classic film noir tropes are cleverly strung together to make a rivetting 10 minute story. A lonely laboratory worker (Michael Lake) becomes obsessed with a parcel which a beautiful and mysterious woman has left on a train. Will the object of his desires yield pleasures or tragedy? Winner Best Direction New Films Award and Australian Cinematographers Society Award at 1993 St Kilda Film Festival. With sound editing by Stavros Efthymiou."
