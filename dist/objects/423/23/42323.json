        "A 19th century hypnotist, Dr Vogler (Max Von Sydow), and his wife Manda (Ingrid Thulin), dressed as a man are scrutinised and ridiculed by Dr Vergerus (Gunnar Bjornstrand) due to sceptisicm towards their \"magic\" performance. Vogler seeks retribution for this humiliation by performing the greatest conjuring trick of them all- faking his own death. Vogler's actions lead to the murder of a local constable who later returns to haunt the dead. Described as \"a thinking man's horror movie\", this film was awarded Special Jury and Cinema Nuovo Prizes at the Venice Film Festival, 1959. In Swedish with English subtitles."
