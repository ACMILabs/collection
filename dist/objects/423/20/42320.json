        "This film marked a milestone in Bergman's career and his success with international audiences allowed him this foray into romantic comedy. Forming the basis for Stephen Sondheim's musical ' A Little night music', this is the story of a middle-aged lawyer, his inexperienced young wife and her step-so, who are all invited to spend the weekend at the country mansion of a beautiful actress, the lawyer's ex-mistress. During the course of the weekend three couples meet, exchange partners and provide some lively comedic action, illustrating Bergman's sardonic attitude towards the vagaries of love. Behind the scintillating and witty approach to this charming period comedy of manners lie the illusions and pretensions of the haute bourgeois which Bergman cleverly illistrates with his collection of fickle husbands and scheming women."
