        "A beautifully filmed adaptation of the Tomi de Paola story about Giovanni, the clown who juggled for a living during the Middle Ages. Now, old and penniless, he returns to his birthplace seeking refuge in the church on Christmas Eve. Watching the procession of gifts for the Holy Child, he offers the only gift he has - one last performance. Suitable for middle and upper primary level."
