        "Presented by Jo Hall, this video which takes a good Customer Service person and shows them how to be a great Sales Person. Different vignettes have been chosen to demonstrate the major points of a sales role. The focus is on the skills of questioning, communicating, recognising buying signals and closing the sale. In talking about these areas, this program highlights the difference between satisfying a customer enquiry and turning that enquiry into a sale. It is presented in a generic, rather than industry specific, fashion which gives the video broad appeal to a range of industries. Includes a Leaders guide, Participants workbook and Overhead transparencies."
