        "Hell Bento is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of subcultures in Japan. A bento box is a Japanese lunch box divided into several compartments each containing a different kind of food. Anna Broinowski's documentary is likewise divided into different aspects of Japanese culture, but this is the underbelly, the invisible parts of an ancient conservative culture. You'll see Japan differently after spending some time with it's gay and lesbian community, 50s rock and roll girlie band, geisha pop-star, S&M fetishists, bikers, Yakuza gangsters, techno artists and homeless subway vagrants. Voted Most Popular Australian Documentary at the 1995 Sydney Film Festival. In English and Japanese with English subtitles."
