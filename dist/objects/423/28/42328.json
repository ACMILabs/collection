        "Born a peasant in Turin, Don Bosco (Ben Gazzara) has always known his vocation, thanks to an extremely significant dream. He welcomes poor, abandoned boys to his oratory and promptly teaches them to be charitable in accordance with the Christian doctrine. His power to sway souls away from the perils of greed and avarice frightens many people who repeatedly try to stop him, but without success. Self-assured, Don Bosco decides to found a congregation with its own rules but still has to contend with pressure from the Arch-Bishop of Turin."
