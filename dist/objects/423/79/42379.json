        "Alzheimer's Disease often produces memory loss and gradual changes in abilities to think, plan and communicate. Family members who are caregivers are often frustrated by these losses. This video is designed to help caregivers by providing information about these losses, teaching verbal and non-verbal communication techniques, describing common behaviour changes and providing suggestions to prevent or reduce problem behaviours."
