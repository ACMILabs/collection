        "Contains two episodes aimed at helping young children deal with moral questions and emotions: 'Once upon a feeling' Sooper Puppy explores what happens when bad feelings like jealousy, anger and disappointment aren't shared, and discover ways to handle negative feelings. 'That's trouble' Sooper Puppy learns that it's better to think ahead instead of being surprised by what might happen, and to recognize situations that can lead to trouble, and that it's OK to say \"no\". Suitable for Kindergarten and Lower Primary level students."
