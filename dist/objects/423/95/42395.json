        "The Greek myth retold by film animation, accompanied by music for flute written by Eldon Rathburn. Music, drawing, colour and movement here follow a moving classic restraint. Daedalus, inventor of many things, provides the wings to escape from Crete but Icarus, his son, impetuously flies too high. In this film, artist and composer share equal pleasure in the telling, with a feeling the audience will share. A film without words. Award: Oberhausen"
