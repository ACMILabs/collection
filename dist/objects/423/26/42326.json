        "Pontecorvo's passionate and devastating study of terrorism builds a tight narrative around the reconstruction of the main political events in Algiers between 1954-57: the rise of the nationalist movement led by the Algerian Liberation Front (F. L. N.), its crushing defeat by the French in 1957 and the resurgence 3 years later of Arab nationalism with led to Algerian independence in 1962. The film holds both a specific and a universal interest; first in the observation of the method of starting - and crushing a revolutionary movement and second in the wider implications behind both French and Algerian tactics and the implicit debate on the legtimacy of the steps taken to achieve an end. In French and Arabic with English sub-titles."
