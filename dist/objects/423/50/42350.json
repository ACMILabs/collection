        "Innovative, highly amusing tale of the ugly duckling who turns into a swan. Tania Lacy shines as the very plain, painfully shy and awkward shop assistant who has a crush on the Store Manager. Sophie Lee is equally as good as the bitchy beautiful shop assistant who gets everything her way. Presented as a musical, with ballet-like dance sequences, this quirky film is a classic tale which shows that beauty is, after all, only skin deep. Titsiana's singing voice is provided by Sarah Liversidge."
