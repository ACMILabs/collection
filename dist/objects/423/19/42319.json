        "This book was written by Ingmar Bergman. To write it he rescreened all of his films, many not seen since their release. He recounts the making of the films and explores the themes that bind them together, the preoccupations, the anguish, the conflicts. He comments unsurprisingly on his successes as well as his perceived failures. This text is an eloquent and indispensable companion to Bergman's films."
