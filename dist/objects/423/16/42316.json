        "Jane Eyre has lived a sad life since she was orphaned as a child. Shuffled between relatives and boarding school, she has never really known love. However, when she takes the job of governess to the illegitimate ward of nobleman, Edward Rochester, she experiences warmth and security for the very first time. When she and Rochester fall in love and he proposes marriage, it seems that finally, she will know happiness - until a devastating secret threatens to destroy the one thing she so desperately desires. Cast includes William Hurt, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Joan Plowright, Anna Paquin and Elle MacPherson. This is an enthralling love story based on the classic novel by Charlotte Bronte."
