        "Set in the American colonies during the brutal Anglo-French war of 1757, this fierce romantic adventure chronicles the story of Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), a whiteman raised by Mohicans, wo becomes entangled in a raging battle between the two rival nations. Exhilarating and exciting, this is adventure on a grand scale, with heart-stopping action, sizzling romance (between Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe) and spectacular battle scenes. An epic tale of love and loyalty, this is great entertainment and should not be missed."
