        "Winona Ryder shines in this deeply moving and touchingly funny story of a Berkeley graduate student Finn (Ryder) who spends the summer at the home of her sparring Grandmother (Anne Bancroft) and great aunt (Ellyn Burstyn). Their house is a quiet haven where she intends to finish her latest thesis and think over a marriage proposal. This beautifully filmed tale brings unbridled passion, true love, betrayal, joy and heartbreak vividly to life in a captivating cinematic tapestry that celebrates finding your way and following your heart. Based on the novel by Whitney Otto."
