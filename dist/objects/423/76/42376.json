        "This very sweet film, with no dialogue, is the tale of a small mouse who is asleep in its nest in the basement of his house when a plumber calls to fix some leaky pipes. Tha mouse is awakened and moves to the edge of the nest to have a look, but it leans over too far and falls out into the plumbers coveralls. The charming story follows the little mouse's adventures as he is transported around town from person until it eventually makes it safely back to the nest. Suitable for Kindergarten and Lower Primary students."
