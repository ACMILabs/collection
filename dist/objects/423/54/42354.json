        "In her award winning role, pop icon Madonna shines as Eva Peron, legendary wife of Argentinian President Juan Peron. Her desperate ambition to climb to the top saw her trade her only assets for one shot at power and fame. Co-starring Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Price, this is the epic true story of the charismatic yet controversial, devoted yet ruthless, deprived yet triumphant Evita. Screenplay by alan Parker and Oliver Stone and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice."
