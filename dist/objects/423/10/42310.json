        "An animated Christmas story for young children, in the Disney style, about the forest animals gathering snow-covered Christmas trees in preparation for the Christmas festivities. Father Christmas in the meantime is driving his sleigh through the forest gathering gifts, only to be hindered by two mean foxes. Fortunately the forest animals come to his aid and to celebrate, Father Christmas waves his magical wand to produce a beautiful large Christmas tree covered with gifts. At the stroke of midnight, all the animals and Father Christmas dance around the tree. Russian dialogue - no subtext."
