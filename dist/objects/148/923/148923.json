    "description": [
        "Originally planned as a work for Chrysler Corporation's weekly television program, 'Rhythm'  presents a montage of the factory workers, machinery and materials on a car production assembly line. Lye has edited his footage with a staccato feel that he has matched with the percussive music used for the soundtrack. Although rejected by Chrysler, the film won first prize in the television category in the 1957 New York Art Directors' Festival but was subsequently disqualified because it had never been broadcast."
