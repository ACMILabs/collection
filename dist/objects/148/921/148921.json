        "A primitive kinetic dance of white lines and angles meticulously scratched onto black and white film over an 8 month period and then edited and retrospectively matched with an African field tape of the Bagirmi tribe. The title is a reference to modern physics, 'free radicals' being particles of energy. The original version was a major award winner at the Experimental Film Competition at the 1958 Brussels World Fair. This revised version was a reworking of the original by Lye in 1979, with financial assistance from the New Zealand Film Commission. He deleted approximately 1 min. from his first version, made in 1958."
