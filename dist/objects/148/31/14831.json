        "The year is 2035. Advances in Bio Technology including human cloning and genetic engineering are leading humanity into a realm of unprecedented physical and mental proliferation. The quest for technological innovation has become an integral part of our evolution as a species. Chromozone is an interactive work which aims to explore the technologies of cutting edge genetic engineering and internet advancements, as they may appear in the year 2035. It is a virtual world where we as humans can modify the genealogy of our future generations. It is a satirical work designed to raise awareness and provoke debate about the social and ethical implications of the genetic engineering of our species."
