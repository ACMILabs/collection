        "Combining 2D art with abstract stylised 3D Elsie's world is immersive and slightly disturbing as the audience receives a taste of walking in her shoes and seeing with her eyes. Imagination and reality collide as the race to find the parents she ironically avoids from the evil clutches of her neighbours, the Fenwrights, begins."
