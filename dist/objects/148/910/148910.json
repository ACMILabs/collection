    "description": [
        "New Zealand-born Len Lye (1901-1980) was one of the most creative and innovative artists of the modernist era and a seminal figure in the history of the moving image. His major innovation, beginning in the 1930s, was to pioneer a form of 'direct' filmmaking, producing films without the use of a camera. Lye would paint, stencil and scratch imagery directly onto strips of celluloid.  His early hand-crafted films such as 'A Colour Box' (1935) are vibrant and lively moving image compositions; the abstract visuals, which use innovative colour combinations and effects, are paired with energetic soundtracks such as Jazz scores of the era.  With later films such as 'Free Radicals' (1958) and 'Particles in Space' (1957-1979), Lye reduced the moving image to its purest elements: light, dark, sound, motion, rhythm. He began making these films in the 1950s by scratching small, repeated patterns and images directly onto strips of 16mm film.  In his later career Lye's attention shifted to his series of impressive kinetic sculptures, however he often re-visited these 'scratch' films, updating and re-working them with the help of assistants."
