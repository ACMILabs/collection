        "Participants in the Stories and Songs of the People weekend tell their personal stories and provide a perspective on living in a world dominated by white culture. The struggles of indigenous peoples in Australia and some other parts of the world are explored through these individual experiences. A selection of music and songs performed during the weekend provide a backdrop to the discussion."
