        "Jazz guitarist Tal Farlow provides the background music to Lye's final film, which, although begun in the 1950s, was not recommenced until the 1980s. Unfortunately he died before completing it. It contains vertical white scratches as well as geometric white scratches on black. It was completed by Lye's assistant Steve Jones under the supervision of Ann Lye. Supported in part by a grant from the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council of New Zealand."
