        "The film presents Rosalie (Ngarla) Kunoth-Monks speaking for the first time in her Arrente language. It tells the other side to the film which in 1955 was one of a kind: first full colour feature film and first to feature Aboriginal actors with speaking parts. The program is about Rosalie's life before and after 'Jedda', her life in central Australia as a young woman and the profound cultural challenges she faced when selected by Charles Chauvel to play the lead role in 'Jedda' in 1955. Includes archival footage and excerpts from 'Jedda' including some b&w scenes."
