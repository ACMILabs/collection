        "The impact of the landmark 1981 Australian television drama series \"Women of the Sun\" on its audience was profound. Groundbreaking in its attempts to present stories of Aboriginal Australian women from their own perspectives and in their own languages, the series won the United Nations Media Peace Prize. In this moving documentary, Bob Weis - the producer of the series - explores the effects \"Women of the Sun\" has had on the lives of some of those involved with its making. Weis interviews some of the people who acted in the series - Justine Saunders, Shirley Nirrpurrangyydji, Naykalan Mununggur, Michelle LaCombe and Eva Johnson - as well as series co-writer Sonia Borg, and indigenous academic Marcia Langton. The film also features remarkable archival footage of series co-writer, poet and educator Hyllus Maris."
