        "The Twist family - 13-year-old twins Pete and Linda, their 8-year-old brother Bronson and their single Dad, Tony - move to an old lighthouse on the Australian coast. Here they encounter some unusual characters and strange happenings in a series of weird and comic adventures. Adapted for television from his own stories by the highly popular Australian children's author Paul Jennings, each episode is a self-contained story with a surprise ending, guaranteed to send you \"round the twist\". \"Sloppy Jalopy\" - When Pete lands in the middle of a sea of polluted sludge from Mr Gribble's waste disposal unit, even showers will not wash off the putrid smell. \"Smelly Feet\" - Bronson upsets Ms James by refusing to attend her birthday party, but the real reason has something to do with the fact that he has not taken his shoes off for 6 months. \"Grandad's Gifts\" - When Linda hears a strange and terrible sound behind the wall, she is convinced it is connected to the lemon tree sprouting fruit, but only Nell knows the true reason. \"Ice Maiden\" - Besotted with Dad's sculpture of Ice Maiden, Bronson resolves to save it from his red-haired cousin, Terry. \"Yuckles\" - Mr Gribble plans to build a casino on the site of a thousand year old rainforest, the home of the mysterious Yuckle - but Mr Gribble's plans blow up in his face. \"Quivering Heap\" - Young Gribble tries to prevent Pete from playing Dracula in the school play. \"Little Black Balls\" - When a goat eats Nell's valuable opal, Bronson is forced to collect and examine each of the goat's droppings. \"Seeing the Light\" - On election night, everyone gathers at the lighthouse for a party, but the lighthouse ghosts have plans of their own."
