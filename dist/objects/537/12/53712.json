        "Talented actress and dancer Nancy Barklay is vying for a lead role in this Broadway musical set in Brazil. Unfortunately her mother is competing for the same part. The situation becomes intolerable when Nancy follows her mother to Rio in order to wrest the part off her; complications ensue when both women fall for the same man. A featherweight musical filmed in Technicolor, 'Nancy Goes to Rio' is mostly remembered for being Carmen Miranda's second to last picture. The film is essentially a remake of 'It's A Date', Universal, 1940. Songs include 'Ca-Room Pa-Pa', 'Love Is Like This', 'Yipsee I-O', 'Time And Time Again', 'Nancy Goes To Rio', 'Shine On', 'Harvest Moon', 'Magic Is The Moonlight', 'Musetta's Waltz' and 'Embraceable You'. Cast includes Ann Sothern, Jane Powell, Barry Sullivan, Carmen Miranda, Louis Calhern."
