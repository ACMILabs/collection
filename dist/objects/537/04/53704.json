        "Starring everybody's favourite dog, Lassie, this entertaining and enjoyable family film centres around a remote Scottish village and its only doctor (played by Edmund Gwenn) who decides to adopt Lassie. However unbeknownst to the doctor, Lassie has an aversion to water and even though the good doctor patiently tries to work her through this fear, it is not until Lassie is put to the test of saving the doctor's life that the fear is finally overcome. Cast also includes Janet Leigh and Tom Drake."
