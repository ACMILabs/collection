        "The Twist family - 13-year-old twins Pete and Linda, their 8-year-old brother Bronson and their single Dad, Tony - move to an old lighthouse on the Australian coast. Here they encounter some unusual characters and strange happenings in a series of weird and comic adventures. Each episode is a self-contained story with a surprise ending, guaranteed to send you \"round the twist\". In \"Hair Brain\" Linda gets an advantage in her campaign for election to the student council after a weird experience with hair products. In \"The Princess and the Pete\" Pete finds the course of true love doesn't run smoothly. \"Boy Bird\" has Bronson discovering a magical singer; while in \"The Shadow Player\" Linda gets some bad news from her own shadow. \"Radio Da Da\" sends Linda and Peter time travelling, and Bronson performs good but smelly deeds as \"Skunkman\". In \"Isle of Dreams\" the Twists meet the Princess of Atlantis and have a difficult decision to make. Based on the books by Paul Jennings."
