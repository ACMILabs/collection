        "The eight films included in the two Knot at Home titles are the result of a series of community projects run by BIG hART, a non profit community organisation. The projects were designed to give people who often go unheard a chance to tell their stories. From 1998 to 2004 over five hundred young people were asked to tell stories about when they felt \"not at home\". The \"Knot at Home\" films present their stories using interviews, narratives, vignettes, songs, animations, dramatised scenes and memories. The young storytellers have made the films themselves, mentored by experienced filmmakers. Contents of \"Knot at Home Disc One\" are: Program One, \"Stories of Survival\" (short film sections directed by Sian Davies); Program Two, \"Stories of Security\" (short film section directed by Brendan Fletcher); Program Three, \"Stories of Love\"; (dramatised scenes directed by Bek Smith and Matt O'Connell) and Program Four, \"Stories of Dreams\" (short film sequences directed by Matthew Priestly and Bronwyn Purvis) Disc Two [319751]."
