        "Nice Coloured Girls uses experimental film techniques in an examination of the new urban ritual of taking white men for a ride. No longer the victims of these men, the women are still trapped by economic necessity. \"Nice Coloured Girls\" uses a clever juxtaposition of images and voice over of extracts from early journals of white settlers to compare aspects of the relationship between Aboriginal women and white men in the past and in the 1980s. Cast includes Gayle Mabo, Cheryl Pit, Janelle Court, Fiona George and Lindsay McCorrmack. (Awards: London, Berlin, Toronto)"
