        "Director Hadi Mahood returns to his hometown of Samawa, in the Shiite south of Iraq, after 14 years living in Australia, where he fled as a refugee from Sadam Hussein. Mahood wants to see for himself, and record, how the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq have affected his country and people. Through interviews and observation, the documentary explores the conditions of life in Samawa, and its peoples' hopes and fears for the future."
