    "description": [
        "The Twist family - 13-year-old twins Pete and Linda, their 8-year-old brother Bronson and their single Dad, Tony - move to an old lighthouse on the Australian coast. Here they encounter some unusual characters and strange happenings in a series of weird and comic adventures. Each episode is a self-contained story with a surprise ending, guaranteed to send you \"round the twist\". In \"Mali Boo\", Tony discovers an old Malibu surfboard in the garage, and Pete is keen to make a splash at the Port Niranda surf carnival, that is until the board's real owner shows up. In \"Brainless\", Bronson teams up with resident geek Anthony for a science project that ends up with Pete and Linda having their brains sucked out their noses. While Bronson is searching for their brains at the local tip, Linda and Pete's bodies become Gribbles' personal slaves. In \"Toy Love\", Linda's old Veronique doll comes back to haunt her, refusing to leave her alone, and neither will Gribble who has heard Linda read from the Viking Book of Love. In \"The Tears Of Innocence\", Port Niranda is in the middle of a drought when days before the annual flower show, Derek the rainmaker arrives. In \"The Ice Cream Man Cometh\", Linda is sacked from Mr. Gribble's ice cream parlor, so she finds work with Paulo the master ice cream maker. In \"If The Walls Could Talk\", Bronson feels left out because no-one ever tells him anything, thinking he is too young. If only the walls could talk he sighs, and then they begin to - the challenge is to make them be quiet again. In \"The Big Rock\", Gribbles gets his hands on the Viking Book of Love and reads the final poem, accidentally unleashing a curse which turns Faye into a frog. Based on the books by Paul Jennings."
