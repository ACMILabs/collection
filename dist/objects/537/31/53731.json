        "At last, an answer to one of the greatest unsolved cases in Australian crime history. When the bodies of brilliant physicist Dr Gilbert Bogle and his lover Mrs Margaret Chandler were found in bizarre circumstances on a Sydney riverbank in 1963, it captured the public imagination and launched an unprecedented murder investigation. However, the Coroner could find no cause of death, killer or motive. Some suggested it was a Cold War assassination, others claimed it was an overdose of LSD. Now, four decades later, a re-investigation of the case and uncovers explosive new evidence. Narrated by Hugo Weaving. Cast includes Rhys Muldoon, Octavia Barron-Martin and Nicholas Hope."
