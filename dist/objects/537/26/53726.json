    "description": [
        "The Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Kalgoorlie Pipeline and the Overland Telegraph were amongst Australia's most significant civil engineering projects. \"Constructing Australia\" is a series of three films - \"The Bridge\", \"Pipe Dreams\" and \"A Wire Through the Heart\" - that tells the story behind these landmarks in the construction of white Australian society. Combining dramatic re-enactments with archival footage, documentary sources, and interviews, the three films deal not only with the practical challenges and problems that faced each of the projects, but also reveal the personal triumphs and tragedies, the political intrigues, the human dramas and the social contexts behind these pioneering events."
