        "Australian director Rolf de Heer has said of his multi-award winning feature film \"Ten Canoes\" \"it is the most difficult film I have made, in the most foreign land I've been to...and it is Australia.\" Narrated by de Heer, \"The Balanda and the Bark Canoes\" tells the story of the making of \"Ten Canoes\" on location in the Arafura Swamp of Central Arnhem Land. The difficulties of filming in a remote and crocodile infested location, in collaboration with members of the indigenous Yolngu community - many of whom have little or no English, and very different approaches to storytelling and film-making - are vividly, and often humorously, depicted. \"The Balanda and the Bark Canoes\" also shows us how some aspects of traditional Yolngu culture are rediscovered and renewed by the process of making the film, and the enduring positive effect the project has had on the Ramingining community. (Awards: 53rd Sydney Film Festival - Urban Cinefile Audience Award)"
