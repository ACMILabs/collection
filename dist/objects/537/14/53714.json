        "The eight films included in the two Knot at Home titles are the result of a series of community projects run by BIG hART, a non profit community organisation. The projects were designed to give people who often go unheard a chance to tell their stories. From 1998 to 2004 over five hundred young people were asked to tell stories about when they felt \"not at home\". The \"Knot at Home\" films present their stories using interviews, narratives, vignettes, songs, animations, dramatised scenes and memories. The young storytellers have made the films themselves, mentored by experienced filmmakers. Contents of \"Knot at Home Disc Two\" are: Program Five, \"Stories of my Family\"; Program Six, \"Stories of Loyalty\" (short film sequences directed by Nathan Brown and Phillip Crawford); Program Seven, \"Stories of Insight\"; and Program Eight, \"Stories About Telling my Story\" (short film sequences directed by Rachel Ward). Disc One [319750]."
