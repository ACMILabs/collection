        "The Twist family - 13-year-old twins Pete and Linda, their 8-year-old brother Bronson and their single Dad, Tony - move to an old lighthouse on the Australian coast. Here they encounter some unusual characters and strange happenings in a series of weird and comic adventures. Each episode is a self-contained story with a surprise ending, guaranteed to send you \"round the twist\". In \"Welcome Back\", the ghosts see their chance to stage a comeback in the play being performed to celebrate Port Niranda's bicentenary. In \"Monster Under the Bed\" the Lintmonster under Bronson's bed demonstrates the dire consequences of neglecting the cleaning. In \"Linda Godiva\", Linda becomes invisible. Peter turns into a werewolf in \"Dog By Night\". In \"TV Or Not TV\" all the Twist kids get (literally) sucked into their TV. \"Face The Fear\" has Bronson colliding with hidden loot, ghosts and escaped convicts in the local cemetery. Based on the books by Paul Jennings."
