    "description": [
        "The Twist family - 13-year-old twins Pete and Linda, their 8-year-old brother Bronson and their single Dad, Tony - move to an old lighthouse on the Australian coast. Here they encounter some unusual characters and strange happenings in a series of weird and comic adventures. Each episode is a self-contained story with a surprise ending, guaranteed to send you \"round the twist\". In \"The Big Burp\", Pete finally meets the girl of his dreams. He can't believe his luck - Jeannie is the most beautiful girl in Port Niranda - even if she is a tree spirit. Pete is also very surprised to find that he has somehow fallen pregnant. In \"The Viking Book of Love\", a long boat of ancient Vikings, led by chef Snorri, emerges from an eerie fog which is enveloping Port Niranda, however the real trouble begins when the chief's son, Snorrisen, falls in love with Linda after he reads to her from the Viking Book of Love. \"The Whirling Derfish\" sees Bronson swallow a rare whirling derfish, causing his willy to spin like a propellor turning him into a human outboard motor known as \"The Port Niranda Porpoise\". In \"Umi\", Pete's mind is trapped in Gribble's body and vice versa, due to a particularly realistic video game they played. While Pete is spending a nasty night with Matron Gribble, Gribble is trying to convince Tony to sell the lighthouse. In \"Truth Hits Everybody\", Linda loses out to Gribble as the host of the Port Niranda High School Broadcast, so she decides to do her own show. Anthony, Fiona, Pete and Linda find a magic microphone that makes everyone speak the truth, which is not always a good thing. In \"Niranderthal Boy\", the tradition in the Twist household of the razor being passed on from father to elder son is broken when Bronson uses it before Pete - thus chaos is unleashed and the consequences can only be dangerous. Based on the books by Paul Jennings."
