        "The Twist family - 13-year-old twins Pete and Linda, their 8-year-old brother Bronson and their single Dad, Tony - move to an old lighthouse on the Australian coast. Here they encounter some unusual characters and strange happenings in a series of weird and comic adventures. Adapted for television from his own stories by the highly popular Australian children's author Paul Jennings, each episode is a self-contained story with a surprise ending, guaranteed to send you \"round the twist\". In \"Know All\" a trunk of old circus costumes and a scarecrow are combined with unexpected results. \"The Copy\" has the Twist children experimenting with cloning, while in \"Without My Pants\" Pete develops an embarrassing turn of phrase. In \"Lighthouse Blues\" the Twist family is threatened with eviction from the lighthouse, and in \"Next Time Around\" Pete gets into trouble after Linda hypnotises him. Bronson finds an ancient and magical Mongolian cap in \"Copy Cat\", and is helped by a water spirit in \"Little Squirt\". In \"Pink Bow Tie\" a bad hair day for Pete, Gribble, Rabbit and Tiger leads to trouble at school, and in \"Nails\" Linda befriends the mysterious new boy at school."
