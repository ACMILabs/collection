    "description": [
        "The Twist family - 13-year-old twins Pete and Linda, their 8-year-old brother Bronson and their single Dad, Tony - move to an old lighthouse on the Australian coast. Here they encounter some unusual characters and strange happenings in a series of weird and comic adventures. Adapted for television from his own stories by the highly popular Australian children's author Paul Jennings, each episode is a self-contained story with a surprise ending, guaranteed to send you \"round the twist\". \"Skelton on the Dunny\" tells how the Twists deal with a haunted outside loo, while in \"Birdsdo\" rogue seagulls inadvertently help Linda and Pete prove that Nell is not insane. Pete meets a ghost who wants his help at the local tip in \"A Good Tip for Ghosts\", and Bronson finds a baby in \"The Cabbage Patch Fib\". In \"Spaghetti Pig Out\" the Twists find that, after being hit by lightning, their remote control works on people, with chaotic results. \"The Gum Leaf War\" takes Linda into the mountains where she encounters a strange and powerful tree. Wishes granted to the Twist family turn out not to be the boon that they seem in \"Santa Claws\", while in \"Wunderpants\" Pete's underwear has special powers. In \"Lucky Lips\" a magic lipstick makes Pete irresistible, and Dad wants to try his own luck."
