        "Billy Peltzer's father buys him a new cuddly pet. But heed these three warnings: Don't ever get him wet. Keep him away from bright light. And the most important thing, the one thing you must never forget: no matter how much he cries, no matter how much he begs...never, never feed him after midnight. Cast includes Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Hoyt Axton, Polly Holliday, Frances Lee McCain."
