        "Hotshot race car Lightning McQueen (given voice by Owen Wilson) is living life in the fast lane until he hits a detour on his way to the most important race of his life. Stranded in Radiator Springs, a forgotten town on the old Route 66, he meets Sally, Mater, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) and a variety of quirky characters who help him discover that there's more to life than trophies and fame. Another hit animated feature from the studios of Pixar that will delight young and young-at-heart audiences alike. Also features the voices of Cheech Marin, Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, John Goodman and many others. Original score composed and conducted by Randy Newman."
