        "Ocean liners were far more than simply giant ships that carried passengers across the seas. They were bold statements of national power and technological might. Like rocket ships in the space race of the 1970s, liners were symbols of ultimate power in the early struggle between the super-powers for dominance of the world. For the first time, the global story of these great ships - an epic story inextricably linked with epic world events is told. From the earliest days of the paddle-wheeled superliner; through their use in times of war as well as peace; into the present, and beyond, for a preview of giant ocean going cities already in the advance planning stages."
