        "This is a hour spent in the company of Frederico Fellini, unarguably one of cinema's greatest figures. American filmmaker Bachmann was given unequalled access to the Maestro and his medium, following Fellini around during the shooting of \"Satirycon\". Fellini displays all the attributes for which he was famous; he cajoles, implores, abuses and torments his cast and crew, behaves one minute like a tyrant and the next like a baby, displays grace and charm, and on occasions a touch of genius. It offers a fascinating portrait of Fellini at work."
