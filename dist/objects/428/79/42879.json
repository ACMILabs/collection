        "This film presents an insightful look into the immigrant experience in Britain. Amir arrives illegally to England in the 1960's. His arrival is less than grand, arriving in a vegetable crate, but he is willing to endure this indignity to find a better life than the one he had in India. His expectations are of wealth, opportunity and prosperity but instead he finds himself dissilusioned, sharing a house with seventeen other illegal immigrants in Northern England. They find themselves working in factories, no better off than the existence they left. Their lifestyle is punctuated by the comings and goings of agents, police informers, occasional enjoyable trips to the cinema to see Indian films and a weekly visit by a prostitute. Into their world arrives Mary, an illegal immigrant from Ireland that house leader Hussein Shah meets in a cafe. At first Mary brings hope and happiness to the household but when she announces that she is pregnant, traditional patriarch Hussein arranges a marriage of convenience between Mary and his nephew. Tension arises when the males of the household object to Mary's free spirited ways. Starring Om Puri, Pavan Malhotra and Angeline Ball."
