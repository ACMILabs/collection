        "Extraordinary people and extraordinary performances are the soul of this documentary, an entertainment special about our inherent fascination with the comic and the unusually skilled. Fire-eating presenter Mic Conway links the colourful reminiscences of the last of Australia's vaudeville veterans - song and dance man Charles Norman; Contortionist Valantyne, Napier; \"Australia's Queen of the Air\", Olga Varona; and \"Patterologist\" Ron Shand. Using rare archival films of acts from the turn of the century, this film will leave you with a positive feeling about yourself, other people and the world at large."
