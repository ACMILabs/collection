        "Episode of Series \"The Avengers\". These two episodes of the television series were originally aired in the mid to late sixties. \"Two's a crowd\": KGB Colonel Psev is rumored to be in London to infiltrate a high level conference, but nobody knows what he looks like. The Russians know what Steed looks like though, and intend replacing him with a lookalike - a true double agent. In \"Mission highly improbable\" a Ministry of Defence scientist, Professor Rushion, has created an amazing reducing ray, capable of shrinking anything. His colleague Chivers sees the possibilities for smuggling miniaturised military hardware, so Steed and Emma must bring him down to size."
