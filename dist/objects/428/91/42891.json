        "The creepy and kooky Addams family; Gomez, Morticia, Uncle Fester, Grandmama, Thing, Lurch, Pugsley and Wednesday are here for two episodes from the original television series. In \"Green-eyed Gomez\" Gomez suffers from a bout of jealousy when a former beau of Morticias, Lionel Barker (Del Moore), comes to stay. In an effort to keep his advances away from his wife Gomez hires a maid (Pattee Chapman) as a decoy but the jealousy is reversed when Morticia mistakes his actions for those of effection. To complicate matters Lionel proves to be a con-man. Directed by Jerry Hopper. In \"Wednesday leaves home\" Wednesday does a disappearing trick after being scolded for borrowing Uncle Fester's TNT. A frantic Morticia and Gomez contact the Bureau of Missing Persons, only to discover that Wednesday was hiding in her room but the problems continue for Sergeant Haley (Jesse White) and Officer Thompson (Rex Kelloss) when they become involved with the Addams family. Directed by Sidney Lanfield. The series features John Astin, Carolyn Jones, Ted Cassidy, Jackie Coogan and Lisa Loring and based on characters created by Charles Addams."
