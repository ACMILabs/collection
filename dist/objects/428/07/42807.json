        "Set in the world of bars, motels and endless highways this is a gritty film about the need to love. It follows the topsy-turvy relationship of four people and their descent into chaos as they drive across Australia. This is a warm and humourous story of human fallibilities, familial ties, friendship and love. Simultaneously rooted in reality and myth, it's a road movie and a comedy filled with energy, humour and affection for its characters. Starring Hugo Weaving, Ben Mendelsohn, Mirando Otto, Naveen Andrews, Noah Taylor and Kimberley Davies."
