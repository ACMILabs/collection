        "The past 200 years has been a period of great upheaval and trauma for the native creatures of Australia. Introduced animals have learnt to adapt to the alien environment at the expense of the native inhabitants, many of which have become tragically extinct. The issues surrounding wildlife management are wrought with varying opinions and passionate sentiment. Narrated by Alan Dale, this video investigates the work being done to preserve endangered native species and to control introduced species in the Top End."
