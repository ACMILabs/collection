        "Paul and Mary Bland, an endearingly middle-class couple, want to get out of their swinger-infested apartment building and open a nice little restaurant in the country. However, real estate is expensive and Paul has just lost his job. So, they take out a kinky ad and then knock off the rich swingers who answer it...Enter Raoul."
