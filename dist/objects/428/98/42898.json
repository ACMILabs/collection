        "Marvel at the magic of Merlin in this spectacular presentation. Sorceress Mab (Miranda Richardson), summons forth the wizard Merlin (Sam Neill) in an attempt to perpetuate the powers of old. Her surrogate son loses her passion for dark magic when his heart is touched by love in the form of the beautiful Nimue (Isabella Rossellini). Merlin aligns himself with the warrior who will become King Arthur and is able to use his powers for good to bring peace and justice. Wherever there is good however, evil lurks, and a battle is waged between these two opposing forces. Even if you are not a fan of fantasy, the special effects from Framestore and Jim Henson's Creature shop, as well as the costuming will delight the visual senses. Also starring Helena Bonham Carter, John Gielgud, Rutger Hauer, Martin Short and James Earl Jones. The feature presentation is followed by \"The Magical making of Merlin\" produced by Russ Patrick."
