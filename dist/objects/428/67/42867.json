        "One of Broomfield's finest films, this award-winning documentary first shown on Channel 4's 'True Stories' timeslot, shows what happens when the apparently shambolic Broomfield tries to make a film about the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance movement and its leader Eugene Terreblanche. The result is both frightening and hilarious, as Broomfield lulls his subjects into portraying themselves in their true light and deflates the pompous rhetoric by refusing to take it seriously. As Broomfield reduces 'the Leader' to apolexy by turning up late for his interview, and disrupts the triumphalism of the Kruger Day rally by his bumbling, one wants to get up and cheer."
