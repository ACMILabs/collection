        "There was a time when the cable car was the pride of many major cities in the Western World, but that was when the pace of life was much slower. However, when major cities started to expand, it became apparent that the demand for some form of short-haul transportation could not be ignored. A young engineer named George Smith Duncan has successfully built a cable tramway in New Zealand. He later moved to Melbourne where he would eventually build the worlds largest cable tram network."
