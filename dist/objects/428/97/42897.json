        "Contains three episodes from the classic series (fans of the original television series note that these are not the original voices) of Kimba, King of the Jungle, a bravehearted white lion cub. Kimbas adventures bring him across new friends and sometimes some very unfriendly visitors, which often lands him in a spot of bother. However he always bounces back with enthusiasm and life, willing to give anything a go. The epsiodes on this tape are: 'Journey into time', 'Restaurant trouble' and 'Running wild'."
