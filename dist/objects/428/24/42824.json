        "This video tells the story of the Modern Olympic Games. From the humble beginnings in 1896 to the most widely watched television extravaganza in the world, there has been a fascinating, dramatic and at times controversial journey. It opens with a dramatic overview of the entire Olympic spectacle and then goes on to explore the rediscovery of the heritage of the ancient world in the 19th century and how the games came to be inspired by the ancient games. It also looks at the celebration of the Olympic festival and how the games have grown to become what they are today."
