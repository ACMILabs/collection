        "This program documents the impact of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. It particularly focuses on the role of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo. He believes that he should be outspoken about the atrocities suffered by the people of East Timor because of the Indonesian occupation. The format consists of film footage depicting life in East Timor: a commentary and interviews with Bishop Belo, the Indonesian General Herman Mantiri and East Timorese people."
