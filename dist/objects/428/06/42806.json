        "A warm and witty screwball comedy about love, fate and other pressing concerns. Mia and Alice have just moved into a warehouse apartment but are still minus a housemate. Danni, Mia's girlfriend is keen to move in, but Mia fears commitment. Mia is obsessed with her favourite lecturer and becomes embroiled in a bureaucratic nightmare as she pursues him to his new department. Alice, a frustrated perfectionist is looking for the perfect man, but cant find anyone who fits her rigorous criteria. Feeling the need for a change she falls for the most unsuitable man possible, Aria part-time gigolo. Little does she know she has her own secret admirer, Michael a shy medical student who is living in the share house from hell, and wants out! Their search for love transcends the boundaries of the Universtiy and their respective disciplines."
