        "Buster Keaton is now regarded as one of the supreme comedians of the silent American cinema. He was also an inventive and dedicated film-maker who performed all of his own stunts yet took little interest in business arrangements. This is a comprehensive survey of Buster Keaton's life and work including generous extracts from all his feature films and most of his two-reelers. Narrated by Lindsay Anderson. Ep. 1. (53 min.)--Ep. 2. (54 min.)--Ep. 3. (53 min.) Further reference: http://www.busterkeaton.com"
