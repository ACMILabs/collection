        "Egyptologists and video artists takes us back 5,000 years to view the awakening of Egypt - a civilisation that created colossal structures with simple tools and massive manpower. Egypt is an amalgam of two things: the constancy of the Nile and the labour of its people. The reconstructions in this video recapture the splendour of Egypt including two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramids and the (Pharos) Lighthouse at Alexandria. Marvel at 25 historical recreations including the Temple of Luxor, Temple of Ammon at Karnak, Temple of Ramses, the Step Pyramid at Saqqra, and the Great Temple of Abu Simbel with its four statues of Ramses II."
