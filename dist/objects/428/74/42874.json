        "Presented by Noni Hazelhurst, each of the Grimms fairy tales is brought to life by the use of beautifully illustrated full colour drawings of both the characters and their environment. The stories told in this volume are: Tom Thumb (16 minutes) ; Snowdrop/Snow White (16 minutes) ; Little Red Riding Hood (9 minutes); \"Rumpelstiltskin (8 minutes). Each story has been divided into its own segment so the educator can easily find stories that suit individual teaching needs. This tape is not intended to be used for entertainment only."
