These two episodes of the television series were orignally aired in the mid to late sixties. \"The Hour that never was\": suppose someone gave a party and nobody came? Visiting the closing down party of his old RAF camp with Emma, Steed finds that not only is the place deserted, but time sems to have stood still. In \"Murdersville\", life isn't as simple as it used to be in Little-Storping-in-the-Swuff. What is the million pound secret which has turned the villagers into killers? Emma aims to find out, or die trying."
