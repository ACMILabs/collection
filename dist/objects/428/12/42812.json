        "In an attempt to reunite his family, which has fallen apart over a hocked piano, sensitive 17 year old Mick O'Brien joins the all girl \"Total Fire Band\" to earn some extra cash. He falls in love with the lead singer Angela whos been jilted by one too many lying men. She's hot for Mick too, but not because hes cute and talented, but being a woman he's sure to be honest! Great performances from Toni Pearen and especially John Jarrat as the has-been Elvis impersonator adds to the hilarity of this left-of-centre comedy."
