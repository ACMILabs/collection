        "Including previously unavailable footage from the Central Russian Archive, this video looks at the events of the year 1917 and attempts to pinpoint the internal struggle and crucial events in the Russian Revolution. It was a year in which anti-war sentiment was running high and Tsar Nicholas the second ceded power, two events which this documentary views as catalysts. It also provides historical footage to convey Lenin's exile after an abortive coup attempt against the caretaker ruler, Karensky, and how in November of the same year Lenin assumed a position at the forefront of the peoples' revolution when soldiers, sailors and factory workers successfully seized control of the country."
