        "A compilation of 6 classic Christmas tales including. \"Christmas comes but once a year\" (dir. Dave Fleischer): When children in an orphanage wake on Christmas day to find they are left with a miserable collection of presents it's up to the inventive Professor Grampy to restore their faith in Christmas. \"Hector's hectic life\" (dir. Bill Tytla): Hector is trying so hard to be a good little puppy before Santa arrives but when he has to look after three mischievous puppies it's going to be harder than he thought. \"Snow foolin'\" (dir. I Sparber): The forest animals make the most of the first winter snow as they ski, skate, build snowmen and have snowball fights. \"Jack Frost\": A young grizzly bear decides he won't hibernate for winter but the task proves harder than he thought and Jack Frost has to save him from an uncertain fate. \"Little drummer boy\" (prod., dirs. Arthur Rankin Jnr., Jules Bass): Greer Garson narrates this classic tale, presented in wonderful puppetry. The Little Drummer Boy, blessed with a special gift follows the Three Kings to Bethlehem. Features the voices of the Vienna Boys Choir. \"Christmas through the ages\" (dir. Milan Herzog): An entertaining history of the legends and customs of Christmas throughout the world."
