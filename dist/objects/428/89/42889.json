        "This video contains four episodes from the popular television series, \"The Twilight Zone\". Included on this tape are; \"Time enough at last\" (originally broadcast in 1959), bookworm Henry Berris (Burgess Meredith) is thwarted in his attempts at reading. After a bomb hits it seems his problems are over and he has the peace and quiet he requires; only there's one ironic catch. \"After hours\" (originally broadcast in 1960), when Anne Francis finds herself locked in a department store overnight she unravles the mystery of the ninth floor, but not by choice. \"The Changing of the guard\" (originally screened in 1962), Donald Pleasence plays a disgruntled but saintly school teacher, recently retrenched, who vows to return to his old school room and commit suicide. A surprise awaits him that will change his destiny. \"Monsters due on Maple Street\" (originally screened in 1960), things are looking grim on Maple Street. The power is out, cars won't start and the phones are dead. The indications are that monsters ahev invaded the earth, only where are they? Cast includes Claude Akins and John Weston."
