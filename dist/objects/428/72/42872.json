        "Presented by Noni Hazelhurst, each of the Aesops fables (stories designed to teach a moral lesson) is brought to life by the use of beautifully illustrated full colour drawings of both the characters and their environment. The 18 stories on this tape are short and to the point. The tapes primary intent is to instruct rather than entertain, and short interludes between each story may be used by the teacher to generate discussion with the students on the stories they have just seen and heard. Fables include: The Fox and the crow ; The Goose and the golden eggs ; The Ant and the grasshopper ; The Lion and the mouse ; The Horse and the laden donkey ; The Lion and the bulls and The Vain crow."
