        "Orson Welles stars in and directs this feature/documentary on fake, forgery, art and illusion that well deserves the title, 'film essay'. As a basis he uses an unfinished documentary (original footage by Francois Reichenbach) on Elmyr de Hory, a noted art forger. Included in Welles' documentary within a documentary are interviews by Clifford Irving, biographer of de Hory. Welles injects his views on his Hollywood career and artistic originality and presents a short piece in which Pablo Picasso meets a beautiful woman."
