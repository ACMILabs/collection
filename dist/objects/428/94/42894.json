        "Loud, funny and undoubtedly fat, Jennifer Paterson and Clarissa Dickson don't suffer fools gladly. On the subject of food they don't suffer them at all. They are the biggest characters to arrive on the food scene in recent years, and they tour Britain on their Triumph Thunderbird in their request to rediscover the delights of traditional home cooking. These are the topics and cuisines explored in this video: Fish and shellfish, Meat, Fruit and vegetables, Cakes and baking, Game, Food in the wild."
