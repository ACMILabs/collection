        "Orson Welles stars and directs (as he so often does, and does well) in this adaptation of Isak Dinesen's (Karen Blixen) story. The story is from a novella and concerns a wealthy Macao merchant, Mr Clay (Welles) who attempts to prove his power by making an old seaman's legend into fact. Welles cleverly uses the original story as a basis of a philosophical inquisition. Cast includes Orson Welles, Jeanne Moreau, Roger Coggio and Norman Eshley. Music by Eric Satie."
