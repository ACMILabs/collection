        "No one believes Nancy Archer has encountered a giant alien from outer space in the desert one night. The local sheriff and her doctor think she is suffering from hallucinations. Her husband, Harry, is openly having an affair and wants Nancy committed to an asylum so he can take her money and enjoy a life of lustful luxury. It soon becomes quite obvious Nancy is telling the truth when she grows into a 50ft woman who soon becomes a towering menace as she seeks out her husband and his lover to get even."
