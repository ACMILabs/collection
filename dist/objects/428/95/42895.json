        "Kevin Spacey makes his directorial debut with \"Albino alligator\", a tense and claustrophobic thriller. A robbery goes wrong for three petty crims (Gary Sinise, Matt Dillon, William Fichtner), when a shootout results in the death of a federal agent. They flee to Dino's Last Chance Bar, a New Orleans basement dive. Their attempt to lay low and maintain anonymity is abruptly shattered when government agents, camera crews and a SWAT team surround the building. The stalemate causes the crooks, patrons and bar employees to react to the situation in unexpected and dramatic ways, contributing to the films tense drama. Also starring Faye Dunaway, Skeet Ulrich, M. Emmet Walsh and Joe Mantegna."
