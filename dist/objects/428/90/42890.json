        "This video contains four episodes of the long-running classic television series. \"The Invaders\" (screened originally in January 1962) stars Agnes Moorehead as an impoverished woman who is stalked by tiny spacemen in her small cabin. \"One for the Angels\" (screened originally in October 1959) has Mr. Death coming for salesman Ed Wynn - but before he departs the Earth he will makes his greatest pitch - to the Angels. In \"The Eye of the beholder\" (screened originally in November 1960) the bandages are removed from a facially deformed woman only to reveal a more hideous nightmare. In \"The Lonely\" (screened originally in November 1959), on a deserted planet convicted criminal Jack Warden must serve his long sentence alone - until his jailers take pity and leave him a beautiful robot woman. Can a man's desperation lead to love?"
