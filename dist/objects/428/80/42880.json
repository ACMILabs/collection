        "Screen legends John Cassavetes and Peter Falk are Mikey and Nicky, friends since childhood. Their friendship is forcefully renewed when small-time hood Nicky (Cassavetes), seeks out his friend Mikey (Falk), when he fears there is a hit on him. His suspicions are correct, with hitman Kinney (Ned Beatty) on his tail. When Mikey and Nicky are on the run one witnesses the unravelling of their friendship as suspicion, resentment and betrayal surfaces. Cassavetes and Falk revel in each others performances and there is fine support from Ned Beatty, Rose Arrick and Carol Grace."
