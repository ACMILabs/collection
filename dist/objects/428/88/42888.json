        "Thornton stars as Karl Childers, a simple man who has spent the last 25 years in a mental institution for the murders of his mother and her lover. On the day he is to be released, Karl tells his story to two journalists and we learn the shocking circumstances surrounding the crime. Now out in the world, Karl experiences cruelty from some locals, kindness from others - especially a young boy and his mother, with whom he develops an unlikely friendship. However, when the mother's abusive boyfriend appears on the scene, Karl is thrust into an explosive predicament that builds to a gripping, unexpected and unforgettable climax. Winner of the 1996 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay."
