        "Erwin Weishaupt made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of a lover - impulsively flying to Casablanca for a sex-change operation following a casual remark by Anton, the man he had fallen in love with. Rejected by Anton, and by her latest lover Christoph in the film's opening scenes, Elwin - now Elvira - is befriended by a young prostitute, Zora, who provides a sympathetic ear for her strange, sad story. In his most personal film, which he wrote, directed, edited, photographed and produced, Fassbinder takes us through the last days of Elvira's life with his unique brand of dark humour and satire, yet with great tenderness towards his hero/heroine. In German with English subtitles."
