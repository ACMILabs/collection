        "This is the story of the swiftest and most comprehensive genocide on record. The Tasmanian Aborignals were an isolated people until British colonisation began. Deliberate government policy and actions meant that a whole society and culture was virtually wiped out within the lifetime of Truganini, known as \"The Last Tasmanian\". This documentary takes a conservative position on Tasmanian Aboriginality, which has since been challenged by descendants of indigenous ancestors."
