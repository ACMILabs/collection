        "The first and last episode of the suspense-filled television series of the 1960s. The first episode \"Fear in a Desert City\" sets up the storyline: Dr. Richard Kimble is about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit - the murder of his wife. He escapes and begins a desperate search for the one-armed man who may hold the key to his innocence. He is relentlessly pursued by the police. In the final episode \"The Judgement\" sees the final climactic confrontation between Kimble and Lieutenant Gerard, the police lieutenant who has relentlessly pursued him and the mysterious one-armed man."
