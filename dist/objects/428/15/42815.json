        "The magnificence or Rome and Pompeii as they were about 2,000 years ago is reconstructed before your eyes. See the Colosseum, as it stood, with 50,000 Romans applauding the bloody gladiator spectacles. Walk the Roman Forum in all its splendour. See the Circus Maximus where 150,000 cheered the chariot races. Gaze at the lavish lifestyles in both Rome and Pompeii - the baths, theatres, temples, palaces and shopping markets. Watch Neros Rome ablaze and Mount Vesuvius devastation of Pompeii, recreated as it might have happened."
