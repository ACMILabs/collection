        "Produced originally as a segment for the Yorkshire Television program \"First Tuesday\". The Island of East Timor was annexed by Indonesia in 1975 and has suffered military occupation ever since. In 1991 troops opened fire on a funeral procession in Dili - the bloody massacre that ensued was captured on film by a Yorkshire Television camaraman and became headline news around the world. That footage is backed up in this documentary by frank and moving interviews with Timorese who describe the succession of atrocities inflicted on them dating back to 1975."
