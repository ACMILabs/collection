        "Presented by Noni Hazelhurst, each of the Aesops fables (stories designed to teach a moral lesson) is brought to life by the use of beautifully illustrated full colour drawings of both the characters and their environment. The 18 stories on this tape are short and to the point. The tapes primary intent is to instruct rather than entertain, and short interludes between each story may be used by the teacher to generate discussion with the students on the stories they have just seen and heard. Fables include: The Shepherd boy and the Wolf ; The Fox and the grapes ; The Hare and the Tortoise ; The Cat and the Mouse ; The Hare and the Hound ; The Raven and the Swan and The lion, the ass and the fox."
