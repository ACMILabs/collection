        "Set in the 1950s this film is based directly on a memory from Fassbinder's youth. An uncle trying to reenter civilian life after serving in the German army set up in business as a fruit and vegetable vendor, other members of the family not only failed to support him but seemed deliberately to put obstacles in his path. Fassbinder turned this recollection of domestic discord into an unsparing critique of selfishness, snobbery and ad inhumanity in a 'typical' German middle-class family."
