        "Kathryn Bigelow's (Strange Days, Blue Steel) fourth feature is a study of masculinity and surfer culture. Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) is a rookie FBI agent working undercover trying to crack an elite group of bank robbers who wear masks of ex-Presidents to hide their identities. As the criminals are thought to belong to an exclusive surfer cult, Utah learns to surf to infiltrate the group. Utah selects Tyler (Lori Petty), who is unaware of his true identity, to teach him the breaks that will make him a convincing surfer and keep his cover sound. Utah meets Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) a top surfer and adrenalin junkie, for whom surfing has a spiritual and mythical significance. \"Point Break\" is an action film that contains some impressive stunts including car chases, leaps from aeroplanes, exploding petrol stations and memorable scenes of breaking waves. Reeves is interestingly cast as the straight-laced policeman who has to learn the speech and mannerisms of a stoner dude. Filmed in Hawaii, California, Oregon and Bondi Beach, New South Wales."
