        "Ancient Greece and 25 of the most significant structures and monuments, as originally built, come alive as Greek customs and daily life are revealed through computer graphics, archival film and classic art. Tour the Acropolis in the 5th century B.C., gaze at the State of Athena and the Parthenon, the pride and joy of the Athenians. Walk the Agora, Theatre of Dionysius (home of the Olympic Games) and the Temple of Zeus. Stand before Delphis Temple of Apollo where the oracle spoke. Travel to Mycenae, City of Agamemnon; Santorini and Atlantis, the legendary lost continent."
