        "This documentary narrated by Kerry Dwyer reveals how the use by the local council of asbestos tailings from the mine at Baryulgil in New South Wales, which operated until 1977, has affected the health of the predominantly Aboriginal population. The dust was used to maintain roads and keep the earth dust down around the houses. The school itself was built on the tailings. The film records what happened historically at Baryugil and follows the people's attempts to gain workers' compensation from the Dust Diseases Board."
