        "Spike Milligan takes a journey around \"his\" Australia, from Woy Woy where his mother lives, to Wagga Wagga - with Sydney and Canberra in between. His journey includes watching the Melbourne Cup with his mother, spinning yarns with locals in a pub, and the search for the great Australian joke. Milligan's personal insight into Australia and Australians is both humorous and an interesting retrospective of the country in the 1980's."
