        "'Between us' is prolific Melbourne filmmaker Bill Mousoulis' 31st film. Shot in an achingly realistic style, the film is about choices - how people from varying backgrounds find themselves holding back from making decisions that can change their lives. Central to the narrative is Rick (Phillip Dean), a washing machine repairman who thinks there's more to life than what he's doing. Through him we encounter Monica and Loretta; one a woman whose living her dream as a singer, the other too afraid to defy her boyfriend and join the workforce. Cast also includes Sharon Rider, Juliet Ward and James Cruickshank."
