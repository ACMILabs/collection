        "A young girl, Jane (Tamara Liffers), left to her own devices at home proceeds to go about her morning ritual. She feeds herself, her pet fish and dog then goes to secretly feed the next door neighbour's pet rabbit. Jane hides when she spots Mrs. Nextdoor (Tiffany Evans) entering the garden who unbeknowns to her is about to bury the dead rabbit. Jane panics when her dog has brought in the dead carcus of the rabbit believing that the dog has killed the rabbit. Jane's matter of fact approach to right the situation illustrates the naivity and simplicity of a child's mind. Cast also includes Ivor Bowen."
