        "3 teenagers speak candidly about their dreams, aspirations, fears and the sanctity that is their bedroom. 17 year old Kirsty lives in St Kilda with her mother, is deciding whether to pursue acting or music, and whether to return to school. Jyka is a 14 year old Koorie boy living in Broadmeadows with his extended family and aspires to move out when he's 16, learn to read, and become a panel beater. 16 year old Will has moved from the country and is boarding at Melbourne Grammar. With remarkable candour and a palpable trust in the voiceless director, the three share their views on the world as perceived from their bedroom."
