        "Dark Wind is a tangled web of deceit between two law enforcements. Lou Diamond Phillips plays Jim Chee a young police officer working on a reserve in Arizona belonging to the Navajo's. He finds himself in constant dispute with the local sheriff of the Hopi clan who want to share the reserve with the Navajo's. Into the web is a robbery, a plane crash and a decaying body that has been in the desert for some time and the mysterious call in the wind of death. Nothing is as it seems in this electric thriller set amongst ritual and superstition of the people of Arizona. Cast also includes Fred Ward, Gary Farmer, John Karlen."
