        "Eden is an old growth forest in the Mount Kosciusko region of N.S.W.'s South-East that is still being logged today. Benjamin Cruse, the narator and member of Eden Land Council, tells of the efforts being made to save the remainder of the forest from total devastation. An Aboriginal man whose ancestors belonged to the region, Cruz describes the logging companies attitude towards the land as being connected and the same to the attitude of the 'settlers' toward indigenous people. The Aboriginal relationship with the land in Australia is described as being the 'original human relationship', the land is where the spirit is born and returns to upon death."
