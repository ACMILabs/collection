        "Filmed in Melbourne, this docudrama consists of individual stories, poetry and performance by a cast of people who all share a similar disability of Acquired Brian Damage. In a population of 5.5 million, it is estimated that there will be 10,000 head injuries per year - 70% caused by road accidents, 40% between 17 and 25 years old, and two-thirds men and boys. Acquired Brain Damage can cause memory loss, fragmentation of thoughts, confusion and loss of co-ordination, but worse still, it can lead to difficulty in holding a job, alienation, loneliness, family and marital break-ups and suicide. Emphasis is put on rehabilitation and the self-help group called Headway where support and guidance is offered for those who are finding it difficult to fit back into \"normal\" society. This is a confronting story which questions social values and attitudes but contains an amazing depth of character and performance by the cast upon whose experiences this film is based. The film ends with a very important message: \"Head injury requires immediate action - Prevention, Rehabilitation, Support, Community Education\". Includes study notes. Cast includes Diane Redman-Heath (Anne), Dianne Cousland (Rosie) and Maurice Keating (Bernie). Poetry by Stanley Newbury and Maurice Keating. This has been a collaboration of the following student scriptwriters/directors: Fran Bosch, Sam Briggs, Joanne Hampton, Grant Hobson, Vicki Holmes, Miriam Krohn, Peter Lawrence, Roland Linssen, Ugo Mantelli, Mathew McRae, Debbi Rose and Vicki Toll."
