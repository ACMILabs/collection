        "This short humorous docu-drama centres around a foley artist/sound effects specialist, Jean-Pierre Lelong and his role in making a film. Infatuated with the main actress Lelong meddles with the tricks of his trade to become the saboteur in an attempt to prevent the hero from being united with the film's heroin. Gradually the film's direction shifts as a result of Lelong's work, but not with Lelong's intended results. No spoken word, sound effects only. Cast includes Sylvie Loeillet, Jean-Pierre Lelong and Bernard Bourdeix."
