        "This lively and inventive student short looks at how the lives of a group of workers and regular visitors of a busy laundromat change when a television enters their environment. TV drama starts to breed into everyday reality, not only inducing romance, desire and lust, but also commanding individuals' undivided attention despite more pressing concerns in the world of reality. Almost totally shot from the perspective of the TV screen itself, \"Here's looking at you kids\" is a comic and ironic reflection on the way television and the media in general can hypnotise audiences and shape our everyday reality. Despite occasional cliches, \"Here's looking at you kids\" has some good camerawork, an upbeat soundtrack and great production design."
