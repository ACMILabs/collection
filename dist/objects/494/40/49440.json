        "Based on the original story by Angela Carter from a collection of short stories called \"American ghosts and old world wonders\", this is an adaptation of what is most popularly known as the tale of Cinderella. Using cut-out animation and filmed on 35mm, Ashputtle tells the story of a mother who comes back from the grave to help her mistreated daughter. She enlists the help of a cow, a cat and a bird to restore her daughter's beauty and set the world right so that she might rest in peace. Voice-over by Linda Gibson and music by Amelia Barden."
