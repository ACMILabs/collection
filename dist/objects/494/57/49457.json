        "When Kazuko Hohki goes back to Tokyo with her avant-garde band, the 'Frank Chickens', after living in England for fifteen years, she decides to marry her boyfriend of ten years to please her mother. This wryly observed documentary records her re-experiencing of Japan after a long absence, examining traditional and contemporary attitudes to women and the unconventional lives of her friends. Focusing on Kazuko's mother and other women who have joined a religion known as 'The House of Development', which encourages feelings of self-confidence and individuality the film provides a fresh perspective on the lives of women in contemporary Japanese society. In Japanese with English subtitles."
