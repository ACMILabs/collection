        "A humorous short film. Rivka Hartman draws on the silent film aesthetic and borrows its stylistic tendencies to recreate a world full of slap-stick, fantasy and drama. Young Sally Shambles (Rivka Hartman) is a naive young lady whose readiness for love leads her into a number of predicaments with men, all unsuccessful. She daydreams about her prospects and potential loves, but just can't seem to get the method right. Written by Rivka Hartman."
