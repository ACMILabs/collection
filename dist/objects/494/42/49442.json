        "This short film asks us to consider the colours of Cuba: the variety of colours of the tobacco in their cigars; the multicultural array of colours of its people; the colours of socialism and the colours of the capitalists who are making it a tourist haven. Filmed largely in one of Havana's biggest cigar producing factories, this film is also a celebration of a revolutionary culture where workers and working life has not become exclusively mechanised and rationalised. A vibrant celebration of Cuba, workers, unionism and the much maligned tobacco leaf."
