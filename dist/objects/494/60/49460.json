        "Experimental narrative without dialogue using a mix of still images, animation and live action to describe alienation and encounters in a big city. Two characters walk, run and gaze across an industrial-looking street-end over which trains pass constantly. No motivation is given for their actions, nor is any definitive direction or conclusion reached. Rather, by a constant shifting of viewpoint and variation in the treatment of the images, the repeated actions focus the attention on movement itself, and on the barely perceptible changes that result."
