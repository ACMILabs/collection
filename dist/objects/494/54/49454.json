        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Survey (National Gallery of Victoria)\". Imants Tillers along with Peter Myers and Peter Rees use the example of Bankstown, New South Wales to discuss the constructed and artificial landscape in terms of Australian culture and the relationship between art making and suburbinisation. Bankstown is a town constructed on landfill. It epitomises and celebrates the 'height' of suburban aesthetic values. Tillers, Myers and Rees explore themes of the 'fulfilled suburban dream', the suburban 'visual' language, Australian Futurism in architecture. Bankstown is the quintessential Australian suburb in its exuberance to express and celebrate urban pride. Some interesting observations are made along the way. The houses are: locked within parameters of essential design elements, with identical floor plans and no fence lines that allow each house to sit like artwork on walls for display reinstituting the notion of 'promenade'.
