        "A short student film in which the filmmaker explores how the relationship with her father was transformed by the knowledge of his being a cross-dresser. Featuring interviews with her father and his transvestite friends, this work dispels many of the common preconceptions about cross-dressing and transvestitism while also being an engaging study of how families cope with aspects of individual difference and gender exploration."
