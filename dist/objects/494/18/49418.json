        "This instructional video produced by Australian First Aid shows us what to do in the event of an an unexpected cardiac arrest. The video demonstrates with eerie reality what happens in the absence of Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (C.P.R.) knowledge and demonstrates the difference made to a life when C.P.R. is performed. Mouth to mouth and chest compression both help to supply a constant supply of oxygen to a patient. Without oxygen, the dies dies after 2-3 minutes. A scary thought, but necessary to understand when placed within an emergency where every minute is vital. Following the DRABC method, this video shows us how we can avert a fatal situation."
