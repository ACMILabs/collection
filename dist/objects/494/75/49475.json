        "This aboriginal dreamtime story of The Greedy Frog is told using footage of Australian animals in the wild. Suitable for children the story tells of The Greedy Frog who drank all the water in the billabong leaving the plants and all the animals in the area without water. The koala wants to fix the situation and decides the solution is to make the frog laugh. After enlisting the help of all the other animals it is the Old Man Emu that finally saves the day."
