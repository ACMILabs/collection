        "Buried in the outer suburbs of Melbourne it appears many subcultures are alive and well. Just ask Bill Hudson (Ian Thomas), the pride of the town, who for the past three years won the coveted Burping Competition. Although great burps run in the family the daughter Jo (Alex Schepisi) struggles to be accepted as she is unable to burp. Made to feel an outcast she goes to great lengths to change her predicament and prove herself as worthy. Other cast members include: Marie-Theresa Byrne, Michael Gwynne, Stuart Baker, Morgan Evans and Renato Bartolomei."
