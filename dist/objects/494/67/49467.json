        "A compilation of 4 of Bruce Currie's dark and surrealistic experimental animations: Flank Breeder (7 mins), Anatomy of a Businessman (7 mins), One Potato Moor (6 mins) and Tar Baby (9 mins). Using the same crew and musicians (Even Orchestra), Currie digresses into dark and pessimistic urban vignettes that are anchored in base emotion: Flank Breeder shows a trapped mailbox living in the city too consumed with his tedious routine to be able to extract himself from his home to save an injured animal outside his door. Anatomy of a Businessman internalises the office politics and disillusionment. One Potato Moor finds a scarecrow (Bruce Currie) lamenting his miserable life whilst fending off a menacing pig (Paul Livingston aka Flacco) in order to survive. Life is really ugly when two men compete bitterly for the attentions of a woman in Tar Baby."
