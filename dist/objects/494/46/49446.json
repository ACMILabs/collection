        "From the Australian Film Commission's Micro Docs Series II, Bad by Design explores the designing and creative process of three Australian designers; Max Bannah (Animator), Elisabeth Watson-Brown (Architect) and Mimmo Cozzolino (Graphic Designer). They reveal their goals with their work and how they've made their unique vision and approach succeed. All are highly accomplished in their own right and give the viewer a glimpse of their motivations and creative outlook. Illustrative animations by Damien Ledwich based on the Designers are intermixed throughtout."
