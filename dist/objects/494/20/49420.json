        "Episode of Series \"The Painters, the sculptors: archival art series\". Roger Kemp is one of Australia's most important artists of the 20th Century. In this documentary Kemp seeks to describe his personal and intense creative vision. Not unlike a scientist in approach, Kemp is systematic, thorough and precise in his exploration in what he calls 'the mathematics of aesthetic'. He describes how his exploration is closely linked to music and the discovery of an abstract symbol. He goes on to describe his views on spirituality in art and how this always sits behind the motivation of creativity. In terms of music Kemp describes emotion and abstraction in painting as performing the function as an octave does in music."
