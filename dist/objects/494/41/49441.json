        "The 50's were a difficult political time in Australia, mostly due to the Cold War and sense of fear it generated within the community with suspicion directed at Unionists and Communists particularly. It was in this political climate of intolerance that the Union of Australian Women (UAW) was born. Set up primarily to address justice, equal rights and peace, the group were instrumental in specifically targeting: the women's right to vote; equal pay for equal work; the right to abortion; the right of women to have child care and the fight against conscription. This documentary gathers a group of the founding members of the UAW who share some amusing anecdotes and knowledge that make this oral history a pertinent study of Australia during a politically volatile period."
