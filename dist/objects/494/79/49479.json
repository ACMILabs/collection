        "A claymation (influenced by Jan Svankmejer in sepia tones and use of stop-still animated found objects and cut-tin figurines) depicts a storm ravaged landscape of an empire. The ruling giant, 'metal' Queen summons her miniature servants to find and rescue her giant clay King. Like ants the small servants work together to unite the King and Queen."
