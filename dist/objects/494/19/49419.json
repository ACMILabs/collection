        "Episode of Series \"The Painters, the sculptors: archival art series\". Sam Fullbrook enjoyed a high reputation in the Australian art world for his painting as a colourist and mastery of the science of light and colour in his painting. Well travelled throughout Australia 'teaming up' on jobs such as mustering, jackarooing, labouring and house painting in the 1920's-1950's Fullbrook talks of the influences to him as painter: the light in the landscape, the spiritually 'aristocratic ' nature of Aboriginal culture and house painting as one of the disciplines that he modelled his painting on. This documentary conversation with Fullbrook was taped over 17-18th December in Oakey, Queensland, 1985 and offers an insight to an artist living in Australia during very different times than today. As much as a portrait of the artist, this documentary offers as a primary source insights into a way of life unique to Australians during the depression and the post-war era."
