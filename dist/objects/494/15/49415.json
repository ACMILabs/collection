        "A delightful and pertinent animation about Darwin's evolutionary theory. Nicely punned, the human race has now been called. From the dinosaurs to present we get a graphic but comic explanation as to how we have arrived to today. As the race is battled out many species die along the way in the advent of disease and things such as technology, but If Darwin's Evolutionary Stakes' is right, it is only with \"a short hair and half a brain\" that we 'humans' make the photo finish. Written and performed by Patrick Burns."
