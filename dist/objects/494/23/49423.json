        "When Mr Sideburns (Morgan Evans) stumbles across a security camera tape from the casino which incriminates the Premier, he finds a variety of sources are eager to lay hands on the material. With a casual nod to the Hong Kong action genre, Deep Shit's momentum carries the viewer through such recognisable Melbourne locales as Parliament Station, Melbourne Central and Queen Victoria Market."
