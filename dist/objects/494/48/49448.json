        "The powerful and moving story of Eve van Grafthorst who died of AIDS at the age of 11 in November 1993. Born 3 months premature, Eve contracted HIV through a blood transfusion to save her life. This documentary is a tribute to an extraordinary child who was determined to tell her story, her perspective on life, death, love, friends, family, AIDS and God. The film includes archival footage and reflects Eve's constant battle against the disease, the prejudices associated with AIDS and of her constant drive to educate the public and support her friends with AIDS."
