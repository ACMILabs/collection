        "Set in Australia in the 1960's, \"Forget me not\" is a short drama about Anna (Alice Garner), a young Italo-Australian woman who is forced to abandon caring for her younger, intellectually disabled sister through the devious machinations of her widowed father. Examining grief, loss, and the deeply embedded patriarchal mores of mid-century Australia - in both the Italian and Anglo communities - this short film is an evocative period piece."
