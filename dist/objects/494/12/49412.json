        "The film starts when Anna (played by Kerry Fox) has called the police to arrest her defacto Serge (played by Raj Sidhu). The film explores their relationship and how the violent tendencies of Serge develop and worsen over time. The line has been crossed. What was frustration and anger has been revealed to be a pattern of violent behaviour. Anna observes this and decides to take action, albeit not soon enough."
