        "A biography of Ruth Cracknell, the renowned Australian actor whose career has spanned half a century. While her work encompasses all genres and mediums she is best known for her comic roles, especially that of Maggie Bear in the long running ABC television series 'Mother and Son'. In this documentary, interviews with various associates and friends focus on the eccentric elements of her work and her ability to juxtapose the tragic and the comic in her performances. Excerpts from 'Mother and Son', Beckett's play 'Happy Days', Elizabeth Jolley's short story 'Woman in a Lampshade, Oscar Wilde's play 'The Importance of Being Ernest' and Neil Simon's play 'Lost in Yonkers' are included."
