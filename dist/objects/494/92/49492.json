        "Director Michaela French uses 2-D animation, over-laying images and sound to create a narrative. A woman narrates over abstracted imagery relating her feelings of loss and grief, coming to terms with the death of a soul-mate in a recent car accident. What emerges is an exploration into grief itself. The narrator not only looks at her separation from her soul-mate, but asks questions about the change of her physical space as a result of their absence."
