        "Dick Smith is often regarded as an unofficial ambassador for Australia and his knowledge and love of this vast country makes for an informative, and yet visually stunning, documentary. His journey begins at Sydney Harbour in a helicopter and Dick Smith's intention is to fly from Sydney to the remote desert settlement of Birdsville, a trip over 1,000 miles in length. The film contains historical and descriptive commentary by Dick Smith, interviews, and some magnificent aerial photography of the Australian landscape, including Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the Darling River, Burke, kangaroos bounding across the desert, and various landmarks along the way to Birdsville."
