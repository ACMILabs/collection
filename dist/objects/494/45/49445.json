        "A young girl, Sally Roberts, transfixed by the violence portrayed on TV enthusiastically tunes into the 'Dance of Death', a TV game show. The 'Dance of Death' hosted by 'The Smiling Scull' is a show where the willing contestants compete to kill themselves in the most imaginative way possible. Turning back on TV for it's content the animation uses TV in this black comedy to critique the role of TV and effect it has on shaping our culture - with a focus on how too much violence desensitises it's audience allowing the audience to consent to their own victimisation. (Award: Best non-feature animation 1983 AFI Awards)"
