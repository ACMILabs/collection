        "Just released from a mental hospital for the 10th time, Aunty Nancy comes to stay with the relatives and our fearless narrator must vacate her room, again. Aunty Nancy can usually be tolerated, but only just. All that changes when she brings the easyplay - an electronic keyboard where she subjects them to a myriad of variations on \"Chopsticks\"."
