        "A boy travelling on a night bus is witness to the murders of other passengers, by a masked killer. \"Nightride\" condenses the conventions of a horror film into 11 minutes, climaxing with a terrifying confrontation between the boy and the killer. This excellent Australian student short has won numerous international and national film festival awards."
