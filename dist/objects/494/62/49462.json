        "The world is full of war and where can we hope to escape it? Home? - Certainly not by a stretch of this little computer animation. A lone kidney bean is being given the rough treatment by two much larger, bullying lima beans. In a number of fancy manoeuvres the kidney bean tricks the bullying two into believing they've killed him. When the kidney bean reaches his kin a battle of revenge is planned. The plan is foiled once ensconced in battle by the true ruler - he/she who cooks beans in the kitchen. The battle scenes are stylistically similar to and remniscent of the battle scenes in the paintings of Australian artist, John Bracks, where he used pencils and decks of cards symbolically and as structural elements to recreate battle scenes. No dialogue, sound effects only."
