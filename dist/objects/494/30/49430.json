        "Deb Filler, Sandy Gutman aka Austen Tayshus, and Moshe Waldoks are three Australian comedians who all share one thing in common - they are all children of survivors of the Holocaust. This documentary takes us into the lives of these three Jewish comedians who talk about their lives, their family, their Jewish identity and the impact of the Holocaust in their humour, their performances and their relationships. Includes interviews, excerpts from each of their many live performances, archival footage and footage from the Inaugural Australasian Holocaust Descendants Gathering (1993?)."
