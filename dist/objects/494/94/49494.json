        "A comical drama about a young man's search for sexual filfilment. Gary (John Howard) awkwardly obsesses over finding a girlfriend. He heads off to Sydney for a new job with many expectations, leaving his flatmate and those 'desperate vibes' behind. Unable to assert himself, Gary sabotages his dreams of sexual fulfillment by allowing a neurotic acquaintance (Joyce) from his desperate past to infiltrate and dominate his life. The director Richard Michalak offers a number of humorous asides playfully referencing the film-making process. When his dreams are shattered, Gary tries to sort out the mess and promptly delivers a script with the demand \"this is my story and I want an up ending\". Cast includes John Howard, Katrina Foster, Kate Fitzpatrick and Patrick Ward."
