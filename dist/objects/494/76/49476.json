        "A factual work that attempts to breath life into the biography of Frank Hardy by exploring his life through his pseudonym character, Ross Franklyn. Australian writer/novelist, Communist and eventual recluse after the death of his wife, Frank Hardy was a champion of the working class dedicated to writing about class outlook and human suffering. This unique documentary shows Frank Hardy talking of himself in the third person providing detective like clues that serve to inform the character, \"Ross Franklyn\". Capturing the mood of the time the documentary discusses such themes as; the Cold War; Communism; organised crime; and poverty in Melbourne. Cast includes: John F. Howard, Rhonda Wilson, Bruce Knappet, David Gray and Susie Fraser. Directed, written and edited by Daryl Dellora."
