        "This queer short film begins with two men in bed next to each other. The focus then shifts to the two men encountering each other in an elevator. As they shift in bed, or begin to make love in the lift, the film becomes a celebration of the body and movement: the erotics are a series of dances choreographed to an experimental music score. This is one of a number of short films directed by Stephen Cummins which integrate modern dance with film."
