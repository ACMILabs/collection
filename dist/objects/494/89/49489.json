        "Two elderly neighbours Elsie (Esme Melville) and Dora (Margaret Ricketts) are isolated by the limitations that their old age brings. Both are lonely but fail to strike up a friendship as personal obstacles like pride get in the way. Slowly, slowly, Elsie's determination breaks Dora's stubborn resistance and the two begin anew as friends. Written, directed and edited by Michaela French."
