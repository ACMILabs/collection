        "Australian Jewish theatre director Barrie Kosky talks about his personal background and how his Jewishness has influenced his somewhat confronting style of theatre production and direction in Australia. He founded the small Jewish theatre company, Gilgul and from there his creative ability and aspirations took him to directing operatic productions at the Sydney Opera House. Through Kosky, his friends, collaborators and family members, this powerful portrait reveals his relationship with his audience, the Australian theatrical establishment and his many and varied experiences including his time as Director of the Adelaide Festival. Shows scenes from some of his productions, including the earlier days of the Gilgul company. Contains some scenes in b&w."
