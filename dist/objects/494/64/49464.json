        "Fired from 1000 kilometers away, 39 scud missiles hit Israel during the Gulf War. Two people died as a result of direct hits. Twelve people died from related causes. Thousands of buildings were destroyed. For Israelis the impact of this war spread far beyond this... This documentary uncovers the personal feelings and stories of six ordinary Israelis as they reflect on their experiences during the Gulf War and their belief in the hatred towards Israel by the surrounding Arab States. It would appear that most Israelis want peace but do not agree on how to achieve this end - resigned to the fact that perhaps co-existence with the Palestinians is the only way. However, the Israelis have lived through many wars: War of Independence (1948); Suez crisis (1956); Six Day War (1967); Yom Kippur War (1973); Lebanon War (1982); and are determined not to back down from their fight to keep Israel as the rightful home for Jewish people. Contains strong images of the aftermath of the Gulf War, archival footage of the Holocaust and interviews."
