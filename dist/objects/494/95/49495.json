        "A closely observed portrait of a single man in his 40's who lives in St Kilda. Although he has none of the trappings of conventional existence, Kelvin's obsessive interest in Born Again Christianity, physical culture and recent German/Jewish history has given him a way of making sense of the world and led him to a number of people, friends through whom we see something of his life and beliefs. These friends include Anna and Max Wachtel, Neil Taylor, Egan and Margaret. The film was made between February 1983 and June 1987 in Melbourne. Camera: Brian McKenzie, Ray Argall."
