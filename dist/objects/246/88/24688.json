        "Gesture drawing is a technique that allows the artist to concentrate on movement, where details are often eliminated. The rhythm and flow of various kinds of movement and the appearance of movement in static objects are shown and then drawn in the gesture technique. The practice of gesture drawing promotes a freedom of expression that will enhance other, more finished kinds of artwork. Includes drawings by Rembrandt, Daumier, Dufy."
