        "Holography is a recently discovered new means of recording images on photographic film. The technique was first conceived by Dennis Gabor in the late 1940's. This film illustrates the basic principles of holography and some of the many optical effects possible with holography. Also considered is the value of holography as both a scientific tool and an artistic medium."
