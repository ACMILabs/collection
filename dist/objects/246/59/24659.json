        "Iceland's chief exports are fish and dairy products, while sheep and wool are produced for home consumption. Steam from geysers provides heating for the glasshouses where the fruit and vegetable supply is grown, and hot water from the same source is piped all over Iceland. The population of 150,000 enjoy a very high standard of living, child welfare and education being especially well provided fro. The film closes with a resume of Iceland's history and her role as a member of NATO."
