        "Once a great military power, as its many castles testify, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is now a highly developed modern society with flourishing industries and agriculture, liberal employment policies and a high standard of living and public education. Luxembourg's cooperation in the European coal and steel communities and the Benlux group is described in some detail. In 1948 her long period of neutrality was ended by joining NATO, and she is contributing a highly trained combat force, a large airport and an extended road system to the common effort."
