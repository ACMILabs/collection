        "Shows how the rudiments of map reading may be learned through a simple study of local geography. Two children arrive in the country and engage in an exploring game. Three flags placed in different parts of the village are marked on a map; each flag to be found with the assistance of the map and an aerial photograph. The instructional approach throughout the film is indirect and simple."
