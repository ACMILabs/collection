        "An album of animated characters from a zoo located on Mars. All the characters are created from a string of beads with various distinguishing features added, using normal animation techniques. The characters are creations of a highly imaginative mind and have a simple charm. Any resemblance to living creatures, either on Earth or Mars is purely co-incidental. Animation by Morton Goldsholl."
