        "This film looks at the creative process of painting as it is revealed in three individual painters. The three painters gather to look at a simple, traditional subject - a woman standing in a boat as the sun rises over the lake. From this we follow the individual creative process in each painter as he recreates the scene in his own imagination. Strikingly different in interpretation, each painting presents a valid statement of the artist's vision of reality. No dialogue, english titles. (An edited version of the film \"Interpretacle\".)"
