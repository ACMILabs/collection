        "A new female employee is told to do a job on the drill press; she is unable to do the job and is then shown how to do it; this does not have the desired effect and in distress she leaves the machine; the supervisor then takes more care over instructing the next young woman assigned to operate the machine, and she becomes a competent operator. Thus are the differences between telling, showing, and instructing demonstrated."
