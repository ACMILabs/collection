        "Life today in Norway's arctic country, with its seafaring tradition. Small isolated communities export fish and farm every arable acre even on steep slopes, harvesting during the short summer. Other natural resources include valuable timber and water for hydroelectric power used in many industries. Isolation and a harsh climate tend to make family ties strong. Many men serve in the Home Guard to supplement the strength of the regular troops along this part of NATO's defence line (of which Norway's border forms a third)."
