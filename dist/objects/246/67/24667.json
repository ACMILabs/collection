        "This film is designed to provide a background against which Shakespeare's life and ideas may be presented. Opens with scenes of Stratford and surrounding countryside, which formed the background to Shakespeare's early life and work. Elizabethan London is illustrated by details of Visscher's View of London of 1616. A full-scale model of an Elizabethan stage is shown and the use of the various acting areas described."
