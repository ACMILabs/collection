        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Man in the Making\". The relationship between animal mothers and their young is built up by a series of complex instinctive responses, and today some scientists see similar kinds of behaviour patterns in human mothers and babies. The first almost automatic smile of a baby may be a simple instinctive action which plays an important part in its development. Children reared in an institution tend to lapse into a state of withdrawal. Speakers include: Dr Mavis Gunther, Dr R.A. Hinde and Dr J.A. Ambrose."
