        "Episode of Series \"Advance Australia\". Made to foster an appreciation of the basic simple shapes in design. Poses the question \"What is design?\". Answers that design is simply an orderly arrangement of lines and shapes. Aboriginal art in its simplicity of design is drawn from nature - if you look up, down and around you will too. Simple motifs are used in everyday articles."
