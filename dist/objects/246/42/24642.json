        "This film reveals the origins of the Inca civilization through an exploration of what remains, and what has replaced it, in Peru today. The early history is traced through surveying old structures, and through old implements. Each of these facets reveals something of the level of thought of the Incas. Commentary: Andrew Faulds Suitable for upper secondary level."
