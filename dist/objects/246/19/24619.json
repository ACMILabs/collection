        "A film of a musical performance in which almost all the instruments of the symphony orchestra, plus others in current use today, are seen and heard in close-up. The music was composed by John Dankworth, who also conducts the orchestra and plays the saxophone. It has been ingeniously written, not only to give each instrument its moment of personal display, but to allow for frequent quieter moments during which a narration introduces the instruments and the techniques of the players."
