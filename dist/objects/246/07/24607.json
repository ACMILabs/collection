        "A fascinating \"Profile\" of a film director in which Anthony Asquith talks about his career going back to the days of the silent cinema; cutting, editing and finally directing; the setting up and shooting of a scene from a recent production; excerpts from his earlier works including \"Tell England\". Mastery of the art and a sympathetic understanding of players are essential for quality productions. Includes interviews with Dirk Bogarde, Olivia de Havilland and Paul Massey."
