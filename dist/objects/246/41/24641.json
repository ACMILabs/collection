        "Malcolm Muggeridge talks to American born film director Richard Lester about the experiences and influences that have affected his work and his decision to give up psychology for the cinema and the nature of filmmaking. His films include \"Running, Jumping, Standing Still\" nominated for an Academy Award and first prize at the San Francisco Film Festival; \"The Knack\" which won the Palm D'Or at Cannes; the Beatles films \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help\" which shared the Grand Prix in the Rio Festival. In addition he has written many songs and scripts and directed several hundred commercials. He also talks about the influence of his parents, and slapstick comedy and its appeal as a reaction to an ordered, mercantile society."
