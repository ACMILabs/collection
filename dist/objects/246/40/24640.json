        "A freewheeling cinematic experience, this film is the work of two Canadian filmmakers, Caroline Leaf and Veronica Soul who relate their perceptions of each other through their respective animation techniques. Images and words are paired in startling associations. Each does a visual portrait of the other, based on characteristic gestures and impressions. A combination of techniques and materials, including live action, animation, photographs and drawings, produces a film of rich visual texture shaped by the hands and heads of two very different people. (Awards: Varna; Montreal; Grand Prix winner of Melbourne Film Festival 1980.)"
