        "The time is 1953 and the place is the eastern Arctic. Beginning with a scene in an igloo showing the birth of Angotee to Atootoo, wife of the hunter Koonuk, this film follows the events of a man's growth from birth to maturity. During babyhood Angotee is secure in the protection of his mother. His childhood is free and happy as he plays games invented out of the skills he will need as a man. During adolescence he accompanies his father on the hunt and enters the company of men where he shoots his first seal. The story ends as Angotee leaves the parental igloo to set up his own abode as a family man and a hunter of the great snow-swept barrens. Awards: Durban; Trento; Toronto."
