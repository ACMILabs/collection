        "Emphasises the point that while we may love and assist wild life, we must remember that they are wild and belong in their native habitat. Pam and her parents live in Africa. Finding a sick baby elephant one day, Pam leads him home, nurses him back to health, and, reluctantly, returns him to his jungle home."
