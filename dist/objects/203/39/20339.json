        "Deals with the subject of depression, arguing that its symptoms are frequently overlooked. Illustrated with four examples: an overburdened salesman, a young mother unable to cope, a female factory worker with a repetitive job, and an older office worker whose symptoms are not recognised. Intended mainly for general practitioners. Written by Christine Netscher, photographed by Joe Ambor and edited by Ted Hunter. This film won the Silver Award (Category A) at the B.M.A film competition in 1966."
