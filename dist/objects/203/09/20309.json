        "A fable from Ghana, animated on film by a young African film-maker studying with the National Film Board. Ananse is a spider with a heart full of concern over the enmity existing between his friends. Instead of mediating in a straightforward way, he devises a scheme using a little deception to bring his friends to amicable terms. The moral of this folktale from Ghana is that employing the wrong means to an end brings undesired consequences, no matter how right the motive."
