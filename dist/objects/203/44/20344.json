        "High contrast film stock is used to give a silhouette effect. Music is by Leonard Cohen. This is a film about a young man, a girl and a dog in which the visuals are over exposed. The girl tries to fly with wings which are more symbolic than practical and the dog and young man make similar attempts. This film won awards at Columbus, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver."
