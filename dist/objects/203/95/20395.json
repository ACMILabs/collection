        "This animated fable points out the familiar moral that we can't play all the time but must work and save for a time of need. While all the ants labor industriously to provide for the coming winter, the grasshopper rests in the summer sun. But when winter comest, the grasshopper finds it difficult to live and it is the ants turn to sing and play. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
