        "By sight, sound and movement, animals communicate fear, presence, interest, alarm and many other aspects of behaviour. A wide range of examples from courtship displays among birds, to the social life of prairie dogs and the intricate actions of bees and ants illustrate role of communication in animal life and survival.
