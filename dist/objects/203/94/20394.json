        "This film brings to light important aspects of the period when the child begins to ask questions. Our answers to their questions go far toward shaping their development as participants in our democratic society. How we answer these questions, therefore, is of vital importance. The film dramatizes true-to-life situations in which youngsters meet with positive or negative attitudes toward their questions and suggests the resulting effects on their personalities."
