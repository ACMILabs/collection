        "The contributions of the Sumerians, Semites, Babylonians and Assyrians who occupied the Tigris-Euphrates Valley are depicted against authentic locales that include Babylon, Ur and Nineveh. These people were first to use the arch and the wheel. They developed a code of laws, a system of writing and military science - all of which have become a part of Western civilization. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
