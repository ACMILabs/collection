        "Documents the 1999 Melbourne Fringe Festival Parade and the Fringe Furniture Exhibition, including interviews with Virginia Hyam, Fringe Director, and Axel, Fringe Furniture Co-ordinator. The Melbourne Fringe Festival has become an institution since its inception in 1982 when a small group of independent artists gathered together to create a platform to present new and independent art to the community. From those early beginnings the Melbourne-based festival now attracts interstate and international guests and covers a wide variety of arts performances including outdoor events such as the Annual Parade in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, the Annual Waiter's Race, street-theatre and live bands and indoor events including comedy and cabaret, music and theatre. The Fringe Furniture Exhibition allows for young students and designers an opportunity to show-off their creative ability and caters for non-mainstream pieces. Crazy, outrageous, quirky and even occasionally practical, the Exhibition contains an amazing selection of eclectic pieces as witnessed in this documentary program. Reporters: Melissa Iaria and Phillip Taylor."
