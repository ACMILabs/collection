        "Through the process of consciousness raising, women develop new expectations for themselves and a sense of self-worth. The process is marked by an understanding of the ways in which society teaches women to assume passive roles in directing their own lives. In asserting themselves for the first time, many women experience fears and conflicts about the future of women as members of society."
