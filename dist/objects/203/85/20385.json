        "A film for food handlers of all kinds. A warning against the risks of food infection through neglect of the simple rules of hygiene. A food handler, suffering from poisoning is questioned by a doctor. The man recapitulates the events which led up to his illness. The film points out, by looking at the various locations he visited where food was handled, how he may have been infected due to dirty utensils, and unhealthy habits on the parts of cooks and food servers."
