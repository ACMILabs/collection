        "The story of Egypt from the prehistoric period to the time of the Ptolemies. The beginnings of monumental art are shown at Sakkara, the funeral temple and the step pyramid. The glories of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids, the Sphinx at Giza, and the artistry of the Middle Kingdom are illustrated in detail. Creations of the great Pharoahs are presented; the temples of Karnak and Luxor, the Colossi of Abu Simbel, and the treasures of the city of Akhenaten and the tomb of Tutankhamen. Scenes painted on temple walls showing the life of the ancient Egyptians are included."
