        "Angkor - a whole metropolis of palaces and temples recovered from the jungle which hid them for centuries until discovered in 1860 by a French naturalist. Monuments, picture tapestries in stone and Angkor Vat, a mile square temple of grey sandstone which no other church has rivalled in size, reveal the glories of the past empire of the Khmers, ancestors of the Cambodians."
