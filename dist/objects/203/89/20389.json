        "A fascinating look at developments that aim to protect and conserve Canada's vast forest reserves. Some of the experiments shown, both in laboratories and in the field include turning a Newfoundland bog into woodland, propagating British Columbia seedlings to withstand mechanical planting, inoculating Ontario elms against bark beetle and devising ways to control fire."
