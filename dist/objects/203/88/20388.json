        "Episode of Series \"The Facts Are These\". Opens with groups of people enjoying a social evening in a pub and using alcohol sensibly. An animated sequence follows which corrects commonly held misconceptions about alcohol and details its effects on the brain and the senses. The work of a hospital Alcoholism Treatment Unit is detailed and a psychiatrist explains the stages in the treatment of alcoholics admitted to the Unit and we look in on a group undergoing treatment. The important role of organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous and regional councils on alcoholism is stressed."
