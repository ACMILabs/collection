        "Hollywood actor, James Stewart, narrates the story of five people leaving for work in the morning. None of these people are reckless drivers, but we know in advance that one of them will die on the road that day. When one fails to return at evening, we know he is the victim of a road accident. This film is a dramatic lesson in traffic law observance. An epilogue provides relevance to Australian road safety statistics for the time."
