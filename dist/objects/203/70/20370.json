        "This film is a simple ecological study of animals whose structure and habits enable them to live on rocky shores both above and below the low-tide mark. The following animals are seen: the common starfish, brittle star, sea urchin, sea stickleback and gobies, the swimming crab, the whelk, the hermit crab (seen climbing into a shell), sea anenomes, polyp clava, and the sea-aquirt ciona. Between tide-marks on the exposed rock surface, mussels, limpets, winkles, and acorn barnacles are seen. The whole series of animals is related to problems of life on the rocky shore."
