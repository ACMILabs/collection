    "description": [
        "Access News Greatest Hits 2000 (Part 1 of 2) SKA TV's Access News is a grass-roots alternative to mainstream news and current affairs, broadcast weekly on Melbourne's Community Television station Channel 31 since 1994. Giving light to perspectives or issues otherwise not seen, stories range from front-line coverage of anti-globalisation protests to satirical critiques of commercial media. 'Greatest Hits 2000' is a compilation of 15 of Access News's best stories from the year 2000. Highlights from part 1: Violence is Violence : Hundreds of Sydney residents take over the streets to protest car-dominated public space and offer a vision of urban sustainability. Their celebration is met with a brutal police response. Fire Water Earth : The world's largest uranium mine is located at Roxby Downs in South Australia. It is owned by multinational mining corporation WMC and is built on Arabunna and Kokotha land. This story follows the nuclear trail from an occupation of a WMC borefield by Arabunna elder Kevin Buzzacott and his supporters to a daring mission by videoactivists into the heart of WMC headquarters in Melbourne, surprising the boss himself."
