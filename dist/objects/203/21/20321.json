Considers three spheres in which the Egyptian civilization has contributed to Western culture; the development of agriculture, and the idea of community living; discoveries in the arts and sciences such as the use of mud bricks and the use of a calendar; the evolution of religion through the Egyptian practice of polytheism. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
