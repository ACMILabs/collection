        "Global Insights 4 is a compilation of short video works of a subversive political nature, sourced from videoactivists, cultural saboteurs and 'serious' documentary-makers from around the world. Pieces featured include an alternative US response to the incidents of September 11 2001, made by Indymedia NYC soon after the event; scenes from the front line of the democracy struggle in Malaysia. A remarkable sequence of (unarmed) indigenous peasants in Mexico taking over an army base; a Korean perspective on the rise of the new global economic orthodoxy and the resistance to it; the 'no borders' movement in Europe and Australia against the deportation and detention of refugees. Adverts peppered throughout the program are actually 'subverts' - biting satirical 30-second statements about consumerism, gender, sexuality and possibilities for reshaping the world. Producers of this form range from disaffected advertisers to teenagers with an ironic message about climate change. The Global Insights videos have seen hundreds of free public screenings from Tamil Nadu to Antarctica - inspiring grass-roots people's action and fostering an independent and accessible screen culture globally. Global Insights is put together on a miniscule budget by volunteers. It is a collaboration between hundreds of independent media makers around the world."
