        "An allegory of the creation of the world, of man's enslavement by the machine, motivated by Greed, which is personified as an enormous and menacing spider. It is eventually overthrown by the intervention of Goodness, but not before atomic warfare has resulted. The Foldes made the film at home, drawing all 32,000 pictures, and showed the 16mm result to Sir Alexander Korda, who had it blown up to 35mm for theatrical release. No other credits available."
