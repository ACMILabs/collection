        "A demonstration, for junior science classes, of what fish are, how they live, breathe, swim and, more remarkable, how they float up or down by manipulating their air bladder. The fish shown in the film are of the kind native to Canada's lakes and streams, but others, of the tropical variety, are observed in the miniature marine world of a classroom aquarium. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
