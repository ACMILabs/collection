        "Puppies and piglets, a colt and a kangaroo, opossums, woodchuck, snakes, fish, birds, tadpoles and caterpillars illustrate how animals are born, and the stages they undergo as they develop. Important life science concepts include the extent of care given by the mother, feeding habits of the young, and that while some may not look like their parents at birth, all grow up to resemble them. Suitable for primary school level."
