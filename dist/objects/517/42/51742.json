        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for and broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew Mackenzie, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant-garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew takes us to the RMIT Gallery where an exhibition by political/journalist cartoonists is taking place. This is then followed by a visit to The Photographers' Gallery; the Penthouse and Pavement \"Graveyard Boys and Cemetery Girls\" Exhibition (horror culture); Gertrude Street Galleries \"Angled 2002\" Exhibition by Natasha Johns-Messenger; West Space \"Suburban myth\" Exhibition and finally an interview with video artist Robin Hely."
