        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for and broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew Mackenzie, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant-garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew focuses on the 2002 Melbourne Art Fair which is held at the Royal Exhibition Buildings every two years. The Art Fair is a trading place for artists, galleries, collectors and lovers of art and not only features local artists and galleries but also includes international exhibitors from the US, UK, China, and New Zealand. The program features several interviews by Andrew including William Nuttall (Niagara Galleries), Brian Wallace (Red Gate Gallery, Beijing), Stuart Purves, Bronwyn Johnson, Christopher Hodges (Art Fair Board members), Anna Schwartz (Anna Schwartz Gallery), Martin Browne (Cohan Leslie and Browne, New York), and Alexie Glass (ACMI). Also includes examples of art works available for sale at the Fair."
