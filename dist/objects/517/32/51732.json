        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". Bond is approached by a crime boss to marry his widowed daughter, Tracy, after hearing of the good deeds that Bond has demonstrated in saving his suicidal child. The father offers one million pounds, Bond asks for the location of Ernst Blofeld (Telly Savalas), head of SPECTRE in return. Disguised as a (kilted) genealogist with the College of Arms, Bond travels to Blofeld's Alpine residence to discuss investigation into whether Blofeld is a legitimate count. Once there, Bond stumbles across a bizarre scene in which he dines with a room containing a bevy of beautiful women eating only one type of food. This is part of their treatment at Blofeld's allergy treatment clinic that also includes late night brain-washing. The clinic is a sinister front - Blofeld is planning a bacteriological war. Features a car rally on ice with Diana Rigg in the driver's seat, and plenty of down hill skiing and other snow-related action. In a departure from most Bond films, Bond (George Lazenby in his only performance as 007) actually falls for the girl, confessing his love and proposing, surviving a brief but ultimately tragic marriage."
