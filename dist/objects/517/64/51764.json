        "This story of one of the world's most intriguing ancient civilizations - the Aztecs - begins in the 14th century in the Valley of Mexico. The Aztecs were a highly evolved society, literate, cultural and amazingly adaptable to what was a fairly inhospitable environment. They were able to transform the landscape to suit their needs and to build their temples and houses. But they were also a civilization consumed with mythological beliefs inextricably linked to nature and the seasons and these beliefs required offerings and sacrifices to the Gods, human sacrifices, to ensure the continuation of life. However their fate was not sealed by the Gods, but by the conquering Spanish Conquistadors 200 years later. This historical portrayal is told through re-enactments; ancient drawings, stoneworks, sculptures and architecture; computer animation; and interviews with Carlos Fuentas (Writer), David Carrasco (Historian of Religions), Richard Townsend (Art historian), and others including archaeologists and academics. Also contains some spectacular photographic footage of many of the sacred sites, including the remains of the Great Pyramids and the ancient cities of Tenochtitlan and Teotihuaca, along with images of Mexico City as it is today - the old world and the new world living side by side as the Aztec legacy continues on. Presented by Dr Tony Spawforth."
