        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for and broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The programs style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode: 'Find and Artist'. Second stop is 'Tampa' at Conical Gallery. MacKenzie talks with one of the directors Adrien Allen about how the gallery uniquely directs its programming around work that responds to or utilises the architecture of the gallery's internal space; A street talk with Collingwood Gallery reveals a burgeoning off-the-street market for artwork; 'Outskirts' T-Shirt Shop shows off its range of small-run and artist-made t-shirts; Cameron Potts (also member of musical band Ninety-nine) talks about his recent photographic exhibition at Found Project Space that draws together his photographic images from the Sahara Desert, Afganistan, Pakistan, Egypt and India; Sue Pavlovich at 4 Cats Gallery. Screen Talk this week hosts the video show at Uplands Gallery. Video artists include: Steven Honegger (Suspect devices), Daniel Von Sturmer and Meri Blazevski (Suspension of belief), Matthew Griffin (All eyes on Amin) and Anthony Hunt with his alphabetical digital composition."
