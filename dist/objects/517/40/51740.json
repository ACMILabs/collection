        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The programs style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode the roving presenter Andrew MacKenzie provides a glimpse into a hectic week in the Melbourne art scene. Melbourne Fashion Week hosts a number of exhibitions around Melbourne. Interviewed are: Lyndal Jones (Australia's representative at the 2000 Venice Biennale), from Munich the collaborative 'Chicks On Speed' present work at Westspace, Akira Isogawa has his first solo exhibition at RMIT showcasing his passionate exploration of textiles and Peter Robertson explores through photographs the uniquely Melbourne 'Sharpies' sub-culture of the 1970's. A culture that unlike the 'Skins' blended style with thuggery whilst even having a dance style all to their own. Also featured are: Local graffiti artists in Flinders Lane, 'Exploration 3' at Flinders Lane Gallery and Bus Gallery also get a look in. Louise Hubbard is interviewed"
