        "Based on Marvel Comics more dark super hero franchise, \"Blade II\" chronicles the adventures of a half human, half vampire (Wesley Snipes) who diligently protects humans from the seething vampire underworld. Mexican horror director Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's backbone, Cronos) has fashioned a faithful sequel which delves deeper into the vampire mythology set up in the first film while maintaining the series penchant for blood soaked martial arts action. Set in Prague (its gothic buildings and ancient cobblestoned streets make this a fitting location for a vampire movie), \"Blade II\"'s action takes off when a new breed of vampires are discovered, the Deadly Reapers. These nasty nightcrawlers not only feed on humans but are not impartial to vampire blood as well. This causes the worried vampire fraternity (known as the Shadow Council) to form an uneasy alliance with arch-enemy Blade and his gruff side-kick Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Together they must hunt down and destroy the rapidly spreading reapers before they eliminate all the vampires and take over the human race. Cast includes: Luke Goss, Ron Perlman, Leonor Varela, Norman Reedus."
