        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie continues his 'find an artist' segment and in record time finds at the Victoria Market, John Karatzus, a local Melbourne designer and painter, and co-founder of Bus Gallery. At VCA, German artist Jochen Kuhn in the exhibition 'Animated film' talks about the process of painting for animation and the act of 'killing' his painting to create an animation that explores process and ideas in flux. Octopus at Gertrude Contemporary Art Space, a group show curated by Charlotte Day, brings together examples of emerging and established artists who exemplify contemporary approaches to painting. Includes artists: Nadine Christensen, Shaun Gladwell, David Griggs ('Death Rated G', 'It Ain't All That Waiko'), Simon Horsburgh ('Mumma, I Don't Ever Want To Learn How To Speak'), Sally Mannell, Sarah Ryan, and Andrea Tu. Screetalk takes a closer look at the video work of artist Sally Mannell. Discussed with excerpts are the works 'Little by little suddenly', 'Skirmish', and 'Take Cover'."
