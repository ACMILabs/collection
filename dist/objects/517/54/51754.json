        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Melbourne City Council invites artists to respond to the recent environmental 'Real Conference' held in Johannassburg. Artists Louise Lavarack and Briele Hansen talk about the collaborative process specifically in regards to their project that utilises the generic plastic shopping bag. At George Paton Gallery, Sharnie Shield exhibits malleable tectohedronic forms exploring spacial possibilities of geometry. Ken Wong curates the annual Gasworks Arts Inc. artists show \"Out of the Dark\". Jeff Wassman and Jamieson Miller are interviewed. Screentalk this week presents the film and projection work of artist Briele Hansen. Her work explores water in its various states (ocean, raindrops) as a metaphor for passage, transition and the human connection to the world. Excerpts are shown from works: 'Fluid connection' and 'Here'."
