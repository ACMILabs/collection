        "Thunderball is the fourth Bond film with Sean Connery playing British secret service agent 007, pitting his stylish form against the espionage organisation SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), with Emilio Largo at the helm. SPECTRE plans to hijack a nuclear bomb, plant it under the sea, and then hold the world for ransom. Set in the Bahamas, \"Thunderball\" provides plenty of lush scenery with spectacular beaches, sprawling mansions and beautiful women in bathing costumes. The under water setting allows for some spectacular ideas and elaborate set pieces. Typical Bond touches include a myriad of one liners and nubile lady friends including a masseuse; Largo's mistress; a British spy; and an enemy agent. Highlights include a Mardi Gras sequence with James evading capture due to a frenetic, chaotic moment. Other fine moments are the irascible Q displaying Bond's latest gadgets whilst whingeing about being dragged to the Bahamas in order to do so. Re-made in 1993 as \"Never say never again.\""
