        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". Featuring the longest pre credit sequence in the Bond franchise, \"The World is not enough\" has more than one fiendish villain and a start including a knife throwing sniper, a brief interlude, then an extended powerboat chase on the Thames followed by a hot air balloon. British oil tycoon Sir Robert King is killed via a booby trap at MI6 by a terrorist, thought to be Renard the Anarchist (Robert Carlyle) - an ex KGB agent whose only goal is to create chaos. His claim to fame is a bullet permanently lodged in his head, killing off his senses as well as any feeling of pain, effectively making him super-human. Renard was also responsible for the kidnapping of King's daughter Elektra (Sophie Marceau) and Bond is sent to protect her and to find the traitor on staff. A ploy is uncovered to steal an atomic missile and use it for sabotage. Nuclear scientist Dr Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) assists Bond is the retrieval process, as well as providing Bond with another potential conquest. Notorious for being the last film in which Q (Desmond Llewelyn) appears, we also see a more humanised M (Judi Dench) and a dazzling array of inventive chase sequences."
