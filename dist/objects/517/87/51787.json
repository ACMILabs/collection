        "1960s British animated television series set in 2065, about a family and their associates combating various dangers with a mix of technology and intelligence. Using marionettes, \"Thunderbirds\" made impressive use of supermarionation - a puppetry technique that used fine wires and electronics to move the puppets' lips. John, Virgil, Scott, Gordon and Alan Tracy are brothers who combat danger using their numerous spacecrafts, working for International Rescue, helmed by their father Jeff. Brains, Lady Penelope, Parker, Kyrano and Tin-Tin ably assist the family on their missions. Four episodes from the show are: \"The Uninvited\": Scott is forced down in the desert by a mysterious force. When he is captured along with two archaeologists, they must fight to escape. \"The Mighty atom\": The Hood is back - and after stealing 'The Mighty Atom', tries to programme the robot rat to take photographs of the Thunderbirds, in order to undermine their operation. \"The Vault of death\": A helpless man trapped inside the Bank of England vault is set to die unless the team from International Rescue, aided by Parker and Lady Penelope, can devise a nifty way to save him. \"Operation crash dive\": When two airliners crash into the Atlantic, International Rescue must investigate the mysterious circumstances. Wonderfully inventive television, suitable for children."
