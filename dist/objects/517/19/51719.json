        "Episode number 7 of Series \"This life\". 'When the dope comes in' (dir. Harry Bradbeer, wri. Amelia Bullmore): Ferdy gets a good deal on some dope from Spain and Miles swears off the stuff - initially. O'Donnell invites Milly to a conference in Paris. When she refuses, Rachel gets to go. Ferdy receives a visit from the police and a stoned Egg is interviewed. 'She's gotta get it' (dir. Harry Bradbeer, wri. Amelia Bullmore): Anna's tenancy is up for the vote and Miles is in favour of the negative. Kira organises for Ferdy to go out for drinks with a mate but the night goes badly. Miles' father introduces him to his young fiancee and Kira sets about seducing Jo. 'The Plumber always rings twice' (dir. Harry Bradbeer, wri. Eirene Houston): There's a shortage of hot water in the flat and a nice looking young plumber comes to fix it. Egg makes preparations for the Mexican night and Miles attends a wedding. 'Wish you were queer' (dir. Sallie Aprahamian, wri. Annie Caulfield): Anna discovers Miles voted against her and seeks a sympathetic ear with lesbian friend Sarah. It's Mexican night at the cafe and there's free tequila for all."
