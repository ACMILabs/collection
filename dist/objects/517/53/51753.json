        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie and Lena Corner present: 'Focus 4' at Fortyfivedownstairs, a collaborative project curated by Stephanie Glickman and Michael Sibel exploring the relationship of inter-disciplinary practise between dancer and artist. Performers and artists include; Benjamin Guaci and Louise Ripp, Naree Vachananda and Anna Fin, Nicholas Mansfield and Andrea Meadows. The winner of the 2002-2004 Contempora Fellowship, Alex Danko, is announced by Victorian Arts Minister Mary Delahunty at the National Gallery of Victoria, Federation Square. Danko discusses broadly his approach to his practice and we're given a tour of the architecture of the gallery on the eve of its opening. Jenny Port and Kim Wall talk about Red Gallery with exhibition by Doyle and Neil Malone \"Home and Contents\". Larissa Hjorth curates \"Gloss\" at CCP and Sutton Gallery, an exhibition exploring cultural exchange between Japanese and Australian artists. Martine Corompt critiques popular culture with her eerie pop song and video, vocals by Kaoru Motomiya. Candy Factory present the results of their universal foray into soap opera sets. Screen Talk includes the performance, video work of Saki Satom that explores the 'personal' that lies invisible within public spaces."
