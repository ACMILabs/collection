        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". The greatest spy in history, Sir James Bond, has long since retired. The stuttering super spy now content with his garden and afternoons of classical music. His legend has lived on with his namesakes populating the continent, only of late, 11 of them have disappeared under dubious circumstances. Sir James (David Niven) is reluctantly brought out of retirement after the demise of M (John Huston) and faces fierce opposition in the form of an army of beautiful women but manages to make it back to MI5. Once there, he implements an anti-female spy device but he too is captured by SMERSH. A further measure includes naming all spies, including the girls, James Bond 007, to throw the opposition off the scent. Bond blackmails the beautiful Vesper Lynd (Bond regular Ursula Andress) to use her feminine wiles on Baccarat champion Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers) to defeat Le Chiffre (Orson Welles) who is bankrolling the activities of SMERSH. Notable cameos include Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond, James' neurotic nephew lost in the Caribbean and Deborah Kerr as French spy Mimi. Whilst based on an Ian Fleming novel, \"Casino royale\" was the only Bond novel not sold to Eon Productions and it was deemed that the only film to rival a true Bond film was a parody. The effect was met with mixed reviews and the film does suffer from having five directors at the helm. However, scenes involving Peter Sellers are particularly entertaining. Soundtrack by Burt Bacharach."
