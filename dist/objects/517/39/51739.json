        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie is there for the announcement of the winner to the second Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award at Werribee Park. At Gammaspace, an art auction to raise funds for the Easter protests at Woomera is covered and at the Centre for Contemporary Photography (CCP) the witty and playful collaborators Nat and Ali present their work the 'Art Bar'. A performance/installation piece that explores celebrity, art politics, art and the alcoholic muse."
