        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for and broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew Mackenzie, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant-garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew investigates ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image) at Federation Square three weeks before its opening. Not only is the functionality and architecture discussed of ACMI's new home, but Andrew, through interviews with Victoria Lyn and Alessio Cavallaro, also discovers ACMI's history and its expanded role in the future world of the moving image through its innovative upcoming programs such as \"Deep Space\" and \"Pathways\". This is followed by an in depth look at the \"Kiss my Art\" public program, a collaboration between shop traders and artists, curated by Antonia Chaffey. Shows interviews with Lissa Watt (artist - Club-X), Anne-Marie Power (artist - Franco Cozzo), Robyn Carretti, Roland Smith (video artist) and finishes off with a piece by video artist Angus Wyatt called \"Success\" from the \"(trans)actions/(plat)forms for alterity\" Exhibition at the Gertrude Contemporary Art Space."
