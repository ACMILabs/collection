        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Lena Corner interviews Sue Wyers in her studio and talks about the 'honoured object' and 'domains of defiance', themes related to Wyers' work. Rod Quantock is the talking head at Span Galleries opening of the 'Artful Dodgers' revealing the Xena photographs as his favourite. RMIT gallery opens its retrospective of internationally renowned German artist, Gerhard Richter. The exhibition surveys forty years of Richter's work using examples that identify 'touchstones' for the artist as selected by Richter himself. The works explore the fluid line between the abstract and figurative and use process both as a means and an end. The exhibition at Westspace Gating\" is a group show exploring sound technologies. Featured are the works by Michael Graeve, Simon Kilvert (Decent Column), Rhino Lintz and Mark Fusinato (2' 30\"). Screen Talk this week features Leslie Eastman whose work is concerned with exploring themes such as; language and time, the objectivity of language and its phenomenon versus conditional experience."
