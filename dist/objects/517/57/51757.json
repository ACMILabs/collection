        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie opens the program with the paintings of artist Tony Clark on exhibition at Anna Schwartz gallery. Clark's work explores the representation of landscape within a historical and cultural context articulating the ritualisation of cultural motifs. Anna Schwartz talks openly with MacKenzie about her curatorial philosophy and gallery practise. Level 11 Gallery, shows the drawings of Asa Letourneau. At Cube 37, Frankston Arts Centre, 'Eternity', celebrates the cultural diversity of the graffiti artist as a matured aesthetic and practice. At Bus, Phil Edwards looks at redundant culture in \"Not Building\". Natascha Frisch and Kate Cotching collaborate using the paper medium to describe place and time. Screen Talk visits the Wednesday night screening at Croft Institute and shows the video of Mandy Morgan, 'Placelike'."
