        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. First stop for Andrew MacKenzie in this episode is 80 Gold Street, a gallery run by director Ellie Young that focuses on photography made by using alternative processes. Interviewed is artist John P. Pollard who discusses the Gum Bichromate process discovered by Poitenin in 1855. Zara Stanhope curates \"Release\", an exhibition of New Zealand photography. Interviewed are artists Fiona Amundsen, Ann Shelton and Anne Noble. Mikala Dwyer exhibits \"Gap Filler\" at Uplands talking about spontaneity, her 'Up Paintings', serious play and nail polish. Kate Beynon shows her work at First Floor and Screen Talk focuses on the animator Michael Pablo."
