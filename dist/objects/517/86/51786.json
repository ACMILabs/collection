        "1960s British animated television series set in 2065, about a family and their associates combating various dangers with a mix of technology and intelligence. Using marionettes, \"Thunderbirds\" made impressive use of supermarionation - a puppetry technique that used fine wires and electronics to move the puppets' lips. John, Virgil, Scott, Gordon and Alan Tracy are brothers who combat danger using their numerous spacecrafts, working for International Rescue, helmed by their father Jeff. Brains, Lady Penelope, Parker, Kyrano and Tin-Tin ably assist the family on their missions. Four episodes from the show are: \"Trapped in the sky\": Arch-enemy The Hood places an explosive device aboard an aircraft in order to photograph Thunderbirds craft. \"Pit of peril\": A revolutionary mobile unit used by the Army goes haywire and the ingenious Brains battles to right the vehicle and save the lives of those on board. \"City of fire\": When a fire breaks out in a space age shopping mall, Scott and Virgil try to save one trapped family from certain death. \"Sun probe\": A research ship loses its way and is headed for a collision course with the sun. Alan and Scott are called upon to right its trajectory, in a daring rescue mission. Wonderfully inventive television, suitable for children."
