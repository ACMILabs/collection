        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". Starting with an impressive sequence involving a small plane and a closing hangar, \"Octopussy\" also crosses the countries of East Berlin and Delhi and culminates in a train sequence then a big top. When an agent is found dead in East Berlin clutching a Faberge egg, British intelligence is alerted to the flurry of fake Faberges on the market from an unknown source - possibly Russian (alarm bells ring). The mission is code-named Operation Treasure Trove; Secret agent 007 (Roger Moore) placed in charge of proceedings. His mission takes him to Delhi in pursuit of exiled Indian Prince Kamal Khan (Louis Jordan), suspected owner of the Faberge eggs. He is not the top of the chain however, that honour lies with the mysterious Octopussy (Maud Adams), head of a floating harem of acrobatic women who have joined her sisterhood as a way of life, and agreed to taking part in smuggling jewellery and the circus Octopussy is running. Highlights include a snake charming agent, a hair raising tuk tuk ride, a jungle chase complete with elephants, tigers, snakes and a leech, death by circular saw, and the sight of Roger Moore in a clown suit."
