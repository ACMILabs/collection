        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Lena Corner rounds up the mood of the Next Wave Festival opening to then look at the collaborative community project from the program 'Moving Along' and the performance of 'The Angels' who took up residency on Melbourne's State Theatre spire for a ten day period whilst doing performances on the spire over that time. 'Neo Noir' curated by Mark Feary opens at Gertrude Contemporary Art Space with artists; Sharon Goodwin, Matthew Griffin, Amanda Marburg, Kate Just, Sarah Lynch, Camilla Hannan, Van Sowerwine. Three works at CCP are investigated; 'Play With Me', 'Skin Club' and 'Solid Estate'. This week's Screen Talk features the work 'Human machine landscape' by Simon Price and Simon Terrill shown at Fortyfivedownstairs."
