        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Changing stages\". Theatre, film director and BBC Governor, Richard Eyre was invited to write and present a series for the BBC about the history of theatre in the 20th century. He chose to write the book first and base his TV series on that book (Changing stages). This is that series - consisting of six episodes exploring the very existence of theatre in today's multi-media techno world. The question is asked whether the art of \"live\" performance can survive, an art which relies on the present tense, the here and now as it is being performed, where illusion can become reality and the audience can use its imagination and interaction with the performers on stage. \"All aspects of our life are recorded...theatre is the most human of all art forms\" (Richard Eyre). The first episode begins with William Shakespeare - his plays, his influence not only throughout Britain but world-wide, the theatres in which his plays have been performed over the centuries, and the many and varied adaptations of his writings on stage and in film, including excerpts from the films \"Shakespeare in love\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\" and theatre productions \"Othello\" (Royal Shakespeare Company, 1999) and \"Macbeth\" (1979), proving Shakespeare's longevity and adaptability to modern times. Richard Eyre is passionate about the subject of theatre and through his enthusiasm and entertaining anecdotes, excerpts, stills, archival footage and interviews with renowned actors, directors and playwrights including Ian McKellen, Judi Dench, Baz Luhrmann, Tom Stoppard, Arthur Miller, Peter Brook, Peter Hall, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Laurence Olivier, among others, the viewer is given an insight and an appreciation of Britain's national icon and best-known playwright. Contains some b&w footage. Written and presented by Richard Eyre. For more information see www.pbs.org/wnet/changingstages."
