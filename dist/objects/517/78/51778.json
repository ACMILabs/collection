        "Claude Jutra (1930-1986) was an innovative Quebecois filmmaker who made some of Canadian cinema's best known films including \"Mon Oncle Antoine\", \"A Chairy tale\", \"A Tout prende\", \"WOW\" and \"Kamouraska\". Paule Baillargeon; actress, director and friend; contemplates Jutra's creative genius, his commitment to furthering French-Candian cultural identity, and his frustrated and difficult career. Through interviews with friends (including Bernardo Bertolucci and Saul Rubinek), film excerpts and extensive footage of the filmmaker himself, Jutra emerges as a sensitive, passionate man who gave his life completely to cinema. Faced with the decline of his faculties due to the onset of Alzheimer's Disease, he took the decision to end his life aged 56. Some French with English subtitles."
