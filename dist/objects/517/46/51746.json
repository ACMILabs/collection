        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for and broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie and co-presenter Lena Corner roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode: Firstly at RMIT Project Space is the group exhibition by artists Peta Clancy, Sylvia Kranawetvogl, Erik Hable and James Cecil called \"Body Manufacture\", an exhibition in response to the 1974 discovery in geneology of the chromosome. The exhibition seeks to explore the 'sexing' of scientific imagery and the publics' relationship to images of the intangible and abstract. At Mira Gallery, James Meldrum talks about his practice and 'letting go..' and the NGV hosts another year of 'Top Arts', an exhibition of Victoria's top art folio's submitted by Year 12 VCE students. Screen Talk this episode focuses on Media Art Graduate work: Joel Zika's 'In the woods' is a sombre abstraction with a soundscape that brings our ears close to the ground with elements reminiscent of Len Lye's kinetic metal sculptures. Anne Perri's 'The Erotica shakes me' is a play on the banality of neon signs and the desire to construct meaning. 'On the way home' by Isobel and Jeremy digitally constructs silhoutted imagery in a style made famous by Lotte Reiniger."
