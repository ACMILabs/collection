        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie interviews Juliana Enberg, director of the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (ACCA) at the opening of it's new building at Southbank and inaugural exhibition by Susan Norrie 'A History of Happiness'. The American artist Steve Keene exhibits his latest work at Linden gallery with the claim as being 'the most prolific artist in America'. His work pokes fun at the age of \"mechanical\" reproduction and technologically driven work. Sandra Bridie, artist in residence at Tower Studio discusses her project '6 Contextual Modules' and discusses her ongoing solo practise where Bridie presents herself as a multiple of fictional artists. Dominic Lococo discusses F4, a new multi-media space. Screen Talk: Brendan Lee discusses \"Projekt\", the first quarterly journal in VHS format and presents excerpts including 'Test' by Sanja Pahoki, 'The Bong Relay Business' by TV Moore and 'Container' by Stephen Honeggar and Anthony Hunt."
