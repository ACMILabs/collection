        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie deviates from the program's usual format to incorporate an in-depth interview with English artist, art critic, writer and television producer, Matthew Collings on the eve of his Australian lecture tour, 2002. Collings provides a refreshing and challenging outlook on contemporary art and provides contextual observation on contemporary art values and practice. Collings is best known for the BBC series 'This is Modern Art' and his book 'Crazy Nation' amongst others. Screen Talk this week looks at the work of Geneine Honey and includes an interview with excerpts from 'Young Sad Love' and 'Don't Go Out Walking'."
