        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". Touted as a possible replacement to the outgoing original Bond - Sean Connery - Timothy Dalton gave way to Roger Moore because he thought he looked too young for the role and didn't appear until 14 years later in \"The Living daylights\". Marking a more brutal instalment than usual, the film starts with a game of paintball gone wrong then moves to Czechoslovakia where Bond is entrusted with protecting the life of defecting former KGB agent Georgi Koskov (Jeroen Krabbe) who is being targeted by a sniper. When the sniper turns out to be a beautiful blonde cellist, Bond is content to wing her and pursue her later for further information. Safely back in the UK, Koskov is kidnapped and disappears, but not before he tells British Intelligence of a plot by fellow KGB agent General Leonid Pushkin (John Rhys-Davies) to assassinate British and American agents in a bid to start a nuclear war. 007 is ordered to carry out the termination issued against Pushkin, based on evidence which he considers dubious. When the name of an American arms dealer is mentioned, the plot thickens. Notable scenes include a particularly grisly death by automatic door and tobogganing on a cello case. It was also the last Bond film to use one of Ian Fleming's original story titles. Cast also includes Maryam D'Abo, Joe Don Baker and Art Malik."
