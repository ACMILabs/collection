    "description": [
        "All inhabitants of mining ship Red Dwarf perish in a radiation leak, except for Dave Lister, safely secluded in suspended animation during the incident, revived years later with companions Rimmer (a hologram of a dead crew member) and Cat (an incarnation of his pregnant cat). All occurs under the watchful eye of the ship's computer, talking head Holly. According to the official \"Red Dwarf\" website, the series is BBC2's longest running and highest rating sit-com. A film is due for completion in September 2003. \"Confidence & paranoia\": Lister contracts mutated pneumonia and suffers from weird hallucinations that come to life as raining herrings, a combustible Warsaw mayor and two beings who are manifestations of Rimmer's confidence and paranoia. High on his list is being reunited with a holographic projection of navigation officer Kochanski. \"Waiting for god\": Holly notices an unidentifiable object - a pod - on the radar. When the alien capsule is safely landed on the Red Dwarf, Rimmer is convinced it contains the remains of an ancient warrior, only Holly and Lister know the \"dirty\" truth. Lister is convinced he is a god and king to the race of cats. \"ME2\": Rimmer's complaint that Lister is holding him back from a fulfilling life provokes him into creating a more worthy companion: a duplicate hologram of himself. There's only room for one Rimmer on the ship however, one of them has to go. Cast includes: Chris Barrie, Craig Charles, Danny John-Jules, Norman Lovett. Episodes written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor."
