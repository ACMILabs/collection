        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. Andrew MacKenzie in this episode introduces the annual Experimenta exhibition held at Southgate, 'Prototype'. Artists in the exhibition include: Stephen Barras (Op Shop), Richard Brown (Mimetic Starfish), Jane Crappsley, Chris Henschke, Isobel Knowles, Hama Marriott, Ben Morieson (Burnout 2001 - Part 1 - The game), Iain Mott, Marc Raszewski, Jim Sosnin, Bruce Mowson (Flesh Antenna), Simon Morton, Martin Walch, Amy Youngs, Christopher Mether, Elizabeth Vander Zaag. Screen Talk looks at the video work of Kate Just who discusses her motivations, comic relief and the spontaneous nature of her work. Excerpts of video work include: 'Home alone', 'Marsha', 'Needle exchange' and 'Beat bag baby'."
