        "1960s British animated television series set in 2065, about a family and their associates combating various dangers with a mix of technology and intelligence. Using marionettes, \"Thunderbirds\" made impressive use of supermarionation - a puppetry technique that used fine wires and electronics to move the puppets' lips. John, Virgil, Scott, Gordon and Alan Tracy are brothers who combat danger using their numerous spacecrafts, working for International Rescue, helmed by their father Jeff. Brains, Lady Penelope, Parker, Kyrano and Tin-Tin ably assist the family on their missions. Four episodes from the show are: \"The Brink of disaster\": Jeff, Brains and Tin-Tin must think quickly to save themselves and the others onboard, when caught on a perilous monorail journey. \"Perils of Penelope\": When Lady Penelope is kidnapped she is set to die unless an eminent scientist reveals his secrets to the enemy. Virgil and Gordon battle to free her. \"Terror in New York City\": When the Empire State Building is moved to a new site, several men are trapped in a cave-in. Brains combats the odds and a massive tidal wave. \"End of the road\": When a family friend is stranded on a cliff, the Tracy boys band together to rescue him."
