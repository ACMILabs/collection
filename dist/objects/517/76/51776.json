    "description": [
        "This tape features the pilot show for the series, \"The End\", in which bickering room mates and co-maintenance workers Rimmer and Lister are the sole survivors of the mining ship Red Dwarf after it suffers severe radiation, thanks to an incorrectly sealed drive plate courtesy of Rimmer. Joining the human Lister and hologram Rimmer, are computer Holly and Rimmer's cat who has now come to life. \"Future echoes\": The Red Dwarf breaks the light barrier and Holly is having trouble navigating. Cat's having trouble narrowing down the number of suits he can take into stasis in preparation, and Lister and Rimmer are subjected to future echoes - visions of what lies ahead. \"Balance of power\": Lister reminisces about Saturday nights gone past carousing with fellow crew members. He threatens to pass the officer's exam so that Rimmer will no longer wield power over him and give himself the authority to achieve everything he desires; cigarettes and a holographic Kochanski. Cast includes: Chris Barrie, Craig Charles, Danny John-Jules, Norman Lovett. Episodes written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. According to the official \"Red Dwarf\" website, the series is BBC2's longest running and highest rating sit-com. A film is due for completion in September 2003."
