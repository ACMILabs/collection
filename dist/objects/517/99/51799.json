        "A haunting tale of magic and mysticism set in an age of enchantment and adventure. Navarre (Rutger Hauer) and Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) are two lovers, condemned to spend eternity together - yet never to touch, due to the spell of that the corrupt Bishop Aquila has placed upon them. Aided by the young renegade thief, \"Phillipe the mouse\" (Matthew Broderick) and defrocked priest, Imperius (Leo McKern), they must find a moment in time when night and day are one - a time when evil will consume itself and the spell will be broken."
