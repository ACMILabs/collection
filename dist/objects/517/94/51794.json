        "Join the Wiggles and friends Wags the Dog, Henry the Octopus and Captain Feathersword as they head out on a special day at Wiggle Bay. Their plans appear to be ruined however when Captain Feathersword forgets to tie up the boat and it drifts out to sea - fortunately the Wiggles are able to amuse themselves with sand castles, fishing, spending time with Henry's friend Magdalena the Mermaid, barbecuing, rolling down hills, and of course singing and dancing. All works out well and the Wiggles get a special shell call from King Neptune."
