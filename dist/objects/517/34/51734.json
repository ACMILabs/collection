        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". With a pre-title sequence involving impressive Arctic down hill skiing cum snowboarding (complete with a Beach Boys track), \"A View to a kill\" marks the final appearance of Roger Moore as Secret Agent 007. When the body of 003 is found concealed beneath the ice, he has in his possession a precious microchip - one impervious to the magnetic force of a nuclear explosion. What's special about the chip however is that the KGB chip is a perfect replica of one designed in the West by Zorin Industries; someone has been leaking secrets to the Soviets. Head of the industry is Frenchman Max Zorin (a fiendish Christopher Walken who revels in his villainous persona), ably assisted by his right hand \"man\" May Day (Grace Jones). Zorin's plan is to take a stranglehold of the International microchip cartel by ridding himself of rival manufacturers - mainly contained within California's Silicone Valley - thanks to a series of strategically placed explosions along the San Andreas Fault. James goes after Zorin in a trans-continental journey from England to France then America where the film climaxes in a blimp over the Golden Gate Bridge. Notable action sequences include an Eiffel Tower chase, a deadly car wash, a competitive steeplechase and a fiery elevator and fire engine. Tanya Roberts stars as Bond girl seismologist Stacey Sutton."
