        "This documentary - an Australian/French co-production - examines Internet based civil action and protests, and the individuals who invent and co-ordinate such exploits. Known as hacktivists, the intention of these protestors is to disrupt business, such as e-commerce and prevent websites from operating effectively. The hacktivists (who range across the globe) are principally concerned with globalisation and capitalism. Their perception is that they are modern dissidents whose activities sit alongside, even boost and support, traditional forms of street protest. In this documentary, several hacktivists are interviewed, discussing their aims, politics and methodology, which may include bombarding companies with emails or performing cyber sit-ins, immobilising a website. These activities are not only effective but also pose a danger to big corporations with net-based trade. There are also interviews with the Canadian police and a cyber expert employed by companies to anticipate and undermine hacktivist activities. One mission of online activism is to explain the philosophy to ordinary people and encourage them to take part. Electro-hippies (as they are known) believe that electronic forms of protest will become even more effective as their methods improve and e-commerce expands. The war looks set to continue."
