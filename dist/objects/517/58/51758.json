        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. This episode first up visits Jawbone Wetlands Nature Reserve to look at the source of inspiration of Caroline Oxley's exhibition of paintings 'Return To Jawbone', exhibited at Fitzroy Gallery. Kathy Temin in 'Kylie Night' explores her ongoing fascination with the pop-princess-phenomenon of Kylie Minogue and the culture of identity fetishism. Collaborators Christos Linou and Robert Mangion interweave the disciplines of performance, visual arts and film making to perform and exhibit the third part of their series of work 'The Act Of Being Inside Out' at Mass Gallery and the County Court in Melbourne. Curated by Stuart Koop at Monash University Museum of Art is the group show 'Gulliver's Travels' that seeks to explore the recent popularity of model making and the miniature in Australian art. The exhibition includes: Craige Andre, Matt Calvert, Richard Giblett, Callum Morton, Louise Paramor, Ricky Swallow and Tim Silver. Screen Talk shows an excerpt from 'S-Crash' by Lindsay Cox and Victor Holder."
