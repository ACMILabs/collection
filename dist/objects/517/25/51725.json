        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". The happy nuptials of James' CIA buddy Felix Leiter (David Hedison) and bride-to-be Della are rudely interrupted when they embark on a mercy dash to capture drug lord Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi). Thanks to some aerial fishing though, their mission is successful and the parachuting groomsmen make it in time for the wedding. The happy couple are soon devastated however when Sanchez escapes and kills the bride and maims the groom as payback. This triggers best buddy James (Timothy Dalton) to relinquish his secret service status and licence to kill authority (Bond is under orders to complete another mission) as he embarks on a personal vendetta to revenge Sanchez's brutality towards his friends. Ably assisted by ex-Army pilot Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell), Bond flies into Isthmus City to infiltrate himself into Sanchez's posse where he discovers a television evangelist (Wayne Newton) providing a front for cocaine dealing. Featuring a plethora of water inspired stunts earlier on in the film, the cast also includes Benicio Del Toro as a brooding henchman and Talisa Soto as Lupe Lamore, Sanchez's mistress, eye candy, and source of jealousy for Bouvier. This was Timothy Dalton's last appearance as Bond."
