        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode, Andrew MacKenzie presents a show of his favourite bits from the first series. This includes: The opening of the Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Prize, 'Neo Noir' at Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces, 'Art Bites' community project in Parkdale, 'Comic Book Lifestyle' Linden St Kilda Centre for Contemporary Arts, Sticky - the comic book shop and James Meldrum at Mira Gallery."
