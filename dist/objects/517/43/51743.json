        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for and broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie walks us through \"Comic Book Lifestyle\" an exhibition as part of the Next Wave Festival at Linden St. Kilda Contemporary Centre for Art that explores the burgeoning underground scene of comics, zine and counter-culture. Irene Sutton is interviewed after the opening of painting exhibition by Rosslynd Piggott at her gallery. Lucy Orta's large-scale community project \"Fluid Architecture\" is launched at the Drill Hall. David Rozetski is featured as this week's video artist."
