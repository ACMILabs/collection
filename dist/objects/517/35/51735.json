        "James Bond (Roger Moore) goes sci-fi in \"Moonraker\", sourcing a missing space shuttle that has vanished in transit. A survey of the crash site reveals no evidence of the Moonraker; hijacking is the only explanation. Heading to California, Bond makes contact with billionaire Hugh Drax (Michael Lonsdale), head of Drax Industries and creator of the shuttle, as well NASA scientist and CIA Agent Dr Holly Goodhead (Lois Charles). Their paths cross again in Venice where Bond discovers a highly toxic nerve gas created from a rare orchid. The film culminates at a space station where a show down takes place with the megalomaniac Drax, intent on inflicting mass genocide and beginning a super race of perfect human specimens created in his image. Highlights include a centrifuge simulator, lethal Dobermans, a gondola chase, an out of control cable car and the return of the deadly steel-toothed killer, Jaws (Richard Kiel)."
