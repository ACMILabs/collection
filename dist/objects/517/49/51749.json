        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Lena Corner interviews Luke Sinclair and Anya Latham about their evolving autobiographical (and collaborative) set of installations at Platform. Melbourne City Councils 'Laneways Project' is launched with the work of David Williams and Carol Porter whose collaborative public work looks at the Chinese role in the Melbourne community by exploring the history of the Chen family, early Melbourne settlers. Andrew Stevens talks about his not-for-profit art space in Footscray, 'Shopfront'. John-Paul Hussey performs his critically reviewed autobiographical one-man show 'The Chocolate Monkey' at Gammaspace. Screen Talk this week looks at the video work of Starlie Gieki whose work centres around themes of victimhood and the image of women."
