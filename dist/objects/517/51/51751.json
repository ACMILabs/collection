        "Episode number 14 of Series \"Public hangings\". Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie introduces a packed program. Tim Danko curates at Westspace \"Paper Skin - Constructed Guts\" an exhibition of the work of thirty contemporary local and overseas comic book producers/artists. Brendan Tolley, Kirrily Schell and Cassandra Tytler are a few of the artists. Nat & Ali provide more comic relief with their lived-in performance on opening night. At Linden St Kilda Contemporary Arts is 'High Tide', a photographic exhibition by contemporary indigenous artists looking at the landscape. Curated by Christian Thompson the artists include; Destiny Deacon, Brenda Croft, Michael Riley, Jenny Fraser, Jason Hampton and Dianne Jones. An excerpt of Michael Riley's film 'Empire' is included with music by Anthony Parthos performed by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (first screened on ABC 2000). At Ian Potter Museum of Art 'It's a Beautiful Day' opens. An exhibition exploring the gamut of contemporary painting that includes the work of Peter Booth, Brent Harris, Vivien Shark le Wit, Anne Wallace and David Jolly to name a few. Curated by Bala Starr."
