        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program's style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie continues his \"find an artist series\" and heads off to Sunshine to discover the art of tattooing. In Glen Iris Sally Miller and Stephen Oakes present 'Stakes and Ladders', a collaborative exhibition that explores the cultural history of Vietnam. At Lab X 'The Picture Show' is presented. A group show coordinated by David Marks that explores the link between cinema and photography - exhibitors include: David Marks, Natascha Stellmach ('Beyond Bollywood'), Lex Middleton, Gary Hillberg and Lawrence Johnstone. Johnstone's work 'All About Eve' explores the processes involved in the construction of a film that remain either invisible or unused. This week's Screen Talk looks at Gary Hillberg's \"compilation\" tapes with excerpts from: 'Shadows', 'Mirrors', 'Smoking', and 'Last Dance'. His body of work explores the relationship between the 'home viewer' and their private collected cinematic memories using low-tech editing techniques."
