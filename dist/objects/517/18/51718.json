        "A cult classic, set in a small American town, \"Blue Velvet\" is a disturbing, sensuous mystery concerning four very different individuals - Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini), the haunting cabaret singer with a dark and deadly secret; Sandy (Laura Dern), the detective's daughter, who embodies the innocence in all of us; Jeffrey (Kyle McLachlan), the naive college student with a penchant for mysteries, and finally, Frank (Dennis Hopper), the psychotic killer fuelled by his own sexual fantasies."
