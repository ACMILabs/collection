        "Born in a circus, Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) is a killer for hire, an ex KGB assassin and the man with the golden gun. When MI5 receives a signature Scaramanga bullet with 007 on it, Bond (Roger Moore) is sent on an undercover mission to locate the man with a million dollar fee. After retrieving a gold bullet from the midriff of an Israeli belly dancer, Bond leaves for the exotic city of Macau where he makes contact with Portuguese weapons expert, Lazar. An assassination attempt reveals that the real target was a missing energy expert who created the Solex Agitator - an energy converter capable of harnessing the sun's radiation. Ably assisted by Goodnight (Britt Ekland), Bond also finds time to woo Scaramanga's mistress, Andrea Anders (Maud Adams, who would later appear with Roger Moore in Octopussy). Highlights include James taking on sumo wrestlers and karate experts, a lengthy boat and car chase and impressive use of a fake nipple. The film culminates in a chamber-of-horrors showdown, with red-lit, mirrors and optical illusions and a voiceover by Scaramanga's short statured sidekick, Nick Nack (Fantasy Islands Herve Villechaiz). Shot across various exotic locations, the film was criticized for 007s uncharacteristic misogyny against his female counterparts."
