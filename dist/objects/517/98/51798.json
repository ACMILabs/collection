        "Based upon the novel by Stephen King, this film is the story of a young girl who is ostracized at school because of her 'weird' mother and upbringing. At the onset of puberty, Carrie White (played eerily by Sissy Spacek) discovers that she has special telekinetic powers that seem to become stronger when she is angered. She is finally pushed into a no return path of bloody vengeance on her cruel classmates. Piper Laurie contributes a memorable performance as the deranged Mrs. White, Carrie's mother. Directed by a master of suspense and in the vein of Alfred Hitchcock, this film is an excellent example of tense and stylish horror. Cast also includes John Travolta, Amy Irving and Nancy Allen."
