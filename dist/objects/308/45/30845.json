        "In the first eight days in December, 1979, over 2000 people from all over the New Hebrides travelled to Vila, the capital, to take part in the first National Arts Festival, covering a wide range of cultural activities. The Festival was arranged to help foster interest in the 'old ways' and try to unite the people through their rich culture. Pidgin dialogue, subtitled in English."
