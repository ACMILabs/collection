        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Australian Art\". The Australian artist has no greater challenge than his own landscape, but few have been completely successful in depicting it. Using both the artists' words and their work, this film studies Sir Russell Drysdale, Tom Roberts and Sir Hans Heysen, and shows why and how they have transmuted landscape into art."
