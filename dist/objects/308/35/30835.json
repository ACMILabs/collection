        "China has a long history in bridge building, but the cross curved arch bridge or the \"double spandrel bridge\" is a new breakthrough in the history of China's bridge construction. Easy, quick and inexpensive to build, and full of national characteristics, it economises on materials and facilitates transport and communications. Shows the development and construction of some of China's 1,200 double spandrel bridges. In English with Chinese and English subtitles."
