        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Child Care and Development\". Coming up to the age of two, children are really beginning to assert their independence and this can often lead to a clash of will with their parents. The film looks at a wide range of different incidents involving children of this age and viewers are asked to decide what they would do if they were the parents."
