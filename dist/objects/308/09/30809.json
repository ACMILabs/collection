        "Shows how the Yuzen-Kimono is made in Kyoto. We follow the process from the designing and making of the wide variety of beautiful hand painted materials, the hand sewing of the traditional kimonos and finally the wearing of them by children and women of all ages on special occasions in the ancient city of Kyoto. Without commentary - music only with English intertitles."
