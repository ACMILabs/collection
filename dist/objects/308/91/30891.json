        "Described by its maker as an art film about art, 'One Weft Double Cloth' explores the work of three Australian artist through a progression of film images. It shows in direct visual terms the inter-relationship between the artists, their craft, and their environment. The work of blacksmith Marcus Skipper, weaver Mona Hessing and potter Peter Travis is seen through a poetic overlay of images in which is seen simultaneously the artist, the emerging artefact and the creator's eye symbolising the preconceived goal to which he or she is working. The film itself reflects the craftsmanship of Larry Wyner who manipulated up to eight separate film images in creating the necessary optical effects. Complementing and supporting Wyner's work is an original music score by Les Dempsey."
