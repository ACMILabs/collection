        "Episode of Series \"Cities\". Studs Terkel, a resident of Chicago since his childhood, proudly displays the city and its 'ethnic parade'. The 'parade' takes us on a view of Picasso's statue, of Louis Sullivan's skyscrapers, on a ride on the 'El' and a visit to the 'Loop'. Terkel also takes us to the Chicago River, the Art Institute, Lincoln Park, Maxwell Street and finally, into the ethnic areas decorated by proud people."
