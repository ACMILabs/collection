        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". A look at what part robots play in the world today and what research into robot technology is likely to produce in the future. Present day (1970s) robots are used in industry to perform a wide range of tasks considered unsuitable for people because they are dangerous, dirty, or monotonous. They are still fairly simple, with primitive \"brains\", but recent research into robot technology could make them far more flexible. Narrated by Paul Vaughan."
