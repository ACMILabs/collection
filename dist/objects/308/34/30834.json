        "Outlines how to conduct effective staff selection interviews. John Cleese portrays the managers, Ethel the Unready, Ivan the Terrible and William the Silent who show the common mistakes of lack of preparation, failure to encourage the candidate to talk openly and relevantly and failing to introduce direct and probing questions. Norman Bowler demonstrates the correct interview techniques."
