        "A look at the diversity of customs, traditions and religions of Fiji. Some of them have remained virtually unchanged, like the Hindu religious ritual of fire walking, or the Kava Ceremony. Others have been adapted or modified by western influences such as the Polynesian wedding, or a Fijian funeral service. Narrated by Peter Gwynne."
