        "Episode of Series \"Background for Social Studies\". Designed to stimulate young children's interest in reading stories about animals that can be seen in a zoo. These animals are compared with the character found in storybooks, such as tigers in \"Little Black Sambo\", deer in \"Bambi\" and bears in \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\". The film concludes with an invitation to the children to make up their own story based on the character \"Bubble the Elephant\"."
