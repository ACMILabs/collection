        "In 1979, the Festival of the Eleven Powers took place on the island of Bali. The festival is called into being every 100 years to mark the closing of the Balinese century and re-establish the balance of the positive and negative forces in the world. Over two million people took part in the sixty days of purification and religious fervour. Script by Bryce Courtenay and narrated by Orson Welles."
