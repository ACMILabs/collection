        "A film made by six Diploma of Education students (Bob Sharples, Kamal Monsour, Sally Ford, Derek Burrage, Denis Connolly and Doug Eastman) about the problem migrant adolescents face in Australia. Through group discussions between Italian immigrants, Greek immigrants and first generation immigrant children, a real portrayal of the frustration of immigrant teenagers growing up in Australia is shown. Also gives a brief background history of Greek/Italian migration in the 1960's and 1970's from an economical/political point of view."
