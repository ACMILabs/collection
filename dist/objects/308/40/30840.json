        "Episode of Series \"Sentinel\". As Australian oil reserves recede, many scientists are turning to the sun for a solution in the looming energy crisis. In Australia, scientists employed by the Department of Defence have been encouraged by their research in a revolutionary form of oil - solar oil. The oil is obtained from a freshwater green alga (Botryococcus) which has the ability to store hydrocarbons direct from sunlight. Its special properties makes the alga an unusual subject of the plant world, and a possible key to energy alternatives. Photography by Phil Hobson, sound by Ron Townsend and narrated by Roger Newcombe."
