        "Episode of Series \"Sentinel\". The last great cavalry charge in history, at Beersheba (Israel) in 1917, by the AIF Light Horse, is still celebrated today. The charge is regarded as an achievement in the history of the 12/16 Hunter River Lancers, based at Tamworth in New South Wales. The unit, comprising Army Reservists, has strong traditions spanning a period of almost one hundred years. The regiment celebrates the charge annually with a formal dinner. The traditions of the 12/16 HRL are upheld by an active Regimental Association formed by veterans of past campaigns. Because of the keen interest in horsemanship displayed by the veterans, many of the Army Reservists in the regiment have taken to learning the skills associated with Light Horse cavalry. Commentary by Peter Gwynne, cinematography by Phil Hobson."
