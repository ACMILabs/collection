        "Paddington is one of Sydney's oldest suburbs, which has developed somewhat along the lines of New York's Greenwich Village or London's Chelsea and has become Sydney's artist colony. This is a fully dramatised film, which captures the essence of Paddington, not only by striking visuals of the Old-Sydney architecture in the area, but by re-enacting the mood and lifestyle of some typical, bohemian inhabitants. Scripted by Joan Long. Music by Grahame Bond and Rory O'Donaghue. Starring Ross Thompson, Janne Wesley and Ron Blanchard."
