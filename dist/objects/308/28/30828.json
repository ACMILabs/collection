        "An experiment in modern creative dancing in which a mime of self discovery is expressed in body movements with accompanying sounds. As the movements express awakening, thought and feeling, the sounds change from sounds of nature to marching feet and atomic explosions. Dance: Suzanne Rivest. Camera: Francois Seguillon. Sound arrangement: Maurice Blackburn."
