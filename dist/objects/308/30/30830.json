        "Cod fish have been caught and processed for export along the coast of Newfoundland for the past four centuries. This film traces the growth of industry and shows the present day methods of handling this harvest from the seas. At the height of seasons, fishermen and their families labour from dawn to dusk hauling in and preserving the catch. The work of splitting, salting, drying and grading is shown, and concluding reference is made to the more recent quick freeze method."
