        "After World War II Yugoslavia faced a task of reconstruction. In 1951 the Government requested the United Nations for assistance through its Technical Assistance Program so that modern methods could be introduced into agriculture. Parts of the reconstruction plan included the speeding up on industrial development by having instructors come from other countries to Yugoslavia to train workers. Health Campaigns have also been organised with the help of the World Health Organisation."
