        "A nostalgic essay on one of the majestic but now retired C38 class steam locomotives filmed on one of its final journeys from Sydney to a series of country railway stations. The film opens with a 1943 Cinesound newsreel depicting the track trials of the first of the C38 engines. The original soundtrack provides the only commentary."
