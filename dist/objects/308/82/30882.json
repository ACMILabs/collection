        "Episode of Series \"Our Asian neighbours: Indonesia\". A simple explanatory film on the well-known Indonesian Gamelan Gong, using the Tunjuk Orchestra. Each instrument is explained and demonstrated, then the orchestra plays a piece from the Ramayana Ballet Suite. This was \"written\" in the 1950's and is based on traditional tunes. An excellent introduction to this music, quite strange and exciting to Western ears."
