        "Perhaps due to its fascinating past and equally astonishing present, the Victorian gold rush town of Ballarat catches the quintessence of Victorian Australia - the curious old homes; the old tramcars; the coffee palace; the Cobb & Co office; the gardens and the people. No narration. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
