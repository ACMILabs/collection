        "Man, it seems, has long craved to fly as the birds fly, silently propelled only by the forces of nature. Some get towed aloft in large gliders; others, like flying men harnessed to flimsy wings, launch themselves from wind swept cliff tops. Icarus is a view of both forms of the gliding sport in which the viewer gains the same sense of freedom, of elevation above the problems of the earthbound as do the men who choose to gain recreation in this exciting way. No spoken commentary."
