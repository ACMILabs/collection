        "In this first-person story, a boy recalls the death of a pet. His father, his teacher, and the pet-shop owner are unable to help his sick turtle, and it dies. This story creates an opportunity for discussion of the inevitability of death and the continuity of life. Adapted from the Little Owl book."
