        "Excerpts from old and more recent feature films are used to illustrate how these pictures appeal to every member of the family and enable each to identify himself with the characters on the screen. Offered adventure, a family accepts seats at a theatre - Father becomes the hero of a baseball team, the little boy a cowboy, and mother swoons in Valentino's arms. The family are ambushed by Indians and freed by stampeding elephants among other adventures."
