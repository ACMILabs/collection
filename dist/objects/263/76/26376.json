        "The young son of a prairie farmer, against considerable opposition, achieves his ambition--a musical education. Andrew's father fears that a musician in the family may affect the future of the farm, and tries to discourage the boy's attachment to his trombone. On Andrew's side are his mother, his teacher and a neighbour, while the farm animals patiently serve as his rehearsal audience. Perseverance wins him a place among the contestants in the annual provincial music festival, and the encouraging words of the adjudicator help sway his father to acceptance of the boy's music."
