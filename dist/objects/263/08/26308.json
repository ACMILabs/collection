        "A drama on the crisis in the Australian rural economy in the early 1970s. Created from a variety of true case histories, the film tells the story of a family faced with near bankruptcy after several seasons of drought and falling prices - and the prospect of moving to the city and a new way of life. Director of Photography: Dean Semler."
