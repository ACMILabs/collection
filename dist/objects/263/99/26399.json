        "Produced to demonstrate to wool growers the best method of spreading the virus disease, Myxomatosis, among rabbits. The film surveys the extensive damage to pastures due to rabbit infestation and shows how the pest may be eradicated by the disease, fatal to rabbits, but harmless to farm animals and human beings. Recommended methods of spreading the disease are demonstrated; infection of healthy animals by the swab and inoculation methods; exposure of infected animal to mosquitoes; the spread of disease among the rabbit population of a district."
