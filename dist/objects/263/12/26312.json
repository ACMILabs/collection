        "The film traces the development of Mozart's music at different periods in his life by showing the people and places which probably influenced his music; the house in Salzburg where he was born; scenes in Rome, Milan and Naples where he was acclaimed a boy genius; and Vienna where he later lived and composed some of his most important works. Excerpts from the following are included in the film: the Overture to the \"Marriage of Figaro\"; the First, Second and Third Movements of the Piano Concerto No. 23; the \"Requiem\" from the Requiem Mass; the Overture and \"Batti, batti\" aria from \"Don Giovanni\"; and the Allegro Movement from the Piano Sonata in C. Major."
