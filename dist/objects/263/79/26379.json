        "A study of the species of mutton bird which appear in large numbers in the Furneaux Islands off North east Tasmania, and which are the basis of a successful commercial undertaking on the Islands. The film depicts preparations for the breeding season, harvesting, cleaning, packing and distribution. Investigations into the biology the the mutton bird commenced in 1947 to determine whether intensive harvesting was depleting the rookeries."
