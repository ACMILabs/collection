        "An animated film which traces the misadventures of Mr Rossi savouring the pleasures of a seaside resort - the sand and the sea, the good food, the pretty girls. Since Mr Rossi is not easily discouraged, there are countless funny moments before we leave him bravely battling a midnight mosquito. Animation by Franco Martelli."
