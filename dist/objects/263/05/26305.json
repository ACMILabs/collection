        "The world depends on information - films can do a great deal. They can support an idea or change one; they can give an insight into some experience; they can give an inside view of written things; they can be a diagram in motion; film is able to affect attitudes because it affects emotions - it's a vehicle for the imagination; a method to make thought understood."
