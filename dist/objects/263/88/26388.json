        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Children of Canada\". A piquant view of downtown Montreal as it appears to a young Chinese-Canadian. Not all guides are as perceptive as Susan, or as outspoken. At home, at school, at play on the Mountain, she has a sharp eye for adult foibles. The result is a meeting with Susan and her city that is enlightening and amusing."
