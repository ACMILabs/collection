        "A family move from one house to another is one of those human experiences which are commonly regarded with foreboding. But if the operation is carried out by experienced and reliable moving-men there is no need for it to be a nightmare. The late Richard Massingham was invited to apply his highly personal technique to a problem for which the more solemn forms of documentary presentation would have been entirely inappropriate."
