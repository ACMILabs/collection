        "An experimental film. Close shots of a bubbling pool of thermal mud in New Zealand are matched to primeval sounds evoking the creation of a world. The sounds are composed of plucked piano bass strings, especially recorded to capture reverberation, slowed-down cymbals, xylophone, wobble board and castanets."
