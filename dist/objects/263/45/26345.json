        "Episode of Series \"Peach's Australia\". The Murray River has many problems, including pollution, the dwindling of its native fish, and the introduction of the European Carp, but the biggest problem has been in the threatened loss of its history. To Bill Peach, \"the riverboats represent the most colourful and romantic part of that history, and the skeletons of riverboats are symbols of our failure to love and care for our greatest river. Written and presented by Bill Peach."
