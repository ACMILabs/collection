        "Music students are able to attend a summer camp at Point Lonsdale, Victoria, for three weeks every year. This camp is organised by the National Fitness Council, the Founder being John Bishop. Students attend tutorial classes each morning in the open air and the afternoons are free to swim, fish, sunbathe and practice. In the evenings students usually give a concert for friends and visitors to the camp."
