        "Photographed on the streets of New York, this film penetrates the world children create in their play. It shows children of varying ages and different nationalities playing in the streets regardless of the life going on around them. It stresses the need for better recreational facilities for children in large metropolitan areas, and the need of a child to have a yard of its own. Production and editing by Patricia Jaffe, Larry Silk, John Schultz and Peggy Lawson."
