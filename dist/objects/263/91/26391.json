        "Episode of Series \"Man Alive\". Kathy Westen ran away from home at sixteen, was found six months later living rough, sleeping in derelict houses. Now she is at home again - at least for the time being. She left because she could not make her parents understand her. They worried because they could not understand what she was trying to tell them. Kathy's act of throwing away the comforts and securities of home life represents the communication gulf between parents and their children today."
