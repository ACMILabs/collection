        "Music makers from all over Australia come each year to the National Fitness Council's Music Camp formerly held at Geelong Grammar School. Some are professional musicians or students of music, others play only in their spare time, but all combine their talents to produce orchestras and chamber music groups. Performances by the players include selections from Handel, Sibelius and Dohnanyi. Photographed by Frank Bagnall."
