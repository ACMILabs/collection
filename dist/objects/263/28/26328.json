        "Blissymbols are giving children without speech a joyous new means of communication. A Canadian/Australian co-production, This film tells the story of a remarkable man, Australian Charles K. Bliss, who invented a symbol language (pictographs) originally as a means of overcoming the barrier of differing languages, and then found that it has an even greater, more rewarding application when used with speech-handicapped children. This is witnessed in Toronto and Montreal, where the Blissymbols are being used. (Awards: Melbourne; San Francisco; Sydney; Mexico) See \"Symbol boy\" (Title code 307141) for animated cartoon embodying the complete Blissymbols."
