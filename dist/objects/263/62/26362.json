        "Episode of Series \"Music for Young People\". Defines and explains melody, harmony, rhythm and counterpoint to a young audience. Each element is illustrated by the New York Woodwind Quintet. The film emphasises that melody is full of character, the addition of harmony makes music complete, rhythm is of many kinds and can be felt and listening to counterpoint is like following a conversation. Summarises and contrasts the elements of composition through the playing of a harmonic, rhythmic and contrapuntal treatment of the melody. Script by Lydia Perera"
