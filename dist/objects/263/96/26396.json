        "It is needless to point out the important role played by the blood for the maintenance of human life and health. In particular, the real fact about blood coagulation is one of the principal problems attracting the attention of modern medical science. This film is intended to show the complicated and clever functions concealed in the simple fact of blood coagulation. Several hitherto unsolved problems have been clarified and new spheres have been presented for future study by this film."
