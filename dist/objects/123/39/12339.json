        "Back to the Past or \"Screening Melbourne\" is designed to encourage students to develop an appreciation for the art and the craft behind moving image in its many forms by developing their ability to think beyond the screen. In the program Students become actors in a sci-fi time travel film story during a blue-screen workshop that allows them to place themselves in a historical Melbourne setting, engage with a screening program featuring historical Melbourne footage and participate in a related discussion learn some simple editing skills while they create a digital 'Melbourne travelogue' Back to the Past aims to develop students' understanding of ways in which film-makers create screen texts to target particular audiences. Students in Years 3-4  learn about concepts related to camera use such as framing, shot types, and angles as well as some of the features of documentary and blue-screen technology.
