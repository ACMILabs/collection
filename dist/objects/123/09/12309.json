        "Western Stories: Expressions for the Future is an inspirational collection of works from young people who, through their association with the Western Chances program, have been given the opportunity to tell their stories and build their own bridge to the future. Western Chances was established to ensure that financial hardship does not prevent a young person in Melbourne's West from achieving their maximum potential in life."
