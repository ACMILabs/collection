        "This is a loving tribute to Lorna Joyce Harrington by her grand-daughter, Rebecca. Born into a family of boys in Nunga, Northern Victoria in 1924, Lorna Harrington was separated from her family at the age of 3 weeks old until 7 years old when her mother was too sick to look after her. She worked on the family farm from the age of 13 after her father passed away, eventually escaping to Shepparton to work in the cannery and then finally marrying and settling in Melbourne. To Rebecca, \"nana\" is the rock in her family - a caring, strong and independent person who has taught her so many things in life."
