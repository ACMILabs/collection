        "Socialist parents, rebellious children - it runs in the blood. Esteban's parents originally came from Uruguay but were forced to flee to Australia in 1974 from the ruling military regime. His father, aged 32, and mother, aged 21, eventually settled in Melbourne raising four children and establishing the first South American bakery, in Yarraville. In this story, Esteban talks of his family's experiences and his deep respect for his wonderful rebellious parents."
