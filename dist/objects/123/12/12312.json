        "Sporting history runs in Darryl's family. His grandfathers were champion cyclists Pat Veitch and Jack Forbes. His parents and his uncles also were all cycling enthusiasts and both Darryl and his brother inherited the sporting genes to become successful in athletics and football. It is this sporting background that Darryl feels has given him his values and made him what he is today."
