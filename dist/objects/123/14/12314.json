        "A narrative of courage, family and a life saved. Dragush's father was dying of kidney failure. His father's sister, Lina, travelled half way across the world to Australia from Albania, leaving her home and family behind, so that she could help save her brother's life by donating one of her own kidneys. This story is a dedication to Aunty Lina and the importance of family."
