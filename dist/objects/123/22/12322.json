        "Otara has the reputation as one of the most dangerous places in New Zealand. But for Sami, who now lives in Australia, Otara will always remain in his heart as home, as the land of his father and his family. Proud of his color and proud of his culture, Sami talks of his memories as a child, the good times and the bad including the tragic circumstances which eventually led to a new start and a new beginning in Australia. Music composed by Sami Laga."
