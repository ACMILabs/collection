        "Ever since a child Mykel has had a fascination for the art of rhyme and a respect for the artistic and creative use of the english language. In this animated piece, he speaks of his dedication to perfecting his art through rap and hip-hop where constant rhyme is no longer a restriction and each syllable and phrase flows into a harmonious melody. \"Allowing your mind to be blown away, storming the front of your imagination and pushing it to the limit - that's the buzz!\" Music by Pabstrakt."
