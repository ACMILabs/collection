        "In 1966 at the age of nine Maria Savarino was reunited with her parents who had migrated to Australia from Italy six years earlier. In doing so she also lost a very special person - her Aunt Maria, who had looked after her in those intervening years in Italy. This is Maria's story about her very special namesake and role model."
