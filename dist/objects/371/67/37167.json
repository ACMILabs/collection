        "The Magnificent Ambersons captures the decline and disintegration of an aristocratic family early in the 20th Century. Within a few minutes the situation is established concisely as we see the large Amberson mansion set in spacious grounds and learn that Isabel Amberson did not marry Eugene Morgan, the man she really loved, but Wilbur Minafer, who was socially acceptable. Much of the story revolves around Isabel's son George Amberson Minafer, who does much to destroy his family. Based on the novel by Booth Tarkington."
