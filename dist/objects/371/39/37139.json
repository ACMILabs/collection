        "Popular children's author, Neara Duncan (played by Glenda Jackson), fearing her creative talents have evaporated, escapes into the dreamy world of sea turtles, seeking inspiration in their beauty and grace. William Snow (Ben Kingsley)is a humble assistant in a bookstore where he too dreams of turtles. Outside of their chance meetings at the aquarium, they have little in common, but an inspiration to free the captive turtles starts a bond that gives their lives a new outlook. The \"turtlenappers\" are about to set their own spirits free. Based on the novel by Russell Hoban. Screenplay by Harold Pinter."
