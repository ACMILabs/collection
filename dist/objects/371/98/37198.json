        "Based on the award-winning collection of short-stories by Robert Drewe, Bodysurfer combines a number of characters and incidents to create a single narrative focusing on the troubled personal life of David Lang. Following the failure of his marriage he begins a series of casual affairs but memories of his past come flooding back to stir his feelings of guilt. Realising he has failed his son, he becomes a fugitive to reconsider his future. Cast includes Peter Kowitz, Linda Cropper, Joy Smithers and Penne Hackforth-Jones."
