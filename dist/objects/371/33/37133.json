        "The moving story of 19th Century English composer, Edward Elgar, told through Huw Wheldon's commentary and Elgar's own music. Against sweeping panoramas of the Malvern Hills, a major inspiration for Elgar, it blends archival footage with the stunning visual imagery characteristic of Ken Russell's work."
