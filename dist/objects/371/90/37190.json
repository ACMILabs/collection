        "Dashiell Hammett's 1932 detective novel, \"The thin man\", was a best- seller sought by every major Hollywood studio. MGM won out and the result is a crime thriller combined with high comedy. As Nick and Nora Charles, the wisecracking darlings of society, William Powell and Myrna Loy made history portraying two sophisticates who are not only married but also very much in love, also stars Cesar Romero."
