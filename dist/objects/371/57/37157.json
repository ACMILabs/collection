        "Five short films featuring the poetry and prose of the Beat writers; William Burroughs, Brion Gyson and Ian Somerville. Filmed in New York City, Paris and Tangiers, the films do not use narrative but rather incorporate avant-garde and experimental film techniques. Burroughs' poetry, and his commitment to homo-eroticism and heroin use, feature prominently in the films. \"William buys a parrot\", \"The cut-ups\" and \"Bill and Tony\" last a few minutes whilst \"Towers open fire\" and \"Ghosts at no. 9 (Paris)\" are longer films. The last film is an hour excerpt of a longer five hour epic."
