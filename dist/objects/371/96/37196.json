        "Douglas Fairbanks plays the part of the Thief of Bagdad. He tries to win the heart of his true love, the Caliph's daughter, by competing with various Princes to find rare treasure. He climbs clouds, battles sea-creatures and killer plants, defeats the Mongols with an army of dust, rides a winged horse and finally becomes victorious. This silent classic is a much loved children's film."
