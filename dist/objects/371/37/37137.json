        "Prime western with warmth and great humour about the exploits of one of the last great bands of outlaws since Jesse James. Butch Cassidy and the deadly Sundance Kid are the most likeable outlaws in the West and amongst the most successful until their most ingenious caper, a round-trip train robbery, backfires, putting the west's most relentless bounty hunters on their trail. Butch and the Kid use all their wiles to avoid capture, and finally elude their posse by making a hair-raising hundred foot jump into a raging mountain stream. Headed for Bolivia, the outlaws continue to rob banks until they meet their destiny. Stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katharine Ross."
