        "St. Helen, 1938. A town divided by bigotry and charged emotions. World War II is raging in Europe, but all is peaceful in the small town of St. Helen. Days are unaffected by the fighting until a tragedy brings the reality of war to the town's doorstep, a tragedy that shatters the entire community. At the same time, a love blossoms amidst age-old religious conflict. Adapted from the novel by James Aldridge."
