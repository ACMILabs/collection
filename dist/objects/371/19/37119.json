        "Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy portray the proud parents of a young lady who's about to bring home the man she wants to marry. They've heard he's handsome and full of career prospects but when they discover that he's black they find out that they're not as broadminded as they thought. Sidney Poitier is the son-in-law elect in this examination of prejudice and social manners."
