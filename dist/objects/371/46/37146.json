        "A disfigured World War II veteran marries a decidedly plain girl and they seclude themselves inside a small New England cottage. A small miracle occurs when they are transformed into a handsome couple, as they see each other through the eyes of love. Based on the play by Sir Arthur Wing Pinero, this fable proves that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Starring Dorothy McGuire and Robert Young."
