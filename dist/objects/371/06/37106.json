        "Richard III is the story of one man's unbridled lust for the crown. Richard's ambition leaves all who oppose him dead, pawns in his ruthless bid for the throne. This is a majestic film in every sense of the word, and one of the greatest films ever produced in England. Directed by, and starring, Laurence Olivier with Ralph Richardson, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud."
