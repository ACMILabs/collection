        "Oscar nominee Barbara Stanwyck stars as Annie Oakley, an Ohio backwoods girl who sets her sights on adventure and romance as the Wild West's legendary lady sharpshooter. She first gains prominence when she enters a local exhibition with Tony Walker (Preston Foster) who claims to be the world's greatest marksman and the star of Buffalo Bill's wild west show. Annie joins the show and soon becomes his star attraction, vying for attention with Toby whom she loves. After the mandatory period of professional rivalry and romantic conflict, they are finally united by a marksman superior to both of them, Cupid."
