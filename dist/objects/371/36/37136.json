        "Twelve years in the making, \"Visages de Femmes\" is a wonderfully unpredictable and creative look at the financial, sexual and emotional emancipation of African women. The film is a series of episodes linked by a chorus featuring traditional singing and dancing. Ecare's achievement is to create a visual feast which owes little to colonial models of cinema."
