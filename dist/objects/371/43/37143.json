        "Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn are sparring partners in this punchy comedy, of two good sports who stage a never ending romantic battle. Katharine Hepburn plays \"Pat\", an all-round woman athlete who is a whiz at golf, tennis, baseball, basketball, boxing, archery and Judo. Spencer Tracy superbly enacts the part of \"Mike\", an unschooled, rough-mannered Broadway promoter who already has a racing horse, and a heavy-weight fighter (Aldo Ray) as \"clients\" and who, possessing the top horse is now determined to have the \"top woman\"."
