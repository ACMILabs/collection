        "When three wacky private eyes are hired to protect a large department store, it soon becomes apparent that the store needs protection against them. The Marx brothers turn their talents to sleuthing at the request of one of the store owners who fears that her partner is in danger. It doesn't take them long to handcuff everyone in sight - with the exception of the criminal. Cast includes Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, Harpo Marx, Tony Martin, Virginia Grey."
