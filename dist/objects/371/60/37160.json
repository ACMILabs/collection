        "Roger Vadim up-dates Choderlos de Laclos' 18th century novel to present day France. Valmont (Gerard Philipe) and Juliette (Jeanne Moreau) turn love and sex into a game, and in doing so make victims of those who fall for their seductive manipulations. However in their attempt to corrupt the innocent Marianne, love threatens to destroy all the players of the game. The cast also includes Jean-Louis Trintignant. The jazz score is by Thelonious Monk and the excellent photography is by Marcel Grignon."
