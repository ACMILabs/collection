        "Based on Patricia Highsmith's chilling thriller, \"Strangers on a train\", this is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most suspenseful and exciting films. Two passengers accidentally meet on a train. Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) offers to kill the wife of Guy Haines (Farley Granger), if Guy in return murders Bruno's father. The excellent script was co-written by Raymond Chandler and the film features a climax in a fairground which is among Hitchcock's finest directing moments."
