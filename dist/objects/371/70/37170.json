        "Describes Rome at the time of Nero, focusing on a Roman commander who falls in love with a Christian girl and becomes a convert himself. A spectacular film, at its most effective where it examines the lives of the early Christians. The Miklos Rozsa score was based on music of the time. Starring Deborah Kerr, Robert Taylor and Peter Ustinov."
