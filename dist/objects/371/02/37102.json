        "Narrated by Anthony Quinn, \"Rembetika: The blues of Greece\" is the story of the music made popular by the film, \"Zorba the Greek\". This video was filmed in Greece, Turkey, America and Australia, and traces the history of this 'blues' music of Greece from its origins in the hashish dens of Athens and Smyrna. It includes rare footage of some of the most famous names in Rembetika such as, Mikis Theodorakis, Markos Vamvakaris, Sotiria Bellou, Mariza Koch and Vasilis Tsitsanis. There is even rarer footage of the 1921 invasion of Turkey, by Greece, which led to the greatest disaster in Greek history."
