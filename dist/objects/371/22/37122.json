        "A captivating musical set in St. Louis at the time of the 1903 World's Fair. The story tells of a family who are crushed to learn that their father has accepted a transfer to New York City. The five children don't want to leave their friends, or, most of all, miss the fair. The family upheaval and the final resolution of the story, make an unforgettable, heart-warming movie. Based on the novel by Sally Benson and starring Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien."
