        "Set against the overwhelming African bush, Karen Black as Mary Turner plays a desperate woman searching for security and love. Unable to come to terms with herself or the land she lives in, Mary accepts a marriage proposal from farmer John Thaw, rather than remain single in a big city. But this is not the escape she hoped it to be. Based on the novel by Doris Lessing."
