        "Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy portray the proud parents of a young lady who's about to bring home the man she intends to marry. They've heard he's good looking and full of career prospects but when they discover that he's black, they find that they're not as broadminded as they thought. Sidney Poitier is the son-in-law elect in this examination of prejudice and social manners."
