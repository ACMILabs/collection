        "Abbott and Costello play a pair of barbers who want their own Hollywood barber shop and to get it no two barbers have ever been in more close shaves. There's Abbott-the-schemer who gets them jobs as big-time talent agents. Then there's Costello, all he's ever headed for is trouble. When Abbott and Costello get inside Hollywood, Hollywood gets turned inside out."
