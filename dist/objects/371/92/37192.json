        "Journey to the dense rain forests of Costa Rica and watch as leaf-cutting ants carry sections of leaves many times their weight to underground fungus gardens; a basilisk lizard walks on water; and howler monkeys bask in the sun. Fascinating and thought-provoking this film is an eloquent warning of the natural wonders we stand to lose on a world scale if human encroachment of the world's rain forests continues."
