        "Doctor Zhivago is a moving story of love and romance told against the flaming background of the Russian Revolution. The story is presented through many characters whose destinies are interwoven. Not only is it a vast panorama of a country undergoing the most radical revolution in history; it also probes, with deep and desperate concern, the personal struggle of one man's survival. The film stars Omar Sharif and Julie Christie. A poet, a surgeon, a husband and a lover - this is the story of Zhivago. Based on the novel by Boris Pasternak."
