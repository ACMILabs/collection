        "When a little girl is accidentally drowned, her parents (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) go to Venice to forget. There they are told by a clairvoyant that their daughter is still very much alive. Adapted from a Daphne du Maurier short story, director Roeg (\"Man who fell to Earth\" and \"Bad Timing\") has created a hypnotic horror film. The film is famous for its effective and shocking editing techniques, as well as its menacing use of the beautiful Venice locations."
