        "An American in Paris tells the story of an ex-GI art student who has fallen in love with a young French girl and then sadly has been parted from her.

Gene Kelly teams up with Leslie Caron in this spectacularly staged musical featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. Academy Award for Best Film 1951."
