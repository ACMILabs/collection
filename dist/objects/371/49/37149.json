        "One of the best musicals by the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers team. The featured songs are \"Fancy Free\", sung and danced by Fred in his hotel suite as a way to bring him face to face with Ginger; \"Isn't this a lovely city?\" which is sung and danced on a bandstand in a London park; \"Top hat, white tie and tails\" featuring Fred and the chorus in an exciting number; the unforgettable \"Cheek to cheek\"; and the lavishly staged finale, \"The Piccolino\"."
