        "Cary Grant is the cheeky news editor, Rosalind Russell is the ace female reporter with printer's ink in her veins. Amid the frenzy of newsmen competing for that front page story, high energy romance, and Ben Hecht's famous overlapping dialogue and machine-gun paced script, a reporter about to get married and escape the newsworld, stumbles upon the biggest story of her career - a notorious criminal surrenders personally. One of the funniest and most biting screwball comedies on film. Also stars Ralph Bellamy. Based on the 1928 play \"The Front page\" by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur and a remake of the 1931 Howard Hughes film \"The Front page\"."
