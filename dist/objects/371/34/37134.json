        "Based on Eric Fenby's book, \"Delius As I Knew Him\", Russell's film follows the events of the five bizarre years Fenby spent in France assisting the aging composer when he was paralysed and almost totally blind. The Delius household proved to be a law unto itself but was an environment where some of the composer's greatest works were created, including \"A Song of Summer\". After the death of Delius, Fenby went on to become Professor of Harmony at the Royal Academy of Music in London."
