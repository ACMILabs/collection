        "The picture of Dorian Gray is a superb film based on Oscar Wilde's novel about a young man who wishes that his portrait could age while he remains youthful. The portrait does grow old, showing not only Dorian Gray's age but also the sins and aberrations of his wicked life. Dorian remains handsome, young and seemingly uncorrupted by his own decadence. Stars George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield, Donna Reed, Angela Lansbury and Peter Lawford."
