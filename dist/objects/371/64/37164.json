        "Dr. Alex Harvey (Trevor Howard) and Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) meet at a railway station and fall in love. Married to other people in middle-class suburban England, they nevertheless maintain an acquaintanceship on her shopping trips to town which deepens into a friendship which blossoms into forbidden love. This is the original screen version of Noel Coward's one act play, \"Still Life\". Atmospherically directed by David Lean, \"Brief Encounter\" is an evergreen romance classic of post-war English cinema with seamless performances from the leading actors and an excellent music score borrowing heavily from Rachmaninoff. The screenplay was also written by Noel Coward."
