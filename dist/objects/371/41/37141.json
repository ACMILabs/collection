        "Hailed as one of the best comedies ever made. Army surgeons during the Korean war develop a lunatic life-style in order to cope with the everyday horrors encountered in a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. The film mixes slap-stick with tragedy and pokes merciless fun at military pomposity, empty religion and incompetence. It sticks its tongue out at hypocrisy - the same attitudes which have made the spin-off television series highly successful. Based on a novel by Richard Hooker."
