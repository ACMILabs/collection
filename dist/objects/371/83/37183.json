        "Seduced by the lure of cheap drink, drugs and sex, an experienced photo- journalist goes with his friend to El Salvador in the early 1980s. Once there they see the turmoil and brutality of the country as it is being destroyed by the conflict, and learn of American involvement. Largely based on the experiences of Richard Boyle, a photo-journalist there in the 1980s. Stars James Woods, James Belushi and Michael Murphy."
