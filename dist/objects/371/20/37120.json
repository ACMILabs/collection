        "Recorded live at the Sydney Opera House in 1985 this lavish production of Puccini's opera stars Eva Marton as Tosca, Lamberto Furlan as her lover Cavaradossi and John Shaw as the villainous Baron Scarpia. Puccini's tale of jealousy, love and betrayal is set against a background of the Napoleonic wars, brought vividly to life by Allan Lee's superlative sets and John Copley's outstanding production. The Australian Opera and Chorus is conducted by Alberto Erede."
