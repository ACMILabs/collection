        "La Cage aux Folles is the name of a transvestite nightclub run by a pair of aging homosexuals, one of whom has a son eager to be married. However his fiancee's father is the chief of a political party dedicated to morality who is not likely to approve of his new in-laws. A touching and sensitive comedy that proves love has no boundaries. Based on the play by Jean Poiret. Screenplay by Francis Verber. Cast includes Michelle Serrault, Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Galabru. In French with English subtitles."
