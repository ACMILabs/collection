        "Kiss me Kate, one of the most celebrated musicals, with its sparkling songs and dazzling wit, stars Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel at their best, in the battle of the sexes. Kathryn is Lilli Vanessi, the temperamental stage star, Howard is her ex-husband Fred Graham. The action takes place on an opening night with a romantic free-for-all in the dressing rooms and on stage. Unforgettable songs in Cole Porter's vibrant score and dancing by Ann Miller. Based on the play by Samuel and Bella Spewack."
