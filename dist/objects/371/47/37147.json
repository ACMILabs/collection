        "A lavish production set in San Francisco, in which Clark Gable plays the role of Blackie Norton, proprietor of a riotous saloon. When Jeanette MacDonald arrives on the scene in search of a singing career, they fall in love. The climax takes place amongst the recreation of the great earthquake that hit the city in 1906. Cast also includes Spencer Tracy, Jack Holt, Jessie Ralph and Ted Healy. Screenplay by Anita Loos from the story by Robert Hopkins. Edited by Tom Neld."
