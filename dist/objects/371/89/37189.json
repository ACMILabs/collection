        "The Amazonian rainforest, flooded by up to ten metres of water every year, is one of the world's last wetland frontiers. A magical submerged world and the greatest river system on earth, these huge flood plains are home to many remarkable creatures. The animals featured in this two part production include the primitive freshwater Boho dolphin, the Arowhana fish, dubbed by locals \"the water monkey\" because of its ability to leap two metres from the water to catch insects, and the strangest-looking monkey in the world, the Ukari. Narrated by Anthony Hopkins."
