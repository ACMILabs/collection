        "A detailed chronicle of the life of Chicago gangster Al Capone, played by Paul Muni, with Ann Dvorak as an incestuous sister thrown in for good measure. This brutal and graphic film was made in 1931, but its release was delayed by the censors. Based on the novel by Armitage Traill, this film is also known as \"the Shame of a Nation\"."
