        "A searing indictment of military life, where one walks the line or pays the price. In a peacetime army camp in Hawaii, the commander's wife, Deborah Kerr, and career soldier, Burt Lancaster, risk everything in a love affair that could destroy them. Persecuted by his peers, hard-headed Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) wants to settle down with prostitute Donna Reed, but she yearns for a better life. Prewitt's only friend, Frank Sinatra, stands up to sadistic guard, Ernest Borgnine, and pays the ultimate price. The film culminates in an explosive climax on December 7, 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbour. \"From Here to Eternity\" is a riveting drama, considered one of Hollywood's greatest achievements. Based on the novel by James Jones."
