        "Renoir financed \"La Marseillaise\" entirely from public subscription. The film traces the fortunes of two young men during the French Revolution. Renoir's characteristic warmth and faith in human nature is prominent, and he concentrates on portraying the lives of ordinary people during the revolutionary period. This is one of the few great films to deal seriously with this momentous time in history."
