        "A sequel to \"Where eagles nest\" this is a study of twin young eagles which form part of a group of seven eagles born over three breeding seasons. Beginning with the twin chicks in their nest under the protective eye of their mother, we follow a progressive journey of the chicks as they become young eagles fending for themselves and taking their first hesitant attempts at flight. Filmed on the north-east side of the Great Dividing Range in the \"Valley of a Thousand Hills\", on the watershed of the Yea River, the King Parrot Creek and the Strath Creek through to the foot of Mount Tallarook and Upper Goulburn River in Victoria, Australia, Frank Muscolino's cinematography provides close-up and in some cases, extremely rare and hard to get footage, of these magnificent birds in flight, swooping and soaring as they hunt for food. Also includes footage of such native animals as kangaroos, koalas and cockatoos. With minimal commentary, background music and the sounds of nature, this is an interesting film, particularly for bird lovers. Narrator: Rod Cook."
