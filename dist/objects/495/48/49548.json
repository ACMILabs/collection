        "Taxithi, which means \"journey\" in Greek, examines an integral but often overlooked and under-represented part of Australian contemporary society: migrant culture. Melbourne filmmaker Christina Heristanidis turns the camera on her immediate surroundings, specifically, her Greek parents, their culture and history in order to understand and appreciate their Greek-Australianess. As well as capturing her parents relaxing at home or attending their social clubs, Christina also accompanies them on a road trip they take to the country with their community of friends. The manner in which they deal with encounters and express themselves through their culture (singing, dancing, communal happiness) as a group evokes the film's central theme: that migrants bring their culture with them, that culture continues through people rather than solely through place and that this shared culture enables community, solace and optimism. In \"Taxithi\", the camera becomes an extension of the filmmaker that often turns onto the filmmaker herself and her own relations with her parents. Never short of humour, warmth and goodwill, \"Taxithi\" is a special documentary that reveals the richness and history that lies below the surface of everyday Australian suburbia."
