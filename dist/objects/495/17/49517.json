        "Set in the Stone Age when men were forced to marry and then work on the rock pile - that's why it was called the \"Stone Age!\". King Ferdinand has ordered that all men between the ages of 13 and 95 must be married within 21 days or be executed or banished for life, or both. Amongst those vying for a wife are the big husky caveman known as the Mighty Giant (Oliver Hardy) and his rival, Twinkle Star (Stan Laurel)."
