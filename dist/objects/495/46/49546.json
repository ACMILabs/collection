        "Sylvia feels invisible because a taxi driver treats her with condescension and takes the long route home despite her protests. She tells her friend Isobel, who encourages her to attend an information session about anti-discrimination legislation. There she meets Douglas, who has lodged a formal complaint to the Anti-Discrimination Board because he feels he is a victim of age discrimination in his workplace. Sylvia offers to be a support for Douglas when he must attend a mediation session with his team leader and the Board. Compromises are met and friendships are created in this informative short film. An ideal training tool for the workplace, classroom or discussion group."
