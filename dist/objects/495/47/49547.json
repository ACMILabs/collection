        "A journey by the filmmaker through the South follows the route of the Union's General Sherman who carried on the war against the civilian population of the Confederacy, then largely female. Along the way McElwee is confronted by the mysteries of Southern womanhood in his encounters with eight women. His dreams are haunted by the spectre of nuclear war and he encounters signs of its pervasiveness along the way. McElwee assesses the state of his movie as he goes along, on the soundtrack and in a series of soliloquies to the camera."
