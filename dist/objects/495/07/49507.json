        "The Australian band Not Drowning Waving in 1988 went to Papua New Guinea to record sessions with Tabaran musicians. Their interest in the music was partly the attraction to the different instruments but also the new sounds created in a period of post-colonialism where western influences can be heard within rich sounds of traditional PNG music. The documentary traces Not Drowning Waving's recording of the album Tabaran in PNG and the band's involvement with local PNG communities. A rich cultural picture is the result as the band travels through a dynamic mix of different tribal cultures within the country, the colonial past, and contemporary street life."
