        "The removal of a teenager's bedroom door by her frugal step father (he has insisted the family live on weet-bix for the last three years) is emblematic of family tension in this telling film about the perils of adolescent years, and the lack of communication within the family unit. Cast includes Barry Otto, Penne Hackforth-Jones and Inge Hornstra."
