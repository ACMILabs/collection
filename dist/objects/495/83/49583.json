        "A fantastical comedy about the clash of two cultures. Some likely surfing lads on Bondi Beach take offense to the Japanese surfer Jiro (Monchi) on the water and an entourage of Japanese tourists taking photos. Insults and racist slurs ensue until Jiro summons the mythical monster Godzilla to come to his defence. Panic follows as crowds on the beach foreshore run to safety. The film includes appearances by a number of well known Australian actors like Tiriel Mora, Jeremy Sims and Sarah Chadwick."
