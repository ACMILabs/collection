        "Award winning animated short about an old air force veteran who reminisces about the war years. Mostly a claymation work, Stephenson uses hand-drawn 2D animation to indicate the flashbacks experienced by the the veteran whilst supping on his beer at his local pub. The veteren, who struggles to find meaning in his old age, draws on his experiences of the past in a heady mix of booze and disillusionment in an attempt to make sense of his life. Voices: Graeme Jackson, Andrea Lang."
