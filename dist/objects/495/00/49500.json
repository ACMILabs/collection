        "Two Australian travellers Karl (Michael Snelling) and Giselle (Kerin Murray) meet up with friends at a cafe in Italy for coffee and discuss their cultural experiences and observations of the country. A trip is planned and the group sets off together on another sight-seeing adventure. A postmodernist film essay exploring the structure of storytelling through the deliberate raw use of cinematic and film making devices (making those devices transparent). A film about foreigners, film making and foreign processes. Cast also includes: Ken Bolton, Mark Thomson and Tish Banks. Narrator: Richard Grayson."
