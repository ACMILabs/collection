        "Charlie and Fatty, both well-dressed but very drunk, come home to their long-suffering wives in facing apartments in the same hotel. The women remonstrate so the men go off out again together to a restaurant where they create total chaos and mayhem and are finally ejected from the premises. They then stumble across a row boat in the park and climb in to try and get some sleep - as the film ends we see a sinking boat full of water! Cast: Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, Phyllis Allen and Minta Durfee"
