        "After rejecting the conventional career path of a successful practice, an idealistic young doctor recalls, 8 years later, time spent in Bolivia, drug addiction and a trip across America. During a course of rehabilitation in Melbourne he meets a young woman, an addict and petty thief. The recollection of this indeterminate journey suggests the disconnected process of memory. The title suggests how the different worlds in which the doctor has travelled in search of meaning have only increased his sense of dislocation. Photographed by Ray Argall. Cast includes Richard Moir and Jo Kennedy."
