        "Cecil is retired and enjoying the twilight of his life. Freida is a widow who enjoys spending time at the local swimming pool, especially after she meets Cecil. Cecil and Freida soon become intimate companions (much to the amusement of some of Cecil's mates from the croquet club), and Cecil becomes determined to fulfil his life-long dream of sailing to New Zealand - but is it too late? This film captures the essence of a generation who have plenty of time to enjoy themselves and is a positive look at senior citizens which illustrates that \"old age\" is really only as old as you feel!"
