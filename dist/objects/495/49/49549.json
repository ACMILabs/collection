        "The Sikh community have played a role in the Northern Australian community at Woolgoolga, New South Wales since the turn of last century. Initially coming as labourers the Sikh's, who now have a stronghold in the community, own and run 90% of the banana plantations in the area. This documentary deals with assimilation and identity and uses the example of both a traditional and progressive Sikh family to discuss the difficulties with language, marriage and family responsibilities in changing times. As the mature generations grow old, maintaining a culture becomes increasingly difficult as the younger generations more easily are attracted to and absorbed into Australia's western lifestyle."
