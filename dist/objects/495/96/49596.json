        "In 1956 Victoria staged its Annual Veteran Car Rally over a two day period and required cars to journey from Melbourne to Ballarat and back again. Among competing cars was a 1906 Argyle, 1908 Fiat, 1914 Napier and 1914 Standard. A Cadillac built in 1913 was declared the outright winner. The annual rally provided owners of old cars to show the public the steadiness, dependability and elegance of their automobiles. Narrated by Ray Chapman."
