        "4 shorts united by the theme of the unique male/female relationship dynamic. \"Hot date\" (dir. Kelly Wallwork): A woman out on a first date learns the hard way not to order the nachos with chillies. \"Risk\" (prod. Hugh Burton, dir. Christian Bernardi): Looi Prescott has asked a sexy waitress out to lunch. Does he act like his true self and consume the Creme Caramel as he is accustomed to? \"Slave to love\" (dir. Caroline Toomey): An elderly woman writes a hit romance novel, despite the distractions worthy of any juicy plot. \"The Drive home\" (dir. Annette Trevitt): While driving home a woman hears on the radio how to recognise your perfect match, provided she can make it through the tunnel and pick up radio frequency."
