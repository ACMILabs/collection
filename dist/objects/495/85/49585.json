        "Strike Your Heart is a gentle portrait of change; its happiness and heartbreak for a boy, a family and a culture. It is 1967 and Australian Aborigines have won the battle for their citizenship rights. New attitudes are being embraced by all and for a ten-year-old boy (Rami Rahman) living in the quiet coastal town of Broome, North-Western Australia, there are personal challenges that have to be faced - falling in love, his first kiss, heartbreak and departure from his close-knit Aboriginal family. Filmed on location in Broome, Western Australia - Wayne Barker's homelands, with an indigenous cast from the region, \"Strike Your Heart\" is the first indigenous drama made in Western Australia. Cast includes Jimmy Edgar, Petris Torres, Attika Edgar, Alison Torres, Sylvia Clarke, Stephen 'Baamba'Albert, Emmanuelle Torres, Brian T. Eastwell."
