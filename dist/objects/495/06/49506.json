Cast includes John Meillon, Gary Waddell, Sally McKenzie, Cate Brennan, Tim Ailwood and Steve Houston. \"Sharkey's Party\" (1986): A less angst counterpoint to \"Dogs in Space\". Having just come out of a mental institiution Sharkey's friends throw him a party. Musicians, jaded punks, out-of-date hippies, sharehouses, drugs and life on the dole make up this portrayal of Australian youth culture in the 1980's. Cast includes David Argue and Sally McKenzie."
