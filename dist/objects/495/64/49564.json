        "Director Frank Muscolino takes us into the cool bush habitat of the Superb Lyrebird (Menura Novahollandiae) around Mason Falls. We observe the lyrebirds in the treetops as well as at ground level, and hear their remarkable vocal range. The hen's determined nest building is captured, as well as the display behaviour of the cock bird spreading his tail as he dances on the mound. Minimalist narration and some footage of neighbouring bush creatures such as reptiles and koalas is also seen."
