        "This film looks at the way various young film makers in Australia are adapting film to communicate their ideas. A film about films, it mirrors the distinctive style of student films, cutting quickly, moving rapidly over a wide range of activities and places, contrasting different approaches to film study. Thirteen schools from five States were selected as being representative of filmmaking in Australian schools."
