        "A story of the impulses of youth that often clash with society's need for circumspection, law and order. Eddie makes the mistake of \"borrowing\" a motor cycle parked in front of a bike shop. He takes his girlfriend for a joy ride before the law intervenes. A commentary on a society that often offers youth little purpose or sense of accomplishment."
