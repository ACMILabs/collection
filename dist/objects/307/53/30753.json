        "Chopin's early life, and his participation in the popular revolutionary movement. Though it uses music freely this film is not a musical. The director is responsible for many notable productions, with much experience of wartime documentary in the USSR; from whence he returned to Poland to reorganise the film industry. Though it uses Chopin's music freely, this film a biography of Chopin during his student days in Warsaw and his first international tour. The emphasis is on the patriotism which he shared with the other educated youth and young officers of Poland. Their country had been divided in the Partition of Poland (1795) by Austria, Prussia and Russia. The film shows the spirit of revolt among the youth, their struggle with the Czarist occupation troops and their assassination plots. When the French Revolution of 1830 touches off revolts throughout Europe, Chopin is in Vienna. Despite illness, he tries to return to Warsaw where the Poles have risen against the Czar. Apart from his nationalism, the film depicts his early love for an opera singer and his affection for the folk music and people of Poland."
