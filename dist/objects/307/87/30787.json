        "Outlines methods of fodder conservation on the dairy farm. The cow may be regarded as a milk factory and if food is in short supply or of the wrong type, milk production will be reduced. The composition of milk is used to illustrate the need for a balanced diet and how such a diet can be obtained from different types of fodder. The latter sections of the film illustrate methods of making grass silage and meadow hay to provide a reserve of fodder for use throughout the year."
