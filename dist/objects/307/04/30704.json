        "Wyperfeld National Park in North-western Victoria: its birds, animals, wildflowers and trees. The Ranger travels through the sand dunes of the Mallee country, stopping at a bore to pump water. Birds gather to drink - galahs, crested pigeons, ringneck parrots, honeyeaters, ravens and white cockatoos. Kangaroos, emus and the bushy-tailed possum abound amongst stands of red gums and Murray pine, and wildflowers seen include the white ever-lasting and Austral beauties. Bird watchers visiting the park study the beautiful Mallee fowl. Camera, editing and script: David Corke. Music: George Dreyfus Assistance and location recording: Peter Bruce. Park Ranger: Alec Campbell."
