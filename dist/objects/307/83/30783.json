        "With the aid of a six-foot model of a human brain and film sequences of brain cells under the microscope the operation of the brain is explained. Brain cells are seen living, dying and linking themselves in the patterns which make human beings behave the way they do. Includes the filming of German artist Horst Pieter drawing under the influence of LSD."
