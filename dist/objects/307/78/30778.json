    ], 
    "description": [
        "This film documents styles of housing, with each sequence featuring a different aspect of Melbourne. There is some rare footage of the demolition of great Victorian mansions made during the boom era of the 1880s. Perspectives on housing needs are drawn from the voice-over comments (which are caricatures of Australian types), and are worked into pictures of Melbourne slums. Comical skits of haphazard \"do-it-yourself\" house builders are also shown. Eric Kerr shot and edited this film. One sequence has innovative, quick-cut editing with cue tones to show several houses of various design and style. Written by Robin Boyd and directed by Peter McIntyre. This title is also available for borrowing on VHS."
