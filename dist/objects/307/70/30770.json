        "The theme of this film is why children can't sleep, what sleep does for children, and why it is much more important for them than it is for adults. Insignificant to the adult, the problems of childhood are real and frightening to children. Because sleep is for children a vital continuation of waking life, during which their minds have a tremendous amount of sorting out to do, some of their problems may cause restlessness and nightmares. Parents can help their children to get sound, healthy sleep by giving them a sense of security and well-being."
