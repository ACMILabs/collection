        "This film is designed to teach pregnant women how to give birth to a healthy, happy baby. It explains what is meant by a balanced diet. It also touches upon other aspects, such as prenatal exercises and proper weight gain. The message of the film is clear: good nutrition may be as important for proper mental and physical development before birth as afterwards."
