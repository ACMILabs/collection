        "A tall karri forest in south-west of Western Australia is part of the State's third of a million acres of forest. It provides a continuous and increasing supply for the timber industry; and is the site of a youth camp for school children. Forest officers explain various aspects of forestry to the children showing felling, milling and fire control. Other attractions include rare wildflowers, reptiles and birds."
