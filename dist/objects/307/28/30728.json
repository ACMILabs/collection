        "A young boy of the 1670's wanders through the Swan Hill Pioneer Settlement and views some characteristic features of life there in the past. Residents of the Settlement in period costume, an old steamboat - the Pyap - journeying down the Murray River, horse-drawn coaches, and colonial buildings, all contribute to this picture of yesterday's Swan Hill. Accompanied by instrumental folk music."
