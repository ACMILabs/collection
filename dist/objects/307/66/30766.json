        "This film opens with a sequence showing children in school; these children are all deaf, some from birth, but the majority of them as a result of common aliments like measles, influenza, tonsillitis, and other ear-nose-and-throat diseases which, if not properly cared for, can cause total or partial deafness. A very clear explanation of the structure of the ear and the care which should be taken of everyday complaints, is given."
