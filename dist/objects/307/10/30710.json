        "An impression of the regular Sunday afternoon meeting of \"Soap Box Orators\" on the bank of the Yarra River in Melbourne. The film is concerned with the characters that make up the gathering, a number of them have been attending the meetings over a period of many years, and some of the speakers have become, well-known identities from their appearances there. The commentary to the film is a series of anecdotes on the \"Yarra bank\" and its people as told by Percy Lightfoot, a regular visitor to the meetings since 1924. Credits: Sound recordist, Ron Green; Sound editor, Glen Pirani."
