        "Partly animated and partly live action, this film shows how the nation's food production depends on good farming practices such as contour ploughing and strip cropping, resulting in abundant crops, healthy farm animals and therefore, well-stocked shops. Discusses soil erosion and bad farming techniques. Suitable for primary level."
