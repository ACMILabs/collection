        "A single dancer, by the use of masks, tells the story of three friends of different temperaments. A preface shows the application of kabuki make-up; the dance itself, a buyo dance with the stylization and refinement of the no tradition, is performed with the choreographic use of the on-stage-hand, or figure in black."
