        "This modern day retelling of the classic fairytale \"Jack and the beanstalk\" was originally released as a two-part teleplay and is directed more at a teen/adult audience, rather than for young children. The main characters still feature in the story, young Jack (J.J. Feild), the giant \"Thunderdell\" (Bill Barretta), the goose that lays the golden eggs, the golden harp, the princess Ondine (Mia Sara). However, that's just about where the similarities begin and end with the original children's fairytale version. This is a far more sinister tale focusing on greed, murder and the corporate world of Jack Robinson (Matthew Modine) who has been taught by his ancestors to, \"believe in the possibility of the impossible\". Jack's dream is to build on the family site a \"Magic Castle Resort and Casino\" but problems of a mysterious kind begin to plague him when a giant human skeleton is found buried on the land and the figure of a woman known as the Matriarch (Vanessa Redgrave), appears from out of nowhere to divulge the secrets of Jack's ancestors, exposing their sins and a family curse that he can only undo. From here the world of fantasy takes over and it is up to you to believe or not. In the tradition of \"Labyrinth\", the Jim Henson Company have made wonderful use of special effects, computer animation, puppet characters and cinemaphotography to create an atmospheric, magical and fantastical retelling of \"Jack and the beanstalk\". Cast also includes Daryl Hannah, Jon Voight, Richard Attenborough, and Honor Blackman. Story by James V. Hart and Brian Henson.
