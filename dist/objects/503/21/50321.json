        "Taylor Hackford (Against all odds, Proof of life) directed \"An Officer and a gentleman\", starring Richard Gere and Debra Winger. It is the story of Zack Mayo (Gere) a man of uncertain future who is in conflict with his identity. A life of familial instability has left Zack unwilling to engage emotionally with others, especially women. Zack determines that he favours a career as a navy pilot, largely to prove to his alcoholic father that he is a son worthy of respect and capable of achievement. His steely demeanour suits military life but is in part broken down by his romance with a local factory girl Paula Pokrifi (Winger). Life in the armed forces is depicted as brutal and inhumane as the recruits make their way through a gruelling 13-week course. Foley, (Louis Gossett, Jnr) the irascible Major in charge of the recruits, rides Mayo particularly hard as he recognises in him Officer material. Mayo is torn between his cold conduct that shelters him from feeling anything and his burgeoning love for Paula. \"An Officer and a gentleman\" won Oscars for Gosset (Best Supporting Actor) and Best Song for \"Up where we belong\"."
