        "A bunch of kids on hearing that a beloved steam ferry \"The Lady Hope\" has been decommissioned and due for the scrap heap decide to rescue the boat from destruction. They use the help from some of their adult allies to help rally against the government in an escalating and hilarious caper that promises to save the 'Lady'. A child's fantasy is saved when the kids command a string of well-hatched decoys to shrug off the threatening eyes of the government whilst restoring dignity to the historical boat. Includes footage of the city and bays around Hobart, Tasmania (Australia). Suitable for children 6-12 years."
