        "The Campaign is a surprising political documentary where the anatomy of a federal campaign has been laid bare: the logistics, the travelling, the locations, the surroundings and the schedule. For the full 35 days of the 1996 Federal Election campaign, Santo Cilauro and his video-camera followed the then Prime Minister Paul Keating, his entourage and the media pack, around Australia to give a revealing insight into the physical nature of campaigning for the nation's highest office. An inside view of how our view is formed in an era where the election battle is fought with the 15 second grab, this two part program is a dynamic display of how the moment is manufactured. Covering 35 days, 150 journalists, 40,000km, 11 million voters and one man in the middle, The Campaign shows why people describe Australian elections like no other in the world."
