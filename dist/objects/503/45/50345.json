        "Short drama about a fleeting first love between a teenage girl and boy living in an urban beach community. Figuring the couple against an elemental background of eternal sky and sea, the narrative builds on the accumulation of tender moments between them, until the time comes when the boy must leave. Through his fascination with sea salt as a symbol of permanence, the film contrasts the boy's state of unsettledness with the girl's solid sense of place. Cast includes Tom Budge and Jacqui Swallow."
