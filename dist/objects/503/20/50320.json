        "Following in the footsteps of Stanley Kubrick, Adrian Lyne brings to the screen the second film version of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial 1955 novel \"Lolita\". \"Lolita\" follows the exploits of bachelor Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons) who marries a jaded widow (Melanie Griffith), whom he secretly loathes, in order to get closer to his object of obsession, her teenage daughter, Lolita (Dominique Swain). Humbert's obsession for Lolita takes them both to some dark sexual and psychological places. Following his wife's timely death Humbert seizes the opportunity to take Lolita on a cross-country journey - one that tracks the sexual progression of the relationship between step-father and daughter. Having majored in erotic cinema in the past (Nine and a half weeks, Fatal attraction, Indecent proposal, Unfaithful) Adrian Lyne is well placed to deliver the sexual fantasies of Humbert to the big screen. Jeremy Irons is a nervous and manipulative Humbert, suffering guilt for his sexual fantasies even as he exploits Lolita in order to realise them. Dominique Swain is well cast as Lolita - the young nubile nymphette, only faintly aware of the intensity of her sexual power over the hapless Humbert. Original score by Ennio Morricone."
