        "Predator: Dutch, (Arnold Schwarzenneger) a military special forces operative, is sent on a covert rescue mission to a Latin American country. After fighting off a team of local guerrillas, Dutch's own team start to get picked off, by a deadly inhuman force. Deep in the rainforest the camouflaged predator is soon on Dutch's tail - whose skills and deadly cunning make him a worthy match for the stealth of the monster. \"Predator\" is an action movie with traits typical of the science fiction/action genre: throwaway lines, fast moving suspense sequences and insurmountable odds for the hero. \"Predator 2\": The setting for the sequel is the urban jungle of downtown LA. A detective and his crew are baffled by a series of gruesome murders of local drug dealers. An FBI officer warns the team off further investigation, which of course only strengthens the resolve of the team. When part of his own posse is murdered, the detective uncovers the awful truth - the monstrous villain of the original film is back. Like the original, the sequel relies heavily on special effects and action to entertain, this time with Danny Glover in the lead role."
