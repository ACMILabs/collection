        "Disco, rollerskates, ELO and 1940s meets 1980s courtesy of Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly combined in this cult, kitsch, musical fantasy. Kira (Olivia Newton-John) is a Greek muse despatched to Earth to inspire young artist, Sonny Malone (Michael Beck), realise his dream of starting up a disco rollerskating rink called Xanadu. She teams him up with Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly), an ex big club band member and former recipient of Kira's magical influence. Sonny and Danny merge their styles and generations as Kira and Sonny challenge the laws of nature by falling in love. From this threadbare plot emerges a time capsule of 1980s music, fashion, and sensibility that has been simultaneously loved and loathed by viewers."
