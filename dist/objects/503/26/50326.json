        "This honest film is suitable for both fans of the band and social historians. The documentary traces the dramatic rise and fall of the Sex Pistols in 70s London, using a collage of interesting footage from the time of chaos and rebellion. Throughout the film Shakespeare's \"Richard III\" is irreverently referred to as being emblematic of the Sex Pistols being a band created during a time ripe for rebellion and individuality. The band members are interviewed in the shadows as if to keep their current identities hidden. These members give a personal account - as a voice over - throughout the documentary, bringing to life the rare footage of the punk movement."
