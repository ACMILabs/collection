        "An energetic short romantic comedy, with a transsexual twist. As Suz's relationship with her rock musician boyfriend, who is also the father of her young son, grinds to an end, she becomes attracted to Danny, the chef at the restaurant where she works. Danny is the antithesis of her insensitive boyfriend and seduces her with food and humour. Yet thrill and excitement of discovering new love, is temporarily dampened by the emotional confusion Suz experiences when she discovers that Danny was once a woman. Cast includes Kate Oliver, Peter Barron, Sullivan Stapleton and Billy Havir-Smith."
