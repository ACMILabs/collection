        "A young girl, Alice (Isabella Giovinazzo), struggles to understand her father's blindness resulting from an accident and blames herself. Fascinated by the universe, she imagines and wonders about her place in the world but feels connected and a part of the universe, a metaphor for her changing (but growing) understanding. Written and directed by David Rittey."
