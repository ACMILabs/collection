        "After immigrating to America, young Frank and his family move back to Limerick following the death of his infant sister. The family is forced to live in the slums of Ireland, with conditions being much worse than they were in America. His Northern Irish father, Malachy, has difficulty finding work because of his former loyalty to the IRA, and what little money he earns, he drinks away, leaving Frank, his mother Angela, and his young brother to scrounge for coal and beg for food and clothing. Determined to escape the poverty, illness, and death that surrounds him in Ireland, Frank dreams of returning to America. Cast includes Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning autobiography by Frank McCourt. Includes bonus 'Making of' documentary."
