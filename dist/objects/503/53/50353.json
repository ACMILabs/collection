        "Hilarious animated film communicates over forty safety tips for homes with infants and young children. The film's hero is a very earnest, somewhat pompous, but endearing dog called Wally. A \"professional\" in home safety, Wally is assigned to a house with an infant whose parents have little safety consciousness. Accidents and near-accidents succeed each other with lightning speed, constantly putting Wally to the test. This comic film will help viewers of all ages become \"home-safety smart.\" For parents, babysitters, and the elementary school classroom. Music by Eldon Rathburn. Also available on DVD [319319]."
