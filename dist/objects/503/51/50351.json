        "Animated version of the popular children's story by Robert Munsch is about a young boy with a major problem: his apartment has become a subway station but his mother doesn't believe him and blames him for the commuters' mess. Jonathan takes his problem to City Hall and gets his first look at what bureaucratic bungling is all about. Munsch's story is entitled Jonathan Cleaned Up--Then He Heard a Sound. Music by Alex Pauk. Voice and narration by Hannah Goodheart."
