        "Episode of Series \"Enchanted lands\". A compilation of six short animated stories from Enid Blyton's Enchanted Lands series, \"The Magic of the faraway tree\" featuring more fantastic adventures with Joe, Fran and Beth and their Faraway Tree friends. Be amazed in the land of Giants, careful in the land of Topsy Turvy where you might end upside down, and watch those magic spells in the land of Wizards. Excellent animation with lots of colour and movement. Suitable for primary school level."
