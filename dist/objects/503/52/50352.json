        "An animated film about the magic of music. A group of musicians plays on stage. Suddenly, the audience is drawn through a cello into a mysterious world where musical notes assume human qualities. They discover how music is made. A combination of live action and cel animation emphasizes the transition from reality to fantasy. The film works as entertainment and as a teaching tool for children and adults. Film without words."
