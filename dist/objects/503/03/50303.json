        "Cynthia is an unmarried factory worker who lives in a state of siege with her perpetually enraged daughter, Roxanne. In sharp contrast, Cynthia's brother, Maurice, runs a thriving photographic studio and works hard to provide a luxury home for his neurotic, childless wife. Meanwhile, an adopted young black woman, Hortense, is scouring London for her real mother, who, she learns to her shock, is white. Emotions run high as everyone's secrets are exposed. Both hilarious and heartbreaking, Mike Leigh's critically acclaimed box office sensation is a superb film. Stars Timothy Spall, Brenda Blethyn, Phyllis Logan, Mariane Jean-Baptiste and Claire Rushbrook. Written by Mike Leigh. (Awards: Palme D'Or and Best Actress Cannes 1996)"
