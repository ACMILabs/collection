        "Hoping for a life of peace and tranquility selling bonsais, Daniel and Mr. Miyagi once again find themselves up against the odds. Going against Mr. Miyagi's wishes, Daniel will defend his title in an All-Valley Championship match arranged by his nemesis, Kreese, whose karate studio folded after his star pupil lost to Daniel. This time Daniel must face 'the bad boy of karate,' Mike Barnes. When Mr. Miyagi refuses to train Daniel for the tournament, Daniel inevitably falls into the clutches of Terry (Kreese's friend, unbeknownst to Daniel), who takes him on as a karate student. Cast includes: Ralph Macchio, Noriyuki Morita, Robyn Lively, Thomas Ian Griffith and Martin Kove."
