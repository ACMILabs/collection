        "Episode of Series \"Carry on\". A virgin goes missing in the woods in this 'Carry on' spoof, leaving her boyfriend and two hopeless detectives in search of her. Their only clue is the remaining gruesome finger of a \"homo-garganturoso\" (an extinct hairy man) at the scene of the crime. They happen upon a spooky house, complete with expressionless butler, buxom vamp and an undead master of the house. When the lost finger is subjected to an electrical charge, another large hairy man is generated. Why does the mannequin resemble the missing girl and what is the vitrification process? The horror theme is made complete with the usual toilet humour and innuendo of the 'Carry on' crew. Cast includes Harry H. Corbett, Kenneth Williams and Joan Sims."
