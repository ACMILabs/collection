        "David and Jack are two American backpackers off for a three-month trek of Europe. Whilst wandering the desolate English countryside they happen upon a quaint pub with a mysterious patron who warns them not to leave the road when walking after dark. Ignoring such advice (as characters in horror films always do), the two inevitably find themselves lost in the moors being circled by a strange beast who attacks and kills Jack. David wakes up in a London hospital with nasty scratch wounds to his cheek and shoulder, and Jack soon appears, freshly deceased and rapidly decomposing, to deliver the grim news that David will in fact turn into a werewolf the next full moon. David dismisses the encounter as a hallucination, but all indications point to lycanthrope. Cast includes: David Naughton, Jenny Agutter and Griffin Dunne."
