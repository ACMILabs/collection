        "This film explores the concept that inanimate objects such as barber poles, candy wrappers, clothing and furniture can communicate complex and subtle messages about people and things. As images of familiar objects are presented, a rhythmic country-rock song raises questions about the messages they carry. The viewer is encouraged to think about how objects stimulate our associations in order to communicate an idea or manipulate our responses. Images by John Seale."
