        "This short drama, shot in grainy colour, explores the conflict between a father and daughter within a contemporary Greek-Australian family. Estranged from her family for some time, a young women decides spontaneously to attend her father's nameday party. When he rejects her, she determines to finally uncover the whole truth about a dark family secret that has haunted her since childhood. Told in a non-linear style, the film weaves together fragments of symbolic imagery and sound to evoke the memories that cause the daughter to suspect her father of murder. Each image sheds light on the previous, as the mysterious connection between the past and the present at the centre of the story is gradually revealed."
