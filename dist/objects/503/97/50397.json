        "Episode of Series \"A Discussion in bioethics\". One of a series of short, open-ended dramas designed to stimulate discussion of values and ethics in relation to modern medical technology. This film looks at questions surrounding life-prolonging treatment for disabled newborns. When a teenage girl discovers that her newborn baby suffers from spina bifida and hydrocephalus, she refuses to agree to a life-saving shunt. While her boyfriend, the father, tries to convince her to accept responsibility for the infant, the hospital awaits their signed consent to proceed with the operation."
