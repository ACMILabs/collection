        "It is August 1988, one hundred years since Jack the Ripper committed his brutal murders in the East End of London and now Los Angeles finds itself experiencing that very same fear as a copy-cat \"Jack the Ripper\" is on the loose, stalking the streets and murdering his prostitute victims in the same cold and calculated manner as his predecessor one hundred years ago. However in this tale, there is an unusual twist to the plot involving a young physician (James Spader) and his twin brother. Cast includes Cynthia Gibb, Jim Haynie, Robert Picardo and Rod Loomis."
