        "Set initially in apartheid South Africa, this deliberately paced, beautifully photographed, short drama explores the legacy of small acts of racism for the post-apartheid era. A white farmer trains his puppy to hate black people using a young Xhosa boy who loves the dog, as the pawn in his lesson. Ten years later in the new South Africa, the boy, now grown, is employed as a farmhand by the farmer. One day when the two men are working together, an incident occurs where both their lives are placed at the mercy of the vicious dog, due to the cruel lesson inflicted upon it years before. Cast: Anele Vellom, Lizo C. Makambi, Danny Keogh, Terry Norton. Awards: Best Short Film and Best Original Screenplay St. Kilda Film Festival 2002."
