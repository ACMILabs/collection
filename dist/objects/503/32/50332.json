        "Lissa is intrigued by the odd behaviour of new next door neighbours. Her curiosity grows into sexual attraction for Michael the awkward son, who although he performs a weird foot washing ritual at night, is virile and shares an increased sexuality with the onset of adolescence. Two worlds collide and the rituals of 'vitalogy' become unstuck as illness forces the new neighbours to face a different world. Cast includes Tenley Gilmore as the cool and confident Lissa and Stephen Pilkington as Michael (with Margot Knight and Brian Lipson). Winner Best Australian Short Comedy Melbourne International Film Festival 1991."
