        "This documentary focuses on children of alcoholics. In the relaxed environment of a mountain campsite, a group of young people discuss their anger and frustration, and talk about their struggle to cope with the problems created by their parents' drinking. By sharing their experiences, they open a door for others like them. Aimed primarily at an audience of elementary school children and older, Children of Alcohol will provide an excellent vehicle for generating discussion about alcohol abuse and the family."
