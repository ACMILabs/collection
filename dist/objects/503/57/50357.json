        "A Room Full of Energy was produced to familiarize children with the concept of energy and to stimulate their interest in energy conservation. Through the magic of animation, the moon comes down from the sky to reveal the marvels of energy to a young boy and girl. The film describes the nature and role of every type of energy, from wood-burning to nuclear energy, illustrating where each comes from and how it is used. Music by Rick Elger."
