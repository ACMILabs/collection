        "Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are two teenagers who are on the verge of flunking out of high school. Acing an oral history assignment the next day is all that will spare the friends from being separated, as Ted's draconian father is on the cusp of shipping Ted off to academy school. From the future, arrives Rufus (George Carlin), in a time travelling phone box. His mission is to give Bill and Ted the means to learn history in one night enabling them to pass their oral test. Bill and Ted rise to the challenge and ride the phone box to various times past, picking up figures of historical significance that will assist them with their presentation. Bill and Ted collect Napoleon, Joan of Arc, Socrates, Sigmund Freud, Billy the Kid and Genghis Khan. Co-written by Ed Solomon (Men in black, Charlie's angels), \"Bill and Ted's excellent adventure\", is an example of \"dude\" teen humour, continued with the likes of \"Wayne's world\". Reeves and Winter are effective as the hapless dudes, equipped with their own language and logic, and a shared love of Van Halen. Directed by Stephen Herek (Mr Holland's opus, Rock Star, Life or something like it)."
