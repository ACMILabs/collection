    "description": [
        "Adapted for the screen by David Williamson from his own stage play, Tim Burstall's broad, low-budget comedy is one of the earliest, and most commercially successful, releases of the 1970s Australian film 'renaissance'.  The adventures of the seven-foot-tall, Marcuse-quoting, would-be-revolutionary 'ocker', Stork, (Bruce Spence) satirise many aspects of contemporary Australian society and values. \"The targets of its humour are the social goals and values of the middle-classes - conformity, ambition, marriage, the pretensions of the corporate world or the academic and art establishments.\" (Tim Burstall)."
