        "A sink full of bloodied knives and the bodies of two young girls are found. Based on a true story, this movie length pilot has Theo, \"I aint rich but at least I dress well\", detective Kojak in charge as the largest man hunt in New York ensues. A simple black boy is arrested and charged. It appears though that the confession was forced, the integrity of the commended and respected policemen in question. A court struggle drags on as Kojak sets out to discover the real murderer. Drugs, grime, poverty and hard hitting detective work spice up this television police drama. Telly Savalas plays the strong and masculine Kojak who shows his sensitive side, as all good policemen do."
