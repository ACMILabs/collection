        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Carry on\". On the eve of retirement Sergeant Grimshaw (William Hartnell) hopes, with the arrival of his new and last National Service recruits, to retire with the honour of winning the Star Squad prize. His plans are tested when the recruits show themselves to be a motley crew of prankish misfits. The first in the Carry On series is a bright wartime comical farce. With only a few of the regular Carry On crew we see Kenneth Williams (as James Bailey) in one of his funniest performances. Cast also includes: Shirley Eaton, Eric Barker, Dora Bryan, Bill Owen, Charles Hawtrey, Kenneth Connor, Terence Longdon, Norman Rossington, Gerald Campion, Hattie Jacques, Cyril Chamberlain, Arnold Diamond and Gordon Tanner."
