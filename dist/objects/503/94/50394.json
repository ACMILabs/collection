        "This exotic film provides a detailed picture of a very different culture, a cooperative and conserver society of the North China plain. Life here revolves around agriculture--wheat, rice and cotton crops--and almost everyone is involved in their intense cultivation. A cotton factory in an industrial city reveals another link in China's massive, coordinated efforts to ensure its people adequate food, clothing, shelter and jobs."
