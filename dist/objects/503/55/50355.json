        "The Movie Movie shows how the camera, editing techniques, make-up and sound can be used in film and video to deliberately manipulate our perceptions and emotions. Drama, action and slapstick humor are combined in a simple, family-oriented plot. There is no dialogue, but there is an explanatory song. Behind-the-scenes vignettes highlight the message that in a movie everything is not quite as it seems. Script and Text by Don White and Bruce Ruddell.Edited by Charles Wilkinson. Music by Bruce Ruddell."
