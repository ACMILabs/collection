        "When his girlfriend decides to do an extra shift at the stripclub where she works, a young man embarks alone on a surreal, drug-fuelled journey. Their separate experiences over the course of the night leave them both shaken, and with their reunion in the morning comes a heightened awareness of how much they mean to one another. Cast includes Mark Priestley and Haley McElhinney."
