        "Mugs, mitts and toothbrushes hang from their respective nails, awaiting ten pairs of hands. At the farmhouse on Cape Breton Island where Shawn Peter Dwyer, age ten, lives with his mother and nine brothers and sisters, a team effort keeps the family functioning. The children work and play together. Their pockets are usually empty, but their lives are well filled. A useful film for the study of values and lifestyles."
