        "An Astronauts view of the earth explores the history behind the development of space photography and discusses how human perceptions of themselves have been changed by this. A planet amongst planets, satellite photography has taught us about human scale and provides us with a snapshot of humans' affect on the environment. A number of space shuttle astronauts draw connections between their work and the environment, science philosophy and history. With striking footage throughout, most notable being a full circle of the earth filmed from a satellite 180 miles out from earth. From the first aerial photograph to the sophisticated IMAX cameras this documentary charts the development of the technology used to photograph and film the earth and reveals a fragility of the earth with increasing clarity. Introduced by Dr. Patrick Moore, leading world cosmologist and narrated by William Shatner with music score by David Byrne and Pat Irwin."
