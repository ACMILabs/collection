        "Directed by Tony Scott, \"Top gun\" was the film that catapulted Tom Cruise into mega stardom. Cruise plays Lieutenant Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, a hotshot navy pilot, with no respect for rules, regulations or authority. Maverick is training at the Top Gun Naval Flying School, where he is out to prove himself to be the best of the best, at all costs. Maverick flies recklessly, but with skill, co-piloted by his best mate Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards). Maverick is somewhat haunted by his father's legacy, also a pilot, whose error whilst flying may have caused his own death and that of others. At the school Maverick encounters competition to be the top pilot from Lieutenant Tom 'Iceman' Kazanski (Val Kilmer) who mocks Maverick's braggadocio and family history. Simultaneously Maverick is attracted to an instructor at the school, Charlie (Kelly McGillis) and is forced to face his personal demons in light of the strengthening feelings for her. \"Top gun\" features several daredevil flying scenes and has a sub-plot involving a run-in (mid-air) with some rogue Russian pilots. \"Top gun\" was the highest grossing film of 1986 in the United States. Also starring Tom Skerritt, as a flight instructor, and Meg Ryan as the Goose's wife."
