        "Australian supermodel Sarah O'Hare makes her acting debut as one of four models to share a plush Manhatten apartment with our protagonist, Amanda (Monica Potter). Single Amanda is cursed with dating the wrong men and when she spots handsome Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr,) out her window - a man she met under curious circumstances in the lobby - she becomes instantly attracted and decidedly cautious. Under the guidance of her new flatmates, Amanda crashes a party at Jim's and discovers he is almost too good to be true. Voyeurism wreaks havoc between the two soulmates when Amanda sees what she believes to be Jim committing a murder. When the police fail to locate a body she takes it upon herself to get to the bottom of the matter, ably assisted and hindered by her model friends. Cast also includes Ivana Milicevic, Shalom Harlow, Tomiko Fraser and China Chow."
