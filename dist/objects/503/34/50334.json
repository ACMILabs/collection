        "Animated film that charts the short-lived adventures of an intrepid strawberry as it evades a variety of kitchen hazards - including vicious utensils, distraction by a Busby Berkeley-style fruit mambo, and a seductive but ultimately deadly pot of melted chocolate - to fulfill its quest to sit atop a decadent whipped cream and meringue dessert. \"A glossy tale with a sticky end.\""
