        "A dark tale of obsession and loneliness about a grotesque man searching literally and metaphorically for his other half. Through the violent coalescence of his neighbour he achieves his goal, but her resistance forces him to face the painful, irresolvable nature of his obsession with completeness. Cast includes Nicholas Hope and Lisa Angove. Written by Peter McDonald, photography by Murray Lui."
