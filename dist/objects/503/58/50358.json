        "A Sense of Sound illustrates relationships among sight, hearing and other senses as sources of information about the world. A kaleidoscope of everyday visual images, accompanied by a sometimes realistic, sometimes playful sound track, shows how sound communicates messages and stimulates associations with past experiences. The juxtaposition of sensible and nonsense associations encourages the viewer to examine how we interpret auditory messages."
