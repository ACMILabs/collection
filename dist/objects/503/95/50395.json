        "An animated short film that follows the tribulations of a cartoon character, Bob Dog, as he hunts for a job. Self-motivation, preparing a resume, contacting people by phone and mail, getting ready for an interview and the interview itself--all are dealt with in a highly entertaining fashion. The Motown mover Get a Job provides the upbeat musical sound track."
