        "A humorous, animated science film that introduces students to the nature of energy and energy conservation, as well as to the second law of thermodynamics, entropy. The points are underscored by the observations of an all-seeing dog in need of a doghouse, whose master, though obsessed with machines, is finally convinced that the simplest tool is sometimes the most energy-efficient! Voice and Narration by Terrence Labrosse. Music by Peter Mendieta."
