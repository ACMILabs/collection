        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Romans in Britain\". The first installment of the Roman's in Britain Series discusses the history of Britain in relation to the Roman invasion and occupation of its shores over a number of centuries. The program explores the tribal groups that previously occupied the area and the systematic take over that the Romans succeeded in achieving in AD43 and the subsequent impact this had on the cultural and societal life of the previous inhabitants. Through thorough narration, interviews with historians and archaeologists, reenactments, reconstructions of archaeological findings and excerpts from film and television depictions of this historical period the various myths, facts and speculations about this time in history are explored and analysed with a view to creating an accurate perspective on the classical past in Britain and the Roman impact on the country that is still visible today."
