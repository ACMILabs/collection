        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Romans in Britain\". The third program in the \"Roman's in Britain\" series which discusses the history of one of the most famous landmarks of Roman Britain, Hadrian's Wall. Through interviews with historians, archaeologists and museum curators and a discussion of artifacts and construction patterns present at the site, this episode explores the various theories about who built the wall, its purpose for the Roman Empire, and the impact it had on early Britain. A commentary on the gradual downfall of the Romans in Britain and their remaining legacy in a variety of forms in the country concludes the program."
