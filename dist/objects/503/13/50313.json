        "Growing up in a small town in Northern England, crippled by strikes, Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) tries to discover his place in the world. His mother dead, a brother and father on the picket line, Billy fills his days with tending to his grandmother and hanging out with his crossing-dressing friend. However, Billy wants more and he finds his calling when one day he decides to join in on a ballet class. Seeing that Billy has a natural talent the Ballet Teacher (Julie Walters) suggests to him that he try out for a the Royal Ballet School in London. The pair train in preparation but all is nearly lost when Billy's father and brother find out about his passion for ballet. Billy Elliot is a touching story that explores the confines of masculinity within the back drop of the 1980's violent struggle between the unions and the Thatcher government."
