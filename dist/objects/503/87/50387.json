        "One effect of the women's movement in western societies has been the gradual realization by some males that they are also trapped by stereotypes. In this film, sixteen- and seventeen-year-old boys talk candidly about how the traditional image of maleness fits their own experience. Young men, the film shows, are beginning to re-evaluate their role in society."
