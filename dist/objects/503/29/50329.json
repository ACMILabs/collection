        "The Rutles is a mockumentary, a parody of The Beatles and Beatlemania written and co-directed by Eric Idle, of Monty Python fame. The Rutles are Dirk, Barry, Stig and Nasty. Made for television, \"The Rutles\" charts the rise of the band of the same name as they progress from English obscurity to world phenomena. Using mockumentary footage and interviews, \"The Rutles\" documents the pre-fab four's journey right through to their messy break up and post-Rutle lives. Idle plays a series of characters including Rutle Dirk and a hapless BBC type interviewer who narrates the film. \"The Rutles\" mocks the BBC, documentary filmmakers, and The Beatles' films and music. Features excerpts from The Rutles films - Yellow Submarine Sandwich, Tragical History Tour, OUCH!, and A Hard Day's Rut. Songs include Please rut me, All you need is cash and Twist and rut. \"The Rutles\" also features George Harrison, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Bianca Jagger, Ron Wood, Mick Jagger, Paul Simon and Bill Murray. \"The Rutles\" is a sharp and witty send up of any number of documentaries made about The Beatles."
