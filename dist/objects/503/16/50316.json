        "Based on the controversial sequel novel, \"Hannibal\" is the follow-up film to \"Silence of the Lambs\". After ten years of hiding following his escape from custody, Hannibal Lecter, a feared and cunning serial killer, resurfaces to toy with FBI agent Clarice Starling. As Starling's career flounders thanks to an ill-fated drug bust, Lecter attempts to elude an Italian police detective who has cottoned on to Lecter's true identity. We are also introduced to a maimed and wealthy former victim of Lecter's, Mason Verger, who plots to avenge the doctor in a most grisly and unusual manner. Cast includes: Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta, Frankie R. Faison, Giancarlo Giannini and Gary Oldman (uncredited and unrecognisable as Mason Verger)."
