        "Two thirty-something women, Alice, an aspiring filmmaker, and Sandy, a student with a messy love life, meet regularly to walk around the domain. As they walk they talk about the state of their lives, yet, due especially to Sandy's self-obsession and insensitivity, their conversations are less dialogues than therapeutic monologues. The tables are turned when Sandy's unsympathetic response to her friend's creative struggles, and her dismissive remark to 'just do it' have an unexpected outcome. Cast: Alison Whyte, Alice Garner."
