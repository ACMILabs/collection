        "Explores the place where the need to survive and the need to be loved and belong meet personal choices in the transition to adulthood of two street hustlers. An indictment of how we exploit each other sexually, emotionally and financially in the '90's and the need to rediscover compassion for the frailties, failings and weaknesses of others. River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves play two young male prostitutes trying to survive homeless on the streets of Portland. A dazzling combination of realist street cinema, experimental narrative, and a homoerotic homage to Shakespeare, \"My Own Private Idaho\" is a stand-out, confronting independent film."
