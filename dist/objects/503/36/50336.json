        "A questioning of religious beliefs and values as seen through the eyes of 11-year-old Malcolm, an altar boy. Malcolm lives with his mother and younger brother in a caravan and earns himself a bit of pocket money by doing jobs and helping out his elderly neighbour, Poppy. When Poppy suffers a stroke, Malcolm is faced with the dubious motives of his own mother and Poppy's son Charles who is trying to find the Deed Box containing Poppy's family papers and documents. Malcolm's ultimate intervention achieves a kind of absolution for them all. Cast includes Malcolm Roberts (as Malcolm), Kim Dawson, Edward Primrose, Cathleen Cooper, Eli Roberts."
