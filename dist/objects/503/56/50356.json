        "At thirty-five, Lynn Ryan took stock of her life. She had five children, no husband, no job, and the outlook for getting off welfare seemed bleak. That was when she decided to change her life. After help from employment counsellors and a course in welding, she now has a good job as an apprentice engineer in a Vancouver shipyard. This is a vivid picture of a tough-minded woman and her courageous encounter with life."
