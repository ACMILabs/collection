        "Produced to commemorate the twenty year of ICEM's existence, this film aims to highlight one of the fundamental human rights - the freedom of movement - and to demonstrates at the same time that through well-planned migration an effective contribution can be made to people looking for better opportunities as well as to countries overseas to strengthen their economic position for further development. Looks at the various programmes carried out by ICEM in the last twenty years and projects some expected future problems of people and their movement in the world."
