        "A young boy finds a lost homing pigeon in a nearby vacant lot. The pigeon's rightful owner advertises for his return, but the rescuer is unwilling to give up the bird, which he has tenderly looked after. The film explores the concepts of ownership and responsibility for one's actions. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
