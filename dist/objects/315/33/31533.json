        "A tongue-in-cheek film, a mixture of documentary and dramatic effect, on the subject of garbage in general and, in particular, the part it plays in the life of a young man named Simon, cast in the role of a latter-day Adam. His fateful act of tossing away an apple core sets in motion all we know about litter, waste, garbage dumps, and the most recent development, recycling."
