        "A study of the slums and shanty towns of Bogota, Columbia, showing the transformation of squatter settlements into permanent, steadily improving neighbourhoods. Many of the problems encountered here arise from the rapid increase in population and intensive settlements of migrants in the city. Lacking in adequate training for most of the jobs offered, migrants have settled on government land in Bogota and attempt to eke out an existence in poor conditions."
