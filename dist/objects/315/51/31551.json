        "His canvases breathe with the spirit and pride of the Indian, and the untouched wilderness that was his domain. Travelling overland west to the Pacific in the mid-1800s, Paul Kane painted the northwest, the great Indian tribes, chiefs, ceremonies, war parties, buffalo hunts, rapids and waterfalls. In this film his paintings are projected with lighting that brings to life every glowing detail."
