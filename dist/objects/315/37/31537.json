        "Episode of Series \"Indonesia\". Bali is one of the many Indonesian islands, but it differs from the other Muslim islands in that the people are mainly Hindu, with some Buddhists and an underlying interest in nature worship and even roots of ancient nature worship. Shows the daily life of the Balinese, which is governed by a voluntary village council, the farming and fishing, the market and the monkey dance. Narrated by Roger Climpson.
