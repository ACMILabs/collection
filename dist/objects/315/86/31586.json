        "Before setting out on a camping trip, careful planning is necessary. The film demonstrates the choice of equipment, the proper food and clothing required and how a rucksack should be packed. For the trip itself, other hints include the various ways to cross a river, finding the route, marking the trail, building a fire and the correct handling of firearms."
