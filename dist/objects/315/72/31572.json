        "The silicon chip has become cheaper and has doubled in sophistication each year. The film looks at what it is, how it works, how it is made, and at its mushrooming applications. Some idea of what goes on inside the \"black box\" of the microcomputer is given by use of animated cartoon film. Finally we are asked how far computer controlled machines can go in imitating human functions."
