        "World population is now 3.6 billion. The human race has doubled its numbers since 1920. It may have doubled again by the end of the century. This is a report on the population problem in Southeast Asia showing the various dimensions of the problem, including the different attitudes of people in cities and rural areas toward birth control and family planning. A solution to the population crisis must be found before any real attempt can be made to overcome many of the major problems facing the world today so as to ensure the quality of life and social justice of all."
