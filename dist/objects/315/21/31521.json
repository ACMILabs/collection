        "Episode of Series \"Regional Geography\". The Fenlands situated in Eastern England are one of the flattest regions of Britain. The Fenland landscape is almost wholly manmade, being the result of draining the land, to make it available for agriculture. The danger of flooding is ever present, and in 1947 a disastrous flood occurred. In an attempt to overcome the problem, an extensive sluice system has been devised."
