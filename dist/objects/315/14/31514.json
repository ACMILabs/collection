        "Episode of Series \"Tales from Hoffnung\". It is the late 19th century in the lounge of an expensive hotel, where the Palm Court Orchestra is playing to a tea drinking audience. A fire starts and the hotel is soon ablaze, the people flee, but the orchestra plays on. In a series of other situations the orchestra also plays on. Based on a series of cartoon drawings by Gerard Hoffnung."
