        "Portrays cross-country skiing as a pleasure sport as well as an Olympic event. Pleasure skiers are shown traversing magnificent mountain country inaccessible to hikers and down-hill skiers; and skiers in turn of the century costume are seen using telemark turns to ski deep powder snow. The film also demonstrates techniques used by the Olympic team which will enhance the skills of, and provide additional pleasure to Nordic skiers. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
