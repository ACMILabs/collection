        "Using a mixture of 2D computer animation styles influenced my Manga films, Flare is surreal with images of insects seen through the microscrope, metaphorically illustrating the obsessions and world of a dedicated scientist. The scientist is confronted by his daughter who insists he talk with her about family issues of the past. The father ignores his daughters request and chooses to bury himself in his work."
