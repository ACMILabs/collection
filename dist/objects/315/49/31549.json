        "Spacious, limitless as they may seem, Canada's National Parks may not be able to keep up with the demands made on their resources without a continuing program of extending the parks system. Wilderness may, in fact, be the greatest heritage this generation of Canadians can leave to future generations. The problems, and the need to act now, are well defined in this film by concerned conservationists."
