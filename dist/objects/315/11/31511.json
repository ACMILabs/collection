        "Three young people (Tony Evans, Stewart Graham and Karen Alexander) set out to climb Federation Peak, a rarely climbed mountain in the rugged South West region of Tasmania. The difficulties they encounter en route include bad weather and the dangerous nature of the terrain. After a few days climbing, the trio finally achieve their goal and reach the summit of Federation Peak."
