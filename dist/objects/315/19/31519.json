        "A colorful, rollicking account of Nova Scotia's rum-running days, told in part by mariners who made the runs into forbidden American ports some fifty years ago, and in part by re-enactments of their tales by actors. The sources of their profitable illegal cargoes were the French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, quiet enough now, but once busy rendezvous for smugglers."
