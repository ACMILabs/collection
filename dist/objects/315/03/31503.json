        "Marcel Marceau, world famous French mime, talks about his life and work, about his theories on mime and the history of pantomime in the theatre. He traces mime through the Greek theatre, the commedia del'arte, the Pierrot of the 19th century and the comics of film, like Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, and Laurel and Hardy. Marceau started out to be a painter and still does drawings and paintings. He feels that mime is closely related to the graphic arts as well as to music and dance."
