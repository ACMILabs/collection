        "What happens to the things that blow away? Like the bubbles you blew on a sunny day? Where do they all go, anyway? To the attic of the wind. The lost treasures of childhood are not really lost but are stored away, along with the rest of the world's lost treasures in the Attic of the Wind. Delicate, dream-like artwork and music combine to create a fantasy world where the past is always fresh and the magic of childhood never fades. Based on the book by Doris Herold Lund, illustrated by Ati Forberg. Photography by Alexander Cochran."
