        "Traces a young boy's venture into creating a sculpture of \"found art\". He collects cast-off wood, metal and plastic objects from an amusement park and proceeds to a mud flat to create his figure. Other sculptures of similar materials are also assembled here in an open air \"gallery\". As he works the film depicts the boy's fanciful flights and shows the possibilities for artistic expression are infinite when aided by resourcefulness and imagination No commentary, music only."
