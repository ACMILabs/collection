        "The circumnavigation of the continents of North and South America, for long a navigator's dream, was accomplished in 1970 by the Canadian Scientific Ship \"Hudson\" as part of Canada's commitment to the International Oceanographic Decade, a project of UNESCO. Here is the ship's log, detailing the many kinds of research in which the \"Hudson\" engaged. The last phase of the 47,000 mile voyage documented, for the first time, scientific investigations of the polar seas above Canada."
