        "Coal miners once took caged canaries into the mines. By collapsing and dying, the tiny birds warned of the presence of deadly gases. Today workers themselves have become the canaries for other workers and society as a whole. The film examines lethal industrial-linked disease in factory workers as well as management and official indifference to this problem."
