A study of non-verbal communication in young children featuring the work of biologist Prof. Hubert Montagner who has discovered a correlation between the behavior of children and the attitudes of the mother toward the child. He also suggests that physiological changes in the mother - specifically the level of various hormones - are mirrored in the child. Made by British Boradcasting Corporation."
