        "An animated story with symbolism that touches on a universal human truth. It is an animated film about a little manikin (made of a few twists of wire) who juggles balls around him, always preferring the biggest and the brightest and overlooking a plain white one, the oddball. It is only when the other balls turn fickle and elude his grasp that he discovers the worth of the little white ball. His every reaction is mimed with complete conviction. (Award: Salerno)"
