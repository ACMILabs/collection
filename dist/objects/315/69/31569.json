        "Documentary-style story of a nuclear attack on Kent, England. This horrific film is a vision of the possible consequences of a nuclear attack on Britain. Much of the filming was done with a hand-held camera and the result is a film with an impact of remarkable immediacy. An uncompromising film about the latent horrors of the atomic bomb. Note: Not recommended for children."
