        "Provides an overview of the first German settlers to the Port Phillip District in 1850 who settled mainly at Westgarthtown which became Thomastown. These first settlers did not speak any English and brought the Lutheran religion to Australia. This German community worked hard to retain the values, beliefs and cultural background of Germany."
