        "Looks at two classes, one at year 4 and one at year 10, engaged in effective enquiry learning. Both are investigating local issues involving the environment, plus the decision making processes that enable change to take place. Different stages of the enquiry sequence are featured which allow observations to be made about teaching strategies and the learning processes."
