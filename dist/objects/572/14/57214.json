        "Three programs which show different periods of school life in Victoria. \"A Day at Ascot-Vale School no. 2608\" is a silent film showing some of the daily activities at a primary school in the twenties. The second film is silent and untitled, but shows life at a primary school in the 40's or 50's. The third film is similarly untitled but is in colour and with sound. It shows different aspects of teaching in Victoria in the 50's, with a substantial section on teacher training and country schools. \"Each one is different\" introduces the concept of child-centred education in Victorian schools."
