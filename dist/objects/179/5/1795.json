        "Synthing is the result of years of exploratory work across disciplines. \"The Synthing concept puts expressive and energetic body movement in front of a video camera interface to create an engrossing interplay of music and images within the framework of a cybermedium... a synaesthetic compositional tool\", says Gruchy. Synthing, through its use of real-time navigation and interactive technologies, allows real opportunities for audience interaction."
