        "The activities and amusements which made up the life of those attending the first International Girl Guides Camp to be held in Australia are shown. Guides came from many countries including Great Britain, USA and the Far East. The arrival at the camp site and settling in are followed by scenes depicting cooking, washing, singing and the other aspects of camp life. Amusements include a visit to Healesville Wild Life Sanctuary, an exhibition of boomerang throwing and national dances. The film concludes with a portrait of Lady Baden-Powell."
