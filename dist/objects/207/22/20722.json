        "The Outward Bound School on the Hawkesbury River is attended by young men of various backgrounds, from all parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea. Here they share many adventures - bushwalking, rock climbing and boating. Before participating in any expeditions they learn the fundamentals of map and compass reading, first aid and safety. The course is designed to teach self-discipline, give confidence, a sense of responsibility and achievement. Wholehearted participation in all activities prepares the boys to take their places in the community always remembering the Outward Bound motto - \"To serve, to strive, and not to yield\". No credits available - donated by the Shell Company of Australia."
