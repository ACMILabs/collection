        "Terra Nova Park, Newfoundland, is the most recent example of the purpose and dimension of Canada's national parks system - a plan which sets aside, for the enjoyment of present and future generations, scenic acres of wilderness, undisturbed except for roads, camp-sites, and other amenities. This film shows how Terra Nova was developed and how it offers a restful escape from the clamor of the city. Award: Annual Film Festival, Columbus, Ohio."
