        "An impressionistic and witty portrayal of the election rituals which periodically grip the U.S. electorate - usually in the fall. Using the 1966 Reagan - Brown campaign in California as an example, the film conveys the excitement, rhetoric and rivalry with which the candidates and the issues are presented to the public. Narrated by Lee Marvin. No other credits available."
