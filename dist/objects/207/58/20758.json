        "Episode of Series \"Mechanical Drawing\". Begins by showing that the three principal views do not represent the true surface of an object that has one or more slanting faces. This condition is shown to require projection of the slanting surface on a plane which is parallel to it and is not one of the principle planes. This auxiliary projection is explained and defined. No other credits available."
