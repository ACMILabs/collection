        "Playwright Michel Tremblay and director Andre Bassard have a talent for capturing the earthy wit and language of Montreal's east-end working class neighbourhood, rendering them into live theatre described by some critics as \"outrageously funny\". Both their vision and their style have had an important influence on other Quebec artists."
