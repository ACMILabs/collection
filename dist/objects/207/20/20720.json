        "The National University in Canberra opened in 1946 is a University new in foundation and purpose. It is for post graduate studies only, and the work undertaken there is on projects related to original research designed to add to the sum of human knowledge. There are four research schools connected with medical research, physical sciences, Pacific studies and social sciences. The purpose of the University is to allow concentration on research and by so doing attract some of the best brains to remain in Australia instead of going to research centres overseas."
