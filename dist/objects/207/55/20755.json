        "Episode of Series \"21st Century\". The redesign, computerization and possible elimination of automobiles in the next century is predicted in this film. Experimental models using new power sources, and the trend towards taking responsibility away from human drivers are examined. A partially automated driving system, as well as dual-mode cars which hook up to an electric rail roadway where computers take full control are demonstrated. Major considerations in the prototypes studied are safety, air pollution and traffic congestion. Reporter: Walter Cronkite."
