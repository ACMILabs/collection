        "Magazine items: Bush Hostel: the dingo-proof fence which runs along the border of New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia is patrolled and repaired. The Todd family live on the job and the three children have been taught by correspondence but are now able to attend school for the first time. Tea and Sugar Train: Fifty maintenance camps are scattered along the Trans Continental Railway which runs along the Nullabor Plain. Weekly trains bring essential supplies and news to families at these lonely outposts. No other credits available."
