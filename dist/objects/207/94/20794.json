        "A slow motion study by Norman McLaren of the pas-de-deux adagio, one of the most exacting and difficult dances of the classical ballet. A ballet originally choreographed by the Russian ballet master Asaf Messerer is performed in this film by the internationally known Canadian pair David and Anna Marie Holmes, to the music of Albinoni's \"Adagio\". A film to heighten the aesthetic appreciation of classical ballet and to afford observation of the technique and mechanics of the adagio movements. Photographed by Jaques Fogel and Douglas Kiefer. (Awards: Melbourne, Atlanta, Columbus, Bogota)"
