        "The life story of the founder of the Boy Scout Movement, compiled form original film records. His early life is shown by linking photographs and his personal sketches of such important events as the Ashanti campaign and the siege of Mafeking. From its unofficial beginning in South Africa the Movement is traced to the Boy Scout groups which Baden-Powell established all over Britain. He is seen attending world jamboree as World Chief Scout, and excerpts from his addresses are given. No other credits available."
