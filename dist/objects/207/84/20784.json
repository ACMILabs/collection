        "Animated drawings showing the balance sheet of Imperial Chemical Industries for 1950. Vivacious little \"match stick\" men, aided by ever active \"Pound\" and other devices perform against a backdrop of graphs and ledgers. An interesting example of simplified animation technique in which an unpopular subject is treated in an entertaining way."
