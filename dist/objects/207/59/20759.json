        "Episode of Series \"Engineering Drawing\". Begins with a brief review of the principles of orthographic projection and goes on to show that the three views obtained by projection on the three principal planes do not represent the true shape of some surfaces of an object that has one or more slanting faces. This condition is shown to require projection of the slanting surface on a plane which is parallel to it and not one of the principal planes. Thus auxiliary projection is explained and defined."
