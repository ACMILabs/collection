        "An animated replay of the human comedy as amusing in its perception as in the way it caricatures man's propensity to resort to violence rather than reason. The whole area of conflict is reduced to its simplest dimensions - cubes and balls representing opposing protagonists. Why they fight and what happens after the battle is a parody of human nature. A film without commentary. (Awards: Palme d'Or, Cannes; Colombo; Buenos Aires)"
