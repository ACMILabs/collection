        "A travelogue on Bali, one of the 7,000 islands that make up the land mass of Indonesia. We visit a fishing village, see examples and areas showing the ingenious terrace cultivation of rice. Many of the entertainments shown are based on Hindu-Balinese religious beliefs which also play a large part in the everyday life of villagers."
