        "Edward Villella, lead dancer with the New York City Ballet, dissolves the notion that male dancers are 'sissified' in a montage of dances demonstrating the muscular control necessary in his art. Shows how the body is made into a smoothly working organism while expressing ideas and feelings. Includes excerpts from NYC Ballet productions."
