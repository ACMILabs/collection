        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Australian Wildlife\". A study of the wildlife of the Victorian Mallee, a land of drifting sand and Mallee Scrub. Small animal life struggles for existence under these poor conditions, where rare waterholes mean life or death. The interesting Mallee Fowl which buries its eggs in incubating mounds, and mysteriously controls its heat; and the Bowerbird which builds a so-called bower for its mating display are shown, together with Wedgetailed eagles, kangaroos, ant lions, honeyeaters and Major Mitchell cockatoos. Photographed by Robert H. Clarke, narrated by Peter Wagner and devised by naturalist Graham Pizzey."
