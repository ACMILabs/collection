        "Magazine items: Drought, A sheep station in N.S.W. faces ruin because of one of the worst-ever droughts; rain has not fallen for 18 months and water for limited use is brought in by truck. Bundaberg: the Queensland coastal port which serves a rich agricultural area with a near tropical climate and rich volcanic soil. Birth place of the famous airman, Bert Hinkler, it is a prosperous city which thrives on the extensive sugar cane industry. No other credits available."
