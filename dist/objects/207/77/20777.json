        "Heyer's romantic impression of life in the inland of Australia featuring the Birdsville Track and its postman, Tom Kruse. Highlights the isolation of the people on outback stations and small towns, and the importance in their lives of the postman and the pedal wireless. Notable in the history of documentary for its strong visuals and use of natural speech, and for being the first production of the Shell Film Unit in Australia. Commentary spoken by Kevin Brennan."
