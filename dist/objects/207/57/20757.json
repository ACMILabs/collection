    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"Engineering Drawing\". Begins with a quick view of orthographic projection on three principal planes and on auxiliary planes; then points out that a new condition is introduced if the object to be drawn has a slanting face that is not perpendicular to any of the principal planes. The film shows why a single auxiliary view does not give an accurate picture of an oblique face. The theory of double auxiliary or oblique view is then described in detail, using the visualization effects of combined animated drawings and animated models."
