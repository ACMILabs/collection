        "This influential erotic horror film, directed by Jesus Franco, established the reputation of erotic actress and horror icon, Lina Romay. In this unabashed performance she plays Countess Iriana of Karlstein, a mute vampire who resides on a remote island, feeding off men and women to satiate her desire to literally suck the life out of her lovers. Iriana faces a new challenge when she meets a poet who believes himself destined to become her lover and, like her, immortal. Simultaneously a scientist Dr. Roberts and his colleague, Dr. Orlof, become aware that a vampire is at work and set about finding him or her. \"Female vampire\" has a dream-like quality, and similar to \"Vampyros Lesbos\", has achieved cult status amid horror buffs. Various cuts of this film exist; this version favours the sexuality of the characters over the more graphic horror elements. The deleted scenes in special features contains scenes of a more bloody nature. Features excessive nudity, and scenes of masturbation and oral sex that are quite explicit. Cast includes Jack Taylor, Alice Arno, Monica Swinn. This film is also known under the following titles: Bare Breasted Countess, Erotikill, Erotikiller and The Loves of Irina. Please note, this is the dubbed English language version."
