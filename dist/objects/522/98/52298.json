        "Five teenagers from various parts of the Arab world share their lives, experiences and hope for the future, providing an insight into everyday aspects of Arab culture and society. Their narratives and different locales reveal a place of contrasts, but also one of similarities in the shared cultural heritage, attitude towards family and religion, continuity and change. Fourteen-year-old Muhammad from Jordan explains how Islam guides his life, in particular the period of Ramadan and the haj. Fourteen-year-old Tamara from Beirut talks about the reconstruction of her city and her aspiration to be an archaeologist. Twelve-year-old Hazem lives in Egypt with his geologist parents and talks of the enjoyment he derives from movies and spending time with friends. Twelve-year-old Sa'ud lives with his extended family in Kuwait and has been told of many of the traditional ways, in danger of disappearing, by his grandmother. Twelve-year-old Khadija from Morocco talks about the differences between her generation and that of her mother. General information is also provided on the demographics, geography, religion, language, trade, industry, family and identity of the Arab world. A detailed teacher's guide accompanies the video."
