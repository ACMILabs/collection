        "This video contains no title or credits and appears to be a compilation of documentary programs produced by the BBC on the subject of Genetically Modified Foods. It begins in the mid-west of the United States where one-third of the soya bean crops are genetically modified and farmers are becoming angry and confused, questioning the costs and yields of GM crops. Where Europe and many other global nations have made the decision to go slow in introducing GM crops, the United States on the other hand have rushed in and agressively promoted the use of biotechnology to their farmers, particularly with soya bean and corn production. Farmers, especially those involved in organic farming, fear cross-contamination from property to property through the spread of pollen from the GM crops. The program then crosses to Oxfordshire in the UK where tests are being carried out by Friends of the Earth on the control of pollen flow from engineered crops and then finally to India where corporations such as Monsanto are pushing the Indian Government to allow GM crop growing by the farmers which would ultimately turn into a multi-billion dollar business for the likes of Monsanto and their partners. As with farmers, consumers are also becoming aware of the inherent dangers, environmentally and genetically, and are protesting all around the world. A very interesting and informative program. NB: Sound quality is uneven and of poor quality in parts."
