    "description": [
        "Final four episodes of the television series presented by Simon Schama on the history of Britain. This video contains the following episodes: \"Forces of nature\" (1780-1832 approx.) - Discusses the rise of radicalism, republicanism and political revolutions including the French Revolution in 1789 and how close Britain came to having its own revolution. This was a time for intellectuals, the \"romantic generation\", of poets like Thomas Paine (The Rights of man) and William Wordsworth and a rediscovering of nature and the environment. It was also a time for women's rights and emancipist Mary Wollstonecraft (A Vindication of the rights of women). Mary actively engaged in political debate on the social injustices and treatment of women. Also examines the effect of the 1798 Irish Rebellion. \"Victoria and her sisters\" (1830-1910) - With the advent of the industrial revolution and advancement in technology, particularly in the area of communications, Britain found its social structure being rapidly reshaped. Queen Victoria came to the throne in 1837 and women more than ever before would play a much more dominant role in society and bring about social reform. This was the Victorian era. \"The Empire of good intentions\" (1830-1925 approx.) - Examines the British Empire, its successes and its failures including the violence and famine which both Ireland and India were forced to endure. For all its good intentions, and leaders such as William Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli, political justice failed and common humanity suffered. \"The Two Winstons\" (1910 to the present day) - Reflects on 20th century history in Britain including two world wars, Sir Winston Churchill, George Orwell (author of 1984), the Cold War and where through all these struggles and events Britain stands in today's world. See: www.bbc.co.uk/history for more information on this series."
