        "Terry Gilliam's surreal depiction of Hunter S. Thompson's classic 1971 novel \"Fear and loathing in Las Vegas: A savage journey into the heart of the American dream\", encapsulates sportswriter Raoul Duke (Thompson's alter-ego) descent into a drug induced frenzy on a wild road trip with his friend and lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta (Benicio del Toro). This story established the term 'Gonzo journalism' as Duke travels from California to Las Vegas to report on the Mint 400 Desert Motorcycle race, with a suitcase filled with an assortment of drugs. This illegal stash, heartily consumed, influenced the crazy antics of the bumbling duo and provided an insight into the decline of the 1960s peace and love generation. Johnny Depp's stunning portrayal of the infamous journalist and writer, is a tour-de-force of acid trip induced hallucinations and paranoia that creates a nightmarish world filled with reptilian monsters, circus dwarfs and morphing hotel rooms. Terry Gilliam's visually stimulating frenetic hand-held style graphically conveys confronting images of psychedelic induced episodes by the main characters who flail around in murky baths brandishing knives and picking up underage girls. The film has been described as hilarious, disturbing and magical. Guest appearances by Cameron Diaz, Toby Maguire, Harry Dean Stanton and Christina Ricci."
