        "The second instalment in the Harry Potter series returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, in what is arguably a stronger film than its predecessor, despite belief that the novel on which the film is based, is the weakest in the series. An enchanting musical score and solid animation are supported by strong performances of young actors Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who reprise their roles as Harry, Hermione and Ron. Between dealing with cryptic house-elves, flying cars, Quidditch, and attempting to keep one step ahead of the nasty Slytherins, who has time to study? However, when muggle-born students are being attacked, it is once again up to Harry and his friends to save the day. The all-star British cast includes Jason Isaacs as the malicious Lucius Malfoy and Kenneth Branagh as pompous professor Gilderoy Lockhart who join Richard Harris, in one of his final roles, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, John Cleese, Fiona Shaw, Zoe Wanamaker, Julie Walters, John Hurt, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths and Warwick Davis."
