        "Episode of Series \"TheEYE\". Part of a series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain - this episode focuses on Antony Gormley, an artist who focuses on the body, the connections between mind, body and spirit, and the links between metaphysical issues and his art. Internationally acclaimed, Gormley's best-known work is \"Angel of the north\" (1998) - this earth bound figure with its massive wings shares with all of Gormley's work his concerns with the miraculous, interrogating notions of religion and the assimilation of divine attributes into the modern world. Early lead and iron figures were cast from Gormley's own body; later works of babies and children were inspired by fatherhood; both periods raise profound philosophical questions about memory, the mind and our senses. In an illuminating interview Gormley discusses the many humanistic issues that concern him, addressed through his art."
