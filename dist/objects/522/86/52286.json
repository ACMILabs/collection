        "Episode of Series \"TheEYE\". Part of a series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain - this episode focuses on Tracey Emin whose intelligence, talent and finesse has at times been obscured by her infamy and the controversy that surrounds her highly personalised art. Many of her best-known works, including \"Everyone I have ever slept with 1963-1995\" (1995) and \"My bed\" (1998) are startlingly frank as they deal with the intrinsically personal themes in which she engages - autobiography, memory, desire and identity. Discussing her art, and the furore that has often surrounded it, Emin astutely addresses some of the criticisms that have been levelled at her, believing that a part of her success is attributable to timing - her yen for self-examination taps into the zeitgeist of the times when Britain is looking toward individualistic issues, which reflect the space that Emin effortlessly occupies. An illuminating interview with a focused, passionate and intriguing artist, this documentary also contains archival footage of Emin at work and features selections of her blankets, installations, neon art and drawings."
