        "Profiling British actor Tim Roth who has worked extensively in Hollywood (Reservoir dogs, Pulp fiction, Planet of the apes), this documentary was filmed in 1999, when Roth, tired of the actor's lot, was directing and promoting his directorial debut \"The War zone\". In interview Roth discusses his influences, experiences both as a fledgling actor and successful star, fame, his upbringing, hopes for the future, feelings about his craft and desire to retire from acting and pursue directing. As a young thespian Roth started off in theatre before landing a key role in \"Made in Britain\", a controversial TV movie about juvenile delinquency, which enabled Roth to forge ahead with a successful film career. Roth was subsequently cast in \"Jumpin' at the Boneyard\" (1992) which led to a key role in \"Reservoir dogs\" (1992), Quentin Tarantino's ultra-violent heist film that made several unknown actors famous. Also interviewed are school friends, colleagues, fellow actors Ray Winstone, Gary Oldman, Chris Penn and John Hurt, Mike Leigh who directed Roth in \"Meantime\" (1981), and Tom Stoppard director and writer of \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead\" (1990). Features extensive footage of Tim Roth shooting \"The War zone\" using inexperienced actors and shows Roth dealing with the mixed critical reception that his film received in the UK."
