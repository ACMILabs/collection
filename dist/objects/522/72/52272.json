        "In this sequel to George Romero's \"Night of the living dead\", the US is engulfed and decimated by a zombie population growing at an inexplicable and alarming rate. Two Philadelphia police S.W.A.T. officers, a helicopter pilot and his TV reporter girlfriend escape the city and take refuge in an abandoned suburban shopping mall. Their attempts to isolate themselves from the marauding army of the undead are thwarted after a band of looters leave a door open allowing the zombies free access to the mall. Romero capitalises on the shopping mall location to present an apocalyptic allegory for a rampant consumer culture driven to eat itself by its own insatiable appetite. Cast includes David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott H. Reininger. Music by Dario Argento."
