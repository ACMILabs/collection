        "London, 1914, and Australian pianist and composer Percy Grainger (Richard Roxburgh) is living in London under the management of his mother, Rose (Barbara Hershey). Mother and son share an \"unnatural\" bond, questioned for being incestuous. Grainger is overpowered by his creative abilities at the expense of ordinary sensibilities. He has a passion for music, passion for life and sex, blatantly disregarding conventions in regards to what people expect him to play. Most significantly, he derives the most passion and pleasure from his propensity for sado-masochism, the one thing he and his mother do not agree on. Percy is introduced to pianist Karen Holten (Emily Woof) to tutor, but also to absorb the feelings he has for his mother. Rose hopes Karen will be a counterfoil to his perverse tendencies, but she is sorely mistaken. Musings on the differences between lust, admiration, friendship and what it means to love are also covered in this biopic of a musician and painter equally known for his peccadillos and fondness for leisurewear. Based on the play \"Percy & Rose\" written by Rob George."
