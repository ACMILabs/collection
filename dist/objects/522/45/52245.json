        "These nine short films, from eminent directors and animators, explore the concepts of the enormously popular cult science-fiction film \"The Matrix\" (Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski, 1999), fleshing out side and back-stories of the principal narrative. \"The Final flight of the Osiris\" (dir. Andy Jones): When the crew aboard a hovercraft witness a menacing mechanical army amassing, one woman travels, at great peril, to the other side. \"The Second Renaissance Part 1\" (dir. Mahiro Maeda): Explains how human beings became the architect of their own demise by inventing robots to do their bidding, before the machines, desiring autonomy and freedom, rose up against their masters. \"The Second Renaissance Part 2\" (dir. Mahiro Maeda): The war of man versus the machines begins. \"Kid's story\" (dir. Shinichiro Watanabe): A high school student who discovers the truth about the Matrix goes on the run from secret agents. \"Program\" (dir. Yoshiaki Kawajiri): In a segment with medieval overtones, two warriors engage in a fierce battle whilst debating the meaning of existence. \"World record\" (dir. Takeshi Koike): A talented track star discovers the secrets behind the Matrix. \"Beyond\" (dir. Koji Morimoto): Whilst searching for her missing cat, a young woman discovers a dilapidated building where children reside with the power to defy gravity and slow down time. \"A Detective story\" (dir. Shinichiro Watanabe): Paying homage to film noir, a private investigator goes in search of Trinity. \"Matriculated\" (dir. Peter Chung): Several members of the human resistance attempt to reprogram a machine to fight for their side."
