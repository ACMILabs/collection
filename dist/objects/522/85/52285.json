        "Episode of Series \"TheEYE\". Part of a series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain - this episode focuses on Howard Hodgkin. Hodgkin, one of the world's leading painters whose art is admired by both critics and the public, labours over his work for lengthy periods, characteristically producing richly coloured, and sumptuous compositions that spill over into the frame. His work straddles abstraction and representation whilst displaying an awareness of history and the potential for art. Larger scale work such as \"Americana\" and \"After Vuillard\", demonstrate his concern to engage the viewer in new and challenging ways. In an illuminating interview Hodgkin speaks earnestly, and humbly, about the process of creating new work, his methodology, influences and ambition, addresses the subjects of the functionality of colour, composition, and the importance of visual art to him."
