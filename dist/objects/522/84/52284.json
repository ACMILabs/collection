        "Episode of Series \"TheEYE\". Part of a series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain - this episode focuses on Mark Wallinger. As Britain's representative at the Venice Biennale, 2001, Wallinger brought together a typically eclectic group of sculptures, videos and installations that provoked, challenged and moved his audience. His public art piece \"Ecce homo\" - a life size figure of Christ marking the new millennium - drew great acclaim, and was a positive experience for the artist. Fixating on the opening of John's Gospel in the Bible, and drawing inspiration from theology and the scriptures, Wallinger created \"Angel\" (1997), an intriguing video art piece that is a rumination on faith. \"Prometheus\" (1999), a thought-provoking piece, addressing the issues of mortality, morality, the after-life and purgatory, utilises an electric chair, a video component, amid other mediums. Wallinger's art is often witty and immediately accessible yet at the same time it engages with some grand themes - religion, spirituality, life and death. In an interesting interview Wallinger discusses his identity as a British artist and his interest in horse racing, identifying it as an exaggerated microcosm of British society, as well as the meanings, motivations and ambitions that drive his creative spirit."
