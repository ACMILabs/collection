        "Shattering experience set in an imaginary prison institution somewhere in the not too distant future. A crammed prison is the breeding ground for violence, drug trafficking and homosexual sadism. Authorities allow it all to breed in order to justify retaliatory crackdowns, in an escalating spiral of violence. The end product discharged from the institution is a new breed of social, disruptive misfits. Cast includes David Field, Mike Bishop, Chris DeRose, Kevin Mackey, Dave Mason, Nick Cave, Vincent Gil."
