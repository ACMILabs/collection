        "Based on the Archie comic book series, this teen flick is an exuberant adaptation of the characters of Josie, Valerie and Melody who form a rock group and are catapulted to stardom overnight after being discovered by a talent scout. Unbeknownst to the girls however, the label they have signed with, MegaRecords, run by Fiona (Parker Posey, revelling in the role of arch-villainess), insert subaural messages into the music that brainwashes teenagers into buying an array of products, from shoes to deodorant. When the label pushes Josie as the main artist, diminishing the roles of Val and Mel, the girls' friendship is threatened. This film successfully satirises teenage marketing, consumerism, product placement, all-boy bands, manufactured pop and teen movies but undermines its credibility by gratifying the teen wish-fulfillment fantasy. The gaudy palette is utilised to great effect from the costumes of the band to the ever-changing sets; and the self-reflexive pop references flow thick and fast throughout the script that oscillates between all-knowing cleverness and straight up pandering to mainstream culture. Ultimately, the film cannot decide which side of the fence it sits on but remains an amusing, fun distraction. Cast includes Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid, Rosario Dawson, Alan Cumming and Gabriel Mann."
