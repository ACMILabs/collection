        "Sam Raimi (famed for his iconic horror work in Darkman and Evil Dead) delivers - \"Spider-man\", adapted from the Marvel Comics book character, is a canny mix of entertaining CG imagery, exhilarating action sequences, and a humanistic portrayal of the man behind the mask. Initially Spider-man aka Peter Parker is an awkward teenager with a smattering of friends and a serious crush on his spunky neighbour Mary Jane. After being bitten by a spider, Parker, much to his dismay, develops super-human reflexes, the ability to project powerful webs, and the knack for climbing walls. Upon experiencing some harsh life lessons, Parker becomes aware of the responsibility attendant with his awesome capabilities. The story also follows the romancing of Mary Jane as she finds her feet in Manhattan and dates Parker's best friend and roommate Harry Osborne. Raimi achieves impact with this film on an emotional level that has been sorely lacking from so many comic book adaptations. He does this by imparting Parker with problems that an audience can relate to - thwarted love, disappointment, guilt and grief - woes that Spider-man's phenomenal strengths cannot combat. Maguire imbues the title role with sensitivity and gravitas, whilst character actor Willem Dafoe ably plays a dual role of Norman Osborn, and Parker's arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin."
