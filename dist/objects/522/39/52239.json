        "An estranged and dysfunctional family are reunited when the matriarch of the clan is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Patsy is a stoic figure, keeping the family united, despite their fractured relationships. Patsy's eldest daughter is a nurse, caring for her ailing mother; her other two daughters travel from Sydney and abroad with their respective children. Their brother, Bo, a biker with a history of drug abuse, is out of jail on special leave and has been disowned by his disapproving father. Vic, their father, is a disgruntled, violent figure who treats his children with disdain, whilst resenting their rallying around Patsy. The narrative is devoted to reconciliation between the disparate family members, in particular the relationship between father and son. In the spirit of black and bleak comedy, Christine Andreef's debut feature is reminiscent of early Jane Campion work, in particular \"Sweetie\"; indeed \"Soft fruit\" has many of the hallmarks of that quirky Australian comedy. Contains scenes of great poignancy and humour, despite a certain unevenness in tenor. Cast includes Jeanie Drynan, Linal Haft, Russell Dykstra, Genevieve Lemon, Sacha Horler and Alicia Talbot."
