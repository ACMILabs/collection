        "Gaspar Noe's \"Irreversible\" made its notorious debut at the 2002 Cannes film festival where it provoked extreme reactions from audiences. Subsequently it has been dubbed as the film with the most walkouts. Noe's previous feature, \"I stand alone\" was considered at the time as an uncompromising and shocking film which presented a bleak and nihilistic view of humanity. Noe even included a foreboding warning to viewers to exit the cinema before its shocking climax, a claim that was no mere cheap effect. With \"Irreversible\" (which includes a brief cameo from the lead character of \"I stand alone\") Noe has upped the ante to an intense degree, making this one of the more distressing films you are likely to experience. Taking the very well used genre of the revenge film as a starting point, Noe defies expectations and delivers a remarkable aural and visual assault on the senses. Using mainly improvised dialogue, a disorientating camera style and depicting the film's events backwards, \"Irreversible\" goes from an intense act of violence, to a horrendous rape (which plays out in excruciating real time) and finally to a quiet contemplative moment. The film's peaceful coda leaves a bitter and devastating aftertaste as we are left to ponder the film's final words, 'time destroys everything'. Please note: contains scenes of violence which may disturb some viewers, and depicts explicit sexual relationships. Cast includes: Albert Dupontel, Jo Prestia."
