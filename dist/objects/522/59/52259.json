        "Dramatised account of the life of Belgian priest Father Damien (David Wenham) who voluntarily moved to the Hawaiian Island of Molokai to tend the spiritual needs of the 19th Century leper colony. At the time leprosy was untreatable and speculations were raised as to how the scourge was contracted: it was rumoured to be the second stage of syphilis. In a pique of frustration, a decision was made by the government to send all suspected victims to Molokai. On Molokai Father Damien initiates moves to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants, including adequate shelter and food, and rumours soon spread of his generosity, generating public support for the Christian hero. Featuring an impressive international cast and stunning locations, \"Molokai\" languorously captures the life of a compassionate man who cared for the lives of lepers despite resistance from the religious and political powers that be. Based on the biography by Hilde Eynikel. Cast also includes: Kate Cebrano, Jan Decleir, Alice Krige, Tom Wilkinson, Sam Neill, Leo McKern, Derek Jacobi, Chris Haywood, Aden Young."
