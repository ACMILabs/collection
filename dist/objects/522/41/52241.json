        "In this satirical slapstick comedy Dean Martin plays Rick Todd, a fledging painter who has relocated to New York in search of acclaim. Eugene, Rick's best friend and housemate also has ambitions, as a children's writer, but his clumsy antics continuously lose them menial jobs that they land. Despite their misfortunes the impoverished pair dream of greater things, such as food, girls, money and fame. Along the way, the friends woo their luscious neighbours, comic book artist Abigail (Dorothy Malone) and her model, Bessie (Shirley MacLaine). When Abigail resigns after being asked to beef up her storylines with more blood and gore, Rick takes her job, using Eugene's ecstatic and vivid dreams as material. Eugene dreams up the secret formula for rocket fuel, and enemy agents are soon on his tail. Several musical interludes pepper the film that is alight with sight gags, physical and madcap humour, and despite its largely formulaic approach, is one of the finest Lewis and Martin comedies made as a duo."
