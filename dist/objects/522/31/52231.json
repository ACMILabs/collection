        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew Mackenzie, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The programs style makes the avant-garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew explores Melbourne's city lane ways, many of which offer public access to street art. He visits City Lights, venue for a a Public Art Project; interviews the author of \"Spray Can Art\" Jim Prigoff at the Central Station Mural; attends the opening night at Bus Gallery; meets and talks to Mark Amerika at CCP to discuss Amerika's \"Filmtext\" (Web Art) Exhibition at the e-Media Gallery and ends the program with an interview with video artist Laresa Kosloff."
