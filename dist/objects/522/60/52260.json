        "John Coltrane (1927-67) was one of the most influential jazz musicians and saxophonists of the twentieth century. Brought up experiencing gospel and rhythm and blues, Coltrane was revered for his unique style, incredible commitment to, and passion for jazz. Initially Coltrane joined Miles Davis' band, before forming his own four-piece that included Elvin Jones, Jimmy Garrison, McCoy Tyner and later Eric Dolphy and Pharoah Sanders. Coltrane also performed with Dizzy Gillespie, playing Bebop, and legendary pianist Thelonius Monk. As well as containing live footage, this work probes Coltrane's interest in the science of sound, the philosophy of music espoused within many Eastern cultures, ideas to which Coltrane was drawn as he expressed spiritual issues through his art. Exploration into notions of Eastern modality resulted in extended solos, which influenced jazz, contemporary classical music and even rock. This documentary examines Coltrane's music in the 1960s as a reflection of the massive changes wrought within American society, particularly in regards to incendiary race relations. Features the voice of Alice Coltrane, discussing her husband and the links between his spirituality and music, and interviews with various friends and colleagues, including Roscoe Mitchell, Rashied Ali, Tommy Flanagan, Jimmy Heath, Wayne Shorter and La Monte Young. Includes performances of his famed re-working of \"My favourite things\" (from The Sound of music), \"Naima\", \"Giant steps\" (with Miles Davis), \"So what\" and \"Reverend King Alabama\" - a tribute to Martin Luther King."
