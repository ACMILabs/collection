        "The pioneering force behind the rise of trip-hop, British band Massive Attack were among the most innovative and influential groups of their generation, renowned for their talents at combining the sounds of hip hop rhythms, soulful melodies, dub grooves and choice samples. Their music is hypnotic, cinematic (in fact their music has featured on numerous soundtracks) and frequently political, addressing the inequities of society and the perilous state of mankind. This disc features eleven film clips, ranging from 1990-98, and includes: Daydreaming (Dir: Billie Walsh, 1990) ; Unfinished sympathy (Dir: Billie Walsh, 1991) ; Safe from harm (Dir: Billie Walsh, 1991) ; Be thankful for what you've got (Dir: Billie Walsh, 1992) ; Sly (Dir: Stephane Sednaoui, 1994) ; Protection (Dir: Michel Gondry, 1995) ; Karmacoma (Dir: Jonathan Glazer, 1995) ; Risingson (Dir: Walter Stern, 1997) ; Teardrop (Dir: Billie Walsh, 1990) ; Angel (Dir: Walter Stern, 1998) ; Inertia Creeps (Dir: Wiz, 1998). The clips range in technique, some, like \"Inertia Creeps\", are stylish and conceptual, others such as \"Safe from harm\" and \"Unfinished sympathy\" are notable for their location (a disused tower block, East London and Peico Avenue, Los Angeles respectively), simple in execution, and succeed in commenting on the social milieu in which they are set."
