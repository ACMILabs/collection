        "'Supernatural' is a visually compelling investigation of the extrasensory and near-paranormal powers utilized by various animals in their daily struggle for survival. The series is presented in six parts, each focusing on examples of amazing and sometimes inexplicable animal and plant behaviour. In 'Extrasensory perception', watch sharks use electrosensors to track prey, and see a flight over the Sydney Opera House through the eyes of a parrot using ultraviolet light as a guide. 'Outer limits' explores incredible feats of endurance; lungfish burrowing into mud to escape droughts, and red sided garter snakes \"defrosting\" themselves after a cold snap. 'Hidden forces' looks at the internal magnet which draws green turtles back to the beaches of their birth to breed, and how fire ants are attracted to electric currents. 'Time warp' investigates how animal size and heart-rate are linked to lifespan. 'Paranormal' looks at the more bizarre side of nature; lizards who squirt blood from their eyes to deter predators and chickens and crocodiles who play dead when hypnotised. 'Close encounters' looks at the role enhanced senses play in animal life, using the story of Whisky, a truck-driver's dog, and his six month journey to track down his owner. Also included is 'Supernatural superstars', a behind-the-scenes look at how the latest developments in science, cutting edge filming techniques and state of the art computer effects allowed the filmmakers to bring such an ambitious project to life."
