        "A patchy collection of cult, unusual and obscure 'erotic' based animation. As a whole overtly designed to titillate on the most obvious level (these animations being the least affective), with only a few having any merit. Generally an over-use of 'visual friction' throughout. Some of the better ones: Karl Krogsta's clay animation Jack in the Fox, Susan Pittkraning's drawing based Crocus, Lapoujade's L'ombre De La Pomme (with jazz soundtrack). The fifteen plus cartoons represent pornographic animation from the early 1900's to contemporary times."
