        "RAF camera reconnaissance pilot Peter Ross (Alec Guinness) is trapped on the island of Malta when his plane is destroyed enroute to Egypt in a bombing raid. While in Malta, Ross discovers that Italy is planning to invade, but the mission is thwarted as Allied control prevents the attack. With the Allied presence in place, Peter begins the dangerous task of tracing an enemy convoy carrying supplies to the German Army in North Africa, a mission that is fraught with danger, as communication to the Allied forces will alert the enemy to Peter's position. Cast includes Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Steel, Muriel Pavlow and Flora Robson."
