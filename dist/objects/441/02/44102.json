        "This film documents the blazen and colourful history of pornography. It begins with primitive hard-core cave etchings, and the sublime prose and erotica of ancient China and India, progressing to the uncontrolled excesses of the Roman Empire and early European erotica. It also covers the first legalising of \"porn\" in Denmark, after a sexual revolution that challenged its constitutional laws. The rapid emergence of \"dirty\" comics and cartoons, and early underground \"stag\" films area also represented. The documentary finishes with an exploration of today's mass marketing of sex."
