        "This film is a collection of some of the infectious comic skits conceived and performed by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore that were to influence and inspire a generation of performers with their fresh and innovative style. Collected from their landmark 60's TV show, \"Not only but also\", this video samples some of the best, to include; Bo Dudley, The Leaping Nuns, Roger and Sir discussing 'the opposite number and how Roger came to be', the moving life story of acclaimed Finnish film star of the 30's Bargo (aka Anna Nigma), Pete and Dud discussing how they've rejected a host of screen sirens from Betty Grable to Anna Magnani. Including many other skits, they particularly enjoy poking fun at the film industry and the art world in general. Their repartee and affection for each other is obvious, especially when together they employ a number of techniques to prevent themselves from laughing, including stuffing their mouths with food."
