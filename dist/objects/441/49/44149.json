        "Cary Grant heads a ramshackle cargo outfit in the wilds of South America, forced to fly in the most perilous of weather conditions to the most treacherous of destinations. Facing death on a near-hourly basis, Grant and his flyers have adopted a casual, all-in-a-day's work attitude towards their mortality. Bringing more than a touch of glamour, and tension, to the sleepy one-saloon outpost is a showgirl (Jean Arthur) on her way to a nightclub engagement in Panama, and a fellow aviator's beautiful wife (Rita Hayworth). Cast includes: Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, Richard Barthelmess and Thomas Mitchell."
