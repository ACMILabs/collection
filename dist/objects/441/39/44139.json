        "It's a rainy day and the Hooley Dooleys and their friends Russell the Muscly Kangaroo and Tickle the Doodat are disappointed because they can't go to the park. Things don't turn out too badly when they decide to put on a pretend concert in Tickle's playroom, and they each take it in turns to either entertain or be part of the audience. Features the following songs; \"We are the Hooley Dooleys\", \"Hello you've got the rhythm\", \"Ten fingers splashing in the puddles\", \"Police car\", \"Peek-a-boo ping pong ball\", \"Kangaroo\", \"Hands and feet sailing\", \"The Hooley Dooley's ball\", \"Photograph diddley dee\", \"Mowing\", \"If I was\", \"Drums\", and \"Everybody\"."
