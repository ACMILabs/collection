        "Advertising has the startling capacity to condition western culture into accepting consumption and waste as beautiful and desirable. This program traces the development of advertising and mass production and the cumulative effects this has on the way we live. Areas discussed include: the shift from factual to social, emotional and psychological content; advertising as the deliberate provocation of personal discontent; advertising as a form of education with the power to shape reality; ascendancy of images and symbols over words, and advertising as economic and political power. Suitable for business and media studies, as well as anyone interested in the relationship between self image and advertising."
