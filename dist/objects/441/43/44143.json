        "This is the dramatic true story of the only German prisoner of war taken in Britain who escaped from captivity and successfully returned to Germany; Luftwaffe pilot Lieutenant Franz Von Werra (Hardy Kruger). Von Werra was captured during the Battle of Britain when his Messerschmitt was shot down in the English countryside. The film is significant in that it was made during the period after World War 2 when the majority of British films paid homage to the heroism of British troops. Von Werra's meticulous and determined bid for freedom took him across England, Canada, the United States, until he finally reached home. Screenplay by Howard Clewes from the book by Kendal Burt and James Leasor. Cast includes Hardy Kruger, Colin Gordon, Michael Goodliffe and Terence Alexander."
