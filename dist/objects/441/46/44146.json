        "This documentary provides the viewer with a fascinating insight into how wildlife documentaries are able to capture such spectacular footage. The film follows a year in the life of film makers Rory McGuinness, Rebecca Scott, their daughter Bella, and camera assistant Matt Cadwallader as they set out to film crocodiles, kangaroos and other creatures that inhabit Kakadu National Park. It is revealed as a process involving patience, persistence, nervous energy, and excitement."
