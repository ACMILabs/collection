        "It is rare in a sport such as cricket that an umpire should have as much of a reputation and following as the players over which he adjudicates. Umpire Dickie Bird is a prime example of this exception to the rule. In this video he reflects on his most enjoyable moments from the game, reflecting on some of the greatest performances and players he's seen, and culminates in Dickie donning the cricket whites to face one of the fastest West Indian bowlers ever."
