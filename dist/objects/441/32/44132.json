        "The issue about whether violence on the screen and in the media influences the behaviour of the community, especially children, is a contentious one. This program, comprising of two videos - 'I wrote to Steven Spielberg' and 'Bobo dolls and copy cats', as well as video support notes, attempts to provide a well rounded introduction to the complexities of the debate. Many questions are raised and discussed, but it should be noted that due to the complex nature of the subject, a definitive answer cannot be reached. The program discusses the difference between real, fictional and implied violence. Discusses the notion of intent, including the difficult areas of comedy and cartoon violence, as well as the impact of television news. It introduces the idea that one effect of viewing violence may be an altered perception of the amount of violence in the world. It discusses the role of Australia's film and television classification system; asks whether violence is always bad, and asks students to consider whether children are an especially susceptible audience. It also introduces the notion that violence in the media may serve cultural, psychological or historical needs, and asks students to consider whether it's violence in the media or other factors in people's lives that are more important in determining actions. Suitable for middle to senior secondary school students in Media Studies, English, and related Studies of Society and Environment."
