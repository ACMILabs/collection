        "'Men Like Me' is the story of Dale Michaels, who changed his sexual identity from female to male. It is also an account of the filmmaker's response to a friend's need to change their identity and what that entailed. The film is a collaboration between the filmmaker and Dale Michaels and was made in 1994 when female to male transgender was relatively unfamiliar to the broader community and rarely discussed. Informative and sensitively presented using interviews, vox pops, archival footage and stills, combined with computer animated images and narration by Susan Long and Dale Michaels."
