        "This short narrated documentary is an experimental film study of the Sydney showgrounds- it's history, and it's current use during the Royal Easter Show. It studies the culture of the past and present, as well as how and why the Show attracts a huge amount of both city and country people to the grounds once a year. The film presents a different point of view of the grounds and the social context in which it functions."
