        "A detailed exploration of twentieth century clothing design, documented through extensive archival footage and interviews with numerous fashion identities, including British designer Katherine Hamnett, and editor of British Vogue, Alexandra Schulman. The design analysis contextualises historical, cultural, social and political influences on the development of fashion, and traverses a wide array of subjects including fashion and the war, innovations and trends, fashion designers, the supermodel phenomena and gender differences in fashion and professional modelling. This detailed documentary is presented in four parts. Narrated by Sir David Frost."
