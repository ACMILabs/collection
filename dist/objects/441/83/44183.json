        "Man-made pine forests are the main timber resources of New Zealand. At Kaingarva, the largest such forest in the world, the Dominion has sufficient supplies for the next few centuries. The film explains that the abundance of natural forests in early days provided a seemingly inexhaustible supply of timber, resulting in the deforestation of large areas. Today (1949), in spite of the development of new forests, timber resources are being used to the better advantage."
