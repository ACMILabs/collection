        "This compilation is a tribute to the comic genius of Ronnie Barker, unconventional hero of television programs such as 'The Two Ronnies', 'Porridge' and 'Open all hours'. This tape includes sketches and clips from 'The Two Ronnies', a showcase for both Barker and his pint sized companion, Ronnie Corbett, including sketches targeting Government Ministers, Civil Servants and Church figures. In 'Porridge', Barker plays to perfection the seasoned lifer of Slade Prison who devoted his sentence to conniving and getting the better of Mr McKay and any other screw that crossed his path. Roy Clarke's 'Open all hours' provided viewers with another legendary character, Arkwright, the stuttering, tight fisted, lecherous, corner shop owner, as well as the supporting characters of G-G-G Granville (David Jason), and Nurse Gladys Emmanuel."
