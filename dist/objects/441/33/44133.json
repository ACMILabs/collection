        "A fascinating insight into the creative and sometimes bizarre survival mechanisms of insects. The discussion centres on the daily dramas unfolding beneath the canopies of a tropical rainforest in Central Malaysia, where insects such as butterflies, grasshoppers and caterpillars must rely on disguise, camouflage and mimicry to maximise their chances of survival. This presents the viewer with a glimpse of the complex relationships existing between ecosystems, and the potential impact deforestation could have on insect populations. Includes video support notes."
