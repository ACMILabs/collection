        "The Wonthaggi State Coal Mine was arguably the most dangerous mine in Australia. Using archival footage and interviews, this film captures the spirit of Wonthaggi, her mateship and her community spirit, as elicited from the men and women who lived through the mine's strongest days. The mine opened in 1909, and the last whistle rang in 1968, signifying the end to a place of danger and industrial turmoil. It was from this environment of danger that the workplace created a solidarity amongst workers that is both encouraging and astonishing. 'Black gold, kindred sprit' is a testament to this community spirit."
