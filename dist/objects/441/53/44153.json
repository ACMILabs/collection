        "The Getikshan and Tsimshian Indians of northern British Columbia live in two worlds. Against the mountains and forests tower the ancient totem poles; the old graveyards reveal past history; on the reserves the traditional crafts are still practised. But in the school games, in the wedding complete with white veil and white rice, and in the sawmill we see how other ways are being adopted. As climax, the film shows the action-packed rodeo at Kispiox."
