        "This sensitive portrayal of a family relationship traces the path of a seemingly \"perfect couple\" whose dreams for living happily ever after are painfully shattered. The film begins with Daniel and Mary Ellen moving into their new home. Everything appears to be normal, as Daniel works at furthering his practice as a brain surgeon and his wife devotes herself to their three children. As the film progresses the cracks begin to show, the children grow up and move away, and husband and wife become strangers. As the alienation increases they drift to other people and Daniel begins an affair with one of his nurses while Mary Ellen fantasises about the family gardener. With their marriage well and truly over, Mary Ellen clings to the security of her once happy home, chaining herself to painful memories. Finally, she realises that to move on with her life she must leave the house that once contained the happiness of her marriage. Cast includes Tyne Daly, Terry O'Quinn and Annabeth Gish."
