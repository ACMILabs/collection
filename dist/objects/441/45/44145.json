        "In 1948, seventeen Australian cricketers set sail for England, their country's dreams for defending the Ashes riding on their shoulders. It had been a long time between drinks for the Australians, ten years had passed, and the war weary Britons were looking forward to the restoration of national tradition, and the appearance of the Australian team led by one of the greatest batsmen of the day, Don Bradman. Remarkably, the team played six days a week for five months and did not lose a single match, thus earning the reputation, \"the invincibles\". Players such as Bradman, Hassett, Barnes, Morris, Harvey, Lindwall and Miller provided a victory that became part of Australian cricket history. ABC Television producer Lincoln Tyner, with the assistance of respected cricket writer and author, Mike Coward, have in this documentary recorded interviews with surviving members of the famous team, the only side in the long history of rivalry between Australia and England, to go through an entire tour undefeated."
