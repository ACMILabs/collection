    "description": [
        "Across mountains, under the sea and into the sun, a group of strange travellers attempt an impossible voyage. Exploiting Melies' mastery of film magic, this early cinema classic explores a vast range of fantasy landscapes. The travellers breach space and time as they travel, using every imaginable means of transportation, from one space and place to another in the attempt to geographically explore the earth and the surrounding space. This extraordinary science fiction fantasy was only one of the many pioneering films made by Melies in the early 1900s and it, like his other films, combines whimsical humour with wild imaginative journeys."
