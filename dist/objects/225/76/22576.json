        "That one duck is not necessarily the same as another is made clear in this film, which has as its objective the protection of the dwindling species. The star of the film is a hunter who is obviously light on duck lore but heavy on the trigger. By the time everything has been made clear, he (and the viewer) knows a good deal more about duck identification."
