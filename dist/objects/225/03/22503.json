        "Concentrates on Dorothea Lange's renowned work on the Farm Security Administration (FSA) project during the depression. Also looks at her photographs during the war and a project on urban sprawl in California which occupied her during the last years of her life. Lange reviews these images and talks about her belief that photography is a universal language. Photographed by Phillip Greene."
