        "Deals with the exploratory work of Charles Sturt; the discovery of the Murray-Darling-Murrumbidgee river system solving the mystery of the rivers, the 1829 expedition westward down the Murray to the sea. Surveys the area today: the Murrumbidgee irrigation area, its chief towns; the wide variety of primary industries - rice cultivation, stoned and citrus fruit production, cattle and sheep raising."
