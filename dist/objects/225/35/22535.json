        "A partly animated film based on a series of drypoint prints ('Movements' and 'Combats') by Australian printmaker Charles Lloyd on the theme of aggression in society. The sound composition by Arthur Cantrill is a mix of percussion and altered piano (plucking and hitting strings and soundboard, played by Arthur Cantrill), sound effects (including breathing), and electronically modified children's laughter, recorded on a Nagra reel to reel tape recorder and transferred to 16mm magnetic tracks which were laid and mixed in a professional sound studio, where reverberation was added to some sections."
