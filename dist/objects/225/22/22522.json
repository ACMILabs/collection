        "Episode of Series \"History of the Motion Picture\". This 1920's film with John Barrymore was the first great American horror film. It was a tour-de-force for Barrymore, and a classic of macabre film making. This edited work retains all the ingredients for which it is famous. The narration points out its significance in motion picture history and provides interesting comment on the craftsmen who made it."
