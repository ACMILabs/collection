        "Episode of Series \"Outdoor Education and Recreation\". Designed to help teach swimmers and non-swimmers alike how to survive a water accident, by showing how to stay afloat and travel in water, even if you have never learned to swim. The majority of men and women can remain on the surface in fresh water, and in salt water the human body is even more buoyant."
