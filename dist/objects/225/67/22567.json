        "An undramatised documentary which shows the harrowing effects of drug misuse. Young addicts and ex-addicts give accounts of what life is like on various drugs, how they experience withdrawal symptoms and their need for more and more money to buy the drugs. Glimpses are seen of a post-mortem examination being conducted on the body of a young female addict."
