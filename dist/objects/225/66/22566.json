        "In themselves drugs are not a problem but their abuse is. The film shows young people using various drugs and the penultimate consequence of addiction. There is a clear, diagrammatic representation of how the human mind and nervous system work and how drugs affect them. Above all, the film repeatedly points out that the human mind is capable of the greatest powers."
