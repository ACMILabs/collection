        "Episode number 7 of Series \"How to Drive\". The drills of the system of car control demonstrated have been well tried and are well proven; once memorised and understood, the system soon becomes an almost instinctive routine. The system is designed to ensure that at all times the car is in the right place on the road, travelling at the right speed for existing conditions, in the right gear, and the driver is never trying to do more than one thing at a time."
