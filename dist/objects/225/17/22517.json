        "A poetic view of Montreal. To the rhythm of excerpts from 'Jazz Sebastian Bach' by the Swingle Singers - a vocal group from France - the camera explores the old city and the new. In the city modern skyscrapers mushroom skywards, but all around are ancient streets and monuments jealously guarding the memories of another time: including Bonsecours Church, La Place Royal, Le Theatre des Saltimbanques and Dickens Street."
