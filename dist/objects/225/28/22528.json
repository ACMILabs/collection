        "Provides an insight into the system of 'creative drama' being practiced in some Australian schools. The system aims to stimulate the imagination of the children. Encourages children to improvise and recreate situations based on their experiences. Includes a film made by an improvisation and discusses the planning of its action. Drama teacher Jean Stuart and students from Fort Street Girls High School and Vaucluse Boy's Hight School appear in this documentary."
