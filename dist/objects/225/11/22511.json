        "Episode of Series \"Path of the Paddle\". Running rapids will always be a calculated risk. But risk diminishes with skill and knowledge. In this film, two canoeists paddling double demonstrate how to read the rapids, plan a course and follow it in complete control of the boat, using the basic paddling strokes. The strokes can be used in endless combination to reduce the risk of whitewater canoeing and increase the sheer joy and exuberance of a whitewater run."
