        "The increasingly important role of safety committees in watching for sources of danger to the worker and seeing that adequate protection is provided. Types of protective clothing for acid handling, welding, lathe work, drum handling and working at heights are shown in use. The film ends with a reminder that while safety committees are doing a good job, their work is ineffective unless the equipment they provide is used by those for whom it was designed."
