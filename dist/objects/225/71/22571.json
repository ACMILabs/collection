        "This film looks at the Gold Coast (now Ghana), its history, industries and export trade in cotton and cocoa, and social and political life. Half of the world's cocoa comes from this region, and the harvesting, fermenting, drying, grading according to quality, and selling and shipping of the beans is illustrated. The film records a ceremonial parade to the local Durbar attended by the King of Ashanti, village Chiefs, and British representatives. Commentary by Leo Genn; photography by Stanley Gooze and edited by John Ferris"
