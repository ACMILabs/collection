        "TV-style film about the correct techniques needed to properly 'drain' a vegetable patch. Contains the 'Greenfingers' title sequence and Victorian Department of Agriculture end credit (see 'Greenfingers - episode 2 'Planting Evergreens'' for description). Also features nicely coloured dissolves between leafy plants and flowers, before entering into conventional 'show and tell' vision with narration of practical drainage creation with host of show, Rod Cantrill. 'Drainage' title at begining of film looks good."
