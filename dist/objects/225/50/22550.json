        "Shows reasons for many youths leaving school without reaching leaving standard through dramatised typical cases. Causes are complex, including home background, attitude of parents, emphasis on possessions in a commercial society and pressure to achieve independence. Suggests ways in which schools can help by attention to those left behind and discouraged and shows courses emphasising practical subjects and preparation for work."
