        "Episode of Series \"World in action\". Looks at the issue of the makeshift Bantu reservations to which the South African Government is transporting whole communities in furtherance of its \"separate development\" policy. Reveals an appalling catalogue of mismanagement and neglect on the part of those responsible for this mass transportation of people - and on the Bantu side a total crushing despair."
