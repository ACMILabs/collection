        "The success of this first full-scale nuclear power station on the shores of Lake Huron has shown the way for the economic large-scale production of electricity from uranium. This film describes the plant at Douglas Point, Ontario, and the process by which the uranium atom is split, employing heavy water with a special property, deuterium, giving the name CANDU (Canada Deuterium Uranium) to the Canadian system of atomic energy production."
