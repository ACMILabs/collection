        "South Down and Weald - open space and green woodland. This is Sussex, a county rich in scenic beauty. History shows itself everywhere, right back to the threshold of legend - The Long Man of Wilmington and Chanctonbury Ring. All this the present day traveller can see and enjoy, together with the present day delights of Petworth Show, Goodwood Races, polo at Cowdray Park, Glyndebourne and the Sussex Coast. Narrated by Peter Halliday."
