        "Episode of Series \"Economic Change in a Developing Country\". In this film, a map locates Arou, a tribal area of the Duna people, in the New Guinea highlands between the Central and Muller Ranges. The traditional economy of the people is shown to be almost self-sufficient. Sweet potatoes are the staple food and pigs are the main form of wealth. The lifting of entry restrictions in 1964 allowed European contact to be made with these people and the resulting changes in the economy and some problems now facing the Duna people are revealed. Suitable for Social Studies and Geography. No other credits available."
