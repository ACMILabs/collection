        "The epic story of the opening of the Canadian West, and the drought that brought depression in the Thirties. The story begins in 1907 with homesteaders staking life and future on the promise of unproved land. Harassed by winter cold and blazing heat of summer, they learned to farm land where moisture was uncertain. Some found the loneliness and the risk too great and gave up. This family tells of a family who stayed. Cast includes: Frances Hyland, James Douglas and Lester Nixon. Narrated by William Weintraub."
