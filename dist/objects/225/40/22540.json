        "The only film ever directed personally by John Grierson. A documentary made for the Empire Marketing Board about the men of the British herring fleets. 'Drifters' brought to the screen the labour of the North Sea herring fleet in such a way that the ordinary man or woman was made to realise, perhaps for the first time, that the herring on his plate was no mere accident, but the result of the labour and courage of other men."
