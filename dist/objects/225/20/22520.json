        "Actor Michael Kane stars in this brief winter romance filmed partly in the dazzling outdoor splendor of a Laurentian ski resort and partly in the cardiac wing of a city hospital. It is the story of a man's second youth, the time in his middle years when he overstrains his passion for life and love. A stolen weekend, and the inevitable reckoning; between these two, the hills themselves serve the drama like members of the cast."
