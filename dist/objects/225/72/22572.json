        "An experimental film capturing the atmosphere of emptiness and boredom which is evident at automatic laundrettes. Contrasts the useless but elegant manicured hands with the constant movement of the washing machine agitating and spinning. Shows the people lounging, smoking, watching the machines and drinking \"machine made\" coffee to while away the time. They are silent and do nothing, appearing bored, listless and sad in this soulless place which seems to reflect much of life in our modern cities today."
