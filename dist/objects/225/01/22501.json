        "A swimmer, an underwater camera, and carefully devised teaching demonstrations introduce the new swimming technique known as the dolphin or fishtail kick. Analysing the body movements used in this technique, the film stresses the importance of practice for mastery of this efficient, speedy kick. From this kick, the Butterfly Stroke was developed."
