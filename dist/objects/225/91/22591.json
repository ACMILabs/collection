        "Episode of Series \"English History\". This film discusses the building of Anglo-Saxon England, with emphasis on the many different peoples and cultures which contribute to the development of the English nation. This film uses authentic landmarks and historical material from 1900 B.C. to 1000 A.D. as well as brief re-enactments of important historical events to give a compressed picture of England and its people before the Norman Conquest."
