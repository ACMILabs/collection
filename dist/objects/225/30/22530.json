        "The technique of one of America's foremost pencil sketchers, Thomas Kautsky, is shown by observing him at work sketching a 17th century cooper's shop situated between the towns of Rockport and Gloucester, in Massachussetts, USA. The film is designed for use by teachers of art, and will be most useful if previewed by the teacher before use with a class."
