        "Domestic cattle drop 33 million tonnes of dung on Australian pastures every year. Pasture areas are reduced and fly pests, like the bushfly and the buffalo fly, thrive. Entomologists are seeking a solution to these problems through the dung beetle, which breaks up and disperses dung pads. Selected species of dung beetles imported from Africa are being mass bred in Australia for release in cattle breeding areas. Early results indicate that they will prove an outstanding example of biological control"
