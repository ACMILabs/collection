        "Mansfield Park Junior Primary School is the locale for this film which emphasizes the usefulness and value of community involvement in the school. Two dozen mothers tell what it means to them to be part of Mansfield Park. In breaking down the barriers that often still exist between the community and the school, Mansfield Park encourages High School students to visit weekly. There is an exchange of learning. The students are told about the understanding of children between 2 and 5 year and the students in turn help with youngsters with their puzzles and paintings."
