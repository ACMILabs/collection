        "In 1820 Oersted discovered that a wire carrying an electric current has a magnetic filed which varies in accordance with the variations of the current. From this discovery the telegraph was developed; the Trans-Atlantic cable laid; the discovery of the telephone; and the advent of the radio. The cable and radio link should be supplemented by signals from satellites - thus the communication network is gradually encompassing the world."
