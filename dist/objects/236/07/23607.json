        "The simple precautions that can save serious accidents on the waterfront. Watching wharf traffic; using gangways and not planks; keeping hatch covers, gear and dunnage stacked neatly out of the way; walking on the off side of an overhead crane; reporting damage promptly; working in good light; keeping guard rails and ropes around open hatches and holds."
