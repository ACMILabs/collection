        "An ancient Roman comes to life and tours the Pilkington glassworks. He discovers modern methods of manufacture and the wide range of uses for glass products; in aviation, at home, in industry, science and building. Each item's use and manufacture is demonstrates (with a streak of comedy to lighten the approach) including the grinding and polishing of lenses, the medieval technique of making glass by hand and mechanical glass blowing."
