        "This poignant story about the relationships between a boy and a tree illustrates some truths about the meaning of giving, receiving and love. The tree unselfishly offers itself to the boy for climbing, for shade and for pleasure. But as the boy grows up his life takes him further and further away from the tree. But old age brings their relationship full circle. Based on the book by Shel Silverstein. Music and narration by Shel Silverstein. Animation by Charlie O. Hayward."
