        "Dramatizes the responsibility of many social institutions for juvenile delinquency and for measures to reduce it. When a teenage boy is brought to trial for theft, the prosecutor also indicts the agencies of society which helped to shape his character. The church, the school, municipal government and the father are questioned about their efforts to prevent juvenile delinquency. All are found guilty and reminded of their responsibility for the welfare of youth."
