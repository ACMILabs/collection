        "'The Geelong' a tug boat in Corio Bay escorts cargo ships and tankers on the four hour journey along the deep but narrow channel into port. The tugs are on call day and night in the busy industrial port. All Geelong's shipping activities are controlled by the signal station at Point Henry, site of the original settlement of Geelong. Crude oil from Persia, phosphate from Nauru, sulphur from Mexico, are among the cargoes brought to the port, while wool, wheat and meat, products from the rich Western district, are among its exports."
