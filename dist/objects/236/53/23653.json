        "A report on the German problem, showing how events since World War II have made this divided nation an area of conflict between two ideologies. The film brings into focus the march of events that followed the country's collapse and its military occupations. The political manoeuvres of the Social bloc to build a satellite state, in opposition to the wish of the Western powers for a unified, democratic Germany, are seen as major factors in the struggle."
