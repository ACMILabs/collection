        "The first International Girl Guides camp to be held in Australia took place at Yarra Junction, Victoria, in January 1959. The film starts with the arrival of the guides who are from many countries, Great Britain, USA, NZ, and the Far East as well as all Australian states. Their life in camp is depicted and the international aspect emphasised by the exchange of signatures badges and by national dances. The Governor of Victoria, Sir Dallas Brooks, plays a visit to the camp and meets the leaders of each national group."
