        "Opens with a survey of the uses of electricity in everyday life. A simple laboratory experiment with magnet, solenoid and galvanometer is used to demonstrate the principles of electricity generation. Diagrams explain the operations of rotating coil and rotating magnet types of generators. The latter part of the film shows how water power is used to turn the turbines of generators used in power stations."
