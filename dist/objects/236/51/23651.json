        "German children express their feelings about the division of Germany in various art forms, painting, drawing, and modelling. Students selected from 80,000 entrants give impressions of 'indivisible Germany'. These dramatic visualisations range from conventional pencil drawing and painting, to collages, bas-reliefs, and sculpture, all conveying the intensity of feeling Germany's youth has toward reunifying their country. 'All Germany at one table' is an often heard slogan in the west."
