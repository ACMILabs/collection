        "Some pointers on the art of film projection, told through the humorous story of a poor showman who lost his film audience because he didn't know how to operate a 16mm projector. The moment that George Beesley appears on the scene we know something ridiculous is bound to happen--and it does! This sad sack merrily muddles through the film showing and annoys his audience so thoroughly that they walk out in disgust. An interested spectator then patiently explains the principles of efficient projection, while animated sequences demonstrate the construction of a projector, the preparation in advance of the room to be used for the showing, and the correct placement of screen and loudspeaker. Procedures for preventing damage to film and equipment are outlined. Animation by Wolf Koenig."
