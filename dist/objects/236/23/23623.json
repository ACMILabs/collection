        "This Italian art film traces a relationship between the shapes of nature and the modern sculpture of the Henry Moore school. The film considers the geometrical lines of nature - the shapes and lines of the human body, the structure of crystals and the spiral lines of a snail's shell - a combination of calculation and creative impulse. Art, by dint of instinct, approaches nature's examples, thus widening the range of our eyes and our minds. (Award: Venice)"
