    "description": [
        "This CD-ROM was created with assistance from the Cinemedia Mutlimedia 21 Fund by Fraynework Multimedia, a not-for-profit website, video and multimedia production house established by the Sisters of Mercy, Melbourne Congregation. The work is a documentary and interactive exploration of issues of identity, belonging and reconciliation in Australia. It names the land as that which settlers and indigenous peoples share in common, both as a physical resource and as a symbolic mediator of the spiritual. The user is taken on an interactive journey of discovery structured around five areas: Experience, Indigienous Culture, Land Issues, Understanding and Discovery. Content includes a detailed timeline dating back 60,000 years, summary and analysis of legal judgments, interviews, songs and paintings. The Discovery 'pathway' is a game where participants travel through the landscape collecting icons and artefacts. The CD-ROM has a linked website and encourages users to keep a journal of their thoughts but can be run without these components."
