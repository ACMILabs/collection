        "Because only his egg escaped a catfish massacre, Gilly grows up thinking he is really a too-long frog. Finally, unable to bear the unkind jibes of the frogs, he leaves the pond to find his true identity. When he returns he meets Sally Salamander, who tells him the facts of his life. This film uses the story about a salamander to motivate the practice of language skills and to encourage young children to share experiences in learning about themselves. For primary grades."
