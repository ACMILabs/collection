        "Traces the evolution of Germany from Charlemagne ti the present day. Stresses early disunity and rivalries of Emperor, Princes and Church. Unification in the 19th century; destruction in the Second World War followed by a rapid economic recovery, epitomised in the changing face of Bonn the new Federal Capital. Early history is portrayed in architecture, sculpture and art."
