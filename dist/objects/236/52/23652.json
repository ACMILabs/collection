        "Regional differentiation within Western Germany reflects the varied physical geography. Contrasts the Black Forest with the more active Rhinelands whose economic importance is accentuated by the proximity of the Ruhr coalfields. The historic south is in direct contrast with the recently reclaimed North Coast. The final sequence shows Berlin epitomising the East-West political division and the rapid post war economic recovery."
