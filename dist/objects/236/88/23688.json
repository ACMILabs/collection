        "Episode of Series \"Disordered Mind\". Psychiatrists Dr. June Cumberland and Dr. S.J. Shamsie interview Susan, a thirteen year old girl on the verge of becoming a delinquent. Susan's parents are also interviewed. Susan is intelligent and a leader; she is thirteen but looks eighteen, and emotionally most of the time is nearer six. She becomes a problem for her parents, her school and herself: she is apparently rushing toward delinquency. Her behaviour is discussed with police, her teachers and in counselling sessions with Susan and her parents. Susan still has problems after seven months of treatment but she has learned how to handle them with more maturity, and has a better relationship with her parents."
