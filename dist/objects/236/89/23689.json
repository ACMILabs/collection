        "Presents the changes of adolescence, from the superficial changes of growth, skin, body hair and body contour to the more complicated phenomena of glandular changes, sexual maturation, and the reproductive function. Throughout the film, individual differences such as those in rates of growth and in menstrual cycles are stressed as normal; the importance of sound habits of personal hygiene and health are highlighted. Also describes the male reproductive system. Narrated by Irene Tedrow."
