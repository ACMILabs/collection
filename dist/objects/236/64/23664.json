        "The mass media are being studied by scholars today more closely than ever before. Media study has been lagging behind but it is suggested that teaching at school level may help. This film shows what is being done in Tasmanian schools today with the critical study of news media and the study of film and television as an art form. It is one of the few states in Australia with a compulsory course in mass media as an examination subject in all secondary schools. The aim - to make students grow into discriminating adults."
