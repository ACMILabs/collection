        "Considers the limited opportunities available to women who want to compete in sporting events. Shows how these limitations are being replaced by new opportunities for women in a variety of competitive sports including track and field. Through a short history of track and field, with original archive footage of Babe Didrikson and Wilma Rudolf, the limitations that were available for women to compete in sporting events are shown. The experiences of three high-school girls - a cross-country runner, a shot putter and a broad jumper - shows the new opportunities available for girls today."
