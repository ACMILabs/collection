        "The epic story of the emergence of independence of the Gold Coast of Africa. Established by the Portuguese in the 15th century, Ghana became a British colony in 1874. The accent in this programme is on Prime Minister Nkrumah, political hero, and magnetic leader. Shows the industrial and social development since independence, proving that Ghana has won the right to freedom under Nkrumah."
