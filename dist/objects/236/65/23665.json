        "Examines the question of whether public health authorities are getting through the message of smoking's dangers. Two major obstacles are that smoking has been socially acceptable for 400 years, and that the effects of smoking are so long delayed \"you don't know in the morning that young get lung cancer in the afternoon\". Consternates on Charlie, a typical teenage smoker and his girlfriend, Judy, with narration by Burt Lancaster."
