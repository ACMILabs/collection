        "The gifted child, whose advanced mind distinguishes him from others of his age, is a valuable asset to society. Some say gifted children should be taught in a class of their own. Others say that the average classroom is better for them. The film presents the views of two prominent educators: Dr Florence Dunlop, Ottawa, and Dr. T.W. Martin, Toronto."
