        "An 'eye opener' film experiment, this is a single frame film where every frame is discontinuous with the preceding frame. An attempt was made to avoid any type of relationship between frames whether of images, shapes and forms or association of ideas. The film sets out to investigate the way in which we can 'read' the content of single frames, when the frames are presented under varying conditions. Some of the images have been carefully composed, while others filmed simply as found objects."
