        "The problem of maintaining a consistent quality standard in manufactured products is discussed by a Production Director and a Sales Director. Conventional methods of inspection between processes and again of the final product prove too costly, and it is decided that quality control should become part of the manufacturing process. The practical, theoretical and statistical aspects of quality control are fully developed."
