        "An investigation of the work and theories of Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, 1736-1806, an architect and innovator two centuries before his time. Initially he created chateaux for the French nobility, but later he became an urbanist, designing houses and cities for the working man. However, his utopian dream that architecture should be related to daily life was not realised."
