    "description": [
        "Based on photographer William Yang's one-man stage show, 'Sadness' is a journey into the past and a heart-breaking testament to the significant traces people leave behind. Through the use of slides, oral history and stylised recreations, Yang investigates the murder of his Uncle Fang Yuen in the sugar cane fields of North Queensland. Running alongside this narrative is a series of moving portraits of the many friends and lovers Yang has lost to AIDS. What emerges is a powerful requiem for the dead and the lasting legacy that family and friends have on the living."
