        "The method and value of mouth to mouth resuscitation. Fifty thousand people die needlessly each year from asphyxia after an accident. This could be prevented by prompt application of mouth to mouth rescue breathing. Diagrams show why this method of resuscitation is so much more effective than others, and detailed demonstrations are given on live patients, adult and child. The use of a plastic airway is shown, and how to care for the patient as natural breathing commences."
