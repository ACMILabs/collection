        "Shows the progress being made in the construction of the underground rail loop in the city of Melbourne. The four tunnels will link five stations at Flinders Street, Parliament, the Museum, Flagstaff and Spencer Street, thus relieving the present strain on the city's transport system. Although much work is yet to be completed - overhead wiring, retaining walls, rails to be laid - by the early 1980's, Melbourne will be a modern transport system city. Narrated by Michael Pate. Photographed by Dudley Robinson."
