        "The permian deposits found most notably in the Kimberley's, North-West Basin and the Hunter Valley are some of the world's richest fossil deposits. Mostly marine, but some fresh-water and land strata fossils are included. Typical fossils such as butterfly shells, starfish, lace coral, as well as plants and coal seams are highlighted."
