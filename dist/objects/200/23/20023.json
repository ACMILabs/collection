        "A record of the 1954 Redex around Australia reliability car trial. The 9,600 mile route commenced at Sydney and passed through every Australian capital city. Only 124 of the 248 starters finished the 18-day trial. The film captures the atmosphere and illustrates conditions experienced by drivers in the trial as they drove through the rain, extremes of heat and cold, choking dust, across roads which in many places were rarely used bush tracks full of hazards to both car and their weary, strained drivers, who, at the same time had to be careful of secret controls to check their speed. Concluding sequences show arrival, welcome and presentation of the winner."
