        "Experimental film which brings alive a small boy's dream as he wanders to the Sydney Harbour waterfront and imagines life on a \"mothball\" warship. Without commentary, but with clever use of sound the warship resounds to the cry of \"Action Stations\", the sound of running feet, firing, vibrations and cheers echo through the empty ship. Finally the ship's flag is run up and the dream ends with his mother calling him home."
