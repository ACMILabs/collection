        "Examines the aboriginal and part-aboriginal situation in Australia today (1964), showing some of the problems associated with their welfare and the policies aimed at their assimilation. Surveys conditions on government welfare settlements and mission stations, where different tribes learn to live together, and are taught new social, occupational and educational skills. Many work happily with other Australians in the Northern Australian cattle industry, but in towns stand apart from the rest of the community. Notes how social barriers need to be overcome if assimilation is to take place."
