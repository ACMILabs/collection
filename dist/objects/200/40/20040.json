        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". Looks at two problems facing aborigines in Alice Springs - child care and alcoholism. In 1970 the death rate among Aboriginal children rose to nearly 1 in 5, one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. Today the ratio has improved, but Aboriginal health still presents a grim picture. Interviews people concerned. Reporter: Brian King; Photographer: Richard Bailie-Mace; Sound: Peter Lipscomb."
