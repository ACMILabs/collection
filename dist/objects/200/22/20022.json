        "Coverage of the 1937 Nuremberg Rally. The film opens with views of Nuremberg immediately prior to the rally. Hitler is seen arriving in Nuremberg by aeroplane and driving through crowd lined streets to a rousing reception. Propaganda shots of factory production, farming activities etc., precede coverage of the rally itself. Shots of massed troops parading before Hitler are followed by a display of military weapons etc. The film closes with night scenes of the rally and a fireworks display. There is no commentary."
