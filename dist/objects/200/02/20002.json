        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Critic and the Film\". John Freeman discusses the film \"3.10 to Yuma\", an example of the \"psychological western\". He illustrates three important functions of the critic; analysis, interpretation and evaluation. Shows that criticism can be both entertaining in itself, and increase the pleasure obtained from the film. He avoids talking down to his audience yet he conveys a sense of authority. He exposes the cliche, which even the serious western cannot escape, with considerable humour."
