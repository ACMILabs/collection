        "Shows the treatment of children's personality disorders through their participation in group activities guided by a permissive adult. Focuses on three boys with different problems: one is over-aggressive, another is withdrawn and latently schizophrenic and the third is introverted and suffering from anxiety hysteria. Their progress is traced through many scenes of group activities, filmed with a hidden camera."
