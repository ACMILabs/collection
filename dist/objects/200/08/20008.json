        "A wry comment on the machine-dominated man, the man to whom nothing matters, who waits on chance for his number to come up. An experimental film presenting a succession of many unrelated views of passing crowds - church, in the street, in the circus. The effect is chaotic, but true to life. (Awards: Chicago, Ann Arbor, Palo Alta.)"
