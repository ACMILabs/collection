        "The film deals with the sexual anatomy, physiology and behaviour of both sexes from conception to adulthood. It uses explicit live photography of nude males and females to explain external sexual anatomy - and graphics and diagrams for internal anatomy. It moves, in order through conception embryonic development, early childhood puberty, adolescence and adulthood. The film describes ovulation and menstruation in girls, ejaculation in boys and treats masturbation as a normal sexual activity in both sexes. At appropriate times through out the film, young people express spontaneous feelings and tell of individual experiences."
