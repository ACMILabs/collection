        "A compilation of 19 Thomas Edison films, some made for use in kinetoscopes others for public projection, averaging less than one minute each. Most are single shot films except 'McKinley's Inauguration' and 'Admiral Dewey at Manila Bay' which are made up of several shots. Includes \"Washing the Baby\" (1893) and \"Inauguration of President McKinley\" (1896) and what is regarded as the first advertising film."
