        "If you erase the people of downtown America, the effect is bizarre, not to say disturbing. That is what this film does. It shows the familiar urban scene without a soul in sight; streets empty, buildings empty, yet everywhere there is evidence of recent life and activity. At the end of the film we learn what has happened. Awards: London; Cracow; Salerno."
