        "An exciting exploration of the weather and how man may one day learn to control it. For this film a great deal of extraordinary colour footage of the sky was put together, including a demonstration of rain-making. There are views of the geysers of the sun, of bright streamers of northern lights, of wind-stirred clouds, and even the awesome fury of a hurricane.
