        "This film explores the meaning of teaching and suggests creative methods for use by teachers. Samples of teaching methods are shown: lecturers who communicate with words, with the assistance of the blackboard, with slide projectors etc. Success in teaching rests upon organisation of material in a meaningful way. Suggested materials are charts, films, film strips, lantern slides, tape recorders."
