        "An experimental film produced by photographing neon signs in the wet pavements of Times Square New York. This unusual film was painstakingly photographed on rainy nights, under difficult conditions, over a period of five years. The producer has discovered, and recorded, a wealth of visual beauty in the patterns and movements of the constantly changing light reflections."
