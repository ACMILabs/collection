        "Remote and baffling except to the most daring climbers, the high peaks are worlds apart where only the most tenacious of living things endure. Forests give way to stunted vegetation and finally to the hardiest of plants adapted to withstand the rigours of bitter cold, glaring sun and tearing wind. The only animals found here are the wild, tough ones such as the mountain goat, elk and bighorn sheep. In true-life colour this film presents an account of life at this specialised level. Film award: Film Survey, Trieste, Italy."
