        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". Proton donor-acceptor theory is used to interpret the experimental behaviour of acid-base indicators. Experiments and animation show the effects on indicators of changing acidity. Equilibrium constants of four indicators are determined and the indicators arranged in order of decreasing acid strength. The competition among bases for protons is shown by mixing the indicators and showing that each changes colour at different total acidity."
