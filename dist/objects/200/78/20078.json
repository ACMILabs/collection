        "This film was made at the invitation of the United Nations Organisation to illustrate the part played by Australia in a UNESCO campaign to foster better understanding between nations. Technical advances have broken down the old barriers to knowledge, but there still remain the barriers in men's minds. The film illustrates the work being done by UNESCO in breaking down these remaining barriers."
