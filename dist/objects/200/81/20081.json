        "The story of the new Cathedral at Coventry. Beginning with the blitz that destroyed the medieval church, it moves through all the stages of rebuilding and visits the studios of the artists concerned. Features Graham Sutherland's gigantic tapestry, Epstein's St. Michael and the devil, some of the stained glass windows, and the figures engraved on the plate glass entrance."
