        "The story of London's underground railway, from the building of the original Metropolitan line with its steam drawn trains, to its latest addition, the ultra modern Victorian line. Lord Morrison tells how London Transport became the model for similar undertakings throughout the world; artist Henry Moore shows how the tube became a wartime refuge, and tunnel engineers explain the problems, past, present and future, of building and operating this vast system."
