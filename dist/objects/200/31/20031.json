        "Yesterday and Tomorrow is a French/English dubbed documentary which summarizes Abel Gance's entire career, from his days working initially as an actor in the film industry, up until 1963, the year this program was made. The documentary shows excerpts of his films including shorts like \"La Folie du Docteur Tube\" (1915). It is narrated through \"the words of Gance\", who explains how his career was plagued with tragedy and little recognition."
