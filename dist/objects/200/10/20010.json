        "This film from the heart of India is a story of a rural Hindu family. The film evokes sympathy and understanding for things people everywhere have in common: the love of a farmer for his land, the devotion of a mother to her children. This is the day-to-day life of Vishnu Shevale and his family in the village of Phursangi, fifty miles from Poona."
