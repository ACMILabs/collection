        "Episode of Series \"Man Alive\". An examination of the difficulties which surround women who want and those who perform the act of abortion. The 1967 Abortion Act in Britain is to be reviewed. This well intentioned legislation has resulted in illogicalities whereby some private abortionists are profitting while the National Health Service is sometimes reluctant to help."
