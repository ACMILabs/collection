        "Based on a short story by Ray Bradbury, this short film is set on a planet where the sun shines for only a few minutes once every nine years. Margot, a frail loner, wistfully recalls her days on sunny Earth and waits longingly for the rare appearance of the sun. But she pays dearly for her sensitivity when, as a victim of teasing, she is locked in a closet for the duration of the event. The other children, overwhelmed by the sun's warmth, have forgotten and left her there. By the time they release her it's too late - the rain has begun to fall. This is a tale of the destructive nature of thoughtlessness and cruelty."
