        "A mad gangster musical set in the New York of the 1920s, a world of would-be hoodlums, show girls and dreamers. But there are no adults, only children. Bugsy, Blousey, Tallulah, Fat Sam, Fizzy, Leroy and Loney are some of the characters involved in a bitter gang war for possession of the dreaded \"spurge gun\". Stars a very young Jodie Foster."
