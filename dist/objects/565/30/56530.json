        "This film depicts situations that children could encounter with strangers, as well as with known adults, that involve physical and sexual abuse and shows children how to deal with these potential situations. Stresses that children are in no way to blame for the deviant behaviour of adults and should not feel guilty about their involvemenmt in these situations. Presents three rules for children to follow: SAY NO, GET AWAY, TELL SOMEONE. Suitable for Mid Primary-Upper Secondary level students. No other credits available."
