        "This production was adapted from the play of the same name and remained basically a filmed stage play. Dorothy Brunton plays Clara Gibbings, the proprietor of a London pub, who discovers that she is the legitimate but abandoned daughter of the Earl of Dunmoor. She launches herself into high society but soon grows disillusioned and decides to return to the fresh air of her own class. A young aristocrat, Errol, has meanwhile learnt to respect Clara and to see his own decadent life in a new light. Impulsively he proposes marriage and they depart for Australia."
