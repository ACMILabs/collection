        "A portrait of a country veterinarian, working mother, and partner in a thriving practice. In the film, Dr. Drouin shares many facets of her life: at work in her surgery, making \"house calls\" that take her over a hundred miles from home, and rare moments of relaxation with her husband and child. Articulate and forthright, she talks about the joys and sorrows of being a veterinarian, and how she balances the demands of a busy profession with those of raising a family."
