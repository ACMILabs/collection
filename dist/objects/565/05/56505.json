        "Pinus radiata is shown to be a reliable and versatile source of timber. The life cycle of the pine is traced from the propagation through planting to initial thinning and clear felling. The milling process is then examined along with kiln drying and treatment with protective chemicals. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
