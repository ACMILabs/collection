        "An introduction to the study of fossil homo sapiens, this film provides a starting point for more detailed discussions. Presents a time line upon which only a small part represents recorded history, the rest is pre-history. The film also discusses a 100 year search by scientists for the earliest evidence of human existence. Suitable for secondary level."
