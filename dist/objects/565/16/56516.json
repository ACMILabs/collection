        "Argues that poems demand a special attention and that there is no correct single response to a poem. To emphasise this, three people are shown responding spontaneously after reading the following short lyric poems: \"So we'll go no more a-roving\" (Byron), \"An Arundel tomb: stanza five\" (Larkin), \"Love\" (Herbert), and \"After great pain\" (Dickinson). Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
