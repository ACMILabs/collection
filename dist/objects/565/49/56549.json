        "Leading Canadian scientist David Suzuki examines the background to Canada's reliance on oil and offers somce solutions to the problems posed by its growing scarcity. Industry and citizens must look for ways to conserve energy in order to lower the escalating cost of operating factories, heating homes and transporting people and goods. \"This Is an Emergency\" looks at some of the methods used in Sweden and gives practical solutions to the much talked about energy crisis. In an entertaining way, the film delivers important information about controlling energy costs that affect the price of goods we buy. Uses some animation and still photography."
