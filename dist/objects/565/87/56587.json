        "Episode of Series \"Chemistry\". The substances forming our world are composed of atoms held together by powerful electrical forces called chemical bonds. The physical and chemical properties of elements and compounds depend on the nature of these bonds. Discusses metallic, ionic, covalent and interatomic bonds and forces dealing with ions, atoms, crystals, valence, polarity and Van der Waals forces. Suitable for upper secondary level."
