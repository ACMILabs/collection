        "Beautifully animated film about a family living in an isolated part of Canada. Highlights aspects of remote rural life, such as long travelling periods in difficult weather conditions, the need for family members to be conscientious about various responsibilities around the farm and the closeness that can develop between members of a farming family. The story centres around a farm girl whose father will not allow her to keep a stray puppy until an event occurs that makes him reverse his decision. Based on a award-winning children's book by Ann Blades."
