        "This short animated film for children looks at the last of the great dinosaurs to stalk the central plains of North America. Lifelike models of ornithomimus, edmontosaur, and triceratops recreate the late Cretaceous period, offering a view of how our world may have looked 64,000,000 years ago. The soundtrack is filled with growls and roars with the occassional voice-over narration."
