        "Born in Swansea, Wales, in 1914, Dylan Thomas would eventually become one of the greatest English-language poets of his century. This lyrical documentary uses archival material and reconstructed dramatic sequences to situate his poetry in his earliest experiences of growing up as a child in Wales. By concentrating on his childhood, and his early career as a journalist and poet, this biography links the themes of his poetry and prose in the sensual inspiration that the Welsh landscape provided the young artist. The voice of Dylan is heard reading several of his poems."
