The Allied Pacific offensive came under the command of two rivals; General Macarthur sweeps upward from the Solomon Islands and New Guinea to the Philippines, and Admiral Nimitz leaps from island to island starting in November 1943 in the Gilbert Islands at Tarawa. Heavy casualties awaited the Americans in their attack. Part 24. On August 1945, an American B-59 bomber, The \"Enola Gay\", named after the mother of the pilot, Paul Tibbets, droped the world's first uranium bomb on the city of Hiroshima. Four days latter a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki."
