        "As in her previous film, the award-winning The Hometown, the filmmaker has used applique and embroidered tapestries to animate a story from her childhood. Distant Islands recalls a young girl's happy summers spent sailing with her family off the coast of British Columbia. Each tapestry, meticulously stitched by hand with brightly colored yarns, evokes a memory of leisurely days at sea, drifting among the islands."
