        "J. R. R. Tolkien's massive three volume saga tells the story of how a few brave individuals manage to avert the Apocalypse by their boldness, chivalry, self-sacrifice and faith. Ralph Bakshi, America's foremost new-style animator, translates this \"impossible dream\" into a full-length cartoon in a way that respects Tolkien's story and inspiration, turning a literary classic into a magical visual experience. A large cast of mainly British voices, including John Hurt's, excites the discriminating ear as much as the movie enchants the eye. Peter S. Beagle co-wrote the screenplay with Chris Conkling."
