        "This film was one of the many documentaries shot in Victoria by Efftee Studios in the early 30s. In this newsreel compiled and narrated by Peter Newmarch of \"The Truth\" newspaper and shot by Bert Nicholas, several Melbourne socialites are featured at various functions: a social party in South Yarra, the first official meeting of the Centenary Dog Club at the Melbourne Showground and Ron Cameron's Riding School. NOTE: No titles included."
