        "This film provides a look at how animators use their imagination; it also shows the materials they use. The film is divided into sections which show the creation of brief but effective story lines or commentaries in various media. Plasticine becomes a gracefully moving woman; another blob becomes a comic singer complete with cape; an egg revolves, bounces and catches fish."
