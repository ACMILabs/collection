        "This was the first feature film of the Melbourne enterprise Efftee Films and was adapted for the screen by Pat Hanna from three sketches from his popular Diggers stage show, which featured two Australian cobbers serving in the AIF in France in 1918. The first episode presents the two friends in their attempts to steal rum from a British Army Store; the second episode shows them relaxing in a French cafe while a fellow digger romances with the waitress; the final episode finds the diggers in hospital feigning illness to escape active duty. Cast includes Pat Hanna and George Moon."
