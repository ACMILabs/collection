        "Leo Dickinson is an English cameraman who goes to such lengths as parachuting from 8000 feet or suspending himself from ropes above a gorge to get a better camera angle. This film, narrated by Dickinson, shows footage shot by him in the Himalayas and the Sudan. When a comrade falls 150 feet down a mountain and another nearly drowns in the rapids, Dickinson keeps on filming. Two climbers cling like spiders to a twenty-five degree fall, Dickinson is there too. The footage is so beautifully filmed and well edited that it is hard to believe that it was taken under such bad conditions and without time to erect tripods or wait for the right light. Photographed by Leo Dickinson and edited by Terry Elgar."
