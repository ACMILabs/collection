        "This film, showing aspects of the life of crocodile hunters on the Gulf of Carpentaria, was one of eleven short Australian educational films produced by Efftee Studios as a result of a partnership between naturalist Noel Monkman and Frank Thring Snr. Monkman photographed and directed the films and Frank Thring Snr narrated most of them. Two series were produced: the \"Barrier Reef\" series which consisted of five films and the \"Australian Marvelogue\" series, of which \"Catching Crocodiles\" is one of six. Suitable for secondary school level."
