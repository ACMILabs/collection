        "This film looks at the life and works of the American sculptor George Segal who invented his own personal style of sculpture: white plaster figures that silently prevail in their own environments, which have been influenced by American townships. The figures are cast from live models, Segal's family and friends. Shows Segal at work and the controversy aroused by his commisioned piece for Kent University."
