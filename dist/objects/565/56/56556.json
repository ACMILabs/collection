        "Episode of Series \"Wildlife on One\". Explores a dramatic breakthrough in the knowledge of animal behaviour. For the first time scientists have proved that vertebrate predator - fringe-lipped batrachops, (which inhabits the rain forest in Central America), can intercept the signals of another animal, the mud puddle frog, to identify and locate it as prey. Shows how the biologists went about obtaining their data."
