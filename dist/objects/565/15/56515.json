        "An absorbing look at an Italian-American family who continue to carry on a family tradition of some sixty years of operating a marionette theatre. The family makes and paints the marionettes, which are almost life-sized and extremely heavy, makes the armour and other costumes, operates the marionettes, provides the music and sells the tickets. An excellent example of a traditional Sicilian form of theatre."
