        "The processes involved in pinpointing the appearance of humans on earth are discussed in this film. Fossils discovered in South Africa in 1924 bore evidence that humans first appeared in Africa, not Asia, contrary to prevailing scientific opinion. Shows how further discoveries by anthropologists proved without doubt the existence of a human-like creature who lived in Africa as long as three and a half million years ago. Narrated by E. G. Marshall"
