        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Out of the fiery furnace\". EPISODE 2 OF OUT OF THE FIERY FURNACE - Iron became a universal replacement for bronce; techniques evolved to \"steel\", quench and temper it. The Bronze Age collapsed when a new metal \"iron\" emerged. The Chinese who were the first to cast it, developed huge blast furnaces. The Hittites, of Turkey, were the first to make iron of good quality, and the iron age spread from Damascus throughout Europe. Shows the importance of mining to the ancient civilizations of Grece and Rome. Presented by Michael Charlton."
