        "The Volunteer Emergency Reserve was established in 1965 and acts as a vital backup to the Victoria Police in emergencies. In 1974, the VER was called in to assist in the search for a young boy lost in the bush. This child was not found, but to help prevent further such tragedies the \"Find me book\" was devised. The distinctive orange colored pages of the book can be torn out and used by the lost person to mark their way. Points on how to stay comfortable in the bush are also given."
