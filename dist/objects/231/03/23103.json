        "This first film by a young New Zealand art student uses the motorcycle as a sex symbol in the lives of the \"beat\" generation...a girl's infatuation with a motorcycle and its rider. This film was made as a design project at the School of Fine Arts, University of Auckland, and makes interesting use of various film techniques."
