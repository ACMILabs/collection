        "An asthmatic child is hospitalized, bringing together his estranged parents, whose obvious hostility toward each other intrudes upon their real concern for their child. They finally lose control and quarrel in his presence as he is about to leave the hospital. The boy has another serious attack, but with the help of a sympathetic nurse, the parents realise they must stop battling for their child's love."
