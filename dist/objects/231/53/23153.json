        "The aim of the film is to motivate the viewer to clean up fire hazards in their home. Home fires can be more immediately damaging than ecological pollution. Several people are spectators at a home fire; on their return home, they recognise fire hazards in their own environment, and quickly take steps to eliminate the possibility of fires in their homes."
