        "This film presents problems arising when filming a person walking into a room to talk to someone. Explains that certain effects can be created in the minds of an audience by the way the sequence is filmed and edited. Uses animation and live action to illustrate examples of variation achieved by changes in camera movement and placement, composition of scene, and cutting during or at junction points of action. The film concludes with scenes selected to form a sequence for audience interpretation."
