        "Episode of Series \"History of the Motion Picture\". Traces the techniques and situations used by film makers during the early years of experimentation with the film medium. In its first two decades the industry tried almost all of the techniques and situations which were to be developed or reintroduced later. Specific names, dates, and excerpts from early films illustrate the work of innovators in techniques, equipment, stories, themes, roles and industry operation. Developments include the first use of synchronized sound; tracking with movie cameras; animation; models; props, and camera trickery for special effects, and underwater photography."
