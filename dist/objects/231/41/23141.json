        "This film presents the beauty and variety of modern design on Finland. Shows designers at work at their drawing boards and in their studios creating by hand, what is later mass produced in the factory. Includes steel saucepans and cutlery, colorful weaving, the creation of pottery, its earliest stage as clay turning on a hand-wheel and beautiful glass being blown by skilled craftsmen working closely with the designer of the product."
