        "Contrasts the work of three Hollywood editors. Shows that the manner in which the film is sequenced, determines the dramatic effect. Firstly we see the film exactly as shot for a dramatic sequence, showing all scenes from various angles. Following these are three editing interpretations of the sequence by different editors. Demonstrates how, in assembling the shots, by omitting and shortening others and by different juxtaposition, the editor may control the dramatic construction. Looks at how a scene from the television series \"Gunsmoke\" is interpreted by different editing."
