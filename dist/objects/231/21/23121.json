        "Episode of Series \"Film making techniques\". Like good athletes, stuntmen must warm up before attempting any feats. Control and practice are of paramount importance. For realism rehearsal in the front of a camera and the matching of the movements of the actor and stuntman are essential. The narrator Jack Mohoney, as well as giving the historical background to stunts in films gives many hints on safety and training."
