        "Traces the development of a simple but effective device for abolishing the industrial smoke menace. In wartime the black smoke trails from ships' funnels indicated the position of convoys. Experiments carried out on board ship and at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research's Fuel Resesarch Station resulted in a new boiler door fitment which minimised the danger. Redesigned to suit industrial boilers, the smoke eliminator door also saves a considerable quantity of fuel."
