        "During Easter 2002, activists from around Australia converged upon Woomera Detention Centre to protest the federal government's mandatory detention of refugees. Activists coordinated with the detainees' protests within the detention centre, resulting in the mass breakout of 50 refugees. Most of the escapees were returned to the detention centre, but 11 detainees achieved freedom. The activists continued to protest the inhumane treatment of refugees in detention throughout the weekend, expressing their solidarity with both the detained refugees and also the people that escaped. This incident led to an increase in global awareness surrounding mandatory detention policies in Australia"
