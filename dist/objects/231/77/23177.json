        "A teacher is faced with many problems when an aggressive child becomes a member of her second grade class. The disrupting influence of the new boy, whose emotional difficulties lead him to bully the other children, is skilfully dealt with by the understanding teacher who not only helps the boy, but restores balance in the classroom by helping the other children handle their feelings. A problem in group dynamics is solved by adjustment which gives the children insight into the feelings that lie behind their actions."
