Spurred on by the English, who wish to ensure that Joan does not revive the campaign against them, the Church authorities press the interrogation of Joan, and next day have her burnt at the stake as a \"lapsed heretic\". Includes Dianna Lynn as Joan. Written for television by Milton Geiger; director of photography by Ed Fitzgerald and narrated by Walter Cronkite."
