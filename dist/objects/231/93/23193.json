        "An animated cartoon illustrating bacteriological contamination of fish and correct methods of handling to ensure freshness from boat to dinner table. The spoilage process is portrayed by battalions of little red demons, who march in full invading force upon the hapless forms of freshly caught fish. They demonstrate effectively how every act of carelessness in fish handling will increase their numbers, and also how proper refrigeration and sanitary handling will rout them."
