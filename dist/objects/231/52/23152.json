        "Dramatic close-up views of a volcano erupting and rare features associated with volcanic action. Filmed during the eruption of Kilauea, on the island of Hawaii in 1969, this was the second greatest eruption in Hawaii's history, the fountain height exceeding 1800 feet. The lava cascade was more than twice the height of Niagara Falls."
