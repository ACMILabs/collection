        "Concentrates upon basic first aid steps. Simulated situations provide an opportunity to discuss and demonstrate mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, shock, bleeding, burns, fractures, poisoning and sudden illness. A recap is made of all first aid directions. Shots of real accidents provide realism which reinforce the film's theme. Narrated by Burt Reynolds."
