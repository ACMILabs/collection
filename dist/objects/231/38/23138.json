        "In this cut-out colour cartoon by film artist Evelyn Lambart, two quarrelsome birds get the urge to change their plumage. A bluejay wants to be decked out in the green of the cedar, and a loon in the burnished red of oak leaves. There is a moral to the story. Neither bird had reckoned on the consequences of vanity. Along comes a gust of wind and both learn to their consternation that their natural, well-anchored feathers offered better protection."
