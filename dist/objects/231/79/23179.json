        "A film on air pollution, with surprising disclosures of what the seemingly empty air around us holds. The film noses around the atmosphere that encloses our Earth - the comparatively thin envelope of air on which all life depends. The problem is discussed by engineers, health authorities and scientists, including Nobel-prize-winning chemist Dr. Linus Pauling."
