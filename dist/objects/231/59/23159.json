        "Episode of Series \"Outdoor Education and Recreation\". An experienced woodsman and a group are stranded in the wilderness. Led by the woodsman, they locate a good campsite, build a shelter of poles and evergreen boughs, construct a fire reflector and build a fire. The woodsman then demonstrates how a fire can be built even without matches, using the Indian bow and drill method."
