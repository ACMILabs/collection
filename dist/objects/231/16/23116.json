        "Episode of Series \"Film making techniques\". If pre-production meetings have been carefully enough organised then going on location should pose no problem. The location chosen is determined by the demands of the script, but before it is actually chosen permits for its use, budgetary considerations and familiarisation by the crew are essential. The film gives numerous hints for filming and graphically explains points of job allocations, camera use and lighting."
