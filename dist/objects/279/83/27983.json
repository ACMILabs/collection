        "An account of the community services provided by Swedish libraries. A typical library is shown - the building being attractively designed, spacious and well equipped. Aspects of library work include general reference and lending library, provision of material from central research libraries, picture collections, scores for music, gramophone records and documentary films. Special activities of the children's department and adult education functions held at the library, are also shown."
