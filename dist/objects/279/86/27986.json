        "Episode number 13 of Series \"The Commonwealth of Nations\". There is world-wide significance in the planned process by which Britain is helping her colonies master the art of self-government. This concluding film cites recent developments in Ghana, Nigeria, Nyasaland and other colonial territories where political evolution has seen striking progress in recent years. Edgar McInnis analyzes these developments on the basis of two main considerations; and why a ruling power should arrange for its own departure from its colonies; why, once independent, the former subjects should continue to associate with their former master."
