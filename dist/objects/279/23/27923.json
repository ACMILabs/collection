        "This film opens with a glimpse of the natives in their villages. These villages furnish native labour for the farms, cities and mines of the country. We are shown glimpses of Johannesburg, which lies on a plateau and developed out of the extensive gold-mining operations in that region. A visit to a mining engineer and his family living in the suburbs indicates that their traditions derive from the Dutch and English who constituted the original white population. There are views of the large cattle ranches on the veldt, the orange groves, and, in the south, grape country. The processes of gold mining and the demand mines at Kimberly are shown. The film closes with views of Captetown, the seaport."
