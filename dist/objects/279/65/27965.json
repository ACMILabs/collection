        "A short cartoon summary of steel making followed by a humorous glimpse of a world suddenly deprived of its steel. A rhyming commentary guides through the processing of the steel, which is conveyed pictorially by bold attempts to combine the utilitarian approach of the drawing office and the artistic licence of the abstract painter."
