        "Depicts the human struggle against hunger and sickness. Insects outnumber man by 50 million to one and are man's rival for food. Man has interfered with the balance of nature and now can only come to terms with his rivals by using organised scientific methods of control. Examples are drawn from many parts of the world, including the desert locust in East Africa and the use of aircraft against them."
