        "Lists the pattern of national evolution in France as an example of the growth of nationalism in many European countries. Explains how the increasing importance of artisans and merchants, resulting from increased travel and better tools and manufacturing methods, helped to strengthen the position of the king; and how the greater wealth provided him with funds to carry on wars and create central services. Shows the famous people of the era and many of the critical struggles."
