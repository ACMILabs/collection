        "Through a study of the values, aspirations and achievements of Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, the effect these men had on the growth of great business enterprises and the further effect those enterprises had on American society is shown. Life among coalminers and in the slums contrast with the lifestyle of the rich and show the direct relationship between the monopolistic practices, ruthless competition and expropriation, and the lives of the poor."
