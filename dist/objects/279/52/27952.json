        "Re-enacts the development of the important co-operative movement in the fishing villages of the Canadian Maritime provinces. In the Twenties, when nearly all the inhabitants were close to starvation, a Government Commission set about to remedy the situation and recommended the formation of co-operatives, with Government assistance. The film shows the benefits to the community of properly organized individual and group self-help."
