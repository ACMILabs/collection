        "Gives the colorful history of the Orange River, lifeblood of half of South Africa's cities in the east and its farms in the west. We see the mountains where the river rises, the farms and cities along its course, with the dams and tunnels now changing its face. Diamond mining has been the major industry since diamonds were discovered in 1866; now underwater drilling has commenced where the Orange enters the sea."
