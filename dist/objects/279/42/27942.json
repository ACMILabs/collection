        "An on-the-spot account of how a shipping hazard on Canada's west coast was blasted out of existence by the worlds greatest non-atomic explosion. The film shows how the submerged twin peaks of Ripple Rock, in Seymour Narrows between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland, were packed with high explosives through an underwater tunnel, and then blown sky-high. For the first time in history ships could pass back and forth without fear of being caught by the underwater death trap."
