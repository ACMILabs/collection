        "Using simple musical instruments, a teacher explains to elementary school children the significance of rhythm and accent. Shows how rhythm is found within the individual, within his environment, and in music. Points out the variations in rhythm by accenting beats and by using longer and shorter beats. Shows also how melodies and rhythm are dependent on each other for support to culminate in music."
