        "A Sunday afternoon at the community skating rink in the park. Rhythmic music from a load speaker urges everyone to strike out boldly on his won, even the toddler. Girls pair off to flash their skates in the wig-wag movement of the twist, and past them speed boys in gay hockey sweaters. Without words, the film conveys the relaxed zest of a bright winter day."
