        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Children's Concert\". To an audience of eager youngsters, Eugene Kash, conductor of the Ottawa Children's Concerts, explains the fundamentals of rhythm and introduces the percussion instruments. An old Indian tom-tom is compared with modern drums, and a children's rhythm band performs under the direction of a diminutive leader. Schemes in music classes show how teachers capitalize on the interest stimulated by the concerts."
