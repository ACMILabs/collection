        "A river derives from the rain and snow that fall on the highest part of the land. The melting snow and the rain form streams, which eventually join to become a river which works its way downward toward the ocean. Along the way it flows through a lake and signs of man start to appear, with towns and cities. Some cities are used as river ports where ships transport goods and people."
