        "The story of the early days of Sydney Cove told by means of historical stills and by the re-enactment of the crossing of the Blue Mountains by Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson, the resulting development and relics of that period, including the old Court House at Hartley. Today fast transport enables commuters to travel to and from Sydney and the Blue Mountains in less than two hours, passing through towns named after the three explorers."
