        "A river's life is traced from its origin in water evaporation from the ocean to its final return to the sea. On its way, the river serves man's need for transport, recreation, power; is polluted by his wastes; and wreaks havon on his creations as a flood. The lyrics of a folk ballad provide the narration."
