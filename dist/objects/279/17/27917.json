        "Year round activity on the rice farms of the Riverina where rice is grown under irrigation in rotation with wheat, oats and fodder and sheep and cattle are also run. Sheep are sheared in August and during this time of the year the land is cultivated for the summer rice crop. Harvesting of the rice is done by contract when the rice ripens after five months and the rice is then processed at the co-operatively owned mill."
