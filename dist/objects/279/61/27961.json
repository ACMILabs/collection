        "Early settlers were plagued by flood and drought along the Murray, today the waters are controlled by the various dams, locks and canals which have been constructed along its course. Includes the Hume Reservoir, Mulwala Canal and the channel at Frenchman's Creek. Now floodwaters are checked, dry lands irrigated, electric power is generated, useless land can be reclaimed, and the river is navigable from the mouth to a point just beyond Mildura. The film also considers the effect of this system on the development of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia."
