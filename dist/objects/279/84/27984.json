        "This great Roman thoroughfare was the path of the medieval pilgrims described in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Evoking memories of Shakespeare and Dickens, the camera follows the road from St Paul's Cathedral in London, through towns and villages and the Kentish orchards and hopfields to Canterbury Cathedral which St Augustine made the centre of Christianity in England nearly 1400 years ago."
