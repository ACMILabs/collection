        "A succession of the drawings of the Australian sculptor, Robert Klippel, covering the period from 1947-1963. Shows the development of the creative talent - an exploration of the mind of a fascinating man, the things which inspired him and the many strange, abstract drawings which were the result of his experiences in Australia and overseas. The commentary is by Klippel himself. Music by Larry Sitsky."
