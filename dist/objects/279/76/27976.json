        "Portrays the people called the Hamar, who live in the scrubland of Ethiopia. Points out that in this society, the men are the masters and the women are slaves and shows how this sexual inequality affects the mood and behaviour of the people. A Hamar woman speaks to the camera at intervals throughout - her words have subtitles. Suitable for secondary level."
