        "Cocteau uses much of the material of his earlier film \"L'Amitie Noir\"; it records the culture of the Chad people of French Equatorial Africa, showing the arts, the handicrafts, and some of their traditional ceremonial dances which have never before been recorded on film. Rarely heard songs and music, authentically recorded on the spot are another interesting feature of the film."
