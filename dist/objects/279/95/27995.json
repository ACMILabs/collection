        "Surveys the biography and works of the Victorian poet Robert Browning, focussing on the revelation of dramatic monologue. The film shows the things from which Browning drew his inspiration and uses paintings, early photographs and scenes of unchanged parts of London and Italy to illustrate the events of his life. Selections of his poetry are read by constumed actors, emphasising the drama and psychological insight of his work. Narrated by Andrew Faulds."
