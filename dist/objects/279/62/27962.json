        "A study of river pollution in Europe and how it can be overcome by the treatment of urban and industrial wastes. When a river is overloaded with waste and the normal methods of breakdown are impossible, man-made systems of purification can be utilised to keep the water clean. Uses microphotography to show river organisms."
