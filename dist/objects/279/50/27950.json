        "Shows that a major city is composed of an extraordinary diversity of individuals, many of whom came to the city to fulfil a private dream of success. Demonstrates that as immigrants came to the city, they changed and built it to fit their demands and desires, and that as they build the city, the city environment also changed them. Points out that those problems that confronted the city in the past are still major problems facing urban centres today."
