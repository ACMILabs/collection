        "Racconti: La Voce Del Popolo (The Voice of the People) is a powerful living memory and dedication to the lives of hard working Australian/Italians and celebrates the enormous contribution they have made to this country. Through the Digital storytelling program at the Australian Centre for Moving Image (ACMI) the 10 storytellers were guided through the telling of a personal story using multimedia tools. The participants used their voice as narrative and combined the audio-visual resources of their personal archives (photographs, video footage, text, music and sound) and each storyteller has produced a 3 - 5 minute digital story that explores their experiences of migration and settlement. Racconti: La Voce Del Popolo (the Voice of the People) was made possible through the partnership of the Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and their Families (FILEF) and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) with the support of the Victorian Multicultural Commission."
