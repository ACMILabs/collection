        "A canoe journey through the beautiful areas of the Great Lakes, formed over 10,000 years ago over successive Ice Ages. This geological and ecological history of the Great Lakes is accompanied by narration in ballad form. Eventually, the advance of civilisation becomes obvious with bulldozers felling trees and pushing earth, huge dams, ocean-going ships, factory chimney's belching smoke and the effects of waste pollution on the Lakes themselves."
