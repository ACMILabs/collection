        "Shows the battle which was waged for five weeks against a fire which broke out in an oil well in Persia. The film includes a remarkable shot of an explosion followed by the upward rush of half-a-mile of steel pipe, and the resulting column of inflammable gas which was finally brought under control. Won a first prize at Venice, 1952. Photographed by Martyn Wilson."
