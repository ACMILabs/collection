        "A film about Robert Indiana; the artist and his art, and the meaning in language. One of the best known \"pop\" artists in America, Robert Indiana gives his opinions and feelings on not just his art, but life in general, and his studio, paintings and everyday life are seen. Highly recommended to classes in both art and language arts. Music by Virgil Thomson."
