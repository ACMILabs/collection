        "This film approaches the subject of death in an open manner. The questions which face today's terminally ill - mercy killing, suicide and medical prolongation of life are scrupulously examined. Frank discussions with patients and interviews with doctors, lawyers, psychiatrists and members of the clergy provide insight and vast differences of opinions to the issues. Important concepts addressed include: when is a person alive or dead; quantity and quality of life; truth and death; criminality in mercy killing; passive versus active euthanasia."
