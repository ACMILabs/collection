        "Broadcaster Wynford Vaughan-Thomas looks at the River Conway (Welsh spelling - Conwy) which rises in Snowdonia and reaches the sea on the North Wales coast at the town which bears its name. The Conway although only 30 miles long passes through landscape of immense variety starting as a fishing lake, gathering momentum at Betws-y-Coed, into the Swallow Falls and finally discharging into the sea at Conway Town."
