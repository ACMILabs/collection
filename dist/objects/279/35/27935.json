        "Begins with a reminder of how the sponsor began its work following the sudden spread of poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, and shows how it is possible for adults to learn to ride despite physical disabilities including cerebral palsy, hemiplegia, paraplegia, amputation and blindness. Intended for people whose work brings them into contact with the medical rehabilitation of the physically disabled."
