        "In words and music, this film brings to the screen a great seasonal event of the Quebec spruce forests - the log drive. A ballad singer comments musically on this annual spectacle. Water-borne, the vast aggregation of logs moves downstream, spurred by dynamite and sharp-tipped cant hooks, tossed and twirled by the boots of leaping men. An abridged version of Log Drive (Title Code 006435)."
