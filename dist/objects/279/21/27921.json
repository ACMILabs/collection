        "Episode of Series \"The American Short Story\". Dave - a black, teenage worker - buys a used hand gun and accidentally kills a mule. Consequently, his father demeans him in front of the landowner, who demands that he work 25 months to pay for the animal. At nightfall, aimed with vague notions of manhood and independence, Dave retrieves his gun and hops aboard a passing train."
