        "The rise of a small-time singer to Hollywood stardom is matched by the decline of her actor-mentor then husband. A melodrama, a musical comedy and a musical-within-a-musical which, beneath its mythmaking about Hollywood, achieves a rare depth of emotion and sense of truthfulness. Cast includes Janet Gaynor, Frederic March, Adolphe Menjou and May Robson."
