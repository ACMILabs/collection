        "A compilation of three short films made by Jane Campion while she was a student. Campion is a stylist whose humour is dry, painful and throwaway. The three films are distinguished by a mischievous sense of comic irony. \"Peel\" won the Golden Palm Award for Best Short Film at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival."
