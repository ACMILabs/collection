        "A warm, moving film experience and a triumph of the human spirit. \"Annie's Coming Out\" is based on the true story of Annie McDonald. Jessica Hathaway (Angela Punch McGregor) works at a hospital for handicapped children, and among her charges is Annie, a victim of cerebral palsy. Discovering Annie's considerable intelligence, Jessica endeavours to prove this and must take her case to court in a battle against the establishment."
