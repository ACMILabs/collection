        "Lola, star at the sleaziest nightclub in screen history meets, seduces and ultimately destroys the upright bourgeois schoolteacher, Professor Rath. A tragedy? A comedy? It's actually a surprisingly complex morality; a celebration of Lola's sexuality (it was Dietrich's first major role) and an ironic observation of Rath's repression and masochism. (Jannings never suffered more or better.) Starring Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings. Rated: PG"
