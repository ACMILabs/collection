        "The characters in this madcap program (a pen, a pencil and liquid paper) spearhead an attack on jargon and woolly-writing. They demonstrate how to improve letter and report writing skills by isolating the four principles of clear, well structured letters and reports: Be clear, Order, Evaluate. Short notes accompany the program."
