        "From the time of the first test, through days of Aboriginal teams visiting England, the drama of the bodyline series, and the 1977 World Cricket Series Revolution, Australians have always been \"cricket mad\". Jack Egan brings together cricket greats to recall highlights of their career, as well as using magnificent archival footage. Special appearances by Ian Chappell, Bill O'Reilly and Lindsay Hassett."
