        "Delia Smith's no nonsense approach to baking strips away the mystique which too often shrouds the subject. Delia covers the entire range of homebaked goodies: bread, pastry, biscuits and cakes. Stick to Delia's methods and you'll soon be able to bake successfully anything from wholemeal bread to choux pastry. Rated: G"
