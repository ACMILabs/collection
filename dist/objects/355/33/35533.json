        "This award-winning documentary covers the Gallipoli campaign from both the ANZAC and Turkish perspective's. Through interviews with ANZAC and Turkish veterans, archival footage and reconstructions, the film creates for the viewer a greater understanding of the tragedy and the complex truth behind the war. It does not glorify war, but rather commemorates the suffering and service of the young soldiers who gave their lives."
