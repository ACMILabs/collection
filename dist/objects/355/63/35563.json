        "Episode of Series 'Touch the Sun'. Badge, a young boy, lives with his parents on a struggling farm in the Tasmanian bush. When Badge's city cousins come to stay he finds their brash opinions unsettling. Following a violent storm the farm's viability is threatened by the death of one cow and the escape of another. The children's quest to recapture the cow leads them to the mysterious crag, Devil's Hill. In conquering the perils of the mountain the children set aside their bickering and discover the value of co-operation. Rated: G"
