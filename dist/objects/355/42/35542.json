        "Students of various racial groups confront the racism they deal with daily. Perhaps schools often reinforce racism rather than help fight it? After a group of black high school students witness a disturbing incident one of the students describes what she saw. She claims police blamed a black boy for breaking a window when they had no proof it was him. She said there were five white boys and 3 black boys present and even when a white lady told them it wasn't his fault they took no notice. When the students told the principal what happened he told them not to bother because they couldn't fight it."
