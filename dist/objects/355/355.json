        "A 2D hand-drawn animation, Shedding the Dead Things... if taken literally is a short animation about the grieving process. A woman grieves over a lost loved ones grave in a cemetary and is haunted by the ominous gargoyles that beckon her to remain in grief. Instead, she throws autumn leaves into the air with a gesture of rejection. Metaphorically the animation is about moving on and past the memory of personal pain."
