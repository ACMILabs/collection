        "Documents the introduction of the cane toad to Australia from Hawaii in 1935 to combat the grey back beetle that was destroying the sugar cane. The cane toad failed to do this, but adapted well to its new habitat and has spread rapidly to reach plague proportions. The program looks at the life and habits of the toad, documents its spread at the rate of 27,000 km. per year, and investigates the ways in which this strange creature has become part of local culture and mythology. A thoroughly fascinating, quirky and off-beat documentary that gains much of its interest through the use of humour where biological fact is juxtaposed with off-the-cuff comment."
