        "The late Neil Davis covered the Vietnam War for over 11 years; his footage of the conflict was seen nightly by millions of television viewers around the world. The film examines the ethical issues facing a person in the front line who is not an active combatant and provides a record of Davis' involvement in the conflict, combining his original footage, comments and archival film. Rated: PG"
