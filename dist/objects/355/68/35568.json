        "According to John Pilger, \"Australia is a secret country with a secret history.\" This documentary looks at that history, the history of the Australian Aborigines from the time of white settlement to the present, and reveals the extent of the cruelty and injustice inflicted upon them. The central issue throughout the film is the differing perspective's on the land and its uses, providing historical background to the present land rights movement and other areas of Aboriginal activism."
