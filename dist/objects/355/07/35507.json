        "Originally a film directed by Roger Corman and shot in two days in 1960, then a musical play extravaganza on Broadway in 1982, and finally a multimillion dollar allstar film musical in 1986, \"Little shop of horrors,\" with its quirkiness, comedy and wonderful satire has developed quite a cult following over the decades. This original version features Jonathan Haze as the nerdy Seymour Krelborn who works in the florist shop near Skid Row, Mel Welles as Mushnik his boss, and Jackie Joseph as Audrey, the shop assistant and woman Seymour secretly desires. When Seymour buys a small exotic plant which suddenly appeared after an eclipse of the sun, strange things begin to happen. Audrey II (Seymour's name for the plant) takes on a personality of its own and develops quite a unique appetite, wanting to be continually fed, not with plant food, but with blood, and the more it is fed, the bigger Audrey II becomes. This monster plant has an insatiable appetite and the dilemma for Seymour is what can he do about it. Features a cameo by Jack Nicholson in his first motion picture performance. The legendary Roger Corman made this movie in days and it has more laughs than most big budget films."
