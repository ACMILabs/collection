        "This is the history of Uluru from an aboriginal perspective, from the dawn of creation to the celebrations on October 26, 1985, when Uluru was handed back to the traditional owners. Presented with humour and sensitivity are re-enactments of the creation stories, the experience of the Anangu during their first contact with white people and minga (tourists) performing their strange rituals."
