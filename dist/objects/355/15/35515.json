        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Australian wilderness series\". A child returns from the future, a time when forests no longer exist and we see the rainforest and its most unusual inhabitants through her eyes. She grows to love the forest and cannot understand some of the things she sees happening. An imaginative and fascinating story which emphasises the delicate balance of nature, and how easily it can be destroyed."
