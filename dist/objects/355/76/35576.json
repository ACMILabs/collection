        "Twenty years after its creation, Norm and Ahmed, remains a classic in Australian literature. This video of the play features the well-known actor Max Cullen as Norm and Alex Pinder as Ahmed. The action centres on a midnight meeting between Norm, an average Australian, who embodies the ocker image and Ahmed, an urbane Pakistan student. The chance encounter starts off in a friendly enough manner, but underneath Norm's veneer of mateyness lies a distrust of the unfamiliar and a defensiveness which turns nasty when Norm feels threatened. The themes of racism and prejudices in the play are still pertinent today."
