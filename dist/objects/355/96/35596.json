        "Whalesong is a tribute to the majesty and grace of singing, dancing, ancient mammals that have graced our planet for 50 million years ... and yet are still endangered by senseless slaughter and ocean pollution. \"Whalesong\" will inspire awe, love and empathy for the whales and dolphins by allowing you to feel a part of their world. Lloyd Bridges is our escort and guide to the people that live in the sea."
