        "The first feature to be written and directed by Maori people \"Ngati\" celebrates the power of community spirit and racial pride. Its universal theme has delighted critics and audiences in Australia and around the world. A young Australian man arrives in a New Zealand seaside town which is the spiritual home of the local Ngati or tribe. He becomes involved with a local girl and gets caught up in a crisis which threatens the survival of the town. As he watches the close-knit community come together to deal with these upheavals, he makes a discovery about himself which will have a profound impact on the rest of his life. The film de-emphasises the personal in favour of a sense of communal inter-connection and explores the possible relationship between Maori and pakeha ways. Some Maori dialogue with English subtitles. Cast: Tuta Ngarimu Tamati, Iranui Haig, Tawai Moana, Wi Kuki Kaa, Michael Tibble, Judy McIntosh, Connie Pewhairangi."
