        "This is a story set in North Queensland about a child's exploration of an ancient coastal rainforest. Using a unique relief collage artform, the animated film takes the viewer on an extraordinary visual journey through the Daintree Forest. The film ends inquiringly with a reflection on the future of our few remaining and special untouched natural places, and it provides an excellent introduction for children of all ages to the understanding of the necessity for conservation of rainforests. Based on the award winning picture"
