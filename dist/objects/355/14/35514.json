        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Australian wilderness series\". This program is the last in a series of six documentaries that examine the wilderness areas of Australia. Mirka Mora is an eccentric artist, French by birth, who had never before ventured into the wilderness nor slept in a tent. Along with Tim McCartney Snape, the first Australian ever to reach the summit of Mt. Everest, and a Nepalese Sherpa, she travels into the Kosciusko wilderness. Mirka's unique and expressive personality helps viewers see and experience this wilderness from an artist's perspective."
