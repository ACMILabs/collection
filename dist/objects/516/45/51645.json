    "description": [
        "Three short films from classic slapstick comedy duo Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. \"The Music Box\" - Stan and Ollie are deliverymen whose task is to deliver a valuable piano to an irascible professor. The pair struggles with the piano up and down a daunting set of concrete stairs, causing a slew of unmitigated disasters once finally inside the house. This short film was honoured with an Oscar for \"Best Live-Action Short Subject.\" \"Busy bodies\" - short film brimming with sight gags, sees Laurel and Hardy driving to work in an old jalopy causing mayhem, distracting others with a gramophone hooked up under the bonnet. Once at work, the havoc continues as they irritate the foreman and cause non-stop harm to one another. Some of the gags recall the complex set-ups of Bester Keaton's finest work. \"Towed in a hole\" - short that ably illustrates the comic chemistry between the two stars. Laurel and Hardy are successful fish salesmen; Stan decides they can increase their profit by cutting out the middleman and catching their own fish off the jetty. Ollie one-ups him by buying a holey boat, over which the two bicker like children, in their attempt to repair it. Immensely funny physical and inspired comedy."
