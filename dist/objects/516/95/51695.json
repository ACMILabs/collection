        "A trendy urban development in Toronto for professionals and artists turned subsidized housing which attracted thousands of refugees and new immigrants, Flemingdon Park has become known as a multicultural model for urban planning. This documentary discusses the past and present community of Flemingdon Park, as well as the challenges the diverse residents face and the valuable lessons offered by the community that has developed there. From a history of overcoming violence and racism to the hope of the celebration of difference in increasingly inclusive and welcoming community attitudes there are many and varied facets to life in and around the Park. Many of these elements are touched on in this program in order to come to terms with the history and current experience of the community through interviews with past and present residents, teachers and students from neighbouring schools, the Park's designer and architect and through commentary from journalist Robert Fulford and the documentary's director, Andrew Faiz, himself a former resident."
