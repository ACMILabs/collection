        "Los Angeles. December 29, 1999 - the lead up to the new millennium. The city is close to anarchy, with crime and racial tensions creating an ever present sense of danger. Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is an ex-cop who now deals in illegal SQUIDS, CD-discs of memory/experiences used like a virtual reality game where the user gets to experience moments recorded from someone's cerebral cortex. When Lenny's friend Iris is murdered and he receives a SQUID clip of the incident, he stumbles into a web of killing and police corruption which involves his ex-girlfriend, rock singer Faith Justin (Juliette Lewis) and her gangster manager/lover Philo Gant (Michael Wincott). With help from friends Mace (Angela Bassett) and Max (Tom Sizemore), Lenny tries to find out who is behind the murders whilst not being killed himself. Written by James Cameron in collaboration with former film critic Jay Cocks, \"Strange days\" has strong performances from Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett who have a lot of fun with the role reversals - Lenny is a hopeless hero whilst Mace is the strong, heroic action heroine."
