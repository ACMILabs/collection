        "Two comedies from popular slapstick team Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. \"Sons of the desert\" - Stan and Ollie wish to attend the Sons of the desert annual convention (read booze up) but Ollie's domineering wife forbids it. Determined to go, Stan has a cunning plan - if Ollie pretends to be deathly ill the two will take a recuperative trip to Honolulu then sneak off to Chicago. The plan goes awry when the ship they were supposed to be travelling on is devastated by a typhoon and the henpecked pair have to face the wrath of their wives. Considered the best of Laurel and Hardy's feature films, with over the top sight gags and slapstick humour, this was one of the top ten grossing pictures of 1934. \"We faw down\" - Stan and Ollie fancy spending the night playing poker. Their disapproving wives refuse them permission so feigning an appointment with their boss, the two pretend to be off to the theatre for the night. When, unbeknownst to Laurel and Hardy, the theatre burns down the pair are trapped in a lie and are asked to act out the play they 'saw' in front of their disbelieving wives."
