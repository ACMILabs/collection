    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". The last season of the X-files ended with the shock suicide of Agent Mulder (David Duchovny). Is this the end of the X-files? Is Mulder really dead? Season 5 opens with a 2 part episode (eps. 1 & 2, Redux) which answers these questions (of course Mulder is not dead!) and also brings to light the mystery surrounding Scully's fatal cancer. The writers don't disappoint as Mulder discovers a secret research facility that may hold the cure to Scully's illness, which also leads him to some revelations about his abducted sister. There are many surprises in stall for Scully and Mulder in season 5, including a mystery child who may or may not be Scully's daughter (ep. 6, Christmas Carol) and the sudden appearance of an old flame of agent Mulder's, played by Mimi Rogers (ep. 20, The End). By this stage \"The X-files\" was enjoying enormous popularity, winning fresh fans and critical praise. The series popularity even drew novelists William Gibson (ep. 11, Kill switch) and Stephen King (ep. 10, Chinga) in to write for the show. Aside form bringing humour into the mix again (ep. 12, Bad blood, ep. 3, Unusual suspects), the creators began to experiment with the show's form, including an episode shot entirely in black and white (ep. 5, The Post-modern prometheus). \"The X-files\" also achieved a first for television by having the end of the season continue onto the big screen (X-files the movie: Fight the future). This was untested ground in that viewers would have to see the movie if they wanted to find out the answers to the cliffhanger ending of the season. There's even a nice self-referential joke in season 5 with the appearance of Darren McGavin (ep. 15, Travelers) from \"The Night Stalker\", the show that originally inspired Chris Carter to create \"The X-files.\" Cast includes: David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Mitch Pileggi, Nicholas Lea, William B. Davis."
