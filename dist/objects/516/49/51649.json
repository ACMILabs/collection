        "At the end of the twentieth century evidence of an advanced alien civilization emerges when an enormous spaceship crashes on earth. The United Earth government is formed to combat impending invasion and to research the advanced and dangerous alien technologies. In this American futuristic anime television series Rick, Ben, Max, and Lisa are four earthlings doing battle in cyber-space, whilst dealing with their complex romantic lives. This disc, entitled \"Homecoming\" contains six episodes from the \"Macross Saga\". \"Blue wind\": having escaped the clutches of the Zentraedi, the fabulous foursome present their report about the enemy's potential, to their disbelieving cohorts. \"Gloval's report\": with the giant battle fortress safely returned to earth, Captain Gloval reflects upon the skirmishes, combats and strategies that have marked the past two years. \"Homecoming\": Rick is secretly engaged by Minmay to fly her back to Japan. Lisa and Gloval struggle to convince the United Earth government of the danger posed by the Zentraedi. \"Battle cry\": the Zentraedi plans a secret attack on the SDF-1. \"Phantasm\": Rick lies in hospital in a critical condition, reflecting upon his tumultuous romantic emotions. \"Farewell, big brother\": as Rick recuperates the Zentraedi threat looms large once again."
