        "When their elderly father dies, two brothers inherit the family business - the Smuntz string factory - along with a dilapidated house. Ernie Smuntz (Nathan Lane) was a once revered chef but is no more thanks to an unfortunate incident involving the mayor and a cockroach; brother Lars (Lee Evans) is a devoted string factory worker. On viewing the house they discover that it was designed by a revered architect at the turn of the century and is potentially worth millions. The only obstacle to the impending fortune is one wily long time resident, a mouse that's proving impossible to catch. Christopher Walken has a brief role as a pest exterminator. The film is rated PG due to potentially horrible traps laid by each opponent, including a freakish cat. Cast also includes Vicki Lewis, Eric Christmas and Maury Chaykin."
