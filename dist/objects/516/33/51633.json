        "Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's rock opera, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" is one of the most successful theatrical musicals of all time. The story of Jesus' Passion is scored to a vibrant, electronic rock beat and is performed by a cast of dancers and singers. This version, following on from Norman Jewison' 1973 feature film of the same name, is primarily the filming of a stage production, performed in London, 1996-2000. The accent has shifted and stress is now placed on the perspective of Judas, casting him as a man in conflict with Jesus over the direction the cause has taken. Modernisation of the sets and costumes is reflected in the multicultural cast that are dressed in modern garb - including techno gear and Darth Veda-ish masks. The songs however remain the same and it is through their singing that the full tragedy and power of the Passion is realised. Songs include\" \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", \"What's the Buzz\" and \"I Don't Know How to Love Him.\" Cast includes Glenn Carter, Jerome Pradon, Renee Castle, Fred Johanson, Rik Mayall, Frederick B. Owens, Michael Shaeffer."
