        "Episodes 1-5 of \"Berserk\", Japanese anime series set in the Middle Ages. Gatsu, a dark knight and skilled swordsman, bears a mark of mysterious origins and is on a quest to find the being who branded him. Adapted from the comic book by Kentaro Miura, \"Young animal\", this decidedly sinister series is filled with kinetic displays of black magic and monstrous beasts, depicting violent and gory encounters whilst conjuring a mood evocative of gothic horror. Ep. 1: Whilst the King's merciless rule creates terror amidst the locals, Gatsu slays several of his marauding men, who fear Gatsu's immense sword. In an attempt to devastate his power, Gatsu challenges the King in battle. Ep. 2: Basuso, a gigantic grey knight, yields terror but Gatsu confronts him. In the woods he encounters The Band of the Hawk - a mercenary army, led by the charismatic Griffith. Ep. 3: Gatsu and Griffith face each other in an almighty showdown. Ep. 4: Gatsu and Griffith develop a friendship; Gatsu experiences flashbacks from his past, including a clash with his father-figure, Gambino. Ep. 5: When The Band of the Hawk attack a castle, Gatsu tries to save Griffith from being killed by a bomb blast."
