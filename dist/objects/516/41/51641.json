        "Examines the life of boxer, athlete, civil rights champion and a compelling figure of the twentieth century - Muhammad Ali. Using extensive archival footage and stills, \"Ali\" presents numerous interviews with countless of his contemporaries who comment on Ali's profile and personality, his impact in the media and on the incendiary times in America of the 1960s and 70s. Interviews include James Earl Jones, Billy Crystal, Rod Steiger, Billy Connolly, Tom Jones, BB King and Richard Harris (many acknowledging Ali's skill as an entertainer), Ali's family, trainer, childhood friends, journalists, historians, broadcasters and writers. Fellow boxers, including Cooper, Torres, Eubank, Ellis and Forman discuss Ali's intimidating and peerless style. Contains exciting footage from the 1960 Olympics, and of Ali versus Liston (1964), Williams, Terrell ('67), Frazier ('71 and '74), Ellis ('71), Foreman (74), Wepner ('75) and Spinks ('78). Also addresses Ali's religious conversion to Islam, his involvement in the Civil Rights movement - when much of America was divided racially Ali introduced the notion that \"black is beautiful\" - the furore of his refusal to be drafted, his many marriages, post-boxing life and current roles. This work is really a celebration of Ali's career - not just as a pugilist, but as a world figure."
