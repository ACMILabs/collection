        "Documentary on boxing and sports legend Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Clay. Ali became a symbol of African American pride during, and after, his dominance of the sport during the 1960s and 70s. This work contains actual footage of events in Ali's life - mostly extensive clips from lengthy bouts, including fights with George Foreman, several with Joe Frazier and numerous other boxers, many of whom Ali defeated. Also features clips of Ali in training; at press conferences; and relaxing and playing with his daughter. Includes some brief archival interviews (some audio only) with Ali and news footage from 1967 when Ali caused a furore by refusing to serve in the armed forces in Vietnam, due to his religion of Islam. At press conferences throughout his career Ali proved that he often cut an amusing, charismatic and inspirational figure."
