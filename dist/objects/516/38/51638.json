        "Four films from classic comedy duo Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. \"Be big\" - Laurel and Hardy desire to go to a raucous stag night, but their respective wives have planned a holiday to Atlantic City. Stan feigns illness to keep them in town for the night, but the plan unravels when their wives miss the train and discover their husbands on their way out for the evening. Bedlam ensues as the hapless pair face the full blast of their wives' wrath. \"Laughing gravy\" - Stan and Ollie face eviction from their boarding house due to Ollie's noisy dog, named Laughing gravy. Battling icy conditions, Ollie is forced to chase Laughing gravy through a storm whilst avoiding his irate landlord. When Stan gets a letter of inheritance, the condition is that he cut all ties with Ollie, and he is drawn into a real dilemma. \"Los Calaveras\" - combination of the Spanish versions of two shorts \"Be big\" and \"Laughing gravy\", into a feature length film. \"Les Carottiers\" - combination of the French versions of two shorts \"Be big\" and \"Laughing gravy\", into a feature length film. Immensely funny and inspired physical comedy."
