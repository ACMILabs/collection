        "At the end of the twentieth century evidence of an advanced alien civilization emerges when an enormous spaceship crashes on earth. The United Earth government is formed to combat impending invasion and to research the advanced and dangerous alien technologies. In this American futuristic anime television series Rick, Ben, Max, and Lisa are four earthlings doing battle in cyber-space, whilst dealing with their complex romantic lives. This disc, entitled \"Battlefront\", contains six episodes from the \"Macross Saga\". \"Bursting point\": Gloval sets about relocating the refugees stranded on SDF-1, but experiences conflicting loyalties when the future of the earth is threatened. \"Paradise lost\": the evil Zentraedi monitors the movements of the SDF-1; the refugees try to make the most of their new surrounds. \"A New dawn\": Minmay prepares for the launch of her first motion picture. Rick and Lisa try to resolve their feelings. \"Battle hymn\": the Zentraedi campaign to annihilate SDF-1 escalates out of all proportion. \"Reckless\": the stage is set for an almighty showdown between earth's displaced warriors and the relentless Zentraedi. \"Showdown\": Lisa makes a rash decision to return to earth in the hope of ending the enduring war."
