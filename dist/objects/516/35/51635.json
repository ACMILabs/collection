        "Two comedies from slapstick team Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. \"Way out West\" - Stan and Ollie head out West as prospectors and when their partner Cy dies, they are entrusted to deliver the deed for valuable land to Cy's daughter Mary. After all manner of mishaps, the pair are swindled by a crooked bar owner and his wife Lola. When Stan and Ollie realise the duplicity they have to steal the deed back, returning it to its rightful owner. Classic scenes include Stan being tickled into submission by Lola and eating his hat after losing a bet. \"Way out west\" is arguably one of Laurel and Hardy's best-loved comedies, which can be viewed on this DVD in the colourised version or in original black and white. \"Big business\" - one of Laurel and Hardy' last silent shorts has been identified as a masterful example of the genre. Laurel and Hardy are door-to-door Christmas tree salesmen who successfully offend potential customers, one of whom becomes enraged when the pair appears determined to harass him. As the feud escalates Laurel and Hardy commit a multitude of destructive acts, which results in the demolition of the owner's house. He in turn unleashes a torrent of angst against the aforementioned tree and the hapless duo's car, as a bemused crowd gather to watch."
