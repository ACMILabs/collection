        "Episodes 6-9 of \"Berserk\", Japanese anime series set in the Middle Ages. Gatsu, a dark knight and skilled swordsman, bears a mark of mysterious origins and is on a quest to find the being who branded him. Adapted from the comic book by Kentaro Miura, \"Young animal\", this decidedly sinister series is filled with kinetic displays of black magic and monstrous beasts, depicting violent and gory encounters whilst conjuring a mood evocative of gothic horror. Ep. 6: The Band of the Black Hawk has conquered the castle but Gatsu is helpless against Zodd the immortal, an indefatigable enemy. Ep. 7: Due to his band's brave triumphs, the King honours Griffith who walks freely amid royalty, some of whom seek to undermine his growing invincibility. Ep. 8: Griffith's ambitions threaten the harmony of his band and his friendship with Gatsu. Once more, The Band of the Black Hawk head into battle. Ep. 9: Skulduggery at court threatens Griffith's life."
