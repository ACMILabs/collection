        "Based on material gathered for a non-fiction book by Nicholas Pileggi, \"Casino\" takes an in depth look at the behind the scenes world of a casino whilst following the history of the mob in Las Vegas. It is 1973 and Sam Rothstein (Robert de Niro) is sent by the mob to manage the Tangiers casino. Sam's childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), follows him to Vegas whereupon he's hired to enforce mob control. Sam's successful running of the Tangiers is soon jeopardised by Nicky's hotheaded thuggery and the explosive behaviour of his coke-addicted wife Ginger (Sharon Stone). \"Casino\" is Martin Scorsese's tribute to a Las Vegas now gone. The film is marked with Scorsese's usual visual flair and kinetic style, with a deadpan voiceover narration from Sam and occasionally Nicky. Sharon Stone gives a knockout performance as the unstable Ginger."
