    ], 
    "description": [
        "The conventions and style of the postcard's photographic moment are transformed by movement and sound in this exquisite collection of thirty-second video postcards. Time worn images fade in, only to be suddenly and momentarily released with a gesture, a punctuating sound - and then frozen again. Witty and often poignant, these revealing documents of time, place and memory capture a fleeting, ephemeral reality. We are invited into a narrative of what the artist calls 'thirty seconds worth of dreams'. Produced in Paris, New York, Rome, Quebec, Iceland, Lisbon, Cairo, Algiers, and other sites around the world, these video postcards form fragments a perceptual voyage by way of the subtle magic of a temporal trompe l'oeil."
