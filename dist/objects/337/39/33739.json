        "Hardy Wilson was an Australian architect and artist who acknowledged a climate that was non-European and designed houses and commercial buildings which were sympathetic to their surroundings. He was also a watercolourist, furniture designer, and a prolific social and philosophical writer. This film is of interest to an audience interested in Australian heritage and culture."
