        "This film examines the origins of the first Australians. In the 1970's two discoveries of human fossil remains were made and evidence implied that two different types of people lived in Australia long before the emergence of the modern Aborigines. Dr. Alan Thorne, a key scientist in both finds, presents this program and explains where the first Australians came from."
