        "This film is about the building of a traditional log cabin in Quebec. It starts with the tree and finishes with the housewarming. While it is not a realistic housing option for many Canadians, it does provide encouragement for all of us to re-examine the resources around us that we may not be using effectively, if at all. French dialogue only. (Awards: Brussels; New York)"
