        "Episode of Series \"Striving\". Douglas Sam, Australia's best middleweight boxer, had to overcome enormous psychological pressures at the Commonwealth Games of 1982 in Brisbane. Douglas is an Aborigine and many of his people felt that he should not compete in these games. He did compete and the news media made Douglas a favourite for a gold medal. This film traces his wins and his losses."
