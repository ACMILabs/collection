        "In 1971 Wandjuk Marika organised a Djangkawu ceremony at Yirrkala in memory of his father, Mawalan who died in 1967. Mawalan had been the highly respected head of the Rirratjingu clan for whom the Djangkawu are primary creator ancestors. For this film Wandjuk has made explicit only outside or public interpretation of this ceremony. The ceremony was also important for its attempt to reinforce, for tribal members, the importance of their traditions. Contains some b&w footage."
