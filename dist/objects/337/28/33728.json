        "Episode of Series \"Striving\". Angela Bailey and Angella Taylor are both ranked in the world's top ten in the 100 metres sprint. They are fierce rivals and this film shows us the girls' gruelling daily regimen, their attitudes to one another and to international competition. At the Commonwealth Games of 1982, we watch the way in which their coach handles their triumphs and failures"
