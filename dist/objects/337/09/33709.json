        "Uses an innovative mix of interviews, photographs and sketches combined with comprehensive statistical information, to provide a profile on prisoners in New South Wales. Shows who goes to prison, why, and what happens to them inside the gaols. Interviews with ex-prisoners and their families demonstrate the futility of prisons as an answer to social problems. Touches on the destructive fires at Bathurst Jail and the reprisals carried out on prisoners before their transfer."
