        "Filmed in ten of Canada's National Parks, this film deals with the evolution of the Canadian landscape and the formation of the present system of national parks. From Gros Morne in Newfoundland to Pacific Rim on the B.C. coast, and from Pointe Pelee in Ontario to Kluane in the Yukon, the spectator is shown a variety of topographical features shaped by millions of years of rain, frost, and wind. The film brings home a sobering thought: we can preserve our environment or we can destroy it."
