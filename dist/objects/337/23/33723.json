        "Episode of Series \"Striving\". Louis Garneau is a road racing cyclist and an aspiring Canadian artist from Quebec. He pursues his cycling with the intensity that all top athletes must have, but he is also equally absorbed in his other interests: sculpture, painting and furniture making. Here is a very enjoyable story of an exceptional young man's battle in a 185 kilometre road race."
