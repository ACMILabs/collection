        "Dr. Nahn, an ethnic Chinese refugee from Vietnam, is one of the many \"boat people\" who emigrated to Canada in the late 1970's. When she arrived in Vancouver she learned that although she had practiced acupuncture in Saigon for many years, British Columbia law would not recognise her profession. One of Many describes Dr. Nahn's life and career prior to her arrival in Canada and documents her efforts to overcome the obstacles that prevent her from using her knowledge. The film leaves no doubt about Dr. Nahn's commitment to people and medicine, and her determination to one day practice acupuncture in her new country. Voice and narration: Linda Uyrehara Hoffman."
