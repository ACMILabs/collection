        "According to this Inuit legend the raven was not always the jet-black bird that it is today. The owl had something to do with it. What happened makes an engaging story acted out by two life-like puppets made of seal fur. The film, narrated partly in Inuktitut, partly in English, is largely the work of Inuit artists. Voice and narration by Toojatogak Itoacheak and Elatak Nakashook."
