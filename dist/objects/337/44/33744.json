        "This is a fast-moving spoof centred around Bruno, the moonlighter who despairs over his striking hens; Dean Goodspeak who hires Frances and Rita, of the Sisters of Detective Agency, to investigate the erratic behaviour of scientist Dr Morrow, a mysterious stranger; and David, the academic drop-out who is nursing a broken heart on his boat. An intriguing mystery story with an \"all's well that ends well\" finish. Cast includes Peter Haworth, Micki Mansel, Jo Kirkpatrick and Bill Reiter. Packaged for Teaching English as a Second Language."
