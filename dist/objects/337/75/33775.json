        "Using vivid animation, the film examines the problem of war, its apparent necessity for creating jobs, protecting oil supplies, etc, and the climate of violence and insecurity which weighs heavily on the world. A haunting film rich with symbolism, this is a filmmaker's please for a peaceful world in which to raise his newborn son. Using the menacing imagery of the howling wind, the artist evokes viewer to reflet on the insanity of war. While the film is symbolic, its message is unmistakably clear: unless there is an end to conflict, we will continue to see our children swept away like leaves in the wind."
