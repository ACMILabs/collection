        "Episode of Series \"The Human face of the Pacific\". The issue of maintaining a balance between the traditional cultures and western world influences is central to this series that examines the different islands of the Pacific. This particular program looks at French New Caledonia and we see how the Kanaks are determined to maintain their Melanesian heritage regardless of politics and alien cultural influences. This documentary is really about the tension between the original Kanak inhabitants of this Pacific Island and the French colonialist settlers that were coming to a head in the early 1980s with a movement towards independence from France."
