        "The most sacred of India's cities, Banaras is the meeting place of heaven and earth. For over two-thousand five hundred years pilgrims have journeyed to Banaras to bathe in the River Ganges and to be cremated on its banks, and the film explores the spiritual forces that have ensured the survival of Banaras over thousands of years of history."
