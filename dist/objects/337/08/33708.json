        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". When the World War Two concentration camps closed, prisoners of war were returned and hostages released. But the victims of those camps continue to suffer - the assault on their minds has often been as effective as the assault on their bodies. More recently the victims of kidnappers have suffered in the same way. In this documentary, the victims discuss their ordeals."
