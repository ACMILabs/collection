        "FLAMENCO AT 5.15 is a visual and emotional thriller. It is an impressionistic record of a flamenco dance class given to senior students of the National Ballet School of Canada by two great teachers from Spain, Susana and Antonio Robledo. The film shows the beautiful young North American dancers inspired by the flamenco rhythms and mesmerised by Susana's extraordinary energy, joyously merging with an ancient gypsy culture. (Awards: Academy Award, Hollywood; Salerno; San Francisco; Cracow; Valladolid; Yorkton; New York)"
