        "A self-help film designed to convince women of the need for regular physical check-ups to detect and counter early symptoms of cancer. The cost of neglect is high, and the film presents ample and convincing evidence: what is shown is strong medicine, and intentionally so-- the malignant growths, the ugly scars, the excised tumours. The procedures followed in examination for cancer are shown."
