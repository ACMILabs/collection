        "A growing number of parents are concerned about the impersonal approach to childbirth seen in many hospitals. They find hospital procedures inflexible and more often geared to the needs of the institution than to those of child and parent. Members of the medical profession and parents discuss today's obstetric methods and alternatives to them. The film candidly records the birth of a baby and the interaction of mother and father."
