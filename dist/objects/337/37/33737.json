        "Memories of the times spent with a family friend Ned Wethered, when the filmmaker was a child, make up this film. The piecing together of these memories, the soft drawings of the animation and a piece of music, composed by Ned Wethered, playing in the background all help the film to portray a sensitive story of this man's life."
