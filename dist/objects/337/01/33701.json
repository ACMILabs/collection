        "Set at the turn of the century, this is a story based on E. Nesbit's novel, \"The Railway Children\". It is much more than a happy-ever-after dream, evoking a nostalgia for a perfect world that exists only in our imaginations. Three children and their mother move to a small town with a railway at the bottom of their field after their father is mysteriously taken away. The children engage in the railway and their local community in such a way that it will alter their lives forever."
