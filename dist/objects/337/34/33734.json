        "In 1981 two aboriginal craftsmen invited scientists to accompany them on a journey to Ngilibitji, a renowned stone quarry in their traditional land in eastern Arnhem Land. They wished to visit it to teach three younger men their skills. The film follows their journey and reveals something of their view of the \"life within the stone\" and their care for their land."
