        "Scots from the Orkney Islands came to trade in Northern Quebec during the 17th century. They brought fiddles with them and introduced a new form of music to the Cree of James Bay. The music survived long after the Scots returned home. In this film two Cree fiddlers travel to the Orkney Islands, the birthplace of the music they learned from their fathers and grandfathers. The film captures the warmth and good will of this reunion."
