        "More and more skiers are opting for cross-country skiing rather than schussing down the crowded, and costlier, maintained slopes. This film captures the full pleasure and delight of this more relaxed but equally invigorating winter sport. A small group of skiers is observed on a day's outing and, as they glide along through quiet Laurentian woodlands, the film notes techniques of movement. Tips are also given on proper clothing and on ski maintenance. In French with English subtitles. (Award: La Baule.)"
