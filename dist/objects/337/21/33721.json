        "Episode of Series \"Striving\". Shows two young Australians preparing for their clash in the 100-metre and 200-metre backstroke finals at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982. Their approaches are very different. Georgina Parkes is a member of an elite national swim squad coached by the man who brought the Cincinnati Marlins to the top of the United States club championships. Lisa Forrest is trained at a suburban swimming school. The consequences of these two approaches reveal some of the pressures in top-level competition. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
