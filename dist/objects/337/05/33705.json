        "A story about the Dallas-style dramas that disturb a quaint Scottish village when a Houston-based oil company plan to buy the seaside town and turn its beach into a refinery site. Contrary to expectations, the eccentric local residents are only too eager to oblige with the sale of their homes. Starring Burt Lancaster."
