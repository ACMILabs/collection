        "A dramatisation about a college senior who drops out of school and embraces the drug culture. The story follows: Peter and Mary are in love and Peter is forming a peace march whereupon he is arrested and one of his friends is killed. After this experience, Peter joins a \"hippie\" group who experiment in all types of drugs. Mary tries to get Peter away from drugs and those influencing him, but to no avail. As one of Peter's friends nearly overdoses, Peter manages to save her and takes her to hospital where the Doctor tries to explain the dangers of drug taking. This film is used to explore the drug syndrome and show the futility of using narcotics. Written by John W. Zodrow."
