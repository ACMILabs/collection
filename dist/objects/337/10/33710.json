        "Inspired by the diaries of a prisoner (in this case Nazi war criminal Albert Speer). In his daily exercise Speer began to measure the kilometres covered and projected his walk, in imaginative terms, across Southern Europe to Asia, Russia and the frozen Bering Strait. The film is constructed like a documentary of his imaginary journey. Holzwege, which translates as 'wood road' or 'wrong way' or 'dead end', was the pseudonym he used when signing the diaries."
