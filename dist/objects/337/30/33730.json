        "Episode of Series \"The Human face of the Pacific\". This series looks at the Pacific islands, the traditions associated with them and issues that pose problems to them. Tahiti is looked at in this particular film. Through the eyes of Karim, a Polynesian dancer, we glimpse the effects of western world influences and the effects of French and Church influences on Polynesian society and customs."
