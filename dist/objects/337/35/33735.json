        "In 1982 Aboriginal filmmaker Wayne Barker returned to his home in Broome, Western Australia to make a film about his grandfather, Cass Drummond. The result is this personal portrait of a staunchly self-reliant old man as he looks back on his life in the pearling industry and comments on what it was like to be an Aboriginal earlier this century."
