        "There was a time when the general store was the crossroads of life, a place where a boy could learn all he needed for the way ahead - especially when his uncle was the storekeeper, and also the undertaker, and the nephew often called upon to lend a hand. This film recalls such a store in a village in the asbestos mining area of Quebec in the early 1940s. The film presents a hundred-and-one vignettes of village life - all the bitter-sweet nostalgia with which a man might remember the events that thrust him into manhood. Mon oncle Antoine is about a Quebec that makes no headlines but reflects the whole of life, the ebb and flow of hope and despair that might be in anyone's memory. (Awards: Fifteen awards including Moscow; Chicago; Toronto) In French with English subtitles."
