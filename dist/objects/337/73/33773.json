        "There may be no more than 1,000 pandas left in the world. As a result of this, scientists, sponsored by a joint China-World Wildlife Fund project, are attempting to learn more about these rare animals. This film examines the studies, being performed by leading panda experts, at the Wolong Natural Reserve in the People's Republic of China."
