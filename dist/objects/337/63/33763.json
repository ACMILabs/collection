        "The familiar story, told this time with the glowing, cameo-like zinc cut-outs of film animator Evelyn Lambart. Here the traditional cast might have been clipped from a joyful medieval manuscript, but it is embellished by the artist's own whimsy - heraldic trumpet sounds, luminescent light, and wildflowers in every scene telling their message of rebirth. Film without words. (Award: New York.)"
