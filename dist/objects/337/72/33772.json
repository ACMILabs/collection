        "A bitter animated joke about the frustration of being an artist in pay of the bureaucracy. A sculptor tries to impress officialdom with his most imaginative works, but does not make a hit - until the finale. The story is told with traditional animation, intercut with more experimental drawing to create geometric patterns. No narration, music and sound effects only."
