        "Episode of Series \"The Human face of the Pacific\". This series looks at the Pacific islands, the traditions associated with them and issues that pose problems to them. This particular film examines the different aspects of life in Fiji. It notes the opinions of a patriarch of the hard-working Indian population and explores the co-existence of Hindus and Moslems who own less than a fifth of the land. Camera by Dennis O'Rourke and Joe Pickering."
