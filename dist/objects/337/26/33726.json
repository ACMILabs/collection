        "Episode of Series \"Striving\". Robert de Castella is one of the top marathon runners in the world today and this film is about the preparation that led to his gold medal at the 1982 Commonwealth Games. The film includes personal films and snapshots that show de Castella's early running career. These also give us an idea of how he developed the physical and mental stamina that a marathon demands."
