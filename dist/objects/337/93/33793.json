        "A nature film that shows the absorbing, even admirable qualities of the wolf's character and behavior, and its essential role in the natural scheme of life and death. Filmed by Bill Mason in caribou country, Wolf Pack closely observes the wolves through late winter into early spring. What emerges is a portrait of the wolf as a disciplined hunter, a respected leader, and a parent whose care for the young ensures the survival of the pack."
