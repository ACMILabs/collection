        "Episode of Series \"Striving\". The fastest 400 metre runner in the world in 1982 was Bertland Cameron from Spanish Town, Jamaica. Bert is studying at the University of Texas, at El Paso, and is there on an athletics scholarship which requires him to perform at his top if he wants to keep it. The pressure, and the tension it brings, continues as he prepares for the 400 metres final at the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games."
