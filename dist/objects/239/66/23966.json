        "A portrayal of the kind of problems a rural clergyman is called upon to solve and how they add meaning to his work. In this film, Rev. Edward Dawson is asked by a farm couple to advise their son George against leaving the land in favor of a factory job in the city. Mr. Dawson finds a parallel between George's problem and his own, for he too must choose between a city church and his rural calling. He is given cause to re-examine the stewardship with which he is entrusted and in it finds an answer both for himself and for George."
