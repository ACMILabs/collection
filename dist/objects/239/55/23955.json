        "A gentle blend of music, people and nature; a summer camp where melodies ripple off the waves and rhythms bounce out of the shadows. Every Summer since 1953, CAMMAC (Canadian Amateur Musicians/Musiciens Amateurs du Canada) has held a bilingual Music camp in Quebec's Laurentian Mountains. Here, people of all ages and levels of Musical ability come together to learn and make music with a professional staff of Canadian and international musicians."
