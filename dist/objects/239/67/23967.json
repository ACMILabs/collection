        "A visual poem about the wheat harvest on the vast Canadian prairies. Here, reality is horizon-wide fields of grain that must be cut and threshed by the combines before frost lays the crop to waste. The images suggest a strange but magnificent military maneuver as a phalanx of giant machines lumbers across the golden acres."
