        "An experimental film by a group of young Victorian filmmakers. Nonchalantly, the cleaner dusts the works of art created by ancient Greek potters, Renaissance painters and modern sculptors. Each piece marks the stage in our progress as percipient thinking beings: civilisations mature and die - but we survive, at least until today. As the cleaner blows dust from the ear of Epstein's Einstein, he is ignorant of the terrible forces such a mind has unleashed; for good or ill these forces can, almost, be directed by a toss of a coin."
