        "A crippled substitute teacher has great difficulty controlling a class of students, especially a girl called Toni. Kept in detention, Toni walks out after verbally attacking the teacher. Next day, as the normal teacher has returned, the substitute teacher does not have to face the class. A repentant Toni rings him up and makes them both feel better. Stars Marina Dimakopoulos, Martin Kevin. Written by Mariette Cook, John N. Smith."
