        "Greece is today (1953) among the most devastated countries in Europe, with widespread poverty, sickness and suffering. Help has come from many countries, through the United Nations and other organisations; from Scandinavia, Switzerland, Britain and America. In addition, Greek people are being sent to other countries to gain the knowledge needed to set their country on the road to a better life."
