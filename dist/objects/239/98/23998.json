        "Scenes from the life and work of potter Peter Rushforth. This film shows how Rushforth's philosophy and strong belief in craft as a way of life has reached all those with whom he has been in contact, and the respect and admiration in which he is held both personally and professionally by students, colleagues and friends. Photography by John Seale and music by the Renaissance Players."
