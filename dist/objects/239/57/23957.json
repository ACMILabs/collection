        "The wind is one of the strongest natural forces around us. Because it is generated by temperature differences in air masses, wind power is in fact a form of solar energy. This film traces the history of man's attempts to control and utilize wind energy, and projects into the future to visualize the potential of wind-power technology. (Awards: Tokyo; New York; Ottawa)"
