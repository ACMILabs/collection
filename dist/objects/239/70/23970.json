        "An amusing treatment of the serious matter of World Peace and International Disputes. Two sentries are patrolling the border between hostile countries; one drops his hat and it falls across the line. When he tries to retrieve it war becomes imminent. Uses an interesting liquid form of animation. Dialogue and music are improvised by Dizzy Gillespie and Dudley Moore."
