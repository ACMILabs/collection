        "An all-star cast of real animals and birds feature in this charming tale for children, based on Aesop's fable. The wise old owl acts as judge, the fox lays out the woodland course for the race, the raccoon (who wakes up the sleeping hare, too late, of course), the gossipy goose, the rooster, and the hare and the tortoise, whose contest proves that the race is not always to the swift, all appear."
