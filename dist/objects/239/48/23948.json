        "A film about Margo St. James and her fight to have prostitution decriminalized. Revolving around the Hooker's Convention in Washington, D.C., the action takes place over a five-day period. It includes a visit to the Women's Detention Center, TV and press interviews, a congressional cocktail party, the Hooker's Ball and a sunrise walk around the White House. It is not a didactic study on the problem of prostitution but a thought and discussion-provoking vehicle that probes the moral and social values involved."
