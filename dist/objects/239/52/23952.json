        "Using the paintings of the American artist Gregario Prestopino, the camera explores life in Harlem throughout the day and late into the night. With jazz accompaniment and clever editing, the film epitomises the life of the people and the atmosphere of their environment. Harlem Wednesday won an award at the Venice Film Festival."
