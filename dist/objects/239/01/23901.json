        "This film deals with community development in Asia. The village is the unit of organization on which Asia rests, and it is the basis of community development. Three examples are shown: simple self-help in Cambodia; villages cooperating with the World Health Organization to run a health clinic in Afghanistan; interdependence of the agricultural and industrial communities in India, with cash crops providing capital for agricultural development and mechanized expansion of village crafts with the aid of electricity."
