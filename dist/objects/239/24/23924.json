        "For five days and nights a trawler steams up the east coast of Britain to reach the northern fishing grounds of the Atlantic. The object of this routine voyage is to spend two weeks catching, preserving and landing some twelve thousand pounds worth of high quality white fish. The importance of cleanliness, care and cooling is stressed in order to preserve a profitable catch."
