        "Filmed during the period, September 1961 to March 1962 over 20 afternoons. This is a film by the students of Form 3A at Ushaw Moor Secondary School, County Durham, whereby the work included film teaching, scripting, location shooting, acting, music teaching, sound recording and film and sound editing. Scripted after their own stories, this amusing film is about a lower middle-class adolescent boy given the chore of buying groceries for his mother but spends the time mucking about with his friends and terrorising the neighbours. During this little outing, he spots a half crown coin lying in the gutter, which he splurges with his friends on sweets - but where has the grocery money gone?"
