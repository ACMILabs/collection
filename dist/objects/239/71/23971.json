        "Episode of Series \"Social Security\". Hattie is seventy-six and completely alone, she has lost contact with a of her old friends and interests and feels that her life is now totally empty. Although she has always been happy and active, Hattie says she doesn't care if she dies tomorrow, and that there are a lot of people like her, discarded because they are old. One of a series of films created originally for day- time television panel discussions to introduce to the public the range of social services available from Government and other agencies."
