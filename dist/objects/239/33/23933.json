        "A story without words set to Rossini's \"String Sonata in C Major\" performed by the Zurich Chamber Orchestra led by Edmond de Stoutz, involves a modern day fantasy about a truck driver's encounter with an elegant, riderless, horse drawn coach. The parallel paths of truck and coach on the opposite shores of a lovely Swiss lake merge in a climax when the driver abandons his truck and joyfully takes up the reins behind the trotting white horse."
