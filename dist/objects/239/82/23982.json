        "A film about the establishment of a new Long John Scotch Whisky at Tormore in the Scottish Highlands - the first completely-built distillery in the highlands in the 20th century. Workers' homes and the distillery were designed to fit in with the landscape. Tormore was chosen because of its water quality. The process of distilling and blending is also featured."
