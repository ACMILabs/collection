        "The object of this film is to show the stresses and strains packages have to withstand and point out the need for care and attention when handling them. An actual packing case is followed from despatch to consignee, involving transport by sea and road and exposure to weather. Emphasises that the actual expense incurred in repairing damaged packages, although amounting to many thousands of pounds, is trifling compared to the loss of the customer's goodwill."
