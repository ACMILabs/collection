        "An accident prevention film intended primarily for showing to new workers entering the steel industry. Aims at a person's attitude to safety rather than suggesting specific safety rules, through the story of two steelworkers on a mountaineering holiday. Compares their attitude to risks in the mountains with a professional attitude to risks on the job."
