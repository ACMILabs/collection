        "Farming in the United States: with the population increase more food must be produced even though more land is being taken up for city and urban expansion. The student population is increasing in universities and agricultural colleges where the study of the sciences associated with modern farming are undergoing rapid change. This leads to a reduction of farm problems and bigger yields with the aid of new chemicals and mechanical implements. However, the farmer is still at the mercy of the weather. Culminates in a harvest sequence."
