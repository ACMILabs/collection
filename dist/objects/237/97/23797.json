        "Extreme close-up views and step-by-step dissection show in detail the external and internal anatomy pf the lubber grasshopper. The distinctive, circulatory, excretory, nervous, respiratory and reproductive systems are traced in the insect and on matching anatomical diagrams. Natural habitat scenes relate the structures to their functions."
