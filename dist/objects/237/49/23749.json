        "Rising in the ranges of Coorg, the Kaveri River flows eastwards for nearly 500 miles before entering the Bay of Bengal, traversing ancient agricultural lands, rich in rice and coffee. Traces the course of the Kaveri River which has been considered sacred by the Hindus for centuries. The waters of the river have been utilised for the generation of electic power at Sivasamudram and harnessed in Mysore and Mettur for the two great dams which irrigate thousands of acres of land."
