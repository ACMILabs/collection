        "British Railways operate thousands of road vehicles. Keeping them trouble-free and accident-free depends to a large extent upon the way they are handled by their drivers. The film shows typical delivery routes being covered by a lorry and by a \"mechanical horse\" and trailer, and some of the many circumstances in which care, common sense and alertness on the part of the driver can prevent accidents."
