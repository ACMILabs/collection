        "A films about distinguished English painter best known for his portraits of Somerset Maugham, Lord Beaverbrook and Sir Winston Churchill. Sutherland is, however, a landscape artist who treats his subjects in a highly personal and poetic manner, which goes beyond surface realism. Descriptive sequences were specially shot in Pembrokeshire and in the South of France to show landscapes which have influenced his painting. The film concludes with a personal statement by the artist about his approach to his work."
