        "Goldwood is a search for the early self, in this case the period is associated with life at a previously abandoned gold mine in the northern Ontario wilderness in 1941-42. A woman describes the look and feel of her childhood to an artist friend. The story of her days at Goldwood unfolds through his paintings and live footage of their visit to the site. Nature has reclaimed the land. The adult attempts to reclaim the child. The woman discovers pieces of her doll's plate lost thirty years earlier. The film evokes the universal feelings of a child in an adult's world and the awareness of self. Paintings and photography by Blake James."
