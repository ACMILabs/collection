        "Episode of Series \"The Twentieth century\". Goering's life story. The air race of 1918; exile in Sweden; return to Germany and the early days of Nazism; Goering sets up the storm troops, the Gestapo, the Luftwaffe, is largely responsible for the economic revival of Germany and wins immense popular prestige. Early Luftwaffe triumphs are eclipsed by the failure of operation Sea Lion and the RAAF raids on Germany. Goering falls from power and public prestige to a figurehead. His capture, trial and sentence at Nuremberg."
