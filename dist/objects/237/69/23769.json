        "This film tells of the adventures of two Australian girls on a flying visit to New Zealand. As they travel the country the girls are seen against a giant backdrop - New Zealand itself. Nearly all of it is shown - forests, farms, the rivers and lakes, ski-fields, and beaches, the volcanoes, and the cities...a lively introduction to New Zealand."
