        "The official film of the XI Commonwealth Games held in Edmonton, Canada, in August 1978. An international sports event occurring every four years, the games draw hundreds of athletes from the many nations of the Commonwealth. Eight athletes from four continents were selected to illustrate the nature of individual effort. They were filmed in their home countries before the Games, and in competition in Edmonton, Canada."
