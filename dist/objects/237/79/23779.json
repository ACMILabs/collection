        "In 1807, Spain was \"peacefully\" invaded by the armies of Napoleon, plunging the country into a long, cruel and bloody war. Francisco de Goya, the great Spanish painter, recorded the catastrophe of this war in a series of lithographs which are reproduced in this film. The transition from peace to rebellion, the brutality and futility of total war, and the grimness of death, are portrayed with bitter clarity by the artist. Narrated by Joseph Armesto and American narration by Frank Gehlein."
