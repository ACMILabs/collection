        "In an effort to emphasize the importance of good vision in many areas of daily life, this film follows the course of a young schoolgirl as she blunders her way along, ignorant that she has poor eyesight. With the help of an alert teacher she becomes aware of her problem and in the process of acquiring a pair of new glasses she gains a new visual perspective of the world."
