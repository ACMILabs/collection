        "A colourful variety of aspects of the land and nature of Japan. Beginning with the new year the film introduces the Grand Shrines of Ise, most honoured of the national shrines; the charming doll festival; the dramatic \"water drawing' rites of Nara are illuminated by torch light; the Mibu pantomime of Kyoto and the Dontaku festival of Hakata. Interspersed are shots of ancient temples and shrines contrasting with ultra-modern structures based on traditional architecture."
