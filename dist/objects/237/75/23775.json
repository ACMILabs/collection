        "A journey of rediscovery down an old Quebec country road in the southwest corner of the province. Family pictures, snapshots, live photography, the homespun philosophy of old folks, some glimpses of the new generation - the impressions are many, varied and gathered at random to build this documentary study. Most of the film is monochrome, with a touch of color here and there to add a note of contrast."
