        "Depicts 50 years of progress in road and bridge construction in Victoria. The first survey made in 1913 showed that travel was hazardous on the hand-made roads. In 1916 the first all-weather road to Geelong was completed. Gradually isolated settlers and mailmen were able to travel in the country. Municipal co-operation was sought and aid given for road construction by machines. Recent work includes new concrete bridges, and the completion of a two-lane highway from Melbourne to Dandenong, all important to Victoria's prosperity. During 50 years, motor registrations increased from 10,000 to 90,000."
