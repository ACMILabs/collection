        "Using a combination of live actors and a puppet - \"Sebastian the Fox\" - this film tells how two unscrupulous miners sell a supposedly worthless mine to Sebastian for 5 Pounds. Sebastian promptly unearths a nugget; the miners try to steal it. Sebastian, however, \"outfoxes\" them and the rascally pair are left with an old boot as the fox drives off with the nugget. No dialogue spoken. Credits include: writing by Tim Burstall; photography by Giorgio Mangiamele; editing by Alan Harkness and Michael Thornhill; music by George Dreyfus."
