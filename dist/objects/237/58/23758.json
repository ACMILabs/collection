        "This film is about a sport in which Australians excel - Australians like Crampton, Graham, Devlin and Thompson. The film shows the variety of golf courses in Australia, and explains the many problems of golf course architecture. It also shows equipment manufacture and how videotape playback facilities are used in training young golfers. Scenes with some of the world's top professionals during the 1972 Dunlop International and World Cup Tournaments in Melbourne are featured. Cinematographer - Dean Semler."
