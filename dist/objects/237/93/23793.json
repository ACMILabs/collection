        "Episode of Series \"Office Supervisor's Problems\". Two girls discuss of rumour that they have heard that their company is merging with another company which would mean moving to another city. On another occasion new office equipment is obtained and the rumour is spread that girls are being replaced by machines. The office manager when confronted with the stories says there is no truth in them. He has not been generous in answering questions and they were nervous about going to him. The question for discuss is how rumour can be prevented from being started."
