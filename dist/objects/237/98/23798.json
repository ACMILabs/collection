        "An example of the silhouette films of Lotte Reineger, based on the poem of La Fontaine. All summer long Grasshopper plays his fiddle for other animals and insects to dance, but Mrs. Ant, busy collecting fuel and food, criticises him for his levity. When winter comes he is near death from cold and hunger when a squirrel and a mouse take him in and care for him. He recovers and all including Mrs. Ant join in dancing to his fiddle. Music by Freddie Phillips."
