    "description": [
        "An image from a newspaper featuring Eastern European women being forced into prostitution and slavery at the end of the Yugoslav-Serbo-Croatian war, sets the scene for the Cross Currents exhibition. Presented in two sections, interactive video and linear video, as well as being in English and German language, events are recreated leading up to a police raid on a sex slave hotel in Berlin. The raid is recreated from the opposing points of view of an enslaved Croatian sex worker and her Serbian bodyguard.  Cross Currents premiered at ZKM, Centre for Art and Media, Karlsruhe, Germany in 1999."
