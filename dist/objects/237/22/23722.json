        "More than 50% of all traffic deaths in the USA are caused by drinking drivers. How people are actually affected by alcohol depends very much on body weight, amount of food in the stomach and length of time over which the alcohol was consumed. Diagramatically the film explains how alcohol works and shows a test worked out to show how alcohol affects driving ability."
