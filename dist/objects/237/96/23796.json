        "Grass is indirectly involved in the production of many essentials commodities - butter, milk, meat, clothes, blankets and soap. Therefore its incorrect use could upset the present and future prosperity of the country. Methods of grass conservation include prevention of overgrazing, extermination of rabbits, and other pests, planting of grass and trees on damaged land and the instruction of young farmers in conservation practices."
