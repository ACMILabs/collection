        "The sea has a certain fascination for Australians. Although it is a large dry contitnent, most Australians live close to the sea. This film makes magnificent use of the sea as a background to the work of designing, building and servicing the variety of navigational aids off the coast of Australia, particularly the work of the ships of Cape Pillar, Cape Morton and Cape Don. An interesting split screen effect has been employed in this fast moving colourful documenatry. Commentary by John Laws."
