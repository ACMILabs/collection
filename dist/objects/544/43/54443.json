        "The film details a process important to house-building in England and the early New England colonies. Using authentic tools and techniques, a seasoned worker at the Plimoth Plantation in Massachusetts thatches the roof of a newly constructed cottage. The film covers all steps, which usually takes one man from eight to ten weeks to complete."
