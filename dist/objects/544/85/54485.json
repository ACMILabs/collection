        "This film is about the impact of Western culture on the people of the Pacific. It tells of the Melanesian's loss of a sense of identity and meaning, and the disappearance of the old ways that gave happiness and security. It is often angry and bitter, but is not without hope, for the man of Melanesia is determined to find the way out of his confusion and despair. Based on a Melanesian play by Francis Bugotu and Tony Hughes."
