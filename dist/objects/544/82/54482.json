        "Part of the \"See it my way\" series, in this program Eric Worrell outlines his views on conservation of the environment, based on the premise that, if the individual starts to rebuild the ecological balance of their own garden, they will encourage others such as business organisations, councils and governments to follow suit on a wider scale. He gives several examples of companies that have established sanctuary areas for the animal population side by side with areas used for economic purposes. He also cites other examples where the environment has been totally destroyed in the pursuit of economic expansion."
