        "A major expansion program, begun by New Broken Hill Consolidated Ltd, in 1968, was completed in 1971. The film describes the expansion activities, which included the sinking of a three-thousand foot air shaft and major extensions to the underground workings. Many views of modern mining methods are provided. Could be used for geography, secondary social studies, and for general interest."
