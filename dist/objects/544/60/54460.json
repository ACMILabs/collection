        "Part of a series on the Netsilik Inuit as documented by the Education Development Center. In this film, it is late autumn. The Inuit move to the river valley where they build karmaks - shelters with snow walls and roofs of skins. The men fish with spears and their catch is cooked over an exterior fire. The family then eats inside the karmak. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
