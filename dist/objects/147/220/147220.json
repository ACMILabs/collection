        "In 1862, Etienne-Jules Marey, a French physiologist, with an interest in movement, devised a camera with magazine plates that recorded a series of photographs. Once combined, the pictures would represent movement, and in particluar, the flight of birds. Marey's invention is regarded as a forerunner of the modermn motion picture camera. See also: 'Pioneers of Photography' (Ep.07): 'The Fleeting Image' (Available on VHS and 16mm).  Credits: No credits available."
