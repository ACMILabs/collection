        "Resorting to prints and songs, this documentary gives a newsreel-style account of the the tragic events of 1793 known as 'La Terreur'. 1793 is characterised by the overthrowing of the constitutional monarchy and the emprisonment of the royal family at the Prison du Temple. The Paris mob (the 'Sans-Culottes') rules and exerts pressure on the Convention, still dominated by the bourgeois Girondins (led by Brissot) and the Montagnards (led by Robespierre). On the borders, the situation is equally precarious with the armies of the coalised nations threatening to invade the country and save the monarchs.  Credits: director, Jean Vidal ; writers, Edouard Bruley, Jean Vidal. Cast: Rene Lebrun, Jacques Tessier [narration only]."
