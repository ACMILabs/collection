    "description": [
        "In the XIVth century, art is no longer controlled by the church or the kings. The new mecenes are the princes and the patrician class. Under their impulse, art becomes more attentive to the depiction of secular life. Works of art are less gandiose, smaller and destined to a private use as illustrated by the somptuous Livre d'Heures (prayer book) commissioned by Duke Jean de Berry. XIVth century aristocracy is intoxicated by stories of chivalry and the knights of round table. Art depicts in minute details the idyllic life of knight, entirely devoted to hunting, tournament and the pursuit of 'l'amour courtois'.  Credits: Director, Roland Darbois ; writers, Roger Stephane, Roland Darbois, photography, Roland Dantigny. Cast: Narrated by Georges Duby."
