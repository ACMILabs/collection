        "Episode 23 of Series \u201cIl Etait Une Fois L'homme\u201d (= \u201cOnce Upon a Time Man\u201d). The awakening of the people in 1830 and more famously in 1848 was a series of republican revolts against European monarchies, beginning in Sicily and spreading to France, Germany, Italy,  and the Austrian Empire. They all ended in failure and repression and were followed by widespread disillusionment  among liberals. Reference: Encyclopedia Britannica.  Credits: Director, writer, Albert Barille ; photography, Jean-Louis Karcher ; art direction, Philippe Landrot, Rene Borg ; graphic research, Jean Barbaud. Cast: Roger Carel, Francine Laine, Pierre Trabaud, Henri Djanik [original French narration]."
