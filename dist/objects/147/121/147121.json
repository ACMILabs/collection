        "Part 11 of 13 part series on the history of French cinema. By the mid-1960s the industry had reconciliated. The French filmgoing public, and most producers, had lost their sympathy for formal experiment and unbridled self-expression. But it would be an exaggeration to argue that French cinema was essentially unchanged, and that most of the films of the late 1960s resembled those of the previous decade. Much had, in fact, been irretrievably altered. The film community was no longer closed to new talent. New directors (for example, Constantin Costa-Gavras, in 1965) and other personnel entered the industry with much greater ease than during the 'Tradition of Quality', though most of them worked on unadventurous, if occasionaly stylish, commercial projects.\" Reference: Alan Williams. 'Republic of images: a history of French filmmaking'. Harvard University Press, 1992 Our collection holds many of the titles referred to in this episode. Apart from a large selection of works by Truffaut, Melville, Chabrol and Godard of this particular decade, we also recommend the following: Rohmer's 'Le signe du Lion' ; Astruc's 'La proie pour l'ombre' and 'La longue marche' ; Franju's 'La tete contre les murs'  and 'Judex' ; Varda's 'Le bonheur' and 'Cleo de 5 a 7' ; Michel Drach's 'On n'enterre pas le dimanche' and 'Amelie ou le temps d'aimer' ; Resnais's 'L'annee derniere a Marienbad' and 'La guerre est finie' ; Colpi's 'Une aussi longue absence' ; Deville's 'Ce soir ou jamais' and 'Adorable menteuse' ; Robert Enrico's 'Au coeur de la vie' ; Alain Robbe-Grillet's 'L'immortelle', 'L'homme qui ment' and 'Glissement progressifs du plaisir' ; Henri Verneuil's 'Melodie en sous-sol'.  Credits: Director, Armand Panigel ; photography, Claude Cassard. Cast: Includes interviews with: Louis Malle, Pierre Granier-Deferre, Pierre Kast, Claude Chabrol, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Eric Rohmer."
