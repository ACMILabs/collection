        "Set in the bohemian quarter of Montparnasse (Paris) at the turn of the century, 'Montparnasse 19' follows the last days of the life of Modigliani. Thinking he is a failed painter, Modigliani has become an alcoholic. He survives thanks to the generosity of Rosalie, a restaurant owner, and his friend Zborovski. An art merchant, Morel, recognises the talent of the young painter, but prefers to wait patiently for his death in order to cash in.  Credits: Producer, Ralph Baum ; director, Jacques Becker ; writer, Henri Jeanson ; photography, Christian Matras ; music, Paul Misraki ; editor, Marguerite Renoir ; art direction, Jean d'Eaubonne. Cast: Gerard Philipe, Anouk Aimee, Gerard Sety, Lino Ventura, Lili Palmer, Lea Padovani, Lila Kedrova, Marianne Oswald, Jean Lanier."
