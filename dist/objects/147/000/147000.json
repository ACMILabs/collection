        "After years of aimlessly wandering around Northern Africa, Edouard Binet is sailing back to Europe. On board, he encounters the beautiful Sylvie and introduces her to Nemrod, a successful merchant, who is carrying a valuable jewel. After disembarking, Edouard accepts Sylvie's offer to stay at her mother's pension in Belgium. At the pension, Edouard's charm endears him to Sylvie's aging, lonely mother, Madame Baron. The stories of his fabulous adventures do much to ease her ennui. When they read in the papers that Nemrod has been murdered during a train trip to Paris and his valuable gem stolen, Sylvie begins to suspect that Edouard may have had something to do with Nemrod's death.
