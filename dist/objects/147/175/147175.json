        "Episode 18 of Series \u201cIl Etait Une Fois L'homme\u201d (= \u201cOnce Upon a Time Man\u201d). A lot of time in this episode is devoted to the transformation of a simple hunting lodge into a palace worthy of the magnificence of Louis XIV. In 1680 Versailles is finally inaugurated after more than 20 years of work which calls upon the best talents of the time: Levaux, Lebrun, Lenotre, Hardouin-Mansart etc... Apart from a foray into French classicism in architecture, this episode also treats of the French religious conflict, opposing catholics and protestants.  Credits: Director, writer, Albert Barille ; photography, Jean-Louis Karcher ; art direction, Philippe Landrot, Rene Borg ; graphic research, Jean Barbaud. Cast: Roger Carel, Francine Laine, Pierre Trabaud, Henri Djanik [original French narration]."
