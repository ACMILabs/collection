        "During the middle-ages, Lord Richard is away at the war when he learns of the death of his wife, Leonor. Stricken with grief, he burries her in the crypt of his castle and re-marries that same night with a young girl, Catherine. Thanks to Catherine and their two children, Richard is re-born, but still has difficulties forgetting his first wife. He decides to re-open the crypt and live there with Leonor, in spite of a warning from an old man that reviving the dead can be an extremely hazardous activity. Soon after, Leonor comes out of the crypt to resume life with Richard and asks him to kill Catherine and the children.
