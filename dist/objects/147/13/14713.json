        "Aaron Purnell used to suffer with up to 200 seizures a day. When he elected to have an operation that would stop his seizures, Aaron also knew that he would also end up with a permanent disability. This is his story of living with that disability, his involvement with the Whitehorse Disability Awareness Project and how his best friend Alisha inspired him to make something of his life. This project was funded by the Department of Human Services, (Eastern Metropolitan Region), developed and executed in partnership with MetroAccess at the City of Monash and City of Whitehorse, and Scope."
