        "Vidocq is doing an other stint in prison, just time enough to organise his next escape via the asylum section. While Annette waits anxiously with a carriage outside the prison, Vidocq and friend are held captive by the lunatics. Convinced the two intruders are demons, the asylum patients decide to put the men on trial.  Credits: Producer, Etienne Laroche ; director, Claude Loursais ; writer, Georges Neveux ; photography, Maurice Damien ; music, Serge Gainsbourg. Cast: Bernard Noel, Alain Mottet, Genevieve Fontanel, Helene Dieudonne, Serge Gainsbourg."
