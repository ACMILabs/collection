        "Elizabeth Massot has taken time off to move into a new appartment. From her windows, she witnesses a cat burgler breaking into a roof-top flat. Elizabeth and an other witness are taken by the police to give their testimony. Elizabeth's testimony is that of a cautious woman used to ponder the frailty of human evidence. As such, she closely observes the other witness giving an incredibly detailed description of the burgler while enjoying all the attention: is she a reliable witness or just a bored woman relishing her 15 minutes of fame?  Credits: Producer, Jean Gauthier ; director, Philippe Condroyer ; writers, Philippe Condroyer, Mariette Condroyer ; photography, Jean-Jacques Rochut ; music, Antoine Duhamel. Cast: Simone Signoret, Didier Haudepin, Jean-Claude Dauphin, Michel Vitold, Marie Dubois, Patrick Bouchitey."
