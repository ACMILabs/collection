        "Episode of Series \u201cLe Tresor des Hollandais\u201d. Stephane is so filled with guilt that he wants to reveal all to Olympe before he gets her compromised further. The second substitution of jewels turns out to just as problematic as the first one. The children return the necklace to the props department of the Opera House. Jacinthe is allowed to keep a ring from the treasure, much to Lulu's dismay.  Credits: Director, Philippe Agostini; writer, Odette Joyeux; photography, Christian Petard; music, Georges Auric; choreography, Michel Descombey; costumes, Pierre Balmain. Cast: Claude Bessy, Claude Ariel, Catherine Bouchy, Pierre Didier, Felix Marten, Jacques Fabbri, Robert Manuel."
