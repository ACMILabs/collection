        "Jean Renoir never made any secret that 'Le Dejeuner sur L'Herbe' was inspired by the impressionist paintings of his father Auguste Renoir, and also of Edouard Monet. A pompous Parisian professor concerned with artificial insemination, finds himself seduced by the mysteries of the countryside and the farmer's daughter. Shot almost entirely at Les Collettes, the Renoir family home near Cannes, its sensuous colours and sunlit images derive from the Impressionists.  Credits: Producer, Ginette Doynel ; director, Jean Renoir ; writer, Jean Renoir ; photography, Georges Leclerc ; music, Joseph Kosma. Cast: Paul Meurisse, Catherine Rouvel, Fernand Sardou, Ingrid Nordine."
