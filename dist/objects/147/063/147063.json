        "An ex-dancer runs an isolated mountain hotel where the guests are 'people with problems'. This melancholy allegory about characters living on the edge of a figurative and literal abyss, was made under the restrictions of Vichy France and at times threatened by censorship. Visually, [during the Occupation] the new films became more mannered and stylized, surpassing even the expressionistic vistas of 'realisme poetique' in their creation of visual fields removed both from every day reality and from the characters who moved within them. Some works returned to overt pictorialism of late silent film, perhaps most notably Gremillon and Prevert's 'Lumiere d'Ete'. Sets were often large and elaborate, despite obvious financial difficulties that this entailed in a period of limited resources. Roger Regent, one of the period's most astute observers, spoke of the 'decor-personnage' (the set as character) as being an often abused cinematic cliche. If decor could frequently function as a kind of (impersonal) character, fictional beings could by the same token lapse into relative, sometimes absolute stillness, assuming the function of decor in a larger, metaphysical drama.\" Reference: Alan Williams. \"Republic of Image: a history of French filmmaking\".
