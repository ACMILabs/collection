        "The eve of the XIIIth century marks the revival of royal power. In France, Louis IX models himself on Charlemagne and, just like his illustrious predecessor, has a chapel, La Sainte Chapelle, built to symbolise his authority and his role as a intermediary between man and God. During this period, Saint Louis participates in two Crusades in the Orient. Although a failure, the  Crusades reveal to the Europeans a world much wider and more diverse than they ever imagined. With better boats, stirring and maps, Europeans are able to set off to far flung parts of the globe and bring back marvellous tales and exotic products. This is a time of discovery and optimism, reflected in a certain estheticism in art and where the beautiful primes over the demonstrative. The XIIIth century sees the creative impulse shift from France to Italy with its soaring class of merchants and bankers.  Credits: Director, Roland Darbois ; writers, Roger Stephane, Roland Darbois, photography, Roland Dantigny. Cast: Narrated by Georges Duby."
