        "Profile of the long and diverse career of Jacques Prevert, from his early beginning as a sketch writer for the Agit-Prop (revolutionary) theatre group 'Octobre', to screenwriter for Marcel Carne and free-verse poet, whose texts have become classics of the French chanson and an all-time favorite of school children. The portrait is that of a tender anarchist and bon-vivant whose ferocious wit would be used to mock the hypocrisy of those who stand for moral, order and against the enjoyment of the simple pleasures of life. The films contains numerous excerpts of films scripted by Prevert, including 'Les visiteurs du soir', 'Quai des Brumes' (both held in our collection) as well as poems interpreted by Maurice Baquet. Includes interviews of Prevert's friends and interprets: Francis Lemarque, Jean Wiener, Raymond Bussieres, Michele Morgan, Paul Grimault, Alain Cuny, Jean-Louis Barrault, Arletty.  Credits: Director, Jean Desvilles ; photography, Maurice Giraud ; music, Joseph Kosma, Francis Lemarque."
