        "Araminthe, a rich and beautiful widow, is in no hurry to marry again. For the moment, she is happy to entrust the management of her estate to Dorante, a proud young man engaged to Marion, Araminthe's servant. But Dorante has eyes only for Araminthe and her wealth. To better forward his amorous goal, Dorante enlists the aid of Araminthe's valet as the man who conveys both true and false 'confidences' to the unsuspecting young woman. The combination of truth and falsehoods as well as Dorante's desire for both the woman and her wealth set up entertainingly ambiguous situations, typical of Marivaux comedies.  Credits: Producer, Jacques Schaeffer ; director, Daniel Moosmann ; writers, Bernard Landry, Daniel Moosmann ; photography, Etienne Becker ; music, Jean Musy. Cast: Jean-Pierre Bouvier, Roger Coggio, Fanny Cottencon, Brigitte Fossey, Michel Galabru, Micheline Presle, Paul Preboist."
