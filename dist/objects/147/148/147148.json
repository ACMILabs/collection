    "description": [
        "Year 1300 represents the apex of the cultural and economical expansion of the Midle Ages with Europe being adorned by sets of new monuments in different styles: gothic in Salisbury and Reims, oriental in Palermo and Toledo. Italy is the centre of artistic innovation and production thanks to a rich class of merchant conducting business all over Europe and the Orient. From the Cathedral, the focus shifts to the city and specially the Piazza. Major works are commissined to adorn private and civil buildings, such Simone Martini's frescos in Sienna's Communal House. But in 1348, the Black Plague epidemic brings the artistic expansion to a grinding halt. This marks the introduction of a macabre element in art. The serene smiles of the angel on the portal of Notre Dame is no more. At the end of the XIVth century, people have two obsessions: death of the body and the unrestrained enjoyement of the short-lived pleasures of life. This episode also profiles the works of Giotto.  Credits: Director, Roland Darbois ; writers, Roger Stephane, Roland Darbois, photography, Roland Dantigny. Cast: Narrated by Georges Duby."
