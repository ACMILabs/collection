        "This short film follows Jean-Pierre Melville during the filming of 'The Shadow Army'. Melville explains his interest in WWII which stems from his involvement in the Resistance movement and later on led to his filming an adaptation of 'Le Silence de la Mer'. He confides his fascination for American cinema where action matters first and foremost.  Credits: Director, Jacques Dupont."
