        "During the XIIth century, the centres of innovation are moving away from the monastries towards the cathedrals. Times are changing and what matters is now the secular world, the merchants and the bishop. Cathedrals are not simply devised for religious celebration, they are also civic centres where town meetings are held and to which the guilds of merchants contribute magnificent stainglass windows. During this period of urban revival, money flows towards the building of cathedrals in Reims, Laon, Chartres, Bourges, etc ...  Credits: Director, Roland Darbois ; writers, Roger Stephane, Roland Darbois, photography, Roland Dantigny. Cast: Narrated by Georges Duby."
