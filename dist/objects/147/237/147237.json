        "Jules Verne had three passions in life: the sea, music and freedom. The passion for the sea started during his childhood in Nantes, in the Quartier de l'Ile Feydeau, filled with memeories of explorers and slave traders. Destined to become a lawyer, Verne is sent to Paris where he begins to write. His writings are highly influenced by the industrial revolution and the belief in the power of the machine to transform the world.  Credits: Director, Jean Vidal ; writer, Yolande Cassin. Cast: Daniel Ivernel [narration only]."
