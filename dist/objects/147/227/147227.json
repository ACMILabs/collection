        "Following the journey of a book from its arrival at the Legal Deposit office, rue de Richelieu, to the consultation room, Alain Resnais takes the audience through the meanders of the French National Library and the treasures it contains. Resnais instructed his crew that he wanted to move through the library like a fish in water or like a rocket. This explains the fluidity of the travelling and tacking shots which gave the film such a dynamism while the subject was totally inert.  Credits: Producer, Pierre Braunberger ; director, Alain Resnais ; writer, Remo Forlani ; photography, Ghislain Cloquet ; music, Maurice Jarre, Georges Delerue. Cast: Jacques Dumesnil [narration only]."
