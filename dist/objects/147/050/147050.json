        "Thirteen-year old Bruno sees his father one Sunday in each month. During the August holidays, father and son spend a long weekend together in Belgium. This is a very slight but touching film about a father-son relationship which sensitively delineates the problems each faces in their difficult situation. Careful direction avoids the pitfalls of cloying sentiment, Hanin's performance is beautifully judged, and the Bruges locations are pleasing. Reference: Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide.  Credits: Producer, Christine Gouze-Renal ; director, Louis Grospierre ; writers, Louis Grospierre, Alain Quercy ; photography, Quinto Albicocco ; music, Jean-Pierre Bourtayre ; editor, Leonide Azar. Cast: Roger Hanin, Christian Mesnier, Marika Green, Mary Marquet, Pascale Roberts, Francine Berge."
