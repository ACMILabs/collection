        "The awakening sexuality of a group of boys during a summer in Nimes is focused on Bernadette, the sister of one of them, and her short-lived love affair with Gerard, a physical education teacher. The blend of sensuality and nostalgia, tenderness and irony recalls Renoir, especially 'Partie de Campagne'. The voice-over narration ensures that we see Bernadette - the first of Truffaut's succession of inacessible women - through the eyes of the boys.  Credits: Producer, Robert Lachenay ; director, Francois Truffaut ; photography, Jean Malige ; music, Maurice Leroux Cast: Gerard Blain, Bernadette Lafont, Michel Francois [naration]."
