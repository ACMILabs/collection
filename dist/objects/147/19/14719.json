        "Diner's Club is for people with disabilities and where once a month, for Melanie, it provides a sense of independence and a chance to mix within her own social group. She explains some of the problems that arise when people with disabilities attempt to organise a night out for dinner. This project was funded by the Department of Human Services, (Eastern Metropolitan Region), developed and executed in partnership with MetroAccess at the City of Monash and City of Whitehorse, and Scope."
