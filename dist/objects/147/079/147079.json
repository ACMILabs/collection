        "The Guillou men spend summer fixing up 'La Constance'. Romance is blossoming between Jean and Anne, Marie-Josee's sister. Anne is both attracted to Jean and worried by the endless life of worrying and waiting that is already the lot of her sister. She seems equally attracted by the easy going lifestyle enjoyed by Arlette and Antoine, the children of Dr Rey, Marie-Josee's tenants. After a quick round of recruiting, the crew of 'La Constance' is ready to set forth for a first fishing campaign.  Credits: Producer, Marcel Degliame Fouche ; director, Robert Mazoyer ; writer, Paul Guimard ; photography, Jean-Jacques Guyard ; music, Georges Delerue. Cast: Jean Le Mouel, Claude Brosset, Lucien Barjon, Andree Tainsy, Jean-Marc Epinoux, Dominique Mac Avoy, Elina Labourdette, Jean-Pierre Kerien, Catherine Seynes."
