        "This episode deals with the slow movement of affirmation of regional styles as a sign of resistance against the 'French gothic'. Sicily is a prime example of a country where the confluence of the Hellenic, Islamic and Latin inflences gives birth to a singular style, epitomized by the cathedral of Montreale (near Palermo). In Italy, Frederic II Hohenstauffen moves to reject both the Islamic and Byzantine influence as well as that of the French gothic. The Cathedral in Betonto (Italy) bears the strong influence of the Carolingian style in evidence in the Palatine chapel of Aachen (Germany).  Credits: Director, Roland Darbois ; writers, Roger Stephane, Roland Darbois, photography, Roland Dantigny. Cast: Narrated by Georges Duby."
