        "Episode 3 of Series \u201cIl Etait Une Fois L'homme\u201d (= \u201cOnce Upon a Time Man\u201d). Following the Ice Age, the era of Cro Magnon starts. The tool making technique has made vast progress. Cro-Magnon is an expert at using stones, bones and skins. He also has a strong artistic bent as demonstrated by the production of human-shaped statuettes and rock face paintings. Cro-Magnon takes the leap from hunter to herder, helped in his endeavour by his ability to domesticate dogs.  Credits: Director, writer, Albert Barille ; photography, Jean-Louis Karcher ; art direction, Philippe Landrot, Rene Borg ; graphic research, Jean Barbaud. Cast: Roger Carel, Francine Laine, Pierre Trabaud, Henri Djanik [original French narration]."
