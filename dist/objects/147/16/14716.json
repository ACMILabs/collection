        "Cameron through the use of his \"talker\" tells of his background, his intense shyness as a child and lack of confidence until the age of 23 when Karen, Rhonda and Mel came into his life. He has become a role model for kids aged 6 to 14 who use talkers and an inspiration to all those who work with him in the disability area. This project was funded by the Department of Human Services, (Eastern Metropolitan Region), developed and executed in partnership with MetroAccess at the City of Monash and City of Whitehorse, and Scope."
