        "On Christmas night, Inspecteur Antoine is asked to investigate the murder of Brignon, an old, creepy producer. The prime suspects are Jenny Lamour, a music-hall singer and Maurice, her jealous husband. Although Jenny knows Maurice's jealousy is a major hindrance to her career, she fights to have him cleared of all suspicions, until she realises that Antoine is trying to get to her through her husband. The crime-thriller aspect of the film is only a vehicle. What really interests Clouzot is the detailed rendition of the atmospheres of a music-hall and a police station, as well as the quirky characters that populate them.
