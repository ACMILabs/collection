        "Gustave Eiffel was afraid that his famous tower would overshadow his other accomplishments. This short film sets out to shed light on a very prolific international engineering career which included the building of railway bridges, viaducts and the metal frame of the Statue of Liberty.  Credits: Director, Joan Laskoff ; photography, Jacques Mercanton ; music, Betty Willemetz."
