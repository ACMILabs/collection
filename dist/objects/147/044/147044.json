        "A murder takes place at a boarding house full of eccentrics, each one a likely suspect. Clouzot, whose films are generally dark in character, made his feature debut with this delightful comedy-thriller of 'The Thin Man' type. The films is not one of these intimidating masterpieces that mark the history of [French] cinema. It is an unpretentious and entertaining piece, solidly built around 2 main centers of interest: the sarcastic and spicy exploration of a boarding house and the colourful fauna living inside it\". Reference: Le Nouvel Observateur, 3 April 1987. German censorship had all the scenes featuring Linz's interrogation cut out of the film because they were judged too violent. Clouzot had asked the actors playing the police not to fake the action and actor Noel Roquevert who plays Linz finished the scene with a swollen face.  Credits: Director, Henri-Georges Clouzot ; writer, Henri-Georges Clouzot ; photography, Armand Thirard ; music, Maurice Yvain. Cast: Pierre Fresnay, Suzy Delair, Pierre Larquey, Noel Roquevert, Jean Tissier, Louis Florencie, Raymond Bussieres, Odette Talazac, Marc Natol, Huguette Vivier."
