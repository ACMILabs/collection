        "A documentary account of a Punk/New Wave festival held in the Fourvieres roman theatre of Lyons in the summer of 1978. Fourvieres made its mark in the history of entertainement as a place where Christians were thrown to the lions. In 1978 only great expectations are shattered as 'Marie et les garcons' are booed off the stage. The concert showcases French exponents of the New Wave movement, such as Telephone, Bijou, Starshooters as well as Heavy Metal band Ganafoul and reggae outfit Cimarons, all working hard to prove that there is a world of peaceful harmony outside Disco. The documentary ends with that also familiar concert ritual: an ocean of empty beer cans being swept away. Cast: Interviews by Jean-Francois Bizot."
