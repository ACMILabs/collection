        "Stan, an adventurer, travels to Corsica to pay his respect to a departed friend who was shot dead in mysterious circumstances. On the good advice of one of his friend, he also goes to drown his sorrow at a local brothel where he meets Helene, a young woman who is being held against her will. Stan manages to escape with her and they flee to Girolata, a village only accessible from the sea. Stan and Helene promptly fall in love, but Stan discovers she may have been responsible for turning over people to the Nazis during World War II. This film was Jose Giovanni's directorial debut. Giovanni is best known for writing a chronicle of his experiences in prison entitled 'Le Trou' that he and filmmaker Jacques Becker then adapted for the big screen in 1960.  Credits: Producers, Rene Pigneres, Gerard Beytout ; director, Jose Giovanni ; writer, Jose Giovanni ; photography, Georges Barsky ; music, Francois de Roubaix. Cast: Michel Constantin, Alexandra Stewart, Jean Franval, Edwin Moatti, Roger Blin, Daniel Moosman."
