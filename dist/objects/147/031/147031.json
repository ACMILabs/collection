        "Adhemar, Rajah of Kashmir decides to play a nasty trick on his estranged relatives and disinherit them all ... except for Ludovic, a vague nephew. Ludovic is a hopeless dreamer and gambler, up to his neck in debts and unpaid tax bills who has to support a wife and ten children. The inheritance arrives in the form of a double-decker bus in which the family promptly moves in order to avoid creditors and gendarmes. For the family, the bus is a wonderful toy which allows them to visit Paris and meet with eccentric characters. The bus also attracts the interest of the Rajah's former servant, for he alone knows that the double-decker is made of pure gold. This is a charming comedy filled with surrealistic moments and songs.
