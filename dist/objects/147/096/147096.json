        "The series follows two years in the life of village of Le Miroir and its residents as they go through the transformation of their quiet Alpine village into a modern skiing resort, Le Miroir 2000. The main protagonist is Antoine Sesterain, the mayor of the village and farmer. Antoine is a widower with three sons, all deeply attached to the mountains: Henri, a resort manager, Francois, a skiing instructor engaged to Martine and Pierre, a restless student. Pierre is causing havoc at the boarding school he attends in the valley and where his uncle, Abbe Bonnevie teaches. Following a prank, Pierre is denied permission to leave the school to attend his brother Henri's wedding. During the wedding, Lauzon, a local saw-mill owner approaches Antoine with the idea of turning Le Miroir into a skiing resort. Set in the mid-1960s, 'Les Sesterain' is a realistic rendition of the changes many mountain villages had to go through as France sought to exploit the 'white gold' and the rising interest in winter sports.  Credits: Producer, Pierre Long ; director, Francois Villiers ; writers, Andre Maheux, Francois Villiers ; photography, Paul Soulignac, Henri Raichi ; music, Francois de Roubaix. Cast: Etienne Bierry, Jean-Claude Dauphin, Marie-Christine Barrault, Georges Claisse, Yves Lefebvre, Christian Alers, Marthe Villalonga."
