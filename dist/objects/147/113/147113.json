        "Part 3 of a 13 part series on the history of French cinema. After a few years in limbo, French cinema is able to start producing talkies on a solid technical and aesthetical base. The camera seems to recover its mobility, the directors continue to explore the possibilities offered by editing and sound effects. First attempts are made to shoot on location and in exteriors. Major directing talents start to emerge, including Yves and Marc Allegret, Julien Duvivier, Jacques Feyder and Raymond Bernard, as well as stars such as Harry Baur and Jean Gabin. This episode profiles 'Le lac aux dames' (Marc Allegret, 1934), Duvivier's 'Poil de Carotte'* (1932) and 'La bandera' (1935). Raymond Bernard's work for the period includes 'Les Miserables'* (1933) and 'Les croix de bois'(1931). Three films directed by Jacques Feyder, include 'Le grand jeu'* (1933), 'Pension Mimosas' (1935) and 'La kermesse heroique' (1934). *=Held in our collection  Credits: Director, Armand Panigel ; photography, Claude Cassard. Yves Allegret, Marc Allegret, Charles Spaak, Marcel Pagnol, Francoise Giroud, Henri-George Clouzot."
