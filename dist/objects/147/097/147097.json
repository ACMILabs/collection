        "Pierre quits the college before the graduation exam and goes back to Le Miroir. Meanwhile, Martine announces to Francois that the engagement is off. Antoine pushes the development plan through the Council. His arguement that a resort might help save the village by giving young people a reason to stay at Le Miroir is rebutted by those who risk losing their farming land to building and development.  Credits: Producer, Pierre Long ; director, Francois Villiers ; writers, Andre Maheux, Francois Villiers ; photography, Paul Soulignac, Henri Raichi ; music, Francois de Roubaix. Cast: Etienne Bierry, Jean-Claude Dauphin, Marie-Christine Barrault, Georges Claisse, Yves Lefebvre, Christian Alers, Marthe Villalonga."
