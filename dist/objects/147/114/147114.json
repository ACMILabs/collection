        "Part 4 of a 13 part series on the history of French cinema. By the mid-thirties, French cinema is enjoying a phase of expansion. Surprisingly, the influx of German personnel fleeing the Nazi regime helps expanding the market for French cinema into Eastern Europe. This is the time during which Pommer leaves UFA to work in Paris to produce 'Liliom' with Fritz Lang. An other emigre is Pabst who directs 'The Three Penny Opera'* and 'L'Atlantide', starring Brigitte Helm. Alexander Korda, brought to France by Pagnol to direct 'Marius'* also directs 'La dame de chez Maxim's', before returning to the UK. For most of the German emigres such as Billy Wilder, Robert Siodmak, Anatole Litvak, Fritz lang, G. W. Pabst, France was only a stop over on their way to real careers and prospects in Hollywood. It must also be noted that certain members of the French film industry did go out of their way to make them feel rather unwelcome. This nationalist animosity is best expressed in a revealing interview with Claude Autant-Lara. These few years are the golden age of commercial production: producers make safe bets with adaptations of theatrical success, bordering on the Vaudeville, and using to great effect the strong presence of character actors, such as Fernandel, Raimu, Larquey, etc ... Distraught at the arrival of sound, French cinema seems to have opted for an increasing banality. After the flop of 'The last millionaire'*, Rene Clair is off to England and the USA and won't return to France for an other 10 years. Renoir directs 'La vie est a nous' , 'Le crime de Monsieur Lange'* and 'Une partie de campagne'*. The greatest novelty for the period is a short film directed by an unknown Jacques Prevert: 'L'affaire est dans le sac'. The film seems to herald something new: the come-back of poetry in film. Shortly after, Carne, formerly an assistant to Jacques Feyder, directs his first film 'Jenny'* and opens the way to a fruitful collaboration with Prevert. A good example of the new mood in cinema and an iconic film of the 'Front Populaire' is Duvivier's 'La Belle Equipe'*. *=Held in our collection.  Credits: Director, Armand Panigel ; photography, Claude Casard. Interviewees include: Rene Clair, Pierre Braunberger, Marcel L'Herbier, Yves Allegret, Henri-George Clouzot, Claude Autant-Lara, Raoul Ploquin, Charles Spaak, Marcel Carne, Pierre Billon, Jean-Paul Le Chanois."
