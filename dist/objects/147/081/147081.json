        "The first campaign of 'La Constance' has been marred by poor returns and lots of material damage. Jean is also increasingly worried that Anne is getting cold feet about becoming a fisherman's wife. For the second campaign, Doctor Rey embarks on 'La Constance'. Bad luck strikes again as the trawler picks up a WWII sea mine. While the crew disembarks on a life raft, the three Guillous stay on board to secure the mine.  Credits: Producer, Marcel Degliame Fouche ; director, Robert Mazoyer ; writer, Paul Guimard ; photography, Jean-Jacques Guyard ; music, Georges Delerue. Cast: Jean Le Mouel, Claude Brosset, Lucien Barjon, Andree Tainsy, Jean-Marc Epinoux, Dominique Mac Avoy, Elina Labourdette, Jean-Pierre Kerien, Catherine Seynes."
