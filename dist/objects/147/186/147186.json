        "Charles Bais is a well-to-do architect married to Marthe, a harpsicord player. The day following Charles' purchase of a handgun, Marthe is found dead in bed with a bullet wound to the heart. The murder investigation conducted by Judge Massot reveals that Charles used to enjoy a rather ecclectic sex life and that he was in the habit of sharing his mistresses with his good friend Docteur Noel. Judge Massot's attention becomes increasingly drawn to one of Charles' conquest: the mysterious Camille.  Credits: Producer, Jean Gauthier ; director, Claude Barma ; writer, Pierre Dumayet ; photography, Ghislain Cloquet ; music, W. A. Mozart. Cast: Simone Signoret, Michel Vitold, Didier Haudepin, Anna Karina, Maurice Ronet, Georges Wilson, Gisele Grimm."
