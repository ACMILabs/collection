        "In the heat of August, in the empty city, a troupe of young actors work on a new production of Shakespeare's 'Pericles' (a play which itself focuses on youthful ideals and commitments) without money and against professional advice. Production difficulties cause enthusiasm to crumble, intrigues to proliferate and little by little the group falls apart. They believe themselves to be victims of an unexplained secret conspiracy. This is a film of mood and lyrical romanticism rather than of narrative lucidity. With 'A Bout de Souffle', '400 Blows' and 'Le Beau Serge', 'Paris nous appartient' (made on virtually no budget) is a key film in the first flowering of La Nouvelle Vague.  Credits: Credist: Producer, Roland Nonin ; director, Jacques Rivette ; writers, Jacques Rivette, Jean Gruault ; photography, Charles Bitsch ; music, Philippe Arthuys. Cast: Betty Schneider, Giani Esposito, Francoise Prevost, Daniel Crohem, Francois Maistre, Jean-Claude Brialy, Claude Chabrol."
