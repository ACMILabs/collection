        "George who? George Sand (nee Amantine-Aurore-Lucile Dupin), the renown 19th century writer who defied conventions by adopting a man's name, garb and making her own a freedom of behavior that was strictly reserved to men. Produced in the heydays of the Women's Movement this film depicts her life and shows she can be considered an essential forerunner of the feminist movement.  Credits: Producer, Jean-Pierre Bamberger ; director, Michele Rosier ; writer, Michele Rosier ; photography, Armand Marco. Cast: Anne Wiazemsky, Jean-Gabriel Nordmann."
