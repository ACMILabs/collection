        "Examines Dada and Surrealism not simply as modern movements in the arts, but also as a history of ideas - emphasising the desire to unify political and psychological values with artistic creativity. Begins with the birth of Dada in Zurich, against the background of the first World War then continues to the Surrealist movement. Describes how Dada and Surrealism attempted to transform the world and how they were transformed by it. Credits: Scriptwriter, Mick Gold."
