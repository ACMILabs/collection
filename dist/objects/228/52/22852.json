        "Esperance, a small town on the southern coast of Western Australia, is a community centre for wealthy pastoralists and graziers. A smaller number of aborigines also live there, who are in the care of the Western Australian Department of Native Welfare. Two of the aborigines have been granted blocks of land to farm, which will enable them to bridge the social and economic gap, provided that the white community accepts them without prejudice or paternalism"
