        "An appraisal of John Constable, English landscape painter, who lived from 1776 to 1837. Depicts his birthplace and the scenes in Suffolk which inspired many of his paintings. He strove to capture the beauty of nature in his paintings with dramatic and emotional brushwork, and in his freedom and his sense of space and light, he can be seen as the precursor of the plain-air painting of the Impressionists."
