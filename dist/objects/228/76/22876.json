        "The story of a day's work at Covent Garden, from the moment when the first lorry arrives in the quiet and shuttered market soon after midnight, through the increasingly busy hours around dawn, until it subsides again into inertia as the last customers, the old flower ladies who sell in the streets at evening, make their modest purchases and depart. Lindsay Anderson's documentary, a remarkable enterprising example of sponsorship on the part of the Ford Motor Company, has become widely known since it received the Grand Prix at Venice festival. It is a film of enormous technical skill: highly sophisticated poetic passages alternate with candid camera scenes close to life. Its real importance, however, is in its attitude - its intentness upon - the dignity of labour and workers and of the interdependence of our society, of which a market like Covent Garden is a highly significant symbol. Lindsay Anderson's intention is summed up in the words which precede the title of the film: To Alice and George Bill. And Sid and Alan and George. And Derek and Bill and all the others. . . this film, about the market at Covent Garden, is affectionately dedicated. Script, Lindsay Anderson. Cinematography, Walter Lassally. Sound recording and editing, John Fletcher. Music, Daniel Paris. (Awards: Grand Prix Venice)"
