        "An engrossing blend of scenes in the ancient kingdom of Ethiopia where indolent camels still sway through the sand and long-robed tribesmen race their Arabian steeds, while great airliners glide into a modern airport. Produced without commentary, this film seems to put the viewer in the midst of the crowds of smiling people, among whom is glimpsed the emperor himself, Haile Selassie, Lion of Judah."
