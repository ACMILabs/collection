        "A National Employment Service placement officer learns that in the man who is physically disabled he has as good a product to sell as in the one without a disability - that the properly placed so-called disabled worker is no more disabled vocationally than the ordinary worker. In support, the film shows many instances of exceptional job performance by disabled workers, illustrating that, from the employer's point of view, physical limitations are amply compensated for by greater efficiency, less absenteeism and a lower accident rate."
