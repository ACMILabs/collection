        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". Deals with three questions: What is chemical equilibrium? How does the chemist recognise it? How does he explain it? In answering the questions the film stresses the dynamic nature of equilibrium. An Analogy in terms of fish population in two connected bowls, and animation using molecular models, present the concepts. Suitable for upper secondary level."
