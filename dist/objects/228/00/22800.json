        "The role of engineers in a series of atomic projects, including Calder Hall, Dounreay, and the new series of stations being built for the Electricity Authority are featured. The need for new techniques in building skill, using a greater degree of precision than ever before, and new materials capable of standing up to intense strain and powerful radiation is emphasised.
