        "Inhabiting the milder waters of southern Australia and New Zealand, the Fairy Penguin does not grow to the height of its companions in the Antarctic regions; it stands about 16 inches tall. This film shot at Summerlands Beach, a protected nesting ground on Phillip Island, follows the penguins through their daily routine, beginning with their return from the sea at dusk after fishing."
