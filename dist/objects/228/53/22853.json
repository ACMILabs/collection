        "Examines past and present reasons for waging war, the distance between those who declare war and those who fight it, the self-seeking of peacetime and the high productivity and united attitude of wartime, and the great ideals of war beside its horrible reality. Presents the positive and negative side of many moral questions related to war, and queries the need of civilised people to kill one another."
