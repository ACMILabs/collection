        "Illustrates causes of domestic outbreaks of fire and the precautions to be taken with them. Nearly all fires are caused by carelessness - leaving on electric appliances, using the wrong kind of fusewire, patching up electrical leads, leaving open fires unattended, and also leaving matches within reach of children. Emphasises that while fire brigades are highly trained, well equipped and within easy reach, the best cure for fire is prevention."
