        "An impression, from daybreak to midnight, of the life of the industrial valleys of South Wales and of the growing part played in that life by bus and railway. The free verse spoken by Donald Houston acts as a link between various arias, choruses and orchestral interludes from Handel's \"Messiah\" that utter their own comment, lyrical, ironic or humorous, upon the pictures of Welsh life and landscape they accompany."
