        "A journey of scientific exploration through Canada's north. Members of the Canadian Army, with snowmobiles and amphibious weasel, made a great winter trek over country never before travelled by motor vehicle. The expedition took detailed weather observations, corrected maps, studied the mobility of snow vehicles, and coped with the weather. Through human skill and endurance the frontier of the north was pushed back, showing its rich promise for the future."
