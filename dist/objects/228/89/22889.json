        "Documentary/drama on police-enforced evictions in Melbourne during the 1930's depression and the tactics the organised unemployed used at the time to combat the situation. Based on the memories of Noel Counihan and Tom Hills and adapted from the book 'Weevils in the flour' by Wendy Lowenstein, the film combines interviews with period reconstruction. Erwin Rado Award for Best Australian Short Fiction, Melbourne Film Festival, 1980."
