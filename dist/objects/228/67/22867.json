        "Film animator Eve Lambart spent over thirty years working at the National Film Board, and now she has retired. This retirement means many things to her: gardening, sewing, baking and preserving, weaving, and even filmmaking in her own animation studio during her \"spare\" time. Always an individualist, she is enjoying her self-contained new lifestyle to the fullest."
