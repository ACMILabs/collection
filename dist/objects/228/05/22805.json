        "A.L. Rowse, the eminent historian, has written, \"The Elizabethan Age is not something dead and apart from us...Wherever one goes in England there are visible memorials of what those men and women were when they were alive, houses they built, things they made and wore, objects they cherished, patterns they imposed upon the very landscape.\" Some of the visible traces as well as something of the spirit of that England of Elizabeth I, Drake, Raleigh and Shakespeare, are recorded in this film."
