        "The film which is in the form of a cartoon in technicolour shows how, at all times and in all ages, industry and commerce have derived their strength from calculated risk taken by shrewd, farsighted and courageous individuals. It begins with a fable about a potter of ancient Egypt whose one-man concern was faded with ruin until it was rescued by the enterprise of its owner. It then advances to the present day when great undertakings are characteristic of the industrial scene. The film shows something of the condition, national and international that brought I.C.I. into being and portrays the structure of the Company from board room to workshop floor."
