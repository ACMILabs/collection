        "A humorous cinematic poem attempting to capture all the images and associations of carnival, which dissolve into each other in the dreams of a young man who has just returned from an evening at the fair. There is no plot, each image suggesting the one to follow. This is one of the most celebrated of French avant-garde films. Made originally for a ballet called \"Relache\" (i.e. performance suspended) it was thus a joke within a joke - an entr'acte or intermission in a non-existent performance. No spoken word, this film's story was written by Francis Picabia with music by Erik Satie"
