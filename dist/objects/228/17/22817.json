        "Harting, a pleasant village in the south of England, follows the traditional pattern of an English village as a neighbourly community in which people live, work, and enjoy their leisure together. In particular, the film illustrates the many communal activities, such as the Parish Council and the Women's Institute, which play an important part in English village life."
