        "Through history humans have fought an eternal struggle against plagues, hunger, and war. Scientists of many nations have contributed to this fight against disease. The developments of the 19th and 20th centuries havce created new health problems because of industrial employment, crowded cities and more rapid means of communication. Control of disease is only now possible on a world-wide basis. The film is a dramatised story of the work of the World Health Organisation organsied to fight disease on a global scale."
