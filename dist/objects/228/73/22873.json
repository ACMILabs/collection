        "This film tells of the history of barley. A grain of antiquity - seeds were placed in the ancient pyramids of Giza. The experimental work done by Victorian and South Australian agencies to improve the barley crop through the development of more suitable varieties for areas of different climate, standard-isation of seed and better farming techniques is shown. This film was included in the San Francisco Film Festival 1964."
