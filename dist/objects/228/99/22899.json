        "Exeter Cathedral in Devonshire, England, is considered to be the finest example of architecture of the Decorated period, 1250-1350. This film rolls back the centuries, unfolding the cathedral's history, showing the refinement of the sculpture that went into its building, from the airy vista of the nave (longest unbroken stretch of Gothic vaulting in the world), to the vibrant colors of its windows. But more than architecture survives, Exeter is still a living church for the people of today. Credits include: photography by Pierre Letarte, Reginald Morris, Richard Todd, Gilles Gascon; editing by Margaret Wescott; music by The Dunstable Consort; sound by Ted Haley, Jean-Guy Normandin and Peter Hearn."
