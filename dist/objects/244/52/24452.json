        "Shows the work of the many people who are engaged in working on Sydney Harbour - the fishermen who gain their livelihood from its waters, those who maintain its laws and ensure its cleanliness, those who maintain its equipment and preserve its many miles of wharves and those who dredge its bed and attend to its buoys. They keep the harbour for the ships from many lands to use, but themselves never go \"outside\"."
