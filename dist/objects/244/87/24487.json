        "This film is based on information gathered for a joint investigation of the Joelma Building fire in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1974 by the National Fire Protection Association and the National Bureau of Standards (US Dept of Commerce). It is a sobering and haunting account of a real-life \"towering inferno\" - two hours of fire, 179 dead. It contains graphic and disturbing images of people leaping to their death. However, it also shows firefighting and rescue efforts and uses animation to show how fires spread in high rise buildings. Electronic score by Robert Ceely."
