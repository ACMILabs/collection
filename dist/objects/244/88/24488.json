        "A film on the work of Charles Lloyd showing in detail the dry-point technique of etching and the possibilities of one-plate colour printing which he studied at Atelier 17 in Paris. Culminates in an animated sequence interpreting his statement - \"each print is an adventure, a little journey of discovery\". The commentary is edited from his recorded discussions."
