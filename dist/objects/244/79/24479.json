        "A documentary about New Caledonia, which shows the nickel plant, and the inroads mining has made on the environment. Traditional forms of agriculture are shown, as well as the traditions of village life. These continue despite the French presence in the territory and the effects of nearly a century of resource exploitation on New Caledonia's environment. Suitable for secondary school level."
