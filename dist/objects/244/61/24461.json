        "Episode of Series \"Canada carries on\". A film on child adoption describing how a welfare agency seeks to find the right home for each child placed under its care. How the agency goes about selecting good \"parent material\" is seen as two childless couples apply for adoption of a child. The first couple demonstrates the type of parental qualities looked for; in the case of the second, there is reason to doubt their ability to provide a healthy emotional environment for an adopted child. We see, too, the need for patient understanding of the delays and complications of placing the right child in the right home."
