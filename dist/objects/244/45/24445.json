        "One of the greatest hazards in marine navigation, poor visibility, has in the past caused much loss of time, money and often life. Before the advent of radar the problem was without solution. This film explains the history of radar, the difficulties faced and overcome in its adaption to marine operation, and finally its inestimable value as a navigational aid."
