        "Pre-school education in Australia is examined. How important is pre-school education? Does a child really learn anything - or is it just a baby-sitting service, or a playtime? What kind of pre-school education is available and what are the requirements of an adequate pre-school education? How many children have a chance to receive this type of education and what happens to those who miss out on this opportunity?"
