        "Discusses the unique qualities of impressionism and shows examples of impressionistic master-pieces. The techniques are contrasted with the detailed photographic techniques of some former schools. Points of departure are in the selection of everyday subjects, the use of intense contrasts of light and shadow and bold generalised patterns using heavy applications of paint to give great action and movement."
