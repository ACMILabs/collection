        "Made in a style similar to the \"Carry on\" movies, this very funny film shows what should and shouldn't be done in a school laboratory. Sid James features in a film clip and cast also includes Bernard Bresslaw and John Merrigan. NB: Some equipment shown is not used in Australian schools. Suitable for lower and middle secondary levels."
