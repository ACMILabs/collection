        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Crossroads of the world: a study of North Africa and the Middle East\". The counter-wave of western expansion breaches the closed frontier of Islam - Napoleon in 1798, quickly followed by the British. From the Muslim defeat rose the new nationalism, an upsurge intensified by two world wars and the emergence of the new state of Israel. Part two of the revised seven-part series."
