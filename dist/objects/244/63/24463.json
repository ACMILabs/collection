        "An adventure film of a whaling expedition that included Scott McVay, an authority on whales, and filmmaker Bill Mason. The objective was to find and film the bowhead, a magnificent inhabitant of the cold Arctic seas brought to the edge of extinction by excessive commercial whaling. With helicopter and Inuit guide, aqualungs and underwater cameras, the expedition searches out and meets the bowhead and beluga. (Six awards, including New York; Columbus)"
