        "An ironic history, culled from much archive film footage preserved in London, the former heart of Empire, and attested by several surviving servants of Empire whose pride and faith in past missions is not without dignity despite the questionable aspects of empire-building. Commenting on the course of Empire are members of the Establishment, and young people of former colonies."
