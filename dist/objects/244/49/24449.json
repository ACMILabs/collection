        "Episode number 10 of Series \"How to Drive\". Town driving demands great powers of concentration, road observation, the ability to react quickly to changing situations, and considerable driving skill. Patience and restraint play an important part in dense traffic driving, allowing safe distance around our vehicle as a 'cushion of air' and giving greater visibility of traffic movement ahead."
