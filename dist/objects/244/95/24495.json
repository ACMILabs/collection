        "Based on a book of the same title by R. W. Grant, first published in 1966, and updated and extensively revised by Susan Love Brown and the student staff of Campus Studies Institute, World Research, under the supervision of Patty Newman in 1974. This docudrama film contains re-enactments based on true facts of various events that took place during the 1960's and 1970's relating to government department abuse of individual freedom and choice. For example, an Amish farmer who could not pay his taxes and subsequently lost his farm (which eventually turned into a parking lot), and a police agent drug bust on the wrong house (with no compensation to the couple who lived there). It focuses on government regulation and intervention, lobbyists and monopolies versus people's freedom of choice and the right to food, shelter and equality."
