        "Three weeks before her wedding, Mrs Joyce Mann discovered that she had a lump in her breast. After a mastectomy she and her husband found just how few facilities there were for women who were considered mutilated. Before a group of nurses, Mrs Mann explains and demonstrates her experience, and the underwear she has worn and now wears. Another cancer victim shows that now, at times breasts can be reconstructed."
