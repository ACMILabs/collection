        "This film pays tribute to the railroad and its contribution to America; discusses the type of life and work of the people who run the passenger and freight trains. Shows the aesthetic appeal of steel and steam and the beauty of nature along the right of way and is almost an abstract painting seen from a parlour car window, a montage of people. The film was prepared in conjunction with the publishing of a monograph on a variety of papers used by the railroads."
