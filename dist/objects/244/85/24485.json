        "A picture of life along the coasts of the Persian Gulf. Here life is a battle - a struggle for existence with the desert and with the sea. In the markets of the villages, the products of cottage industries are exchanged for the products of the sea or of the desert. But everywhere water is scarce. On the coast ships are built; ships for the trade of the gulf, for the fishermen and for the pearling industry."
