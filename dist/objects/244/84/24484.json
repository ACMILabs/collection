        "Aviation came quickly in Australia. In the early days reliable DC3's carried everyone and everything. Then new faster and more comfortable aircraft were sought: the Fokker Friendship from Holland, the super Viscount from France and turbo jets from America. During training flights the attractions of gracious Amsterdam, gay Paris, England's spring, New York's people, Rome's buildings and Australia's scenic attractions are presented."
