        "Episode of Series \"Office Supervisor's Problems\". The supervisor in order to avoid getting rid of staff when work is slack arranged for a transfer of his best typist to another section. Unfortunately he neglects to explain to her why he has recommended the transfer and she thinks it is because he considers her work to be poor. She complains to his superior officer, which causes trouble for the supervisor. Discussion is on how the situation could have been avoided."
