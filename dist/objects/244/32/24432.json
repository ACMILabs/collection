        "Describes a young girl's first experience of the children's room of the New York Public Library. Evokes in an imaginative way the pleasures, satisfactions and companionship children can find in reading. Shows story hours, simple reference work and borrowing routines. Emphasises the child's freedom of choice and the way in which the library is scaled to their requirements. Narrated by Henry Fonda."
