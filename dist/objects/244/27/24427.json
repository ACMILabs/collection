        "Episode of Series \"Educational Psychology\". Follows the case of a 13 year-old boy to illustrate the principle that all education is essentially a process of attaining basic, meaningful goals. In the class-room, the child is bored. Outside, a series of incidents are used to show that the child shows interest where a tangible goal provides the necessary incentive to make him want to learn. Something to work toward, in terms of young minds and young desires, can spell the difference between eager, interested students, and those for whom school is both boring and dull."
