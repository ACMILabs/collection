        "Four unemployed young people roam around one of Australia's largest industrial cities. Combines social realist fiction with an essay-like examination of the city of Wollongong. This film is equally engaging and intellectually rigorous. As an exploration of a once leading steel-producing city, now increasingly blighted by unemployment, it also becomes a requiem for post-war working class Australia."
