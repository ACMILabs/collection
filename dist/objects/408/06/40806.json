        "An interactive documentary, this CD-ROM looks at the future of our planet through a discussion of the environmental issues threatening it and what every person can do to help. Problems investigated include; global warming, pollution, ozone layer depletion, acid rain and the potential solutions: recycling, alternative energy sources and conservation. After examining the issues, you can enter into the debate, hearing what the world's experts have to say about the issues affecting us all. This beautifully composed CD-ROM is fully narrated with stunning photography throughout, it includes specially filmed video sequences, in-depth photo stories and animated diagrams, including graphs to illustrate relevant points. Also included is a full index of contact addresses for all the relevant environmental organisations in Europe and America. A very useful and interesting means of learning how we can all help to save our home, which would suit secondary school aged children and adults alike!"
