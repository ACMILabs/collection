        "Episode of Series \"Playing Fair\". Nobody wants to play Snow White in this year's drama production except for Carol. Previous years she had to be content to play lesser roles or the wicked witch. However, for some of her classmates this is a problem, because Carol is not white. After much lively debate and creative thinking, Carol and her classmates find a solution and show that the problem is not Carol's colour, but that the material itself and people's expectations about Snow White are the real obstacle."
