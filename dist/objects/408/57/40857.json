        "Featuring the voices of Phil Harris and Eva Gabor, this Disney animated favourite is filled with lovable characters and \"swingin' music\". When an eccentric millionairess wills her entire estate to her pet cats, her greedy butler abandons them in the French countryside so he can inherit the money himself. Duchess and her three adorable kittens embark on an adventure-filled journey back to Paris, with a street-wise Casanova alley-cat named O'Malley."
