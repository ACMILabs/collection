        "Episode number 8 of Series 'The Best of British'. Great historical characters have been portrayed on the silver screen since the movies began. The veracity of these films ranges from the authentic to sheer flights of fantasy. In 'Reel lives', films such as 'The Magic bow' starring Stewart Granger, and 'Cleopatra' with Vivien Leigh are examined. 'All in the game' discusses how sports provided just the right background to some of the most exciting British films, including the famous 'This sporting life' and 'The Lady vanishes'. Narrated by Sir John Mills."
