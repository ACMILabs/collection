        "Episode of Series \"Eyewitness\". Horses are an important part of the history of civilisation. Humankind harnessed the energy but never mastered the beast. The fifth fastest land mammal, the horse is the \"Marathon\" winner of the animal kingdom, renown for its strength and endurance. This program looks at the physionomy of the horse and different horse species such as zebras and donkeys. The horse has occupied a place not only in the history of human beings but in our myths, legends and superstitions. Stunning photography and a behind-the-scenes-look at the making of the program ensure this program is an enriching experience for all ages."
