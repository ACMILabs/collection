        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Growing awareness: Factors in plant production\". If every plant of a species was identical, they could all be susceptible to devastation caused by environmental change. This program explains pollination, different methods of seed dispersal, and a detailed examination of meiosis. This ensures that plants swap genetic information randomly, so that the next generation is genetically unique. The retention of old varieties of plants, such as types of wheat, demonstrates the need to store a variety of genetic material."
