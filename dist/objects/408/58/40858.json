        "When baby New Year disappears, Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer dashes into the foggy night to rescue him in time for New Year's Eve but Aeon, the terrible, foul-feathered, big-beaked monster bird is also after the little fellow. Aided by Big Ben the whale, and a helpful caveman, Rudolph sails to the Islands of Last Years. Catching up with baby New Year at last, Rudolph learns why he left home and sets off to save his friend."
