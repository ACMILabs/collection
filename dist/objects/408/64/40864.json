        "900 years ago, Christian Europe was seized by a religious fervour that changed the course of history and the world. Tens of thousands of men, women and children - knights and peasants, old and young - marched 3000 miles to recapture the Holy City of Jerusalem. Terry Jones narrates this fascinating documentary with exceptional special effects, actors, local people and computer wizardry in an attempt to demystify the romantic image of the Crusades. \"Pilgrims in Arms\" discusses who the Crusaders were and why they went. A pilgrimage to liberate the Holy City ensured absolution from sin, while failure to comply meant excommunication. \"Jerusalem\" looks at the actual physical conditions endured by the Crusaders and the art of medieval warfare."
