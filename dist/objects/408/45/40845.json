        "This beautifully animated and wonderfully scored feature film tells the story of the love between a proud lion ruler, Mufasa, and his son, Simba - a naive and curious cub who must find his place in the \"circle of life\". Through the help of his friends, and his determination to meet the toughest challenges, Simba eventually takes his place as the rightful ruler of the Pride Lands. His search to meet his destiny puts him face to face in a struggle to the death with his evil uncle Scar and also leads him towards true love. Elton John and Tim Rice's award winning songs, an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, and voice characterisations by Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson, Robert Guillame, Moira Kelly and Matthew Broderick as Simba, make this an unforgettable experience."
