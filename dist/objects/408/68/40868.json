        "Episode 1: The Pioneers. 1894-1927. Australians of the 1890's were among the first to discover the film medium, producing a dynamic band of film-makers with a bold and uncompromising vision. Raymond Longford, Lottie Lyall and Beau Smith fought against incredible odds and produced classics like \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\", \"Robbery under Arms\", \"The Squatters Daughter\" and the internationally acclaimed \"The Sentimental Bloke.\" Episode 2: \"O.K. for Sound\" 1928-1948. The new technology of talking pictures revolutionised the film industry and created new stars. \"In the Wake of the Bounty\" introduced Errol Flynn. This was the era of the Dad and Dave films and masterpieces such as Charles Chauvel's \"Forty Thousand Horseman.\" Australia's documentary tradition continued with classics like \"Journey of a Nation\" and \"Kokoda Front Line.\" Narrated by Bryan Brown."
