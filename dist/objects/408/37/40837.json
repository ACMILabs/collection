        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Growing awareness: Factors in plant production\". There are major biotic factors which affect plant growth including the impact of pests and diseases and the competition with other plants for light and resources. Highlighted are some of the techniques developed to control these problems and the beneficial relationships which exist between plants and living organisms. A contemporary approach known as Integrated Pest Management looks at various methods used to control pests and disease while minimising environmental impact."
