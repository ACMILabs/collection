        "Spirits of the forest looks at the Birds of Paradise in Papua New Guinea and the unique relationship they have with the highlanders. The people believe they gain the special qualities of the birds by wearing their feathers in ceremonies. This episode was written by David Attenborough. \"Year of the Gagadju\" looks at Kakadu as the traditional homeland of the Gagadju tribe. This is an account of how they divide the year into six seasons, reading the changes around them. The Gagadju are determined that their traditional culture will not be lost for future generations. Both programs are narrated by Sandy Gore."
