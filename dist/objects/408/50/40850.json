        "A continuation of \"Italianissimo 1\". The episodes focus on talking about oneself and interests, taking part in discussions, expressing an opinion, looking at topics of conversation such as the relationship between the sexes and politics. The program also reviews the units as a whole, as well as focusing on cultural topics, local customs and some tourist destinations. Audio cassettes and a manual complement the videos and can be borowed as separate loan items."
