        "Oskar Schindler was not the \"stuff from which heroes are made\". A womaniser, opportunistic, charming and hedonistic this documentary examines Schindler's life in terms of the historical events which shaped it: the rise of Nazism, the \"Final Solution\" and the Concentration Camps. His famous list of \"essential\" Jewish workers needed to staff his factory in order to help the Nazi war effort, ensured that the lives of 1,100 men, women and children were spared from the Holocaust atrocities. Schindler's life ended tragically as he died alone and unsung. His request to be buried in Israel was met, and it is there that he is celebrated as a national hero. As one of the survivors on the list said, \"[Schindler] gave me what the Nazi's took away from me... hope.\""
