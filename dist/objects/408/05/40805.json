        "This CD-ROM has been designed to allow Secondary level students to step back in time to Colonial Australia in a refreshingly new and interactive way. Structured for enquiry learning, students can explore hundreds of important aspects of colonial time through pictures, text, spoken word, poems and movies. Some of the issues covered include the reaction of indigenous Australians to Europeans, the legal system and how it changed, the changing roles of women and numerous aspects of the development of Australian society. Aimed at assisting teachers, this interactive tour would be a useful aid in the syllabus of English, Human Society and its Environment, Science and Technology, and Visual Arts. Minimum system requirements: 256-colour colour-capable Macintosh with 4 megabytes of RAM, running system 7 or later, with a CD-ROM player, a 12-inch 256 colour screen (on the LC) and a hard disk."
