        "H.G. Wells' classic tale about the invasion of the Earth by Martians has inspired and terrified people for many decades. Its translation into film was even more frightening, as audiences felt the panic and saw the destruction, as Martian machines, swan-shaped, ticking and hissing menacingly, destroyed everything in their path. In order to modernise Well's ideas, the original story was updated to include the atom bomb; ineffectual against the Martians. The film won an Academy Award for special effects. Staring Gene Barry, Ann Robinson and Les Tremayne."
