Growers face conflicting interests - the need to grow plants economically and the need to ensure against long-term destructive environmental consequences. Four case studies feature four different ecosystems: 1. Managing a National Park - preserving the natural features while allowing public access 2. Agro-forestry - the combination of timber production and agriculture 3. Parwan Valley - where a local Landcare group is working to restore the environmental balance 4. An Urban Bushland environment."
