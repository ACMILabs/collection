        "Muriel is a dag, an Abba maniac and out of place girl who would give anything to be like her bitchy friends. In her hunt to find Mr. Right in all the wrong places, Muriel takes a one-way ticket to freedom to find herself. A bitter-sweet and much acclaimed film which touches the essence of the themes of self-respect, identity and friendship. Toni Collette gives an inspired performance as Muriel and the supporting cast includes Bill Hunter, Sophie Lee, Jeanie Drynan and Rachel Griffiths."
