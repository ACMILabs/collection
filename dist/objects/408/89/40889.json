        "The subject is the actual crash of a small plane in which one man survived to tell the story. What he describes is his view of the world now, after being on the edge of death. It is, he says, like being continually stoned - neutral but more fully aware, accepting life without bias, a condition he feels we are all coming to. Award: New York."
