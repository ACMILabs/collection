        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Growing awareness: Factors in plant production\". Examines several different case studies on plant production systems. The environment can be manipulated to produce seedlings for retail nurseries, while vegetable seedlings are produced in large quantities needed by growers. Demonstrates hydroponics in a controlled environment being used to grow tomatoes and micro-propogating techniques. Explains how salt-tolerant plants can be cloned, using tissue culture methods to rapidly produce large numbers of plants suitable for use in high salinity areas."
