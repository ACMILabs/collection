        "Acupuncture and moxibustion in China have recorded histories of several thousand years. They are effective, convenient and safe treatments. Many people regard both treatments as one and the same, but they are in fact two distinct treatments that are often used together. Acupuncture is a corrective therapy and moxibustion is the burning of herbs on acupuncture points to bring healing relief. This is a in-depth analysis of these two healing methods, how they are applied and their increasing acceptance as efficacious treatments in Western medicine."
