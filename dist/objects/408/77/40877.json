        "Episode of Series \"Playing Fair\". During a friendly game of tag, Robert calls Kelly a racist name and a fight ensues. Both Kelly and Robert are given detention, and the Principal gives them a task where they must co-operate in order to achieve the desired end. It is through this co-operation and working together, that Robert realises that he has a great deal in common with Kelly, and that her \"difference\" is only \"skin-deep\"."
