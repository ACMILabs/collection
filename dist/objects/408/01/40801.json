        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Spaceship Earth\". The number of people at the world's \"dinner table\" is expected to at least double in the next few decades. Can human beings find a way to provide or restore rich, green, fertile lands to Spaceship Earth? This program examines comparative studies in France, ancient growing traditions and life in Samoa, and the importance of food in specific cultures. Desertification and erosion in Kenya is also examined."
