        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Growing awareness: Factors in plant production\". Photosynthesis is the process by which a plant converts the energy from sunlight into sugars in specialised cells called chloroplasts. Respiration is the releasing of energy stored in sugars in the parts of the cells called mitochondria. The manipulation of light to simulate the natural habitat, shows how plant science can measure the relationship between light level and growth to determine optimum growing conditions."
