        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Animals of Farthing Wood\". Bold turns his back on his father, who is none other than Fox, Leader of the animals of Farthing Wood. Born during the animals' first spring in White Deer Park, Bold and his fellow cubs have been a source of joy for Fox and Vixen after the cruel winter. This period of happiness ends abruptly when Dreamer, the gentlest of the cubs is killed by Scarface, rival leader of the Blue Foxes. Although Fox wants vengeance, he is reluctant to start a war between the Red and Blue Foxes, but Bold, the most reckless and bravest wants to put an end to Scarface once and for all. It is a contest which threatens the relationship between father and son. Based on the novel by Colin Dann."
