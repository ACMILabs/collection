        "Based on the best-selling novel by Michael Dobbs, a former aide to Margaret Thatcher, \"House of cards\" is a chilling political expose about the corruption of power, and the unbridled evilness of those who are determined to obtain it at all costs. Ian Richardson gives a brilliant performance as Francis Urquhart, Chief Whip and passed over by the PM in the Party allocation of \"Jobs for the boys\". The PM discovers that Francis is a deadly enemy. Enlisting the aid of eager, but novice journalist Mattie Storin (Susannah Harker), Francis uses his undoubted charisma to double deal and murder his way to the top."
