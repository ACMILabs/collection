        "Episode of Series \"Playing Fair\". Walker is a young American Indian boy who has tragically lost his parents and is now fostered by another American Indian family. His only playmate and real companion is his dog. Jamie, a lonely young white boy has been made afraid, not only of dogs, but of people who are not white. Walker ignores the racist taunts and jeerings of the older boys who have influenced Jamie, and reaches out to him. Together they find friendship and understanding as Jamie learns to conquer his fears."
