        "Episode of Series \"American revolution\". This dramatisation stars a youthful Michael Douglas and James Woods and is based on the letters of John and Henry Laurens, written between 1772-1776. The letters between father and son give a first-hand account of some of the events and issues surrounding the American Revolution. An interesting comparison is made between the call for national independence by America and the prohibition of slavery in England."
