        "When three innocent cowboys are mistaken for stagecoach robbers, they are forced to become fugitives until they clear themselves of suspicion. Before Jack Nicholson achieved fame in \"Easy Rider\", his electrifying talent was evident as the writer, co-producer and star of this taut, highly charged western thriller. Co-starring Cameron Mitchell, Millie Perkins and Harry Dean Stanton."
