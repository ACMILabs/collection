        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Nuclear age\". This program looks at the political, military and technological events that contributed to the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United Statesof America. As tension rose between the two \"Super-Powers', the nuclear arms race began in earnest. When the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb in 1949, President Truman stirred considerable controversy by deciding to pursue the development of the hydrogen bomb, six hundred times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. By 1953, the U.S. atomic arsenal had grown to over 1000 weapons."
