        "A documentary revealing the true spirit of Taiwan. It takes the audience on an exciting excursion to six major scenic and cultural spots in Taiwan including a visit to Orchid Island, participating in the age-old aboriginal rites of the Yami tribe and Taiwan's natural wonder, Taroko Gorge. We also visit the ancient city of Tainan, bustling Kaohsiung city, and the country's largest city Taipei. In addition to being an exciting visual experience, it is also a musical treat, with scores written especially by composer Gerald Shih."
