        "Episode number 9 of Series \"The Nuclear age\". Jimmy Carter began his presidency with a vision of a new world of non-nuclear peace, but his dream was shattered by constant domestic and international pressures. In 1977, when he took office, Carter pledged to reduce miltary spending, pursue a foreign policy based on human rights and to negotiate arms control with the Soviet Union. By 1981, he had ordered the Senate to halt the ratification of the SALT II Treaty and the deployment of MX and Cruise Missiles. This program examines the failure of Carter's vision and includes frank interviews with the former President, his Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, and Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko."
