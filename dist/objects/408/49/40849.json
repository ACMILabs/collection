        "Episode number 11 of Series \"The Best of British\". The ultimate collection of scenes from feature films inspired by the literary giants Shakespeare, Shaw, Dickens, Wilde and Wells. Some of the great classic films based on literature are featured including \"Oliver Twist\", \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" and 'The Importance of being Earnest'. In the episode entitled the \"English gentlemen\", the image of this stereotype as portrayed in film is discussed. It is a reflection on the urbane and sometimes eccentric characters portrayed by such stars as Rex Harrison, Michael Wilding and Stanley Holloway. Narrated by Sir John Mills."
