        "This program serves as a testimonial to the endeavours of the Taiwanese to rebuild their society: economically, socially and culturally. It focuses on the achievements of individuals, each of whom have contributed to the successful relocation of their society onto the Island of Taiwan. It was once said that \"Taiwan is like the oyster in the Pacific. It turns sand into pearls.\" For the filmmakers, this national pride provided a source of inspiration, in the hope that others will share their sentiments."
