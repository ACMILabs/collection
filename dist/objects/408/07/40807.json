        "Staggering adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel of the same name about an Austrian businessman who, during the Second World War, saved 1,100 Polish Jews from Nazi slaughter by using them in his factory manufacturing crockery for the German Army. Filmed almost entirely on location in Poland in gritty monochrome, this is a brilliantly realised, fiercely controlled and restrained treatment of a true story. Harsh and compassionate, it avoids sentimentality until the end. The three central performances, Liam Neeson who is towering as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kingsley as his Jewish accountant and Ralph Fiennes as the odious Nazi Commandant Amon Goeth, are unforgettable. Winner of seven Academy Awards for: Best Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Screenplay based on Material Previously Produced or Published, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Film Editing, Best Achievement in Music, and Best Production Design."
