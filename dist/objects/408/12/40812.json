        "This program enables children to discover the role science plays in their daily life. In each program, Jeffrey, a city kid spending his summer on a farm, explores one aspect of science with his friend Kate. She demonstrates a variety of fascinating experiments which children can do in the classroom. Curiosity and inventiveness are stimulated. The 20 ten minute episodes deal with plants, animals, astonomy, seasons, recycling, the weather, geology and basic physical principles."
