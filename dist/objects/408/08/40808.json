        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Nuclear age\". This program examines the background of the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. It was a decision which shocked and profoundly changed the world, killing and mutilating thousands. There were mixed reactions of pride and horror. \"We had calculated beforehand how much destruction there would be. But seeing it on films was much more terrible.\" was one reaction of the time. The pilot was given a hero's welcome, a medal and a celebration party."
