        "Terry Jones continues his fascinating account of the history of the Crusades. Although romanticised in literature and films, the Crusades history is filled with horrific tales of unbridled bloodshed and violence under the banners of \"Righteousness and Faith\". Jones examines this period not just from a singularly European perspective but also from the perspective of the Islamic world. \"Jihad\" looks at the unification of disparate Muslim groups under one powerful leader - Saladin. His brilliant leadership formed the foundations of the ultimate victory by the \"Infidels\". \"Destruction\" focuses on the enigmatic character of Richard the Lionheart and concludes the history of the Crusades, which ended bloodlessly with the Fourth Crusade in which not one \"Infidel\" was killed."
