        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Growing awareness: Factors in plant production\". The principles applied to commercial plant production are studied by the examination of three case studies. The first is pasture management, where with expert help, resources must be carefully managed to ensure the quality of diary produce. The second case study highlights broad-acre crops, a six year cycle of crop rotation and crop diversity to ensure better economic returns. Lastly, the focus turns to modern orchards and their design in order to ensure increased yields and good crop management."
