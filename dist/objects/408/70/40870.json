        "Bert Hinkler became an Australian hero and is remembered as one of the world's greatest avaitors. His record-breaking solo flight from England to Australia in 1928 was completed in 15 days reducing the original record by half. People wore Hinkler hats, Hinkler flowers, ate Hinkler puddings and had Hinkler dances as part of the excitement following this achievement. The program recreates scenes and uses archival footage to bring to life not only one of the greatest pioneers in aviation, but also a period of our history."
