        "Budgie is the bravest, cheekiest, friendliest, \"nippiest\" little helicopter at Harefield Airport. When he isn't getting into trouble, he's busy flying off on an adventure and his friend Pippa, and his other airborne friends are happy to lend a wing to him out of a a scrape. Based on the successful picture-storybook created by Her Royal Highness, The Duchess of York, Budgie's adventures will delight young children. The four episodes are: \"Pippa arrives\", \"'Chuck comes unstuck\", \"Budgie's blizzard\" and \"Ice work Budgie\"."
