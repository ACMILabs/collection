        "Episode of Series \"Astronomy: an Open Learning unit\". Telescopes provide our gateway to the stars. The study of astronomy relies heavily on telescopes and has done so for many centuries. Australia is in a unique position for studying the heavens, given its location in the Southern Hemisphere and its relatively small population. This program looks at the history of Astronomy in Australia."
