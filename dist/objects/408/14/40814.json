        "Based on Ray Nelson's short story \"Eight o'clock in the morning\", this is a fantastically subversive film which uses the clever premise that those in control of the global economic power structure are other-worldly aliens. Masquerading as humans they are overpowering the Earth and its inhabitants with an hypnotic form of mind control - hidden subliminal messages in the mass media. Featuring state-of-the-art special effects and starring Roddy Piper, Keith David and Meg Foster, this fast-paced adventure hurtles the viewer into another dimension where all is not as it seems."
