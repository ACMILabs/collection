        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Nuclear age\". In an exclusive interview, former Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko speaks for the first time about his famous White House Meeting with President Kennedy at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and refutes certain claims made at the time. \"...Kennedy never raised the question of the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba. I repeat, he never mentioned it.\" The statesman recalled that the discussions were \"full of sharp turns.\" For the first time since the end of the Second World War, the Cuban Missile crisis brought the world to the brink of a Nuclear war."
