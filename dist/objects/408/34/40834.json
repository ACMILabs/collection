        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Growing awareness: Factors in plant production\". Water is a critical requirement for plant growth. This program examines different methods of watering commercial plants and how to measure water needs scientifically. Water moves from the roots throughout the plant, distributing nutrients and keeping the plant moist. This flow, called transpiration, is driven by diffusion, evaporation and capillary action. The plant uses osmosis to aid this process, and the importance of the Osmotic Gradient in how plants cope with drought, water-logging and salinity is discussed."
