        "Set in a faraway land of magnificent palaces and beautiful Princesses, a sly thief, a shy cobbler and some very ugly brigands, do battle with an evil sorcerer to save a kingdom and rescue a beautiful princess. Following the tradition of \"Aladdin\" and \"Ali Baba\", this animation is exciting family entertainment, with a wonderful musical score featuring the voices of Bobbi Page and Steve Lively, from \"Beauty and the beast\" and Vincent Price as the evil Zig Zag."
