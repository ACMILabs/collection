        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Astronomy: an Open Learning unit\". The Southern Hemisphere provides some of the best viewing for astronomers. Galaxies and Nebulae close to the Southern Cross constellation are more observable and provide useful data to astronomers studying the wonders of the universe. This program also provides a brief history of astronomy from a Southern Hemisphere perspective by highlighting Captain Cook's voyage to Australia."
