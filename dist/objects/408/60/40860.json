        "David Attenborough's thrilling series takes a guided tour through the secret world of plants, using exceptional time-lapse photography to reveal hitherto, unseen details. The three episodes are: \"Travelling\" which looks at the various forms of locomotion developed by plants to establish territory. \"Growing\" examines the development of the plant from a seedling to a mature adult, while \"Flowering\" looks at plant reproduction and the cunning ways in which plants ensure successful cross-fertilisation. Also available on DVD [318963]."
