        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Hand of Stalin\". In 1929, Stalin implemented a massive process of forced farm collectivisation which saw millions of peasants forcibly removed from their land. Ill-conceived and carelessly administered, the collectivisation process resulted in millions of peasants suffering deportation, imprisonment and finally death by starvation as the process led to a massive famine. Interviews with peasants, old Communist Party activists and survivors of the famine provide an eloquent and moving testament to the abuse of power enacted by Stalin in his iron-willed determination to make collectivisation a success."
