        "Episode 3: Arising from the ashes. 1949-1970. The post-war film world was dominated by Hollywood giants but local heroes achieved huge success in \"Smiley\" and \"Jedda\" with stars like Chips Rafferty and Bud Tingwell. This episode explores the influences which encouraged success in the Australian film industry and overviews Australian life during the Menzies era and '60's - the point where the industry gained a financial footing for the first time in decades. Episode 4: Beyond our wildest dreams. 1971-1995. The era when our cinema was reborn with the classics \"Picnic at hanging rock\", The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith\", \"Mad Max\", \"Breaker Morant\" and \"Gallipoli. This renaissance fostered the talents of Mel Gibson, Judy Davis and the directors Peter Weir, Gillian Armstrong, George Miller and Bruce Beresford. Australia's image internationally consolidated with \"Crocodile Dundee\", Strictly Ballroom\", \"The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert and \"Muriel's Wedding\". Within 25 years the film industry had moved from near extinction to a point beyond our wildest dreams. Narrated by Bryan Brown."
