        "Davy Crockett was a legendary folk hero. Starring Fess Parker as Crockett, the hero fights alligators, battles an Indian Chief in a savage tomahawk duel and fights for freedom at the ill-fated Alamo. Accompanied by his friend George Russell, played by Buddy Ebsen, \"Davy Crockett\" is a daring adventure of drama, humour and excitement and will remain a colourful portrayal of the frontier."
