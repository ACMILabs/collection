        "Episode of Series \"Mathematical eye\". This program provides an introduction to geometry. It includes useful demonstrations showing how manufacturers use geometric principles to design packaging and how a variety of geometric shapes can be made by folding paper. The distinction is made between two and three dimensional shapes and the mathematical link between geometric shapes is explored."
