        "The discovery of Insulin and the story of Dr Frederick Banting, practitioner, surgeon and lecturer from London, Ontario, and his young associate Charles Best, medical student at the University of Toronto, who struggled against the scepticism of other doctors, the press of time, the restrictions of limited means, and discouragement, to discover a treatment for diabetes. Shows how they persisted with their experiments on diabetic dogs until they lowered the high blood sugar content in diabetes by an injection of insulin."
