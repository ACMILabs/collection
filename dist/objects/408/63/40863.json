        "Desmond Morris examines the ways in which human beings behave in terms of our \"animal\" instincts. The three episodes are: \"The Biology of love\" which is a scientific and biological approach to aspects of human love, courtship and sexuality. \"The Immortal genes\" examines human life from babyhood in terms of the Life Cycle. \"Beyond survival\" focuses on aspects of behaviour exhibited by human beings beyond those required for survival; in particular creativity and imagination. NB: Features full frontal nudity and specific scenes of sexual intercourse."
