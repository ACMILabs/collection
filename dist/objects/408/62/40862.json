        "Desmond Morris attempts to illustrate how the many ways human beings behave across cultures have their roots in our \"animal\" past. The three programs are: \"The Language of the body\" which examines the origins of our body language and how body language signals vary across cultures. \"The Hunting ape\" examines how our primeval hunting habits have been mainfested in activities such as sport and mob behaviour. \"The Human zoo\" looks at how urban humans deal with their tribalistic instincts. This episode contains some full frontal nudity."
