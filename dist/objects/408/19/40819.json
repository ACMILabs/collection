        "Modern Chinese culture in all its vitality, springs from the glories of traditional Chinese culture dating back thousands of years. Ten compelling aspects of Chinese culture are highlighted including contemporary architecture, ancient Nankuan music, native choral singing, Buddhist religious education, opera, modern dance and ancestor-worship rituals. The ROC on Taiwan has managed to translocate its rich cultural heritage, so that it continues to flourish."
