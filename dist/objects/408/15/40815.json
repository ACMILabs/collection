        "A documentary aimed at raising the level of awareness regarding issues of sexual assault against women; exploring rights, legal processes, resources and services available to sexual assault victims in Victoria. Issues covered include dispelling commonly believed myths about sexual assault, where to go if raped, surviving rape, the rape victim's legal rights, the role of the police, counselling and support services available to victims and societal attitudes to sexual assault and violence in our community. The program seeks to empower women by informing them of their rights, resources and services. This program was produced to assist professionals across Australia working directly or indirectly with victims of sexual assault, the general community and school students to better understand the facts about rape."
