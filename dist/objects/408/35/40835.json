        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Growing awareness: Factors in plant production\". Temperature influences a plant's growth, and plants have developed strategies to cope with extremes in temperature. In commercial plant production, statistical techniques are used to determine mean temperatures for different areas. Combining temperature and time, gives the concept of 'heat summation' measured in 'degree days'. Crop Modelling uses a computer to combine data on light intensity, temperature and the rate of photosynthesis to determine optimum growing conditions."
