        "When Paul's father is badly hurt, the Royal Flying Doctor service has to be called. Paul is left in charge of the farm and must fetch water from a nearby property. This becomes a task fraught with problems. Based on the novel by Colin Thiele, this is an excellent production from the makers of the award winning children's dramas, \"Danny's egg\" and \"Banduk\"."
