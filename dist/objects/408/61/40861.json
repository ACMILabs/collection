        "David Attenborough shows us plant life in action. Beautiful filming highlights many strange and wonderful species of plant life as well as revealing the inner and hitherto secret workings of plants. \"The Social Struggle\" looks at how plants compete in the environment for territory and survival. In particular parasitic and fungal plants are highlighted. \"Living Together\" reveals how plants can co-exist with animals and other plants so that both partners thrive, while \"Surviving\" shows how plants deal with adverse conditions in coping with climate extremes, lack of nutrients and predators. Of particular interest is the focus on carnivorous plants. Also available on DVD [318963]."
