        "Set in the year 2084, \"Total Recall\" tells the story of Doug Quaid who after having strange dream about Mars, visits a travel service called Rekall Inc. which implants artificial vacation memories into their clients' brains. In Quaid's case, the process goes horribly wrong and he discovers that his life on earth is an illusion, and that his real persona once lived on Mars. The film follows Quaid's search for his identity and the unravelling of the mystery which surrounds his life. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, this film has exceptional special effects, and is based on a story by renowned science fiction writer Phillip K. Dick."
