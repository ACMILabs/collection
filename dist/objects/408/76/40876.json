        "Episode of Series \"Playing Fair\". Mela has just immigrated from India to Canada and is trying to settle into a new environment. Finding new friends and getting used to new surroundings becomes difficult because Peter and his classmates are determined to make her feel unwelcome and out of place. They jeer at her because her lunch is different and initially Allison goes along with the group, but realises this is unfair. Her decision to stick by Mela and to get to know her better demonstrate that differences in skin colour and country of origin should not be an obstacle to friendship and self-esteem."
