        "A tribute to Godard's seminal \"Ici et Ailleurs\" (Here and Elsewhere), video artist Akram Zaatari's documentary, like its predecessor, critically explores issues of representation within the occupied zone of South Lebanon. Interviews with Lebanese prisoners in Israel illustrate aspects of life under occupation with convincing poignancy. In Arabic with English subtitles."
