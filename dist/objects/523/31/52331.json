        "Set in a German prisoner-of-war camp, \"Stalag 17\" is about a group of American sergeants confined to one barrack, trying to survive wartime restrictions and spartan conditions. Amid the soldiers is one man, Sefton, a canny operator and racketeer who has amassed a case of contraband that enables him to bribe favours, providing him with more comfortable surrounds. When a meticulously planned escape is expertly foiled, the men suspect a traitor within the ranks; soon all suspicions turn to Sefton, whose compassion has been battered out of him after years as a POW, but could he be a Nazi collaborator? Effectively utilising the confines of the barrack as an incendiary setting for pent up frustrations, Wilder successfully explores the mob mentality in a compelling manner; less compelling (at least dramatically) are the humorous moments operating as light relief which stagnate the drama, diluting the well crafted tension. \"Stalag 17\" was one of the first films to convey war with humour - a definite precursor to \"M*A*S*H*\", \"Catch-22\" and the campy outlandishness of \"Hogan's Heroes\". William Holden won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the embittered Sefton - a role he apparently reluctantly played. Cast includes Don Taylor, Otto Preminger, Robert Strauss, Harvey Lembeck, Peter Graves, Richard Erdman, Sig Rumann and Neville Brand."
