        "An intense urban drama, set in Hell's Kitchen and interpreted by many critics as an unofficial sequel to Scorsese's iconic \"Taxi driver\", \"Bringing out the dead\" examines one man's crisis of conscience as he battles the furious demons that occupy his soul and the sullied streets where he works as a paramedic. Set in early 1990s, Scorsese evokes a New York awash with filth, human degradation, violence, drug abuse and amorality. Nicolas Cage puts in an incendiary performance as Frank - a man struggling to locate his compassion amid the overwhelming cruelty that rages around him. His (then wife) Patricia Arquette also puts in a fine performance as Mary Burke, the daughter of a patient Frank has brought in. Mary, a virgin/whore figure who similarly rages at the injustices and inequities of life, may save Frank - as he rescues her from drug addiction. In this redemptive tale Frank inches towards salvation - dragging the ghosts of the unsaved with him. Containing evocative religious (particularly Christian) imagery, scriptwriter Paul Schrader (Taxi driver, Raging bull, The Last temptation of Christ) continues his explorations into urban decay, morality, salvation, humanism, spirituality and violence. Adapted from the novel by Joseph Connolly."
