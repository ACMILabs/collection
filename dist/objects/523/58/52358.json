        "Robert Winston presents this series that looks into what it means to be human: the instincts we have and why we behave the way we do. This episode in the \"Human instinct\" series looks at our sexual instinct, why men and women are drawn to each other to have sex and procreate. It looks at the different qualities men and women seek in a partner's appearance and the role of smell in selecting the right genetic match for future children. Attitudes towards casual sex are also touched on as well as the physical changes that take place when we are attracted to someone. Features interviews with a man who discovered he wasn't the biological father of his children and the actions of a man who wreaked damage when his jealousy was aroused. Long-term couples speak briefly of why their love has endured. Male sexual jealousy is also discussed."
