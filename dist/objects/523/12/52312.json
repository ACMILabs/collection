        "This experimental documentary exhibits the rise of the sublime architecture of shattered shop signs and bricks in war-torn Beirut, creating poignant juxtapositions of progress, beauty and regress. As the filmmaker drives around the ruins of Beirut he documents, amid the chaos and the ruins, signs of life. Toufic films the inmates of the Fanar Mental Hospital; disabled adult men, living in a decrepit institution - a reflection on the forgotten underclass of any society that is torn asunder by war. He then interviews a Lebanese man who is enraged by the injustices that he sees committed around him, identifying himself as a messenger of the prophet Mohammed and Jesus Christ. Finally Toufic ponders the future - what is the destiny of Lebanese children growing up amid conflict; these children display hope and joy as they play, exhibiting innocence. Jalal Toufic is a writer, film theorist, and video artist. This work, \"Credits Included: A Video in Red and Green\" addresses issues of being a refugee, of displaced persons, of homelessness and destruction. In English and Arabic with English subtitles."
