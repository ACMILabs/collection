        "Ep 5: In this episode, Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman discover several new leads which point to the involvement of Leo Johnson and Jacques Renault in Laura's murder. Audrey Horne continues to provide more unexpected assistance to the investigation as she infiltrates the nearby brothel, One-Eyed Jacks, in an effort to impress Agent Cooper. Meanwhile, Donna forms a new bond with James Hurley and Madeline, while Laura's father, Leland Palmer, becomes even more unhinged. Ep 6: Agent Cooper and Big Ed Hurley, James' uncle, go undercover at the casino and brothel, One-Eyed Jacks, unaware of Audrey's similar plans. Meanwhile James Hurley and Donna Hayward, suspicious of Laura's psychiatrist, Dr. Jacoby, decide to lay a trap for him by disguising Madeline as Laura, back from the dead. Ep 7: The final episode of the first season sees the climax of several important plotlines. Donna and James' trap for Dr. Jacoby backfires after he is beaten and has a heart attack. Agent Cooper's undercover infiltration of One-Eyed Jacks leads to a telling encounter with Jacques Renault, who confesses to his activities on the night of Laura's murder. Meanwhile, Leo Johnson sets fire to the mill with his wife inside, unknowing of the plans for his own demise."
