        "Terry Zwigoff followed up the unexpected success of \"Crumb\" (a startlingly heart-felt documentary on American comic book artist Robert Crumb) with \"Ghost world\" an adaptation of the popular comic novel by Daniel Clowes. Addressing the vagaries of suburban dysfunction, two misanthropic best friends graduate from High School, eager to explore new possibilities. Initially this equates to hanging out in dreadful 1950s retro diners, reading the personals and mocking the entire world. For Enid (Thora Birch), her identity is closely bound with aesthetics - her constantly changing outfits reflect her turmoil and eternal dissatisfaction. Becky (Scarlett Johansson), more conventionally pretty and able to attract male attention, has a singular goal - to move out with Enid into their own flat. But Enid, uncertain where her desires lie, defers making decisions, frustrating and isolating Becky. After initially humiliating avid record collector Seymour (Steve Buscemi) Enid is drawn to his eclectic interests and, recognising a kindred spirit, determines to find him a girlfriend. Unrelenting deadpan delivery confirms the melancholic tone of the film but dilutes the emotional content contained within a wry and savvy script. Whilst the characters' physical surrounds are well captured (with some sumptuously shot interiors), the emotional core that drives Enid, and especially Becky is not. Ultimately \"Ghost world\" is a bittersweet comedy about transition and a journey toward the responsibilities, dilemmas and disappointments of adulthood."
