        "Based on the play \"Attila, Konig der Hunnen\" by Zacharias Werner, this made for television production of the opera \"Attila\" by Guiseppe Verdi with libretto by Temistocle Solera was performed at the wonderfully atmospheric Arena di Verona in 1985. Set in 5th century A.D. Italy, in the town of Aquileia, during the barbaric age of Huns and Ostrogoths, this opera tells the tale of invasion and victory, love and betrayal, patriotism and vengeance and the eventual fall of the great babarian, Attila the Hun (Evgeny Nesterenko) at the hands of Ezio (Silvano Carroli), Foresto (Veriano Luchetti) and the love who betrayed him, Odabella (Maria Chiara). Featuring the Orchestra and Chorus of the Arena di Verona conducted by Nello Santi, this is a grand-scale production complimented by an impressive stage setting and design, and a very strong cast of lead singers. Sung in Italian with English subtitles."
