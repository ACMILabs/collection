        "Giacomo Puccini's opera in three acts with libretto by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica is based on the original play written for Sarah Bernhardt by the French playwright Victorien Sardou. \"Tosca\" is a dramatic love story involving the ill-fated painter Mario Cavaradossi (Giacomo Aragall), his love, the singer Floria Tosca (Eva Marton) and the evil Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia (Ingvar Wixell) and set in Rome in 1800. Performed live at the magnificent amphitheatre of Arena di Verona, this made for television production features the Orchestra and Chorus of the Arena di Verona with conductor Daniel Oren and Chorus master Tullio Boni, along with grand scale set designs and period costumes by Fiorenzo Giorgi. Sung in Italian with no English subtitles. Includes booklet with English translation."
