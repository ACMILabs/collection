        "This feature length production of Giacomo Puccini's tragic love drama, \"Tosca\", with libretto by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica and adapted from the original play \"La Tosca\" by Victorien Sardou, is filmed on location at the magnificent Baroque Church of San Andrea, the luxurious apartments at the Palazzo Farnese and the bleak Castel Sant'Angelo, and features passionate performances by the three leading singers - Raina Kabaivanska (Floria Tosca), Placido Domingo (Mario Cavaradossi) and Sherill Milnes (Baron Scarpia). Also features the New Philarmonia Orchestra conducted by Bruno Bartoletti and the Ambrosian Singers as the chorus. Powerful, realistic and intensely dramatic this cinematic version captures the mood and emotions of one of Puccini's most popular works. Sung in Italian with no English subtitles. Credits in Italian. NB: This video print is poor in quality in parts but is worth viewing for its unique presentation."
