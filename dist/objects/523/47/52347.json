        "When Mori, a young Japanese man, is sent by his family to Australia to oversee the funeral of his uncle, Hiroshi, he is thrust into a world of cross-cultural love, grief and misunderstanding. Estranged from Hiroshi for many years, Mori and his family are unaware that he was gay and lived with his Australian lover Ron for decades. As he gets to know his uncle for the first time through videos, photographs, and the stories Ron tells him, Mori must now come to terms with this fresh knowledge and find a way to fulfil his traditional obligations to his family while remaining true to his uncle's spirit. A powerful and poignant film. Winner of Best Australian Short, Melbourne Queer Film Festival 2003. Cast includes Morihiko Hasebe, Ronald Jacobson, Chris Bartlett, Ant Keogh, Rohan Timlock, Takuji Hasebe, Yukio Kimura."
