        "This film is a result of Wenders' enthusiasm for Patricia Highsmith's novels and also of his fascination with America which preoccupied him until his return to Berlin to make \"Wings of desire\". The plot, concerning forgery rackets, remains subsidiary to mood. Amidst moving trains and changing landscapes the new world of the American gangster invades the Germany of the dying artisan Ganz. Wenders said that he equates American film directors with gangsters and here cast directors Hopper, Nick Ray and Sam Fuller as the art racketeers."
