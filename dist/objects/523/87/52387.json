        "Intermezzo by Richard Strauss is an autobiographical opera based on the real life relationship between Richard Strauss and his wife Pauline using the characters Robert and Christine Storch. Set in the 1920s, the central plot involves an innocent flirtation by the lonely and bored Christine (Felicity Lott) with the charming, but penniless, Baron Lummer (Ian Caley) whilst her composer husband Robert (John Pringle) is away on an official visit to Vienna. However life becomes complicated when an unexpected letter is delivered to Christine, the contents of which lead her to suspect her husband of having an illicit affair. This is an opera of comedy and wit with a blend of talking and singing, told in 14 scenes with symphonic interludes. Costume and set designs are lavish and stylish and very art nouveau authentically recreating the era and atmosphere of the times. Features the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Gustav Kuhn and supporting cast including Elizabeth Gale in the role of Anna, the chambermaid."
