        "This unsettling and at times disturbing film deals with the unpalatable and violent practice of illegal cockfighting in France. But director Claire Denis (Chocolat, Good work, Nenette and Boni) looks further into the motives and reasons behind those who indulge in this rather nasty past-time and in doing so has produced a film with soul and depth, exploring the complexities of human nature. The story revolves around the two main characters of Dah (Isaach de Bankole), an African immigrant and Jocelyn (Alex Descas), a West Indian, who team up in a partnership to train and supply fighting cocks for the rather unsavoury bar-owner Pierre Ardennes (Jean-Claude Brialy) whose soul aim is to make big money through holding cockfights in the basement of his saloon. Add to this fray, Toni (Solveig Dommartin), Ardennes' mistress who becomes involved with Dah, Jocelyn's obsession with the cocks, and money - everyone wanting more of it - and things begin to escalate. Harsh, bleak and realistic portrayal by an exceptional cast, with excellent directing by Denis, and confronting and extraordinary visuals by cinematographer Pascal Marti. NB: WARNING - Includes several graphic scenes of cockfighting and handling. In French with English subtitles."
