        "Giuseppe Verdi's \"I Lombardi\" with libretto by Temistocle Solera, was first performed at La Scala in 1843. This made for television production, also performed at Teatro alla Scala in Milan, features the Orchestra and Chorus of La Scala conducted by Gianandrea Gavazzeni and a wonderful cast of lead singers including Jose Carreras (Oronte), Ghena Dimitrova (Giselda), Silvano Carroli (Pagano) and Carlo Bini (Arvino). The story takes place during the time of the first Crusade in 1099 A.D. in the settings of Milan, Antioch and the country near Jerusalem. Giovanni Agostinucci's stage sets are many and varied, adding depth and substance to the production of this medieval story of Crusaders, knights and soldiers, and damsels in distress. A spectacular presentation visually, excellent support cast and an outstanding solo violin performance by Franco Fantini. Sung in Italian with no subtitles. Booklet included."
