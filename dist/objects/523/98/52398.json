        "This made for television production of the comic opera \"Don Pasquale\" by Gaettano Donizetti features The Welsh Philharmonia led by John Stein and conducted by Richard Armstrong and The Welsh National Opera Chorale led by associate conductor Anthony Hose with music direction by Norman Kay. It tells the tale of Don Pasquale (Geraint Evans), an elderly and wealthy bachelor who is desperate to marry, whilst however, his nephew and sole heir, Ernesto (Ryland Davies), refuses to marry the woman assigned to him by Pasquale because Ernesto is in love with another woman, Norina (Lillian Watson). As a result, Pasquale disowns Ernesto. With the help of Ernesto's friend, Dottora Malatesta (Russell Smythe), an elaborate scheme is prepared in which Norina marries Don Pasquale and drives him so crazy as to allow her to marry Ernesto instead. Delightful costuming and set designs in beautiful pastel colors along with the magical voices of the lead singers, make this entertaining and light-hearted production a must for lovers of opera. Sung in Italian with English subtitles."
