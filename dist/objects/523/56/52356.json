        "Sequel to \"Wings of desire\" sees a continuing exploration of the themes of mortality, spirituality, personal responsibility and forgiveness for director Wim Wenders. Cassiel is a melancholic angel who becomes human when he impulsively swoops to save a young child's life. Upon this deed he earns the wrath of Emit Flesti, the angel overseer who decides to meddle with Cassiel's new life. There is also the continuing story of Damiel - the angel who chose to be human for love in the original film - now a short-order cook and happily married, Damiel seeks to guide Cassiel through the labyrinthine ways of the world. Another angel Raphaela seeks to temper Emit's wrath and aid Cassiel's journey. This sequel, filmed in Berlin, contains some stunning cinematography and set pieces - angels atop iconic structures, observing and sympathetically listening to the ails of the human hearts that they seek to assuage. Wenders' film falters with a subplot involving arms dealers and a pornographic distribution ring, run by corrupt businessmen exploiting the newly established entry into the East. In German and English with English subtitles."
