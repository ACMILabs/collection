        "Based on the true story of Theirry Paulin who, with his male lover, murdered over twenty elderly women in the 1980s, \"I can't sleep\" is a serial killer movie that avoids cliches of the genre, preferring fresh insights via its allusive Parisian protagonists. Daiga is an aspiring Lithuanian actress, who arrives in Paris expecting work but finds few opportunities open to her; Theo is a musician and carpenter from Martinique, estranged from the French mother of his young child, who longs to return to his family and homeland; Camille, his brother, is a beautiful drag queen and part time prostitute, joylessly making his way in the gay scene. Around these dynamics unfurls a series of heartless murders of elderly women. Characters grapple with urban dislocation and social isolation whilst recognising their enduring status as outsiders and limited possibilities. Whilst Denis may have intended to draw links between society's treatment of those operating outside of the mainstream (immigrants, transvestites, homosexuals) and the consequences of intolerance for difference, generally this film raised the ire of viewers, many of whom interpreted these thematic links with murder as homophobic and racist. Cast includes Yekaterina Golubeva, Richard Courcet, Line Renaud, Beatrice Dalle and Alex Descas. In French with English subtitles."
