        "Experimental in its format, \"This is not Beirut\" is a wonderful documentary comprising of an eclectic mix of film footage from Hi-8, VHS and \"found\" film material shot and collected in Lebanon during 1992. Filmmaker Jayce Salloum took on the challenge of selecting from over 200 hours of film footage to produce a unique and intriguing piece of film journalism which focuses mainly on Beirut, a city sometimes called the \"City of eternity\", \"Jewel of the Levant\", or \"Window on the West\" or conversely the \"City in crisis\", \"City of fear\", or \"Improbable city\". By putting together a montage of these images Salloum provides an insight into Beirut and Lebanon, the constant reconstruction, structually and mentally, from years of bombings, kidnappings, killings, internal warfare, terrorists, resistance movements, and Israeli aggression and invasion. Enhancing this constantly changing stream of images is a soundtrack of interviews, conversations and commentary, television and radio broadcasts, street noises, music and even the occasional silent piece of footage. Salloum attempts to represent Lebanon and the Lebanese people as they see themselves and not necessarily as the West sees them, a concept which proves to be more difficult and problematical than expected. Historically interesting and a most enlightening documentary."
