        "This experimental film without dialogue makes innovative use of sound to tell the story of a shepherd who, having lost his wife, children and cattle after his homeland is stricken by drought, goes to the city to find work. Through a poetic association of images the film critiques the dehumanising effects on the Sudanese people of the Sharia ruled government that was in power in the early eighties."
