        "Inspired by a true story and based on David Henry Hwang's award-winning stage play, this film version by David Cronenberg (Naked lunch, Dead ringers) does not quite live up to expectations even though Hwang has written the screenplay. Set in Beijing, in 1964, the story revolves around married French diplomat Rene Gallimard and his obsessive love affair with Beijing Opera star Song Liling who first entranced Gallimard with her performance as Madama Butterfly. As Gallimard becomes more deeply involved with the secretive and allusive Song Liling, life begins to take an unexpected turn - one that involves intrigue, espionage, and betrayal. Starring Jeremy Irons, John Lone, Barbara Sukowa, Annabel Leventon, Shizuko Hoshi, Ian Richardson."
