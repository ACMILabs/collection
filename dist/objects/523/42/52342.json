        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Alexandria Trilogy\". This unusual and fascinating follow-up to \"Alexandria, why?\" picks up the story of Yehia, the troubled adolescent boy headed for prosperity in America as WWII ravaged his Egyptian homeland. Yehia, now a draconian film director who neglects his wife and children in order to create his work, falls ill and requires open-heart surgery. During the operation a young boy, representing Yehia's conscience, accuses him of betraying his ideals. A metamorphic trial ensues in which various witnesses, including family and colleagues, offer their testimony about \"the defendant\". These proceedings force the filmmaker to come to terms with hidden emotions involving his life, work and country. Chahine's work examines the politics of the 1952 revolution and its demise in 1967, as well as the frissons that arise as he tries to reconcile his art with his ambitions. This film recalls \"Eight and a half\" and \"All that jazz\" in that it examines one man's conscience and history, in a humoristic, satirical and at times, surrealistic, manner. This sequel was followed up by \"Alexandria again and forever\". In Arabic with English subtitles."
