        "Dedicated to the Executive Producer of 'Jenin' Iyad Samoudi who was murdered at Alyamoun at the end of the filming by Israeli soldiers on 23/6/2000. Mohammad Bakri A film of despair, human tragedy, hatred, cynicism and last but not least, of hope. This is the story of the 8 day bombardment by the Israeli Defence Forces of the autonomous Palestinian refugee camp in Jenin (Palestine) during April 2000. The camp itself was just about razed to the ground by fighter planes, tanks, missiles, and bull-dozers and all that remained at the time of filming were piles of rubble, half-demolished houses and thousands of homeless Palestinians. Many civilians including children, women and the elderly lost their lives. The older population in Jenin feel lost and defeated, betrayed by the Arab nations and the West, but at the same time they are looking to the younger generation to maintain the resistance and keep fighting for the future of all Palestinians and a free Palestinian State. Through interviews and personal stories from many of the refugees, from the young to the old, Palestinian actor/director Mohammad Bakri presents an intimate portrayal of the extent to which the prolonged oppression and terror has affected the Jenin refugees. Contains graphic archival footage (some in b&w) of the invasion and the aftermath of disaster and destruction. The film was banned in Israel for its propensity to engage in propaganda. In Arabic with English subtitles."
