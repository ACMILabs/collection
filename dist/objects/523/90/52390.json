        "This production of Giuseppe Verdi's \"Il Trovatore\" with Libretto by Salvatore Cammarano, in four acts, was performed at the magnificent outdoor theatre, the Arena di Verona in 1985. Set in the environs of Zaragoza, the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon, and in the mountains of Biscay, around 1412, the story consists of three intertwining sub-plots - war, love and revenge. Dramatic and stirring \"Il Trovatore\" features an excellent lead cast in singers Giorgio Zancanaro (Count Di Luna), Rosalind Plowright (Leonora), Fiorenza Cossotto (Azucena) and Franco Bonisolli (Manrico) supported by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Arena di Verona, chorus master Tullio Boni, conductor Reynald Giovaninetti. A Verdi masterpiece. Sung in Italian with English subtitles."
