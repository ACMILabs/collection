        "Clayton Jacobson graduated from Swinburne Film and Television School in 1984 and has subsequently directed numerous music videos, television advertisements and award-winning short films. 'Environmental': A man is threatened by a masked bandit who breaks into his home. But instead of cleaning the house out, this thief cleans it up! A story about environmental awareness, an obsessively green bandit and a man's conversion from litter dropper to neat freak. 'The Pin Drop': A film without words, this darkly gruesome bloody tale of murder is beautifully filmed in atmospheric black and white. 'Tickler': A couple debate the size, shape and purchase of a vibrator as they sit in a car outside a sex shop in this funny engaging film. 'Tanaka' When a young Japanese man is sent by his family to Australia to oversee his uncle's funeral, he is thrust into a world of cross-cultural love, grief and misunderstanding. 'I Love U': The silent world of deaf lovers is shattered by obsession, denial and a recurring dream of betrayal. Cast: Kym Gygnell, Rhys Muldoon (Environmental)--Ronald Jacobson, Raylene Gordon (The Pin Drop)--Clayton Jacobson, Chris Bartlett (Tickler)--Morihiko Hasebe, Ronald Jacobson, Chris Bartlett, Ant Keogh (Tanaka)--Fiona Crisp, Ross Onley-Zerkel, Richard Neville (I Love U). 'Tanaka' is also available separately on VHS."
