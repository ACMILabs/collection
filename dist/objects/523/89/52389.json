        "Gioachino Rossini's opera in two acts with libretto by Jacopo Ferretti, critical edition by Alberto Zeddo. Rossini's version of Cinderella was first performed in Rome in 1817. However there is a twist to the original fairy tale - Ferretti's libretto maintains the human relationships but without the magic of the pantomime fairy tale, and the \"lost slipper\" becomes a bracelet given by Cinderella to the Prince. The costumes, stage-setting and design are dominated by tones of sepia and gold, like an old-fashioned story book. The leading role of Cenerentola is sung by Kathleen Kuhlmann, with support performances by Marta Taddei (Clarinda) and Laura Zannini (Tisbe) as the two step-sisters, Claudio Desderi as their father Don Magnifico, Laurence Dale as Prince Ramino, Alberto Rinaldi as the valet and Roderick Kennedy as Alidoro. Features the London Philharmonic Orchestra lead by David Nolan, conducted by Donato Renzetti and the Glyndebourne Chorus directed by Jane Glover. This stage production was produced for television as part of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera series. Sung in Italian with English intertitles."
