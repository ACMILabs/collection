        "On their anniversary of 5 years together, Frannie (Teri Garr) walks out on Hank (Frederic Forrest). They are portrayed as unhappy, uncommunicative and finding fault with one another. Thus begins 48 hours in the lives of a recently separated couple. Both seek solace and answers in best friends Maggie (Lainie Kazan) and Moe (Harry Dean Stanton) then swiftly begin fledgling relationships with other people. Frannie with pianist and singer Ray (Raul Julia) - Hank with circus performer Leila (Nastassja Kinski). Not known for dabbling in romance or musicals, Coppola has managed to fashion a film about relationships, their deterioration, and our inability to change others with pathos and plenty of colour, music, dance and spectacle provided by the Las Vegas inspired sound stage. Songs and music by Tom Waits."
