        "This film departs from the conventions of the artist's biopic more radically than the Van Gogh films 'Lust for Life' (1956) or 'Vincent and Theo' (1990). Pialat makes no attempt to 'explain' Van Gogh's creative genius or illuminate the dark side of his psyche. Rather he uses an accumulation of naturalistic detail to present an emotionally restrained account of the last three months of Vincent's life. He is shown to be irrationally resentful of Theo's failure to sell his paintings and his moods swing erratically between introspection and frustrated anger. Dutrone's inwardness contrasts with Douglas's expressionism (in Lust for Life). Pialat introduces a fictional relationship between Vincent and Dr. Gachet's daughter in order to show Vincent 'as a man like any other.' Compared to the portrayal in 'Vincent and Theo' Gachet is shown in a positive light. Cast: Jacques Dutronc, Alexandra London, Gerard Sety, Bernard le Coq. In French with English subtitles."
