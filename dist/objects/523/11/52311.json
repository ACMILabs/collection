        "Filmmaker and video artist Akram Zaatari was born in Saida, Lebanon in 1966 and currently lives in Beirut. His art practice also includes photography, installation, critical writing and curating. \"Teach me\": By constructing new meaning out of recycled TV news footage, the filmmaker creates a thought-provoking statement against violence. \"Countdown\" This personal reflection on film and TV mixes footage of real-life war and reel entertainment. Zaatari explores our sense of real-time transmission and movement through space as we experience them in televised images of breaking news. \"Gift\" looks at Lebanon's summertime beach boys. One boy begs the filmmaker to let him join the soccer players on the beach so he can be on TV. \"Reflections\": Memories and images of childhood are reflected both on the screen and in the small mirror that a young boy plays with. \"A family portrait\" is a profile of a young, modern Lebanese family who are having their family photos taken. This multi-layered work examines the differences and similarities between real life and the synthetic world of TV and film. In Arabic with English subtitles."
