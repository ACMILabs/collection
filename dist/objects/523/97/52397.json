        "This beautiful rendition of \"Manon\" was choreographed and produced by Kenneth MacMillan to the music of Jules Massenet, orchestrated and arranged by Leighton Lucas with the collaboration of Hilda Gaunt and performed by The Royal Ballet (directed by Norman Morrice) at the Royal Opera House, Covent Gardens. Set in 18th century Paris, \"Manon\" is a tale of mismatched love, manipulation, betrayal, abandonment and death, with Jennifer Penney dancing the role of the beautiful, but amoral, Manon, and Anthony Dowell in the role of Des Grieux, Manon's besotted lover with David Wall as Lescaut, Manon's manipulative cousin. Also features dancers Derek Rencher (Monsieur G.M.), Monica Mason (Lescaut's mistress), David Drew, Gerd Larsen, David Peden, Leslie Edwards and music by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House conducted by Ashley Lawrence. Made for television in association with the British Broadcasting Corporation."
