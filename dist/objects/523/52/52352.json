        "Ken Loach (Sweet sixteen, Bread and roses, My name is Joe) continues his exploration of the plight of the working class, this time addressing the trials of those struggling with the bureaucratic machinations during the privatisation of public utilities in Britain in the mid-1990s. John, Mick, Paul, Jim and Kerry are workers employed by Brit Rail; when BR is privatised the men find themselves being lured by offers of voluntary redundancy (for large cash sums). Then, working for a private company, and sub-contractors, they are virtually without rights in the workplace, increasingly subject to unstable employment conditions, and despite the overtures of management, are subjected to progressively unsafe workplace practices. Loach explores their private lives, which range from happily married to disgruntled fathers separated from their children, as a way of highlighting the additional burden on families of economic rationalism. Given the subject matter the tone of the film is light and satirical; Loach mines the topic for laughs but never at the expense of keeping his protagonists or their situations, believable, producing an entertaining but at the same time scathing work. Deleted scenes provide some interesting back-stories to the main themes, but also highlight Loach's skill in keeping the story focused and tight. Script written by ex-British Rail employee Rob Dawber. Cast includes Dean Andrews, Tom Craig, Joe Duttine, Steve Huison and Venn Tracey."
