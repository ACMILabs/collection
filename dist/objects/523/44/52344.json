    "description": [
        "Tasmanian landscape photographers Olegas Truchanas and Peter Dombrovskis had much in common. Born 22 years apart both came from Baltic Europe and migrated to Tasmania, where they developed a passion for visiting and photographing the island's remote, wild places. Both men died before their time in the wilderness doing what they loved, and left a legacy of stunning landscape and nature photography which became synonymous with campaigns to protect Tasmania's natural heritage. They believed that if people could see the beauty of Australia's wild places then they might be moved to save them. Through the sixties and seventies Truchanas raised public awareness about the beauty and uniqueness of the Tasmanian wilderness, and the threat to it posed by the Tasmanian government's massive hydro-electric schemes, through his now legendary slide presentations. After his death his work was carried on by Dombrovskis who published his images in calendars and allowed them to be used freely in the successful campaign to save the Franklin River from hydro-electric development. Combining interviews and archival footage with over 300 photographs by Truchanas and Dombrowskis, 'Wildness' is an accomplished tribute to the two men's invaluable contribution to both visual culture and environmental awareness in Australia. Narrated by Nina Landis. Teachers notes are available from the Film Australia website. [www.filmaust.com.au]"
