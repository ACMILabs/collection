        "Personal documentary essay on the city of Cairo by renowned Egyptian filmmaker Youssef Chahine. Director of over forty films, Chahine is renowned for his diverse styles and often controversial subject matter. \"Cairo as told by Youssef Chahine\" began as a commission by French TV for the news series Envoye Special. Using his unique sense of artistic digression, Chahine begins the film by poking fun at conventional travelogue imagery of Cairo, before going on to explore, from a deeply personal perspective, the contemporary political, religious and social life of the city he loves. The film was banned in Egypt for showing too much dirt."
