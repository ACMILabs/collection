        "Set in British colonised Egypt during the 1930s and adapted from the novel of the same name by Abdel Rahman Al-Sharqawi, director Youssef Chahine (An Egyptian story, Alexandria trilogy, Cairo station) spent eight years in the making of this classic film about the struggles and division of a small peasant village in their battle with Cairo-based bureaucracy and government. Living under harsh conditions, the villagers find themselves fighting each other over water irrigation rights that have been cut by half by the government. But more threatening to the farming community than losing their water rights are the plans of a wealthy local landowner intent on building himself a palatial home with modern roads cutting right through the villagers' land. Just what will it take to unite the village community? A contemplative film of rural life, customs and rituals, political oppression, family, marriage and relationships, and a rich array of characters who provide the film with a level of depth, humour and sensitivity. Cast includes Yehia Chahine, Ezzat El-Alaili, Ali El-Scherif, Mahmoud El-Meliguy, Imad Hamdi, Nagwa Ibrahim. Nominated for the Golden Palm Award at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival and also named as the best Egyptian film ever made in a recent poll of Egyptian film critics. In Arabic with English subtitles. NB: Images and sound of variable quality."
