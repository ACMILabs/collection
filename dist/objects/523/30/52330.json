        "Based on her popular \"Saturday night live\" character Mary Katherine Gallagher, Molly Shannon stars in this feature length, musical, romantic, film homage. Mary lives with her grandmother and ever since she was a child has dreamed of having a \"proper\" kiss and believes becoming a superstar will make this possible. It's a hard task however, as Mary is the brunt of many jokes at school, especially by the bitchiest blonde at Saint Monica's, Evian (Elaine Hendrix), who is dating Mary's object of affection, Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell). Mary has a good pool of resources at her disposal however for transformation, she is the rewind girl at the video store and her parents were professional step-dancing champions. When the school has a talent contest to promote the fight against venereal disease, Mary has the opportunity she has dreamt of by competing for the joy of winning, and the prize of going to Hollywood (to play an extra). This charming film is a fantasy world of boys, dance, kissing, monologues from made for television films, as well as numerous film references. There is a fine supporting cast too in Mary's special-ed class mates the wire mouthed strongwoman Helen (Emmy Laybourne), silent new boy in town Slater (Harland Williams), and Mary's grandmother (Glynis Johns)."
