        "Fifteen-year-old Alex has always adored Brenda, who has helped his mother around the house for years, but she hardly notices him. When his mother asks Brenda to go on their annual beach holiday to help her out, Alex thinks his chance has come to impress her. But, as usual, it is his older brother Michael who gets the girl. Alex thinks he will never be happy again - until he meets Margaret and his adolescent fantasies come true."
