        "This is a 50's home movie style portrait of a fictional 19 year old, undiscovered jazz starlet, called Della Ray ( Kate Cebrano).Though recently shot, the film masquerades convincingly as found footage of a 50's jazz club and its inhabitants. It begins with a roller coaster jam session featuring unknown local musicians of 1958, and ends with an impromptu number by the delightful Delia herself, who \"died\" in the tradition of thejazz greats, shortly after the footage was shot. Features excellent original 50's jazz numbers."
