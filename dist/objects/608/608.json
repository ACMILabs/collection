        "In 1788 the first white settlers arrived in Botany Bay to begin the process of white colonisation of Australia. In this light-hearted film the roles are reversed, imagining what it would be like if black settlers arrived to settle a continent inhabited by white natives."

    "description": [
        "'BabaKiueria' takes a satirical look at black-white relations in late twentieth century Australia, with a comic depiction of a racial role reversal. In documentary (or 'mockumentary') style, the film's presenter investigates white lives in the fictitious land of 'BabaKiueria' ('Barbeque Area'), where white people are a minority, living under black laws and suffering from discriminatory practices and attitudes held by the black majority. Written by Geoffrey Atherden ('Mother and Son', 'Grass Roots'), the film was awarded a United Nations Media Peace Prize in 1987. Stars Michelle Torres, Bob Maza, Kevin Smith, Cecily Polson, Tony Barry."
