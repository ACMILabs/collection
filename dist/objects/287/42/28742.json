        "The River Amazon rises in the Andes in Peru not far from the Pacific Ocean and continues for some 4000 miles to the Atlantic Coast in Brazil. The film traces its beginning from the melting snows of the Andes down to the plane country and finally the thick tropical jungle. At Equitos where the river becomes navigable to craft other than canoes the produce of the jungle is brought for transport to the world markets."
