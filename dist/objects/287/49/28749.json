        "Although the people of North and South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos are similar, there are differences in human use of the land. The rugged terrain of Laos is less productive than Cambodia's fertile plain. The North Vietnamese have developed more industry than their South Vietnamese neighbours, although both countries are similar geographically."
