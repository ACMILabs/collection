Depicts the Trans-Amazon highway across Brazil, a new steel mill on the Orinoco River, a university in Quito, a peaceful political rally in Santiago, the oldest airline in the Western Hemisphere, a strife-filled street demonstration, old paintings and modern graphics. Features three traditional institutions: the hacienda, the church and the military."
