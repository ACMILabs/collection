        "Mike Hoover as the climber portrays the efforts and exhilarations that are experienced by the solo mountain climber. Filmed in Mexico, the United States and Canada on 21 different climbs this story explores the pleasures and dangers of mountain climbing by presenting three aspects of climbing of which the non-climber is rarely aware. These are the driving rhythm of sustained physical effort, the discovery of scenes and weathers unknown to others and the commitment to challenges which must be met alone."
