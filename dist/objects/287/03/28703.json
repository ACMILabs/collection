        "Episode of Series \"Path of the Paddle\". This film explains clearly how to locate a deep water channel by reading the rapids and how to apply the many paddling strokes and manoeuvres to steer the canoe where you want it to go. It also depicts what happens if you make a mistake and \"wipe out\" in a turbulent rapid, and how to survive the swim. (Award: Venissieux.)"
