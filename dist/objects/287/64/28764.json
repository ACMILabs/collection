        "A geographical survey of the Soviet Union pointing out the diversity in land forms, climate and human activities. Four zones show the main differences in climate and soil - the northernmost belt or tundra region, the forest belt; the Black Earth Area; and the steppe lands. Industries range from hunting, trapping and lumbering to collective farming, mining and manufacturing. Great efforts are being made to utilise the countries natural resources especially for use in the manufacture of steel and in heavy industry."
