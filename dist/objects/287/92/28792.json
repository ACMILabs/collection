        "Focuses on the work of Danish inventor Karl Kroyer. His 200-odd patents have made him a millionaire many times over. Kroyer's carefully planned and controlled processes of thought allow him to continue to tackle a dazzling and diverse range of problems. Some of his inventions include: the non-stick frying-pan, glass roads, paper made without water, and new methods for raising sunken ships."
