        "A dramatic portrayal of a not infrequent rural problem: the tendency of farmers' sons to leave the land in favour of other employment. The serene pastoral countryside of southern Ontario provides the story background. Howard, an only son, has grown to manhood under his father's domination, working for a weekly pittance that offers no independence. His resentment finally threatens a complete break from the farm. A legal partnership agreement between father and son provides an amicable solution. (Award: Toronto.)"
