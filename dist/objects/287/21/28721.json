        "Outdoorsman Bill Mason takes his wife and two children on a wilderness canoe camping holiday. In this film the art of canoeing is more than technical expertise; it becomes a family experience of shared joy. Along the way there are countless adventures and much lovely scenery, including the Indian rock carvings of Lake Superior"
