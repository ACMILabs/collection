        "Demonstrates the four basic elements of which all art is composed: line, colour, shape and texture. Natural forms are dissolved into famous works of art. Water-lilies become part of a Manet painting, and swimming trout become part of an ancient Chinese scroll. Paintings by mature artists and paintings by children show that no two artists see the same world in the same way. Paintings photographed at St Louis City Art Museum."
