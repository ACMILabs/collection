        "Soya beans, one of the oldest crops of man, are still a major product today. Illinois, USA, with its rich soil, gives the highest yield in the world. We follow a crop from the ploughing, harrowing and sowing in April to the harvest in autumn. The beans are used for margarine, cooking fats and oils; the residue, being high in protein, is ideal for animal feed."
