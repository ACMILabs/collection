        "An American and a British soldier meet by chance and very soon begin to argue about the relative merits, especially the \"toughness\" of British rugger and American gridiron football. Each man then takes part in the game played by the other man's fellow-countrymen, and from this experiment both of them barely escape alive. Presented in a humorous fashion."
