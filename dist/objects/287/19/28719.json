        "A portrait of life in a capital city. the noise of a crowd swarming around a city hotel is offset by the cooing of pigeons in the bird market; the mute dialogues in the parks, the clamour of the flea circus; the traffic jams, the whistle of the policeman which hypnotises the mannequins in a shop window; the cries of the street urchins; the music of the city. Without commentary."
