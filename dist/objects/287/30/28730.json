        "Her daughter had just been born and Lyn Helton was still 19 years old when whe learned that she had a fatal type of cancer. In whatever time she had left, Lyn was determined to write a book of hope to be left to the world. Most of all it would be a way to communicate with her daughter who some day would want to know the mother she couldn't remember. The soundtrack of the film consists of excerpts from Lyn's unfinished book."
