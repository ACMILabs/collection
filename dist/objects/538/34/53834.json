        "Compilation of classic Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes cartoons featuring Bugs and Daffy going on the road as two travelling salesmen for Rambling House Publishing Co. Sultan Yosemite Sam is their number one client, and Sam's royal heir, the Crown Prince of Abadaba, demands constant storytelling, or tantrums ensue. Bugs is held captive reading aloud from the book he is selling. So Bugs retells several children's classics in his own irreverent style. Voice characterisations by Mel Blanc."
