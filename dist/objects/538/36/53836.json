        "John Hargreaves stars as Martin Stang, a character based on a real-life bank robber and conman, in this Australian \"crime caper\" film. Martin attempts to ease the burden of his time in a New South Wales jail by pretending to be blind. While he succeeds in fooling the authorities into giving him special treatment, unexpected complications arise when Martin meets Sarah, (Judy Davis) the wife of a local lay preacher, and becomes emotionally involved. The stellar Australian cast also includes Wendy Hughes, Colin Friels, Max Cullen, Michael Caton and Geoffrey Rush in his first film role. Judy Davis won the 1981 AFI Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance."
