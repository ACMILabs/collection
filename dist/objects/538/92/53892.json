        "This film deals with the need for unification of rail gauges in Australia by showing just what the breaks in gauge at the States' borders mean to the people who have to ship their goods interstate; particularly primary producers. It also makes a very lively plea for unification, treating its subject humanly, stressing the vital importance of rail transportation in a continent of such vast distances as Australia."
