    ], 
    "description": [
        "Published in 1908, Jeannie Gunn's autobiographical novel, \"We of the Never Never\", chronicled the tough life she and her husband Aeneas shared while managing one of Australia's largest cattle stations, Elsie Station on the remote Roper River in the Northern Territory. Adapted from this classic Australian novel, the film tells the story of how Jeannie adapts to the harsh and isolated station life, how she wins acceptance from the station's disapproving stockmen and how she learns from and befriends some of the indigenous Australians she encounters there. Cast includes Angela Punch-McGregor and Arthur Dignam. Music composed by Peter Best (Awards: AFI Award 1982 Gary Hansen for cinematography.)."
