        "Diary of Brian Gordon. Brian Gordon and his younger brother Michael, Sydneysiders, embark on a trip to rural New South Wales. Taken by the peace and lifestyle of the farming districts, both regret their imminent return to the city. But as luck would have it, Brian meets and falls in love with an orphaned country girl, Marian. Fortunately Brian is able to arrange a Rural Bank of New South Wales loan to assist himself and the cash-strapped Marian save her farm. A patriotic and heroic view of the idealised bush of a by-gone era. NB: A promotional film for the Rural Bank of New South Wales."
