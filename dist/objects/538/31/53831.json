        "While vacationing in Las Vegas with his mother, a wealthy Nevada rancher meets a ballet dancer who brings him luck at the roulette wheel. Shot on location in the renowned Sands Hotel, the film captures the glitz and glamour of the neon-lit gamblers' paradise in its martini-era prime and features numerous cameo appearances by famous actors and Las Vegas entertainers including Frank Sinatra, Paul Henreid, Lena Horne, Frankie Laine and Peter Lorre. A song and dance highlight, featuring Cyd Charisse, is the thirteen minute bop parody of the ballad 'Frankie and Johnny' with special lyrics by Sammy Cahn sung by Sammy Davis Jr. Other songs include 'The Gal With The Yaller Shoes', 'If You Can't Dream', 'My Lucky Charm', 'Hell Hath No Fury', 'I Refuse To Rock 'N Roll'"
