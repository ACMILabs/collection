        "Coming of age story starring a young Dean Stockwell, 'The Green Years' traces the formative years of an Irish boy sent to live with his draconian maternal Scottish grandparents. A reclusive, introspective child, Robert forms an attachment to his roguish great-grandfather, who draws the youngster out of his shell with his raucous ways. The film follows Robert into adulthood where he yearns for a career in the sciences, but is thwarted by lack of financial resources; he also falls in love. A sentimental drama, 'The Green Years' draws on Scottish and Irish culture as a backdrop to its central narrative quandaries. Cast also includes Charles Coburn, Tom Drake, Beverley Tyler, Hume Cronyn, Gladys Cooper, Jessica Tandy. Based on the novel by A.J. Cronin."
