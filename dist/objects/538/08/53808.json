        "Being Me is an ABC health series for students in middle to upper primary school years, that \"encourages kids to know themselves, like themselves and be themselves\" (ABC). The eight twenty minute episodes are made in a style designed to engage children, with the use of vibrant colour and sound, numerous dramatisations, short comic skits featuring the superhero \"Bounce Back Man\", recurring \"Kid's News\" segments, and group discussions amongst school children. Presenter Alex Shepherd ties together and summarises the themes and strategies explored in each program. Episode 1 \"Identity\" looks at issues of individual identity, including how it is constructed and expressed; Episode 2 \"Happy to Be Me\" deals with self esteem. Episode 3 \"Belonging\" explores the dynamics of group affiliations and interactions; Episode 4 \"Making Friends\" investigates why and how we make friends; Episode 5 \"Keeping Friends\" examines how friendship is maintained in the face of everyday challenges such as arguments. Episode 6 \"Power and Responsibility\" delves into issues of responsibility and power in relationships, and examines the affects of bullying and other abuses of that power. Episode 7 \"Changes\" considers change as a normal and ongoing, if challenging, part of life; Episode 8 \"Taking Risks\" analyses how taking risks can be a necessary part of growing, and looks at how to assess and mitigate risks."
