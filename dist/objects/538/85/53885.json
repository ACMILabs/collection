        "This film was made in honour of the Queen Mother's visit to Melbourne on March 3rd, 1958. A performance for the Queen Mother, by the school children of Victoria, was staged at the Melbourne Cricket Ground with items arranged by the Physical Education Department and accompanied by the RAAF Band. Family and friends were gathered in the stands of the MCG to watch and cheer on the children. At the end of the performance, the Queen Mother toured in an open car around the MCG."
