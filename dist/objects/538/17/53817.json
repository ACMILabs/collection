        "At the Japanese Kwannon festival people pray for happiness. A young boy is told by a mysterious voice to grasp happiness with his own hands and through his kindness to others he receives fine things - starting with a rice straw, he achieves his wish through perseverance and compassion for others. This is a warm story with delightful puppet animation."
