        "A teacher is a person skilled in the ways of imparting knowledge to their pupils, and at the Burwood Teachers' College, we see students developing these skills. Many of them live in comfortable hostels where they are made to feel at home in a bright atmosphere. The happy relationship between lecturers and students is evident. A number of students are assisted by bursaries, and all receive a regular allowance. Debates on current affairs, discussion and drama groups, woodwork, sewing and other media, and sports of all kinds are valuable supplements to the normal course of lectures. The students are taught to think clearly and to express themselves confidently. Observation and teaching in schools are important practical aspects of training the students to uderstand children and to maintain discipline. Visits to provincial colleges, meeting future colleagues, preparing assignments, the ratings for their certificates, the final graduation ceremony and the appointments to their first schools are other features of this film produced by the Visual Education Centre."
