        "The second Tarzan film starring Johnny Weissmuller who succeeded Elmo Lincoln (the 'silent' Tarzan) as the King of the Apes finds him settled with the Englishwoman Jane in their jungle domain until disturbed by two white hunters from Mayfair (one a former beau of Jane's) in search of ivory. The thirties MGM series, of which Tarzan and His Mate is widely considered to be the best, had above average production values (set designer Cedric Gibbons is credited here as co-director) with well staged action in the studio jungle. Pre-dating the stiffening of the industry censorship code in the thirties, Tarzan and His Mate is considerably less coy about sexuality than the later entrants in the series. Cast also includes Maureen O'Sullivan, Neil Hamilton, Paul Cavanagh, Forrester Harvey, Nathan Curry."
