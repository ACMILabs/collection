Years later he finds himself re-united with his childhood love Kitty and back in the \"civilization\" of Colonial India which he finds far less civilized then his jungle haunts. The search for a lost treasure shows who the truly civilized members of society are. Cast includes Jason Scott Lee, Cary Elwes, Lena Headey, Sam Neill, John Cleese, Jason Flemyng."
