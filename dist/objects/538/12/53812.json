        "A musical set in New York in the 1890s in which a playboy seeks redemption in the arms of a mission girl. This is the pretext for transforming Astaire's past decadence into present zaniness and Vera-Ellen's primness into sauciness. Despite the suggestion of fairytale fantasy - lovers truly in love can literally walk on air - this is at core a folk musical with an idealised New York as a slightly larger version of hometown, a community to be celebrated. Several lively dance numbers are designed to evoke the paintings of Currier and Ives. This was Astaire's personal favourite of his musicals. Cast also includes Marjorie Main, Keenan Wynn, Alice Pearce, Clinton Sundberg, Gale Robbins. Music by Harry Warren, lyrics by Johnny Mercer."
