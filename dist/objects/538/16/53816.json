        "A romantic musical comedy set in a girls college, mainly around the swimming pool, where the beautiful Esther Williams plays the role of a swimming instructor and Red Skelton stars as her lovesick, abandoned husband. A perfect setting for some stunning choreographed underwater performances by Esther Williams. Cast also includes Basil Rathbone, Bill Goodwin, Xavier Cugat, Ethel Smith, and featuring Harry James and his Orchestra."
