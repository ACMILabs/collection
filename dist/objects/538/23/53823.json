        "The story is based on the life of Spig Wead, a pioneer aviator, renowned screenwriter. He scripted two of Ford's films and was a personal friend. Spig is unable to combine his career and marriage. The exuberance of the early scenes of inter-service rivalry and the pursuit of glory rings hollow in what is basically an unattractive portrait of military life. Following the breakdown of his marriage and a crippling accident, Wead is overtaken by a profound sense of failure and loss. Cast includes John Wayne, Dan Dailey, Maureen O'Hara, Ward Bond."
