        "Visually seductive, this film uncovers a few hard truths under the packaging. Dr. Vladimir Krajina, botanist and teacher, is waging a successful battle in British Columbia for the creation of ecological reserves. He explains the importance of such sanctuaries and why people must know and respect nature's laws if the future needs of the industry and the desire for a high quality of life are to be reconciled. Written by Barry Cowling and narrated by Stanley Jackson."
