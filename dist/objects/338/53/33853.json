        "Filmed mainly at the Montreal community of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, this film revolves around three young Quebecers, Michel, Robert and Johane, from their first days in the temple to their initiation six months later. The film examines the family life of Krishna members, the active proselytising in the streets, the temple rituals, and the role of women and their reliance on men for spiritual guidance. This film affords a close look at one of the controversial new religious organisations to have emerged from the Sixties in the United States. An English version of a French film."
