        "Demon Lover Diary is a documentary about the making of a low-budget horror film, but beneath the surface of this terse, incisive, cinema-verite study is a sense of real-life horror. DeMott's boyfriend, Jeff is hired by Don and Jerry to photograph their film, \"Demon Lover\". The production becomes a shambles and eventually explodes into violence."
