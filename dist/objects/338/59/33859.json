        "The cry from the Cross echoed in a film parable, told without words, where sculptured figures of the anguished Christ mix with contemporary scenes of city life. Musical accompaniment is a Dies Irae in memory of the victims of Auschwitz. Religious processions suggest man's spiritual insight; scenes in city parks or streets reflect the bland tolerance of human suffering."
