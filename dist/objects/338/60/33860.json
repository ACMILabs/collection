        "A highly personal and impressionistic piece of work, Firelight explores time. This animated film has long dissolves and pastel shades which reflect its ephemeral nature, its steady progression and the constancy of its cycles. It is a gentle film that sets the mind adrift. Film without words. Music by Eldon Rathburn."
