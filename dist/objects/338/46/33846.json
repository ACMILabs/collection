        "The skateboard gave the youngsters, who mastered its technique, a thrilling sensation of speed unexcelled by any other pavement sport. Filmed in 1966 on Montreal streets before the elongated rollerskate was banned, this film captures the exuberance of boys and girls having the time of their lives in free-wheeling downhill locomotion. Music by Pierre Brault. Sung by Genevieve Bujold."
