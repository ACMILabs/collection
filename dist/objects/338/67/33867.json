        "A film in the mode of direct cinema which follows the lives, over a three month period, of a young couple and their two children living in a squatter settlement in Manila. A succession of long \"takes\" is edited as fragments in the lives of the subjects. Begins with Cora's attempt to find a new room for the family after they have been evicted from the previous home. Lately Celso and Cora face a crisis in their own relationship aggravated by the stresses of their daily life. Made by Gary Kildea with the local collaboration of Rowena Katalingkasan. Tagalog (Filipino) dialogue, English subtitles."
