        "One of Canada's best known fly-fishermen, essayist Roderick Haig-Brown, demonstrates the art of salmon fishing in the Campbell River of northern Vancouver Island. The film, like the fisherman, has eyes for more than the river's surface. The camera looks below, showing what the fish sees and the fisherman senses. A film of solitude and of harmony with nature. (Awards: Toronto; Detroit; Novi Sad)"
