        "Mickey's Christmas Carol features Scrooge McDuck as the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, Goofy as a rather accident-prone ghost of Jacob Marley; Jiminy Cricket as the ghost of Christmas Past, and a host of other Disney favourites! It's all the magic of Disney animation in an enchanting new version of the world's best-loved Christmas fantasy. Rated: G"
