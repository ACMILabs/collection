        "A documentary that looks at the urgent need to introduce a health program to the communities of people who live in the isolated areas of the Andes mountains. These tiny communities have very high infant mortality rates due to malnutrition and frequent infections. With no health workers to prescribe the correct treatments, this pattern continues."
