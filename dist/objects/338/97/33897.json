        "The late Ken Carter's long-time obsession to be the world's greatest daredevil is the subject of this feature length documentary. Seen are the five years of preparation that went into raising one million dollars, building a rocket-powered car, and constructing a ten-storey take-off ramp for his attempt to jump a car across a mile-wide stretch of the St. Lawrence River. A portrait of a stunt driver who made his living by risking his life. Photography by Barry Perles. Narrated by Gordon Pinsent. (Awards: Genie, Toronto)"
