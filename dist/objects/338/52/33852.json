        "During the winters, since times pre-dating agriculture, the Cree Indian people of Mistassini have gone to the bush of the James and Ungava Bay area to hunt. Three hunting families agreed to meet an NFBC crew, who filmed the building of the winter camp, the hunting , the relationship to the land, the rhythms of Cree family life. This sensitive film expresses Cree beliefs and ecological principles that are the foundation of their lives. (Awards include: Melbourne, Toronto, London)"
