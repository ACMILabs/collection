        "Perhaps because estuaries seem so ordinary, many on the west coast of Canada are being drained to accommodate new housing and industry. This film demonstrates the importance of the estuary; its environmental function, the natural forces that control it, and its particular ecology. Superb microphotography affords unusual shots of tiny creatures hunting and eating their prey. Sound by John Knight. (Five awards, including Toronto; San Antonio)"
