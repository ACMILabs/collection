        "Flash William Shewchuck is a one-man movie industry. He combines the roles of film producer, director, camera man, actor, promoter, projectionist and ticket taker. In between productions, he works elsewhere to finance his company. In this film about his latest feature, \"Dawson City Joe\", he reveals his style and technique. Some of his innovations, developed by Flash in the isolation of the wilderness, have long been used in the industry. Voice and narration by Stanley Jackson."
