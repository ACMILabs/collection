        "Set in the 1940's on a fox farm, this film explores the critical period in a young girl's life when she first realises the existence and implications of traditional role stereotyping. At thirteen, Margaret enjoys helping her father with the outdoor labour, but she soon realises that her parents consider her help necessary only until their son is old enough to take over. When her attempts to express her feelings fail and she sees the favoured treatment of her younger brother she rebels and lets loose a rogue mare destined for slaughter. Provides a valuable study of the subtle ways in which sex role stereotyping can occur. Based on a story by Alice Munro. Suitable for secondary school level."
