        "People have become so sated with spectacular inventions and achievements that it is now difficult to imagine the sensation created by the first motion picture films, in which people actually moved about on the screen just as in real life. Little is left of those early days of Canadian cinema. But from the footage available, the filmmakers have pieced together an absorbing account of what went on the screens of the nation in those times, and of the people who influenced the fledgling industry. This is a flashback to the past that all will enjoy."
