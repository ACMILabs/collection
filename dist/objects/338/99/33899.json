        "The Kid Who Couldn't Miss has been the subject of controversy since its release in 1982. It is the fascinating account of how a brash kid from Owen Sound, Ontario, named William Avery (Billy) Bishop, became one of the leading fighter pilots of World War I. This film is a docudrama and combines elements of both reality and fiction. It does not pretend to be a biography of Billy Bishop. Certain characters have been used to express certain doubts and reservations about Bishop's exploits. There is no evidence that these were shared by the actual characters. At age 23, Bishop became a hero and Canada's most decorated military figure. Excerpts from John Gray's play Billy Bishop Goes to War, featuring Eric Peterson, provide a thread throughout the film."
