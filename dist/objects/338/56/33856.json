        "An animated children's film that illustrates the different projects that UNICEF uses its funds for. Two young children suddenly find that their own comfortable home surroundings have disappeared and that they are in a very poor village that does not even have a water pump. UNICEF comes to the rescue! Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
