        "Author of one of the major novels of the century, Under the Volcano, Malcolm Lowry fought a winning battle with words, and a losing battle with liquor. On-location shooting in four countries, photographs, readings by Richard Burton from Lowry's novel, and interviews with the people who loved and hated him give the film a terrifying immediacy. More than a portrait, it is a reflection on the greater agony of man. (10 awards including: Asolo; Toronto; Oscar nomination, Hollywood.)"
