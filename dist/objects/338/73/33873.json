        "Two little Japanese girls go for a stroll after school to look for beautiful tropical fish which they had been studying and drawing in school. Their search leads them to the pools of a formal garden and to the glass aquariums of street markets. Their parents, who have become anxious over their prolonged absence, go searching and find them. Many glimpses of Tokyo are seen."
