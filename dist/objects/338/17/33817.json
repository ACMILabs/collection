        "This finely crafted drama, set in Ontario's cottage country, revolves around two teenaged boys from the city who pick up two local girls on a Saturday night and take them for a ride. Based on an Alice Munro short story, Thanks for the Ride is about values and morals, expectations and broken dreams, class differences and peer pressure. It is also about the overwhelming intensity of adolescent emotions and that momentous event--the first sexual encounter. An excellent film for use in family life, values education, Canadian literature, and creative writing courses."
