        "A film showing the relationship between the activity of honey bees and the fertility of field and orchard crops. The process of cross-pollination of flowers by bees is observed in close-up. The life of the hive is similarly illustrated, including the curious dance by which a bee communicates the discovery of a new source of nectar to the colony in the hive ."
