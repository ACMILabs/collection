        "Gurdeep is a thirteen-year-old Canadian Sikh whose family runs a dairy farm in the southern coastal plain of British Columbia. They have retained their language and religion. Attendance at the Sikh temple, playing soccer with his schoolmates and working on the farm are all part of Gurdeep's life but sometimes he feels different from other children, because he wears a turban."
