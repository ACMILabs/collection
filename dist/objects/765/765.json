        "Gift was shot in the Wolfen-Bitterfeld region of Germany, formerly part of the GDR. Home to intensive chemical production powered by local open-cut coalmines, Bitterfeld has been referred to as the filthiest city in Europe. Since the reunification of Germany, attempts have been made to redress the environmental damage, but the long-term effects remain evident in both the scarred landscape, and the poor health statistics of the people who live there. Gift is a mesmeric, impressionistic collage of images of industry, mining, pollution and community.  Gift is the German word for poison"
