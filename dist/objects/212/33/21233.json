        "The life cycle of the brolga, Australia's only red crane, also known as the native companion. Flocks gather in the early morning to feed on insects, rodents and herbage. About September the birds pair off for mating, after a strange courting dance, and raise two chicks, which soon learn to follow their parents around. At about four months they are big enough to fly and join the flock. The film includes a number of remarkable sequences, photographed in slow motion, recording brolgas in flight."
