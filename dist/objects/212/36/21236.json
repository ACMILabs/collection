        "This film presents the conception and execution of a work of art - a monumental bronze work by Montreal sculptor Charles Daudelin, now standing outside the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. Shows the shaping of the model in its styrofoam stage with knife, saw and blowtorch. The film is without words, but with music to evoke the mood. Credits: Photography by Thomas Vamos and Michel Thomas-d'Hoste; edited by Yves Leduc; music by Maurice Blackburn and sound by Claude Delorme."
