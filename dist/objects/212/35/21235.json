        "A very funny yet deadly serious film, The Bronswick Affair, demonstrates the effectiveness of advertising in motivating people to buy products they don't need. It entertains through the comic appeal of its characters and the baroque situations they fall prey to. It also lays bare some facts about the excesses of consumerism prompted by a steady flow of commercials. Nine awards including Chicago; New York; Yorkton; Columbus; Melbourne."
