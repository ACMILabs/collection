    "description": [
        "Melbourne documentary filmmaker John Hughes will join ACMI as artist in residence in order to produce an exhibition, DVD, book and film program dedicated to the work of the Melbourne Realist Film Unit. The exhibition is scheduled for September 2004. REVISED: The Archive Project will be exhibited as part of 2006 Contemporary Commonwealth.  People involved with the Realist Film Unit made twelve films between 1946 and 1951. Some of these are lost. Those saved are held by Screen Sound Australia. These projects have received some attention in unpublished theses. However, the important work of the Melbourne realists remains largely 'hidden history' to a wider public.  John Hughes and/or ACMI may draw further finance for the production of the work, through ACMI, or independently through JH from grants. JH in collaboration with ACMI will seek partnerships in the project. JH will work from ACMI at Federation Square and participate in ACMI's activities. He will also act as a mentor for ACMI staff."
