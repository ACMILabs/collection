    "description": [
        "Stand on your head This is a film about aging, attitude'and yoga. Come on a journey to the centre of a suburban yoga class to witness elderly women, some in their nineties, practising yoga. Though they no longer stand on their heads, they do turn society's perception of the elderly on its head This film documents how yoga has helped these women keep physically and mentally strong despite their ageing years. The sense of community that coming to the same teacher for over thirty years has given them has also helped them cope with life's challenges. The film centres on Edka, who maintains that yoga has helped her overcome many tragedies in her life, including the death of her husband and daughter. By placing a local, multicultural group of ageing women in the spotlight, it is hoped that Stand on your Head can provide a positive role model for other senior citizens. This 'no-budget' film was made in Melbourne by local documentary filmmaker, Naomi Wise. The music featured in the film is an old European Jewish folk tune. Indian instruments are used to reflect the curious mix of cultures in the film. It was arranged by Melbourne music producer Adam Starr and sung in Yiddish by Karen Feldman."
