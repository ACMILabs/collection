        "Episode of Series \"Earth and it's peoples\". The film opens with a description of London, population 9,000,000 (1948), showing its old, narrow streets and congested traffic, the West End with its theatres, hotels, and shopping centre, the City, financial heart of England, and the seaport, largest in the country. England is highly industrialized and its manufacturing cities have grown up near the coal fields, with textile mills more widely scattered. Newcastle is such a typical city, and the film goes on to describe the lives of a typical family, the Kilgores. Mr. Kilgore works in the shipyards, his son in a coal mine, and a daughter in a dress factory. We have glimpses of their home-life and recreation."
