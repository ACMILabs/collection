        "In this film Buster Keaton rides across Canada on a railway scooter and, between times, rests in a specially appointed passenger coach where he and Mrs Keaton lived during their Canadian film assignment. This film is about how Buster Keaton made a Canadian travel film, \"The Railrodder\". In this informal study the comedian regales the film crew with anecdotes of a lifetime in show business. Excerpts from his silent slapstick films are shown. Awards: Seven, including Venice; New York; Melbourne; Milan. Commentary by Donald Brittain."
