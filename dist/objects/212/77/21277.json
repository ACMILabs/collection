        "Compilation of footage covering the Burma campaign against the Japanese between 1942 and 1945. For censorship reasons this campaign was given very little newsreel coverage and the footage was assembled into an absorbing narrative. Footage taken by British, Indian and American Combat Cameramen of South-East Asia Command."
