        "This film is part of the original silent film record of C.P. Mountford's Central Australian journey with a group of desert Aborigines. From the original footage the two popular sound films, \"Walkabout\" and \"Tjurunga\", were compiled. \"Brown men and red sand\" (if projected at silent speed) shows the movements of the Aborigines, especially in the sequences dealing with tribal ceremonies and dances, more naturally than in the sound films, where the movements look jerky."
