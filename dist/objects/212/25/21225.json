        "Episode of Series \"Planning for Teaching\". Shows American ideals of a broader education in living for adolescents, under the headings of civic competence, vocational orientation, preparation for family living, and health and physical fitness. High school students are seen as they elect their own leaders, and to research into social questions such as the power of pressure groups. Also shown are the types of vocational guidance and practical experience needed. Discussions on family problems, training for leisure, sport, are other elements of a broad curriculum."
