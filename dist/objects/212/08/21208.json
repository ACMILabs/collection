        "In 1945, Britain emerged from the war to find that, although victorious, there lay ahead a tremendous task of reconstruction; cities to be rebuilt, trade to be revived and exports to be stepped up. The film tells the story of Britain's post-war recovery, thanks to the courage and determination of her people. Overseas, three great nations have achieved independence within the Commonwealth, and in the Dependencies, new constitutions are paving the way to self-government. Narrated by Leo Genn."
