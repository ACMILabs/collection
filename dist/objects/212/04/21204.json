        "Shows how parents day-to-day enjoyment of family living provides the best emotional climate for children. An excerpt from a longer film on mental illness, \"The Lonely night\", depicts a mentally healthy family, the Dunns, the relaxed and sensible way in which the parents deal with minor problems and discords, and the personal satisfaction of each individual as they share in the responsibilities and pleasures of the family. Reaffirms the intuitive wisdom of parents who themselves have mature and healthy personalities."
