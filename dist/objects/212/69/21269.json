        "Twenty different antique sculptures from Central and West Africa are used to illustrate the important part played by carved wooden statues and masks in the everyday life of native Africans. The use of masks as protection or reassurance against common dangers and fears is dramatised with the assistance of tribal drum music actually recorded in Africa. Antique sculpture used in the film is from the Segy Galleries, New York."
