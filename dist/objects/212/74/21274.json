        "Shows one of Sweden's best known sex educators, Dr Maj-Britt Bergstrom-Wahlan, as she speaks with a class of 8 and 9 year old boys and girls. Later, she holds an informal discussion with an uninhibited group of teenagers, some from Sweden, others from the United States and Great Britain. The film concludes with a poem on the meaning of love and happiness, read by an elderly lady from an old people's home after she has visited a public exhibition of erotic art."
