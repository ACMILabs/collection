        "Established by the State Government of Victoria in 1976, the Victorian Tapestry Workshop has garnered itself an international reputation as a leader in the industry. In 1999 the Government decided to present a gift to the new Singapore Esplanade Theatre and visual artist David Larwill was selected to create a design that would be turned into a tapestry. This documentary covers the process of creating the tapestry, warping the loom, dying the wool, hitching on, interpreting the artwork, hitching off and the cutting off ceremony. Includes a biography of the artist and his work, as well as a brief spiel on the artist exchange program involving 3 Singapore artists, culminating in an exhibition at the Victorian College of the Arts. Sue Walker, Director, Victorian Tapestry Workshop is also interviewed on her involvement in the project."
