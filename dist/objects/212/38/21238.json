        "This film was made as a contribution to \"Brotherhood Week\" held in the USA in 1946, in which President Truman called on Americans to see that fair practices were the rule in both private and industrial life. The film is based on the pamphlet \"Races of Mankind\", written by Dr.Ruth Benedict and Gene Weltfish, anthropologists of Columbia University USA, and published in 1943. \"Brotherhood of man\" explodes a number of commonly held fallacies which lead to racial discrimination and group persecution. It gives a clear scientific exposition of a number of basic biological and historical facts, which demonstrate the fundamental identity of humanity, stressing the need for tolerance and co-operation between all groups and races since human beings are always dependent on other human beings. It uses humor rather than drama to make its points. The soundtrack of this film was translated and re-recorded for use by the USA Occupation forces in Europe."
