        "A survey of the major operations involved in the construction of a modern house: preparation of plans by architects; stripping of site and laying of foundations; subsequent work of bricklayers, carpenters, tilers, plumbers, glaziers, electricians, plasterers, painters and others. The commentary points out that the finished house is the result of the combined efforts of a large team of craftsmen."
