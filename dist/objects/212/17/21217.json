        "This film illustrates the function of limited constitutional monarchy in the present state of the British Commonwealth and Empire. The monarchy provides continuity and unity. The idea of continuity is presented by showing the historical development of the British monarchy, and something of the constitutional function of the sovereign. The idea of unity is shown by scenes illustrating the monarch's public duties and their position in relation to other countries of the Commonwealth and Empire."
