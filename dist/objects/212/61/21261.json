        "Sponsored research helps maintain quality and high production. Studies of soil mechanics led to new developments in footings allowing greater scope in planning buildings; a moisture meter led to new uses for hardwoods treated with preservatives; finger jointing prevents timber wastage; protected working spaces are provided by laminated trusses; control of firing procedures eliminates expansion of brickwork; strengthening of concrete and devices to cope with problems occurring with high buildings."
