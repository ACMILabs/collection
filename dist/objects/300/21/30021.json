        "Episode of Series \"History of the Motion Picture\". An edited version for the History of the Motion Picture series of the German film \"Variety\" produced by Ufa and directed by E.A. Dupont in 1925. The revolutionary photographic techniques of this important and influential German film had a profound effect on filmmaking everywhere. A strong stark drama of human passions set against a circus and vaudeville background. It is generally considered to be the best film of both its star, Emil Jannings, and its director, E.A. Dupont. Silent film with music and story line narration added."
