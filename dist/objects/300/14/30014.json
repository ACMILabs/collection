        "Jan Van Eyck, a rebel in his own time, strove to free painting from the conventions and restrictions of manuscript illumination of the early 15th century. He developed a personal style, and on it the entire Flemish School of painting was built. The film aptly illustrates his mastery and the many close-ups reveal the precision and skill of the artist. Works studied in the film include: Giovanni Arnolfini and his Bride, the altarpiece in Ghent, focusing on The Adoration of the Lamb and the Madonna with Chancellor Rolin. The camera explores the major subjects of other paintings as well as the smallest background detail. Just as many of Van Eyck's paintings are a tribute to the glory of God, this film is a monument to the marvels of his art. Music by Andre Colson."
