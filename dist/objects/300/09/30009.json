        "The Tennessee Valley Authority was the largest project undertaken by President Roosevelt's Works Project Administration, transforming a malarial floodplain into a prosperous agricultural region and improving the living and working conditions for those who lived on the plain. President Kennedy's vulnerability at his address when he visited the Project for the 30th anniversary celebrations on 18 May 1963 prefigured his assassination six months later."
