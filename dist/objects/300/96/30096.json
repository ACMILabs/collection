        "Deals with the objections sometimes raised against measures aimed at increasing productivity in a novel way in the form of a trial. The defendant, representing the indifferent worker who is opposed to better work methods is put up against various witnesses who are called to explode his views. The judge sums up the case, and the jury, the audience, must consider the verdict. The attitude to better work methods must be positive and helpful. Our standard of living depends upon our efforts to produce more. We must work better, but not necessarily harder, if we are to maintain and improve our standard of living."
