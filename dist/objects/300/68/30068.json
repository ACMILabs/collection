        "A look at some of the remains of Victorian cast iron in Great Britain, and some earlier examples with some discussion as to why they are important and representative of the period. Cast iron has survived better than any of the other new materials discussed, although much was lost for scrap during the wars, and many important monuments are being pulled down yearly."
