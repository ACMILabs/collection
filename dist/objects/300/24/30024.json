        "A portrait of Frederick Varley, Canadian painter of the Group of Seven. Following Varley as he returns to his studio in Toronto after a sketching trip in the country, the camera moves about the studio selecting examples of his work which typify his sensitive reaction to the world about him - reactions particularly evident in the work he did as a World War I artist and in his emotional response to the beauty and wonder of life. The film also presents a revealing glimpse of the artist as he becomes absorbed in work on a new canvas."
