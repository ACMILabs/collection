        "Dramatically depicts the effects of alcohol, stressing that consuming even the smallest quantities of alcohol can be dangerous. Tells the story of a young secretary who has two cocktails while out to lunch with her fiance. Her reaction dulled when driving back to work, she cannot brake in time and is killed, killing another person, also an alcoholic. Subsequently both their brains are examined by a neurologist; and the effects of alcohol on reaction times and normal co-ordination, convincingly demonstrated at a physiology lecture and a sports car gymkhana."
