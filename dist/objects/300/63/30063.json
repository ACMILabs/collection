        "Episode of Series \"Nature of Work\". Elevation to the position of Vice-President brings prestige responsibility and freedoms of action, but it also means a shifting of loyalties and the losing of personal contact. This is shown in the dramatised story of John Harvard who rising from Branch Director to Vice-President finds himself having to put pressure on the men who a short time ago were his near equals. Only by going against their wishes can he serve the best interests of his company."
