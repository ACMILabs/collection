        "Tells the lighthearted story of a Veteran Car Club Rally of vintage cars, held at Abingdon, in Berkshire. Of quaint appearance (none of a later vintage than 1916) and still lively performance, they are seen being submitted to tests of speed, braking and steering, to the delight of many onlookers."
