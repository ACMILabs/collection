        "Episode of Series \"Music in Motion\" The sights, sounds and feelings of London at night aptly illustrate the third movement of Vaughan Williams' London Symphony. The fountain at Marble Arch, pigeons in Trafalgar Square, moving traffic, flickering neon signs, a Cockney blowing on a mouth-organ, are contrasted with the dignity and tradition of the House of Parliament, and the evening mist and sunset along the Thames Embankment. Includes a Study Guide."
