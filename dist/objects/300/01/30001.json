        "In the south east corner of New South Wales, lie the Snowy Mountains, 1,300,000 acres of which have been set aside as a recreation area - the Kosciusko National Park. It holds a wide range of tourist attractions no matter what season or time of the year. In winter, the Park becomes a focus for Australia's skiers and in summer its bushwalking and fishing. The hills are dotted with chalets, huts and hotels catering for the many visitors. This film shows the Park in all its moods and seasons, with its beauty and excitement."
