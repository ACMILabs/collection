        "Records the actual life cycle of the peregrine falcon beginning with the nest building and courting rituals of the parent birds. Because the most desirable birds are the femal of the species, the remainder of the film focuses on the adventure of Varda, a female peregrine and her eventual capture by Charlie Cypress, a Seminole Indian falconer."
