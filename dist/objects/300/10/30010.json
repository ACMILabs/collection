        "The story of how machines made a \"boom\" town with factories running at top speed, stores crowded with shoppers, money flowing freely - and of how more machines broke it. Considers the problem of capable workers thrown out of jobs because of high-speed machinery. Gives an idea of what this does to the human spirit and of the effect on a family. Finally offers as one solution the constant training of adults to keep them abreast of new developments ready for new and better jobs. Narrated by Ray Collins."
