        "Although rich in oil, Venezuela is beset with staggering problems. Poverty is rife in its capital - Caracas - where thousands of Indians dwell in one-roomed ranchitos. At the opposite pole are the rich with virtually no middle class between the two. The region of Orinoco seems immune to improvement and overall continued development in Venezuela depends largely on increased efforts in the areas of education and economic reform."
