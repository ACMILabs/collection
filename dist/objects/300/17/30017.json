        "Eipsode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study\" Vanadium is studied as a typical transition element. The different oxidation states of vanadium and their colours are observed and then identified by means of a quantitative titration of vanadium(II) solution with cerium(IV) solution. The oxidation states and the observed colours are correlated with the electronic structures using an orbital board. The formation of complex ions containing vanadium in different oxidation states is demonstrated. The variations in properties in terms of ion size and charge density are discussed."
