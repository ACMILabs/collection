        "The Derwent Valley combines the beauty of the river itself with prosperous agriculture and many links with Australia's pioneer days. The tourist is offered cruising, rowing and angling along the river, while in New Norfolk, first settled in 1807, you may visit some of the oldest churches and inns in Tasmania. Eighty percent of Australia's hops, together with apples, cattle and sheep are produced in the fertile valley. Photographer: Neil Davis."
