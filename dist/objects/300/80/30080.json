        "The city of Brisbane, Queensland, as seen through the eyes of European migrants. Language presents more than a communication barrier to the new arrival. It is both a handicap at work and in impediment socially. Criticism is made of officials who do not advise migrants to learn English before landing in Australia. Also discusses the easy going life style of the Queenslanders."
