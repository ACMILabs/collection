        "Demonstrates the scientific methods used to prove Van Meegeren's contention that he was the painter of works of art which had previously been accepted as genuine Vermeers by museums and art critics. Scientific instruments employeed include radio and X-ray appoaratus; also a chemical analysis of the materials used was taken. The film explains the reason for Van Meegerens faking of Vermeers works, and mentions his means of disposing of the pictures and the sentence passed on him. Adapted from Prof. P.B. Coreman's book \"Van Meegeren's faked Vermeers and De Hooghs\"."
