        "The great winter storm of 1953 breached many dykes in the south-west Netherlands, flooding vast areas of fertile land. This film shows how 25 kms of dykes at Goeree-Overflakkee were repaired during the summer of 1953, in time to protect the land against the spring tides and storms of the coming winter. Great quantities of bitumen were used in this repair work."
