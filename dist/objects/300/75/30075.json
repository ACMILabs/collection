        "A report on the war in Vietnam (1966). Superimposed on internal rivalry and political tension, it involves not only the people who fight it but also the people who cannot escape it. Scenes of the guerilla type warfare, the ramsacking of villages and rebel street fighting, resulting in the needless suffering of the aged, women and children set the pattern of a brutal war. Reporter: Michael Charlton. NB: CONTAINS SOME DISTURBING IMAGES."
