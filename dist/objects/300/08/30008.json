        "Using archival stills and prints, and aerial shots the film traces the Yarra River from its source in the Great Dividing Range to its entry into Port Phillip Bay, emphasising its importance as a natural asset. Also shows geographical features such as the delta from Princes Bridge, Melbourne to Fisherman's Bend, the port complex and various sporting facilities. Discusses the planning policy for the Yarra Valley prepared by the Town and Country Planning Board, Victoria's state planning authority. \"Modern man causes problems to this priceless asset\" (Liberal Minister Dick Hamer)."
