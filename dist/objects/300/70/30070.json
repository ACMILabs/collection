        "This film was reconstructed from footage held in the Archive collection of the National Library. The \"Better Farming Train\" did 38 tours throughout Victoria in the 1920s - its aim was to bring the latest in agricultural science and technology to the man of the land. It had specially fitted display carriages and experts on board to provide information and demonstrations."
