        "This classic documentary celebrates the variety of activities the Murray River and the surrounding district sustains: from agriculture to timber, fishing to mining, fruit picking to shipbuilding. There is a special focus on the optimistic spirit of the people of the region as they overcome problems of erosion, bushfire and drought and makes a plea for further development, arguing that at least another million people could find happy homes in this fertile territory."
