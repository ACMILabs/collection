        "Emphasises the importance of soil conservation in Africa. Bushfires and certain methods of farming have removed much of the vegetation of the land, leaving the fertile topsoil exposed to the action of wind and water. The only way to combat erosion is to teach Africans the needs and make-up of the soil and how to preserve its fertility. Work is also being done in the reclaiming of eroded land."
