        "Episode of Series \"World in action\" Statistics show that venereal disease rates are rising, particularly among teenagers; teenagers explain how they become affected, and later describe their experiences in clinics. A lecture, sensibly frank and usefully informative in respect to symptoms, is heard and discussed by a mixed sixth form; a doctor gives further information about the spread of the disease and clinical procedure. Follow-up to previous Granada program \"The Shadow of ignorance: an inquiry\"."
