        "The posibilities of discontinuing production of their more popular and uneconomic articles, as a means of reducing production costs, are discussed by the executives of a manufacturing concern. Sales and production staff put forward feasible arguments, in human and commercial terms, for and against the proposition; eventually a compromise is reached as all agree that a policy of selective production will ultimately market better and cheaper goods and ensure quicker delivery."
