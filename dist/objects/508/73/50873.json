        "Rob Reiner (A Few good men, Misery, When Harry met Sally) directs this comedy about a fictional American President, who has more than a passing resemblance to President Clinton. Written by Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, A Few good men) \"The American President\" is a light-hearted romantic comedy about life in The Oval Office. Democrat president Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a widower three years into his term with a 63% approval rating, when he meets the intelligent, attractive Sydney Wade (Annette Bening), an environmental issues lobbyist. Shepherd woos and starts to date Wade, who reciprocates his interest. With an election looming, problems arise when Shepard's political enemies exploit the situation seeking to hamper his re-election by depicting him as a radical. The private life of Shepherd is scrutinised by the media, raising questions of public responsibility verses ownership of a private life for those living in the media glare. The film is most enjoyable when it takes a behind the scenes look at the machinations of the hectic, compartmentalised life of a president. Also starring Richard Dreyfuss, Martin Sheen and Michael J. Fox, Samantha Mathis, John Mahoney and David Paymer."
