        "Produced to celebrate Australia's bicentenary in 1988, this short picture postcard presents images of Australia's distinct landscape, flora and fauna, new Australian's sharing their experiences, archival footage of the colonial era and Australian's at war, natural disasters, and footage of the entertainment industry; music, dance, performance and radio. The soundtrack is a combination of Australian rock as well as instrumental \"patriotic\" songs."
