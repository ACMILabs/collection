        "This is a tribute to one of Hollywood's most remembered and highly acclaimed actors whose life and career was unfortunately cut short by a tragic car accident. James (or Jimmy) Dean was born in Marion, Indiana in 1931 and died only 24 years later on 30 September 1955. During his short acting career he became a cult hero for the youth of the 50's, a rebel and an individualist whose sensitive and intense portrayals, particularly in \"East of Eden\" (1955, dir. Elia Kazan) and \"Rebel without a cause\" (1955, dir. Nicholas Ray) shot him to legend status almost overnight. Modelling himself on his heroes Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift, James Dean managed to achieve his own heroic status as a Hollywood star proving that he too could be a great actor in his own right as witnessed in his role in his third feature film, the epic \"Giant\" (dir. George Stevens), where he starred alongside Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper and Carol Baker. This special Collector's Classic contains some rare archival newsreel footage, stills, film excerpts from his three feature films, biographical details with personal narratives from friends and actors including Carol Baker, Dennis Hopper, Jack Larson, Natalie Wood among others, career highlights including footage of many of his bit parts in film and television, and finally a complete and uncut version of \"The Unlighted road\" (1951) which featured in the television series \"Schlitz Playhouse of Stars. Backed by the music of Don McLean and \"American Pie\", and some wonderful images of the \"strange and different...but pure gold\" James Dean, this is a most interesting and informative video. NOTE: Due to the unique material contained in this video, fluctuations may occur in picture and sound quality during the program."
