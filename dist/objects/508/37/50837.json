        "Nurse Betty is a black comedy directed by Neil LaBute (In the company of men, Your friends and neighbours). Renee Zellweger (Bridget Jones's diary) stars as Betty Sizemore, a big-hearted waitress living in Fair Oakes, Kansas with her boorish, abusive, cheating husband Del (Aaron Eckhart). Unbeknownst to Betty, Del is involved in some shady business dealings. One night when Betty is engrossed in her favourite soap, \"A Reason to love\", Del is crudely murdered by two hit men, Wesley (Chris Rock) and Charlie (Morgan Freeman). Rather than believe reality, Betty believes the screen and goes off in search of her long lost love 'Dr David Ravell', the main character on her favourite show. The two hit men who killed her husband, each of whom make very different assumptions about their prey, pursue Betty across country. Once in LA, Betty strikes up a friendship with Rosa (Tia Texada) who reluctantly helps her track down her mythical doctor, played by Greg Kinnear. Renee Zellweger is funny and convincing as the naive, Betty, and won Best Actress in a comedy/musical at the Golden Globes, 2001."
