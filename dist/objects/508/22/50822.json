        "Episode of Series \"Hollywood's rebels\". This documentary highlights the experiences of those that worked with Marlon Brando, whether cast or crew, throughout his career, and provides a unique insight into the man himself. Director Claudio Masenza has collated a myriad of interviews from colleagues, friends and family, as well as stills and film clips to give a thorough overview of Brando's acting career, and although much praise is bestowed on the star the rebellious presence of Brando on the Hollywood stage is also discussed. Candid accounts and anecdotes make up this portrayal of Brando's darker side in tandem with a sensitive discussion of the talent that made Brando one of the most sought after actors in Hollywood following his debut in the 1950s."
