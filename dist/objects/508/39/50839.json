        "Spencer Tunick, internationally famous for taking public nude photographs 'en masse' has travelled the world photographing individuals and groups. \"Naked states\" is the documentary that helped make Tunick famous, chronicling his first major project, photographing people posing naked across 48 different states in America. This biographical documentary explores Tunick's influences and motivations, commenting on the artistic process and the issue nudity. This rich documentary offers a sometimes intimate journey into the reasons why the subjects chose to pose naked. What is revealed, surprisingly, is not naked bodies but the breadth of difference of the people that make up our society and a generous spirit usually concealed. Contains nudity which may offend some viewers."
