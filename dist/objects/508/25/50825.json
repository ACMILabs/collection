        "This video contains two programs pertaining to the history of the Anzacs using archival footage, drawings and stills and narrated by Barry Lineham. \"Prelude to glory\" - Presents a brief historical overview of Captain Cook's landings in New Zealand and Australia and the following events which took place including colonisation, the chain of British governors, a Treaty with the Maoris, Federation in Australia, and the eventual lead up to World War I. With the advent of the War came the formation of the Anzac Corps, an alliance between the Australian and New Zealand defence forces, and a commitment by the Anzacs to fight for the British Empire in a war half a world away. Shows the sailing of the first convoy, the naval battle and sinking of the German battle ship \"Emden\" and the arrival of the Anzacs in Egypt. \"Gallipoli\" - Tells the story of this ill-fated war against the Turks, the tragic mistakes, the chaos and disorganisation, and the horrendous loss of young Anzacs (10,000 soldiers) from the botched up landing on 25 April 1915 in a small bay south of Ari Burnu (renamed Anzac Cove) to the eventual evacuation of all troops in December 1915."
