        "The history of Hungary, just prior to, during and after WWII, is related through the recollections of the inhabitants of an old house, over the course of one hot night, on the eve of its demolition. Szabo employs a fragmentary, non-chronological, flashback structure to convey public and private events stretching over forty years. This important film by Szabo is an incisive account of human perception, memory and horror, told in poetic and ironic terms. Cast includes Rita Bekes, Lucyna Winnicks and Peter Muller. In Hungarian with English subtitles."
