        "How to steal a million is a romantic comedy caper film that re-teams star Audrey Hepburn and director William Wyler thirteen years after their classic film \"Roman holiday\" was made. \"How to steal a million\" is set among the high-end fine art world of museums, collectors, dealers and con-artists. Audrey Hepburn plays Nicole Bonnet, who's father Charles (Hugh Griffith) specialises in art fraud, in particular 'lost' van Gogh masterpieces, which go on to command high prices at auction. Charles' prized (fake) Cellini sculpture, Venus, is loaned for a public exhibition in Paris. Fearing that her father's forgery will be discovered Nicole enlists the help of renowned art thief Simon Dermott (Peter O'Toole) to steal the sculpture. O'Toole plays the charming thief and Hepburn's love interest with aplomb. The Paris setting and couture clothes (by Givenchy) for Hepburn make \"How to steal a million\" a delight to watch. Also stars Eli Wallach with a guest appearance by Charles Boyer."
