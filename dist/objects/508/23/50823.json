        "Eddie Maloney (Ben Mendelsohn) whose nickname is 'Mullet' (aptly named after a fish that no-one likes eating), unexpectedly returns home to Coollawarra after a three year absence. Surprisingly, not many people are too happy to see him back in town, particularly his estranged family who greet his arrival with some apprehension. None more so than his law enforcing brother Pete (Andrew Gilbert) who is now married to Eddie's childhood sweetheart, Tully (Susie Porter). David Caesar's understated screenplay interweaves pointed metaphor to explore the ties that bind and separate family. The story unfolds through a series of well observed and familiar characterizations, while unashamedly wearing it's Australianness on it's sleeve. The vibrant cinematography by Robert Humphreys gives the story a sense of magic realism, while the characters quiet musical interludes are surprisingly and nicely understated. Cast includes Belinda McClory, Kris McQuade, Tony Barry, Peta Brady and Wayne Blair."
