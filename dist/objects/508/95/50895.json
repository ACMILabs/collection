        "Adapted from the novel by Han Suyin, \"Love is a many splendored-thing\" is a film about an inter-racial romance, shot on location in Hong Kong and filmed in Cinemascope. Set in Hong Kong 1949, the film centres on the love affair of Dr Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) and Mark Elliot (William Holden). She is a dedicated and talented doctor of Eurasian background, working in a local hospital, who longs for her Chinese homeland. He is an American war correspondent covering the Korean War, temporarily based in Hong Kong. When Suyin meets Elliot she is alerted to the fact that he is married and is warned that a cross-cultural relationship is a perilous move. The racism and snobbery of the British social network of Hong Kong is made clear, particularly in the initial stages of the film. The expectations of Suyin's Chinese family and colleagues are that she will behave in the culturally expectant Chinese way. Suyin is proud of her Eurasian heritage but is also made acutely aware of her cultural difference and status as an outsider, despite being respected professionally. Winner of three Academy Awards, including Best Song."
