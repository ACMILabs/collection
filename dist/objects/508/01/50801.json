        "Narrated by Michael Meyer, this discussion of the controversial career of playwright, Henrik Ibsen, covers both biographical details of the writer and delineates the four significant stages in his writing through a comprehensive study of the themes and the sociological and political impact of his work and its part in changing the face of live theatre. His characteristic questioning of authority and tradition and demands for debate on issues in wider society through his work is evoked and discussed. As is the powerful turning point in theatre his approach to writing and acting influenced, with discussion of his scripts about ordinary people that turned theatre into a mirror on society and encouraged relational acting instead of grand solo performances in larger than life show pieces that had previously dominated the theatrical scene. Through the program's commentary, interviews with other writers and academics, through readings of his work, including his letters and diaries, and excerpts from performances of his renowned plays this documentary provides a thorough analysis of the influential work of Henrik Ibsen as well as a contextual insight into the more personal life of this powerful writer."
