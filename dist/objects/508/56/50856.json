        "48 Hrs set the blueprint for the successful comedy/action/buddy genre film in Hollywood. Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) is a white renegade cop determined to avenge the murder of several colleagues at the hands of criminals. The only way to find the killers is to allow one of their crew, a street-wise hustler out of jail. Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) is given forty-eight hours leave from jail to assist with the investigation. Hammond and Cates hate one another on sight, but have to learn to work together, perhaps even like each other to crack the case. Murphy was still a member of the television show \"Saturday Night Live\" when he made his debut film, which broke him in the mainstream. His profane shtick became his signature routine, which would see him through many phases of his bountiful career. The film consists of numerous violent set-ups and shoot-outs as well as exciting action sequences."
