        "After serving 18 years for the chaos he was responsible for in the original film, Jake Blues (Dan Aykroyd) is released from jail and learns his brother Elwood has passed away. Even more shocking news is that his old mentor and the man he came to think of as his father, Curtis, has passed away also, leaving behind an illegitimate son. Determined to reform the band in their memory, Jake returns to the orphanage where he and Elwood were raised, only to be asked to care for ten-year old Buster, an orphan with an attitude similar to his own. Desperate for money to fund the band's reformation, Jake visits Curtis' son Cabel, a police sergeant. When Jake's plea for money is unsuccessful, Buster steals Cabel's wallet. The band is reformed with singer Mighty Mack (John Goodman) replacing Elwood in the lineup. With the police, the Russian Mafia and a militia group on their tails, the band travels across country to Louisiana, where they aim to win Queen Mousette's Battle of the Bands. Also includes performances from Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Erykah Badu, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Isaac Hayes, Bo Diddley, Dr. John, Travis Tritt, Steve Winwood and Clarence Clemmons."
