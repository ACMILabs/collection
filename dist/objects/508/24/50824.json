        "A stunning visual adaptation of the novel of the same name by British author J.K. Rowling. 10 year old Harry Potter, orphaned as an infant and raised by his horrible aunt and uncle, believes himself to be an ordinary boy, only to find out on his eleventh birthday that he is anything but ordinary. Harry is a wizard and has been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he will spend the next seven years following in his parent's footsteps. Spells, charms, potions, Quidditch - every young wizard's favourite sport, dragons, trolls, three-headed dogs and discovering the truth behind his parent's not-so-accidental death means never-ending adventures for Harry and his friends Hermione and Ron. Newcomers Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint star as Harry, Hermione and Ron. Cast also includes Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, John Cleese, Fiona Shaw, Zoe Wanamaker, Julie Walters, John Hurt, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths and Warwick Davis."
