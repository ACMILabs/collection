        "Dark victory was nominated for three Oscars in 1940 including Best Picture and Best Actress for Bette Davis. Davis and the film lost out in that year on both counts to \"Gone with the wind\". In \"Dark victory\" Davis plays Judith Traherne, a beautiful young Long Island socialite, without a care in the world until she discovers she is suffering from a potentially fatal brain tumour. Her surgeon offers temporary hope with an operation prolonging her life and simultaneously brings love to Traherne's life for the first time. One of four collaborations between director and star, \"Dark victory\" is a typical Hollywood melodrama of the 30s that rises above the ordinary, thanks to the compelling presence of Davis. Davis portrays Traherne as a beguiling, earnest, and impetuous woman, reluctantly facing her own mortality. Humphrey Bogart stars as an Irish horse trainer holding a candle for Traherne's affection. Future president of the United States Ronald Reagan has a minor role in the film as a playboy socialite. \"Dark victory\" is reflective of the strong period that Bette Davis' career was at in the late 1930s and 40s when she enjoyed studio backing and public acclaim."
