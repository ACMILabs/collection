        "Episode of Series \"Speaking from experience\". Aimed at increasing awareness and consciousness of the crimes depicted, this episode from the \"Speaking from experience\" series looks at the experiences of Lucy and Tina. Lucy was sexually abused by her father as a young child; a situation that the remainder of her family was aware of. Tina was raped by an unknown assailant in her own home, a country property out of Melbourne. Both women speak candidly and honestly to varying degrees of detail about what happened to them, how they coped immediately afterwards and now, the impact it had on the rest of their family as well as intimate relationships, the benefits of talk therapy, the need for justice, and what has to be achieved to assist the healing process."
