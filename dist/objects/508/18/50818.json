        "Episode of Series \"Hollywood's rebels\". James Dean was a 1950s icon whose image fought against all that was wrong with the adult world: displacement of the young, repression, and general uncoolness. This documentary however focuses on James Dean the man, rather than his image. It is an illuminating look at the actor's life seen through the eyes of friends, family and work colleagues. The testimonials are frank and thought provoking, and there is rare footage of TV commercials and telemovies that Dean had featured in. It shows an extremely talented and ambitious actor who often seemed more comfortable on stage or in front of a camera than he did being himself. Refreshingly it also highlights other sides to Dean such as his wicked sense of humour. The interviewees speak candidly and articulately of stories that are not a staple of the James Dean myth, leaving one with a real sense of whom this young man was as an actor."
