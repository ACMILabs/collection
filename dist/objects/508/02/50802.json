        "Episode of Series \"Australian biography\". An intimate encounter with the extraordinary \"poet of suburbia\", Bruce Dawe, whose ability to evoke the drama and beauty of everyday life has set him amongst the most accessible and highly regarded of Australian poets. His highly empathic style of writing stems from a staggered history of variant occupations, contact with those from a diversity of backgrounds and failed studies as he drifted through his early years with a skill for writing but little direction. Here his motivations and writing process as they have since stood are explored. He discusses his family history and early life, his fascinations and motivations and his view of his place in the poetry world of giving a voice to ordinary Australians. Through interviews with Dawe, footage of him reading his poetry and commentary on his life and writing this is a comprehensive personal insight into Bruce Dawe's life and influences."
