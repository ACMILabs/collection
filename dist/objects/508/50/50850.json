        "A biographical documentary dealing with the life and work of Albert Einstein using historical footage and interviews with friends and colleagues. The film explores Einstein's childhood, education, work, migration and political beliefs. His theories are explained using simple, unscientific terms. Tragically, despite his pacifism, Einstein's work was instrumental in the creation of the atomic bomb. Includes footage of Einstein with Charlie Chaplin, at a ceremony in his honour hosted by George Bernard Shaw, visiting California between the wars and receiving a Nobel prize. It also contains historical footage of the World Wars including the burning of books by the Nazi party and attacks on Jewish homes and businesses. Narrated by John Stockbridge. Photographed by Eugene Carr, Len Newson and Tony Leggo. Edited by Ted Walter."
