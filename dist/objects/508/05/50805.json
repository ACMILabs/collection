        "Sticks, or pool, means more than life to Jack (Robbie Magasiva), Wayne (Scott Wills) and Thomas (Paolo Rotondo) - it can even override sex. In fact, \"pub pool is the perfect game...conflict, drama, thrill of the chase, strategy and a cliff-hanger ending\". What more could you want? As best mates, the trio spend most of their spare time hustling at Dave's Bar for a bit of a laugh and some money on the side until one night they are asked to enter into a high stakes tournament run by the local crime boss \"Daddy\" (Enrico Mammarella). Their pool-playing lives suddenly changes - as the stakes get higher so trouble seems to follow and all three are faced with the prospect of doing what Daddy asks or else! But more than anything else, the \"Stickmen\" want to win. Humor, sex, violence, romance and pool blend together to make this a quirky and upbeat film in the tradition of \"Lock stock and two smoking barrels\" and also is director Hamish Rothwell's first feature film. Cast includes Anne Nordhaus, Simone Xessell, John Leigh, Kirk Torrance, Luanne Gordon."
