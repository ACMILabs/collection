        "This series from the American Film Institute (AFI) salutes some of the biggest stars that helped shape the face of Hollywood as we know it today. James Cagney, one of the Hollywood greats, acted in over 60 films. Remembered mostly for his gangster roles and the delivery of the now famous line \"You dirty rat\", Cagney's repertoire was diverse and included comedy, musicals, westerns and Shakespeare. Hosted by Frank Sinatra, this tribute, both informative and entertaining (winning an Emmy Award in 1975 for Outstanding Television Programme), celebrates his career with a top line-up of stars contributing anecdotes along with excerpts from many of his films. Frank Sinatra delivers a wonderful version of 'My Way' with lyrics written to honour Cagney. Guest speakers include: Mae Clarke, Doris Day, Kirk Douglas, Frank Gorshin, Charlton Heston, Bob Hope, Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Ronald Reagan, George Segal, George C. Scott, Cicely Tyson and John Wayne."
