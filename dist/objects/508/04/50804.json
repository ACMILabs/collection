        "Intending \"A.I.\" as a collaboration between himself and Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick created various treatments and hundreds of storyboards for the film - upon Kubrick's death Spielberg inherited the project as director and co-producer. \"A.I.\" is the story of David, a cyber boy, realistically designed and programmed to provide unconditional love to its owner. David enters the home of Monica and David, where Monica, after initial problems, embraces his presence. Trouble brews however when Martin (the couple's biological son, recovering from an illness) returns home and displaces David. David is turned out into the wilderness where he meets Gigolo Joe, a love robot on the run. Joe and David visit Rouge City, in search of the Blue Fairy (whom David is convinced will grant him mortality) and then to a Flesh Fair where the two witness a carnival of robot torture. \"A.I.\" is a fantastical quest that depicts a robot yearning to be real and hence loved, themes echoed in \"Pinocchio\" (a touchstone in the film) and \"Blade runner.\" A film with three quite distinct acts, \"A.I.\" is saturated with memorable images, set pieces and costumes, as well as some interesting concepts and ethical moral dilemmas but is compromised by its eagerness to provide David with a happy ending."
