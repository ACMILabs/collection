        "Examines the life and problems of Megalopolis, the urbanized northeastern seaboard extending from Boston to Washington, D. C. Shows metropolitan centers, transportation networks, harbors, suburban and rural areas; points out the need for better organization of the suburban sprawl in the future course of urbanization. Compares population density in this region between 1940 and 1960. Also discusses pollution and water contamination and the cultural and economic diversity of the area. Based on the survey 'Megalopolis: the urbanized northeasteren seaboard of the United States' by Professor Jean Gottmann from the University of Paris. Narrated by Ben Grauer."
