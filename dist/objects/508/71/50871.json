        "From the writer of \"The Full monty\", Simon Beaufoy, comes \"Among giants\", a tale set in Sheffield, England about a group of unemployed blue-collar workers who take on odd jobs to make ends meet. The latest of these high risk ventures is an unofficial contract to paint miles of power towers on the remote and beautiful Yorkshire Moors. The group are an eclectic mix of ageing hippies and adrenalin seeking rock climbers, very laddish in their encounters with one another. Into this all male crew enters Gerry (Rachel Griffiths) a feisty, fearless, mountain climbing Australian backpacker, who upsets the working life and social order of the group. Gerry falls for her boss Ray (Pete Postlethwaite) fuelling problems for both of them with his ex-wife, and with his best friend, Steven. Tensions rise as racing against the clock, the crew strives to complete the job, whilst Ray and Gerry struggle to resolve the status of their relationship. Billed as a romantic comedy, the film is situated in the tradition of light hearted tales of the woes of English working class life."
