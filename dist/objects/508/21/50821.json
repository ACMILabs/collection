        "Lee Remick hosts this tribute to screen goddess Marilyn Monroe, charting her rise to fame from her early years as struggling brunette photographer's model to her later incarnation as a successful actress and blonde bombshell. This documentary examines the continuing appeal of Monroe and the private hell hidden behind the radiant public facade, and features rare footage of her teenage years, an early television commercial for Royal Triton Fuel, her appearance on the Jack Benny Show, her visit to Korea to perform for the American troops, her controversial rendition of Happy Birthday for President Kennedy, and clips from some of her most famous film roles. Also includes interviews with Gloria Steinem, Robert Wagner, Robert Mitchum, Susan Strasberg, and Monroe herself."
