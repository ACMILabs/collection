        "This bio-pic is the story of legendary (real-life) American big band leader Glenn Miller. Miller was a visionary who introduced swing music to American audiences in the 1940s with his own original compositions. Starting in the 1930s \"The Glen Miller story\" tracks Miller's struggles to have his arrangements played when the mood of the day was for the standards only. Miller was a talented trombonist who was driven by a love of music to champion the case for a new style of writing. The film also tells the story of Miller wooing his teenage sweetheart, whom he eventually marries. Helen (June Allyson) frequently played second fiddle to Miller's ambitions, even spending her wedding night at a club whilst Miller jammed with Louis Armstrong. The film features many musicians of the era playing themselves which greatly enhances its appeal. Musicians include: Louis Armstrong, Gene Krupa, Barney Biggard, Arvell Shaw and Frances Langford. \"The Glenn Miller story\" was one of the most successful bio-pics of its day. Starring James Stewart as Miller, the film was nominated for five Academy Awards in 1954, winning one for best sound."
