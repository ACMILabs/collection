        "Discover the history of amusement and theme parks in America, the design and construction of roller coasters, the invention of the \"hot dog\" and experience, graphically, some of those most amazing roller coaster rides for yourself. Hosted by Vincent Price, this video details the history of amusement parks from the establishment of Coney Island (New York) in the 1860s with its three separate parks, Steeplechase Park, Dreamland and Luna Park to a point when by the 1920s, there were around 1,000 amusement parks throughout America. Meet John Allen, the designer of the wooden roller coaster and see how today's monster thrill rides (longer, faster and higher) are conceived, from the artist's design through to models, prototypes and the final ride. Also includes footage of the original Disneyland, (first of the \"theme\" parks) and Palisades Park."
