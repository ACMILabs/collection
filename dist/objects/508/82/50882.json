        "Joey Boca is a philandering pizza shop owner whose wife Rosalie turns a blind eye to his indiscretions until she spies him fondling a woman in the library aisles. Her initial reaction is to contemplate suicide, but her mother advises otherwise - eliminate the rat and be done with it. So Rosalie and her mother set about finding a killer, but their inept choices result in failure and a comedy of errors. Despite repeated attempts using a variety of methods, Joey appears to be invincible. Directed with bland efficiency by Lawrence Kasdan (The Big chill, The Accidental tourist, Grand Canyon, French kiss), this is a black comedy that ponders notions of fidelity and loyalty, albeit in a screwball manner. The original script is peppered with agreeable jokes but strains too hard to convince the audience that despite its dark premise, the filmmakers are only joking. The bright spot here is the ensemble cast in a range of unusual guises: William Hurt as a bummed out hippie, River Phoenix as a love sick would be murderer, Kevin Kline as a two-timing Italian. Based on a true story. Cast also includes Keanu Reeves, Tracey Ullman and Heather Graham."
