        "The story of St Francis of Assisi - a compassionate saint who shed a life of wealth and privilege to live as a humanitarian zealot, helping the poor and unwanted. Mickey Rouke plays Francis and Helena Bonham Carter is Chiara, the woman, and fellow convert, who loves him. After the defeat of Assisi by Perugia and spending a year in prison, Francesco is gradually awakened to the plight and suffering of the people, and to his religious calling. Despite the imploring of his distressed father, Francesco rejects his background and is driven to dispersing aid, by begging alms, and living amid the lepers and impoverished. The film relates Francis' evolution, from a hedonistic merchant to a pious man of spiritual calling, told in flashback by his disciples. With an episodic structure, the film has grand intentions, and ably captures the aesthetics of the thirteenth century Italy but is laden with a rather portentous tone. Filmed on location in Perugia and Cincecitta and directed by Liliana Cavani (The Night porter, Ripley's game)."
