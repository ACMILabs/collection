        "One true thing depicts relationships among one ordinary American family as they grapple with emerging truths as a result of terminal illness. Ellen, an ambitious but somewhat frosty Harvard graduate working at 'New York Magazine' as a writer, is dominated by her father, George, a literary professor and critic and her mother, Kate, a homemaker and perfectionist who reflects the middle-America values and priorities that Ellen scorns. With Kate unwell, George asks that Ellen return home as carer - a role which Ellen resents, as it will take her away from her boyfriend and literary career in New York. \"One true thing\", a high-brow tearjerker, utilises melodrama to portray the central conflict of the family that is always subtly at war with itself. At times turgid and predictable the drama is nevertheless effective, mostly due to the strong performances of the three lead actors as they portray adults bourgeoning with thwarted desires and misplaced loyalties. Cast includes Meryl Streep, Renee Zelweger and William Hurt."
