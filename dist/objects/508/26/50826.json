        "Acclaimed by the American institute of Architects as the best American building built in the last 125 years, Fallingwater, built by Frank Lloyd Wright has attracted since its construction in 1936 ongoing international accolades. The home built as a summer residence for a family was designed in direct response to it's environment. The building is sited over a waterfall using mostly counter-levered platforms. The documentary extrapolates on the building method (with archival footage) and details with interviews the materials used and intellectual ideals that directed the external and interior functionalist aesthetics. The documentary observes the home throughout the seasons to illustrate the depth of the Lloyd Wright's design and his consideration for a place to be lived in and shared with a changing environment. Narrated by Bingo O'Malley."
