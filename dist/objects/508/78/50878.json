        "In 1979, in cooperation with the Members of Congress for Peace Through Law Education Fund, the Center for Defense Information financed this short documentary to promote the unilateral disarmament lobby's claim that, \"there is no defense against nuclear war,\" on which basis they also oppose civil defense programs, anti-ballistic missile defenses and development of satellite-based beam weapons. Combines footage of nuclear tests, presidential speeches and interviews with military leaders with opinions expressed by Russian and American members of the public. Includes President Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter, retired US Navy Admiral La Rocque, former CIA Deputy Director Herbert Scoville and Civil Defense consultant William Kincade. Also includes historical footage of nuclear bomb blast tests in the US desert. Narrated by Paul Newman."
