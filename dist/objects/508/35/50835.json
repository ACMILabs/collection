        "Just how far will one person go to achieve their goal? For Danielak (Jerzy Stuhr), a variety host/entertainer, there appears to be no boundaries or limits out there which will stop him from being the MC of an upcoming gala ball in a brand new hotel. Danielak is prepared to lie, deceive, bribe and bluff his way through the chain of authority in order to eliminate his competition. Realistic in style, \"Top dog\" is a biting commentary on 70s communist Poland, and in particular, the bureaucratic State departments and State owned companies. Director Feliks Falk is representative of the 70s new Polish cinema, the \"cinema of moral anxiety\" and for this, if for no other reason, \"Top dog\" is both intriguing and entertaining. Cast also includes Slawa Kwasniewska, Wiktor Sadecki, Michal Tarkowski, Ewa Kolasinska, Ryszard Kotys, Jerzy Kryszak. In Polish with English subtitles."
