        "Directed by Francois Truffaut, \"Jules and Jim\" is the story of a menage-a-trois in the years around World War I. Jules and Jim are old friends in love with the same woman - the beautiful and free-spirited Catherine - who returns the affections of both men. \"Jules and Jim\" is their story - the liaisons between the trio, the jealousies and shifting loyalties. The audience is distanced by the narrator who makes the viewer continually aware of the artifice involved in the storytelling. Truffaut drew on incidents in his own life in developing Henri-Pierre Roche's novel in a personal way. He identified Jim with Roche and Jules with himself. Their discovery of Catherine is symptomatic of the confusion between art and life which pervades the protagonists' lives. The narrative, punctuated by cinematic allusions, is marked by a wide range of techniques and rapid shifts in mood from pathos to whimsy. Starring Jeanne Moreau, Oscar Werner, Henri Serre and Marie Dubois. In French with English subtitles."
