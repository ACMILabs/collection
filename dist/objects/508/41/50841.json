        "The Closet is a farcical French comedy from writer/director Francis Veber (The Dinner game, Les Fugitifs, The Birdcage). Francois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is an accountant in a rubber factory, where he is regarded as boring, insignificant, disposable and 'unmanly'. Pignon, estranged from his ex-wife and teenage son, is about to be fired, an event that he regards as catastrophic. His response to his impending unemployment is attempted suicide until his new neighbour (Michel Aumont) talks him out of that plan and into another - if Pignon pretends he is gay the company will not fire him for fear of seeming homophobic. The effects on Pignon's life, of his decision to come out of the closet, are enormous and ricochet into the lives of family and colleagues. \"The Closet\" explores notions of homophobia, machismo, discrimination, work place relationships and sexuality in a comedic manner. Stars some of France's finest actors - Daniel Auteuil, Gerard Depardieu, Michele Laroque, Thierry Lhermitte and Jean Rochefort. In French with English subtitles."
