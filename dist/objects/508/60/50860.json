        "Sinatra: A passionate life is a loving tribute to the late Frank Sinatra. It provides an excellent biographical overview of the singer, actor and all-round performer, ranging from his childhood years to retirement. We are introduced to Sinatra's family, his place of birth, his admiration for Bing Crosby, his initial rise to fame, his huge success during World War II, his work in the film and TV industries, his Vegas years and experience with the Brat Pack, and so on. Interviews with numerous colleagues and close friends are interweaved with archival footage, photos and film excerpts. The archival footage is especially splendid including such rare and classic moments as Sinatra and Elvis Presley on live television performing each other's songs or Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jnr carrying out their legendary Brat Pack routines at the Sands casino in Las Vegas. Though completed just prior to Sinatra's passing, \"Sinatra: A passionate life\" is overall both a fitting testament to the man's unique talent, career achievements and influence and a record of the eras in which he performed."
