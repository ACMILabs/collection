        "A rift in the friendship of two girls develops when one girls tells a racist joke about the other. Lisa has a traditional Chinese dinner at the home of Nancy, her Chinese-American friend. When she returns home, her father and brother tease her about Chinese food, chopsticks and accents. Lisa repeats these jokes at school the following day and they are repeated in Nancy's presence causing her to feel hurt. As Lisa witnesses more racial problems in the playground, she realises the impact of her 'little joke' and seeks out Nancy to make up."
