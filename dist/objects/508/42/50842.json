        "A young family lives isolated in rural Australia with the father, a truckie, almost always away. Sparrow asks her mother what the difference is between ghosts and spirits as she ponders the death of the family dog. The mother remains emotionally distant until Sparrow's curiosity with death leads her to dig up a family secret. 'Sparrow' explores the quiet of the emotions within a family and creates a portrait of emotional distance affirmed with the slow pace of country life and the very distant horizon. Cast includes: Molly McCaffrey and Leverne McDonnell."
