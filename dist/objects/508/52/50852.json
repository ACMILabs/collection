        "Introduces teachers to new theories about the right and left hemisphere of the brain. In an in-service workshop Dr Bob Samples, author of 'The Metaphoric Mind', contrasts and compares the rational mind and the metaphysocal mind. He concentrates on the brain-hemisphere functions as related to values and morals as well as the similarities between prjudices and values. Bob also discusses Piaget's theory and his research and experience in Hopi Indian communities. Photographed by Wayne Threm."
