        "Episode of Series \"Speaking from experience\". Breast cancer is a malignant tumor in the breast. The severity of the disease depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. This excellent and informative documentary presents five women of varying age, who have all experienced the trauma of breast cancer. Each woman relates her own personal story from the initial diagnosis and having to deal with the reality, to surgery and treatment and finally to recovery and the future. Various types of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are discussed including the side effects, physical and emotional, and the important role self-image can play in the road to recovery. Also stresses that the key to recovery is through support from family and friends in terms of encouragement, offers of help in daily routines, and generally in just being there. A common factor with each of the women is the way their outlook on life has changed, valuing each day as precious and maintaining a positive attitude as a means to coping with the disease. A warm and enlightening progam."
