        "Caught in a collision between the modern world of rap, football, and street cred and the oldest living culture on earth, Lorrpu, Botj and Milika are three Yolngu teenagers who once shared a childhood dream of becoming great hunters together. But things have changed and their paths are diverging. Botj is walking on the wild side, a lost soul in search of a place to belong. Milika is more interested in football and girls than any of the traditional knowledge he is being taught. Only Lorrpu seems to care about the dream any more. Their paths are diverging, and he is the only one who can see it.  When Botj goes too far and finds himself on the wrong side of both black and white laws, Lorrpu must weigh up his own future against saving his friend.  He persuades the boys to trek to Darwin to argue Botj's case with Dawu, a tribal leader. Leaving behind their community, they journey through the unforgiving wilderness of north-east Arnhem Land to Darwin. To survive, Lorrpu, Milika and Botj must draw on the ancient bush knowledge they were taught as boys and, most importantly, the bonds of their friendship.  Yolngu Boy is about the search for identity, making the journey from adolescence to adulthood and the implications of belonging to a larger social group, whether it is a culture, a family or a group of friends."
