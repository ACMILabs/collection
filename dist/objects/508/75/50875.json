        "Pamela is a successful writer working for a magazine, single, independent, professional, well dressed, but hapless, lonely, depressed, confused about where her road has led her, reading self-help books in search of an answer. On her birthday, demoralised after an awful blind date and considering suicide as her next career move, Pamela contemplates how her life would have turned out if she had married Robert, her early 20s sweetheart. Pamela gets the chance to find out when she meets her doppelganger and they swap roles. Pamela spends a few weeks in a house in the leafy suburbs, with Robert and their three children. Over that time Pamela discovers that it is not all plain sailing trying to balance work commitments, child rearing and a dormant sex-life. A switcheroo comedy, Rachel Griffiths takes the title role/s and plays Pamela as a woman searching for identity, sexual satisfaction and personal gratification from life, whatever role she chooses. \"Me, myself, I\" is a female empowerment film in that it recognises the burden of housework, the compromises of relationships, the need for sexual satisfaction and the demands of children from a woman's perspective, comically exploring these issues without (for the most part) reducing the characters to displays of sentimental mawkishness. Cast also includes David Roberts, Sandy Winton, Yael Stone, Shaun Loseby."
