        "Based on the famous and scandalous novel by D. H. Lawrence, a classic love story banned for over 30 years when first published. This controversial literary classic is brought to the screen by the director of \"Emmanuelle\", and stars Sylvia Kristel as Lady Chatterley; rich, titled and beautiful but increasingly restless and frustrated by her passionless marriage to Sir Clifford (Shane Briant). Increasingly attracted to the handsome Mellors (Nicholas Clay), her husband's gamekeeper, she is soon seeking physical and emotional satisfaction in a passionate affair, oblivious to the ensuing social scandal. Cast includes Ann Mitchell, Elizabeth Spriggs and Peter Bennett."
