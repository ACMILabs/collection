        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Fire on the rim\". Careful planning with technological innovation can minimise the damage and death caused by seismic activity. The education of peoples in lands around the \"ring of fire\" also assists in avoiding unnecessary disaster. Although scientists can make intelligent guesses about the movement of the earth, the predicition of earthquakes and eruptions remains an imperfect art. The study of historical evidence coupled with intensive research around the Pacific Rim, is helping to gain a clearer picture of the problem."
