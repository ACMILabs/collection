        "No other actor played a gangster with the conviction of James Cagney. As Eddie Bartlett, James Cagney epitomises the classic ani-hero - a lawless man in a lawless time. Humphrey Bogart cut his teeth with his rough and tough portrayal of George - Eddie's closest buddy and partner in crime. The combined talents of these two stars make \"The Roaring Twenties\" a landmark in cinematic history - the seminal gangster movie. Co-starring Priscilla Lane, Gladys George, Jeffrey Lynn, Frank McHugh and Paul Kelly."
