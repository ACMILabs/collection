        "Episode number 9 of Series \"The Worlds of childhood\". A child's capacity to learn symbols is the first step to acquiring language. Through observations of a deaf family who converse in American sign language, and visits to a family with a child learning to speak, we are shown how language facilitates self-awareness and builds a child's understanding of the world."
