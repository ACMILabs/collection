        "Naive, prudish, yet sweet and endearing, India Bridge (Joanna Woodward) devotes every waking moment to her family. She has no understanding of current affairs because that's Walter's (Paul Newman) domain - he knows everything and he's never wrong. That's Mr and Mrs. Bridge, or is it? As their children mature and discover boys, girls, sex and silliness, India and Walter suddenly face challenging issues. When Mrs. Bridge decides to show that she is more than a doormat, her new-found independence sparks a heartwarming journey for the whole family - from curious moments, to crisis after amusing crisis. Co-starring Blythe Danner, Simon Callow, Kyra Sedgwick, Robert Sean Leonard, Margaret Welsh, Austin Pendleton and Saundra McClain. Based on the novels \"Mr Bridge\" and \"Mrs Bridge\" by Evan S. Connell."
