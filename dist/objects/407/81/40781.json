        "Rambo is sent on a secret mission to help the U.S. Government find remaining Prisoners of War in Vietnam. However, although the mission is designed to fail, the bureaucrats did not take into account Rambo's fierce determination, courage and skill to bring them back - alone if necessary. Rambo is launched into the jungle and the film explodes into one fireball action sequence after another."
