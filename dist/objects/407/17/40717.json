        "Episode number 7 of Series \"The Worlds of childhood\". We learn how families bring the wider world home to children, and how they sometimes serve as a place where society's failings can begin to be reversed. Christmas Day with families in New York and Moscow serve as the background for an overview of issues relating to family structure and dynamics."
