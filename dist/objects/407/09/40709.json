        "Episode of Series \"J'accuse\". Was Vincent Van Gogh a genius or a clumsy amateur? Art historian, Griselda Pollock presents a critical and provocative look at the life and work of this celebrated artist and examines some of the myths. Van Gogh is popularly perceived as a tragic but inspirational figure who was unappreciated during his life, but has since become one of the most famous artists of all time. Pollock tries to separate the facts from the legend and shows how powerful mass media and the art market have been in shaping our attitude towards art and artists."
