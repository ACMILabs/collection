        "Short vignettes illustrate the most common mistakes young people make when they are new to the workforce. These include: calling into work sick at the last minute, chronic lateness, not following instructions and less devious forms of stealing such as taking goods and services from the store or office. There is also an emphasis on attitude and how this affects customer service."
