        "A graphic, compelling and factual account of the life of John Curtin, tracing his life from his birth in 1885, through his hellfire youth, his chequered political career and drinking problems, to the highest position in the nation. Painstakingly researched, this program features contributions from leading academics and politicians. It does not present a glamourised version of Curtin's life, but looks objectively at the man and his actions. Curtin was a man of great strength and yet his battle with drinking threatened to ruin his personal and public life. He witnessed and took part in some of the momentous events in Australian history such as the Conscription debate in World War I, and occupied the political stage with such figures as Robert Menzies and Archbishop Mannix. Narrated by Leo McKern."
