        "Episode number 19 of Series \"The Worlds of childhood\". Through historical and cross-cultural comparisons, the extent to which the concept of adolescence as a period of increased autonomy, identity development, and risk-taking, is a social construction, is examined. The biological aspects of puberty and emerging sexuality are addressed. Observes examples of adolescents in transition from family to a broader adult world."
