        "A quiet sensitive and beautifully photographed story of a man in middle age, who has reached a \"still point\" in life. Without the drive to attain the rare moments of happiness which life offers, he lapses into warm memories of a life creatively spent, inducing a sensual nostalgia which threatens to cripple him. His urban frustration takes him to an old people's home where he gives piano lessons to the daughter of a friend. But alone, yearning for the richness and depth possible in personal relationships, his dreams become haunted by Johanna, a past love. The film can be described as a journey; not of physical life, but of the individual's inner self moving towards a point of self-acceptance, despite life's disappointments and increasing loss of faculties."
