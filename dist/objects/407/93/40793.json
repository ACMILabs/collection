        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Spaceship Earth\". It's hopeful that views from space can help human beings to better understand the oceans, and to care for them more wisely than has happened with land resources. Satellites have transformed the human view of the world's oceans and coastal seas. Maps which took centuries of seagoing observations to compile are now being superceded by a constant stream of space data."
