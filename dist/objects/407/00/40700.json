        "Trams have always been a feature of Melbourne life and they have now been transformed into moving art galleries. Melbourne's Transporting Art Project involves a new series of decorated trams. Several of the artists discuss their reasons for taking part in the scheme, the themes behind their work and the unusual medium. Artists include Aleks Danko, Philip Faulks, Lin Onus, Terry Matassoni, Jenny Watson and Brett Colquhoun."
