        "The Miraculous Mellops is a fantasy tale about interplanetary co-operation, faith, trust, young love and greed. When the Mellops children, Samantha, Michael and Jason meet Moon Emissaries, Gamma Jane and Alpha Ralph, they discover that nothing will be the same again. The Moon's 2000 year old leader, 'The Grand Baby' is dying and the new ruler is believed to be a member of the Mellop family. The question is - which one? Meanwhile, the plant nursery run by father Bill Mellop and Aunt Jocelyn is experiencing problems."
