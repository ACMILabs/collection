        "Driven by the desperate social ambitions of his wife Joyce, (Maggie Smith), one act of folly turned the life of sensitive, small-town chiropodist, Gilbert Chilvers, (Michael Palin), into a nightmare. With Britain in the grip of post-war rationing, Gilbert steals Betty, a contraband pig being secretly fattened by a group of town dignitaries for a banquet to celebrate the Other Royal Wedding. But there is a price to pay. Gilbert's squeamishness, his mother-in-law's senility, and Betty's incontinence lead to trouble and Gilbert ends up with blood on his hands and the police on the doorstep."
