        "Ira Wells (Art Carney) is an ageing private eye trying to solve the murder of his ex-partner (Howard Duff), \"helped\" by Margo (Lily Tomlin), a flaky, aimless young woman. The chemistry between Carney and Tomlin is perfect and echoes of Chandler and Hammett resound in Benton's complex but likeable script. This quietly authoritative show-stopper is a marvellous comment on classics like \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"The Big Sleep\", while at the same time taking its place beside them as a superior example of the genre. Also starring Bill Macy and Eugene Roche. Co-starring Joanna Cassidy, John Considine, Ruth Nelson, Howard Duff and John Davey."
