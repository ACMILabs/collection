        "The torment, fear and severe discipline of impressionable schoolgirls at a Catholic orphanage in wartime Britain are brought vividly to the screen in \"Sacred hearts\". Sister Thomas, (Anna Massey) is a major contributor to the atmosphere of intellectual, sexual and emotional repression at the convent school, where no signs of affection are tolerated. Excellently acted and constructed, this film exposes some of the myths and rituals which make up our perceptions of convent schools. The cast also includes Katrin Carlidge and Oona Kirsh."
