        "Annually, Thailand reaps a financial reward from thousands of tourists. However, the tourism boom has had a destructive effect upon the Thai people, flora and fauna. In an effort to capture the tourist dollar, luxury resorts have been built with no regard for the lives of local inhabitants. This program looks at Phuket and its problems from a local perspective, investigating the reality behind the paradise illusion."
