        "John Ford's colourful screen adaptation of Maxwell Anderson and Laurence Stalling's raucous army comedy. James Cagney plays Captain Flagg, a hard-boiled leader of a company of US Marines stationed in France during the World War I. Dan Dailey plays the quirky newly arrived Sergeant Quirk and it is not long before the two of them are at loggerheads. When the beautiful Charmaine (Corrine Calvert) becomes the object of their attentions, the war is really on. Watch for a young Robert Wagner in one of his early screen roles."
