        "Episode number 18 of Series \"The Worlds of childhood\". Explores two worlds children must negotiate during middle childhood and adolescence; the authority of adults and the co-operation of peers. The nature of the peer group as a microsociety is analysed through a look at \"los abandonados\", a homeless and parentless group of children in Guatemala City who live in a completely peer-organized world."
