        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Spaceship Earth\". The problem of global warming has preoccupied scientists, meteorologists and environmentalists since it was considered a threat to our existence. Artificial satellites have helped provide a clearer picture. However, if more reliable forecasting shows that some countries can expect to benefit from the warming of the planet, will those countries want to prevent human impact on the climate of Spaceship Earth?"
