        "The moving story of transexual Rene Richards, the male surgeon turned female tennis luminary. It is a story of deep pain, long struggle and great bravery leading to a real victory of the human spirit. Redgrave's rivetting performance is unforgettable - aging from 22 to 54 and changing from man to woman. She imbues every gesture with dignity and truth as a transexual who did what she knew was right. Co-starring Martin Balsam, William Russ, Alice Krige, Kerrie Keane, Richard Venture, Reni Santoni and Louise Fletcher. Based on the book of the same title by Rene Richards with John Ames."
