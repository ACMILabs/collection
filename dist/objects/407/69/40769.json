        "The Curley's are a working class Dublin family headed by Dessie, (Colm Meaney), an affable plasterer with a taste for the drink, and Kay, (Ruth McCabe), who keeps their six children in line. This topsy-turvy household falls into a tailspin when 20 year-old Sharon, (Tina Kellegher) announces that she is pregnant. Tensions mount when it becomes obvious that she has no intention of revealing the child's paternity. As the time approaches for the little \"snapper' to be born, Dessie is becoming a New Age Man while Sharon learns to turn life's little \"accidents' into big achievements. This is a delightful Irish comedy, well handled by director Frears and with quality performances by Meany and Kellegher."
