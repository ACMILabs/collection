        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Fire on the rim\". In days long gone, the lack of factual explanation for the eruptions, quakes and ancilliary disasters throughout the \"ring of fire\", gave rise to myths and legends as means of coping with the impact of the erratic disturbances. Cultures both old and new have been partly shaped by such events, producing beliefs affecting the social behaviour of people living with the unpredictability of the earth. This program examines some of the fascinating stories that have emerged in these communitites."
