        "This program aims to promote Cross-Cultural Awareness and explores situations in which the actions of Aboriginal people have been misinterpreted by non-Aboriginal people in a work environment. Three scenarios highlight body language differences in a youth custody situation, bereavement issues and community relations. At the conclusion of each scene, Richard Frankland summarises and discusses pro-active measures that can be implemented to prevent such Cross-Cultural problems occurring in the future. Designed to be used by non-Aboriginal professionals to promote an understanding of cultural issues."
