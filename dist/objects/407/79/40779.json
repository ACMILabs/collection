        "This is the story of Frances Farmer, whose troubled life made headlines in the 1930s. At 16, she was an award-winning high-school student in Seattle and at 23, a rising, provocative star of stage and screen, admired for her beauty and talent. At 27, a chain of relatively insignificant events led to her arrest and involuntary committal to a mental institution. Jessica Lange delivers a powerful, harrowing performance as the tormented Frances."
