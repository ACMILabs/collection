        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Worlds of childhood\". Language, schooling and the interactions of everyday life are vehicles of acculturation that communicate values, beliefs, attitudes and expectations to children. Observing a traditional Japanese religious festival, we explore the myth and ritual which help children see their relationship to time, place and values."
