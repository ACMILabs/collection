        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Spaceship Earth\". In conjunction with modern computing power, space technology is helping scientists to create global geography. The aim is to discover how Spaceship Earth's life-support system really works, and how natural and human forces are changing it. Satellites help us to understand our planet, particularly in monitoring global weather patterns which can shift rapidly."
