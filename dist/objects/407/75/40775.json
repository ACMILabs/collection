        "A bittersweet Neil Simon comedy about alcoholic Broadway actress, Georgia Hines' (Marsha Mason), struggle to remain sober and who six years earlier relinquished custody of her daughter Polly (Kristy McNichol) in order to \"straighten out her life.\" Georgia is about to star in a play about her turbulent romantic past, when Polly decides to move in. There are good times, pretending to be sisters to confuse a pair of college boys, and there are tough times, when they confront the past and the truth about the lost years. Through it all, with humour and warmth, they come to know one another again. Superior performances by James Coco as a gay failed actor, Joan Hackett as an aging Park Avenue beauty, Georgia's \"perennially out-of-work\" friends, and David Dukes as boyfriend David. Screenplay by Neil Simon, loosley based on his play \"The Gingerbread Lady.\""
