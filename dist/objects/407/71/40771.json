        "In what has been hailed as his best performance, Academy Award nominee, Dennis Hopper stars as Paris Trout, a man riddled with hatred and obsessed with inflicting cruelty on those who dare to cross him. With a magnificent supporting cast including Barbara Hershey and Ed Harris, Paris Trout was applauded by critics worldwide as a must-see, chilling, erotic thriller. \"In this spectacular character study of a man whose soul is rotting with pure evil, Hopper gives a performance of such magnitude that it's painful to watch and impossible to look away.\" - Michael Dare, Billboard Magazine. Based on the novel by Pete Dexter. Co-starring Tina Lifford, Darnita Henry, Eric Ware, Ronreaco Lee and Ray McKinnon."
