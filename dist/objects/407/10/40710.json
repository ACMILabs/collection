        "Episode of Series \"J'accuse\". Nicholas Kenyon presents a critical look at the life and work of Mozart, exposing some of the myths that surround the famous composer. He rejects the notion of a saintly genius, who sacrificed himself for his art and died a pauper. When considered in the context of the historical period he lived in, Mozart emerges as a more \"down to earth\", practical composer, who wrote music for money. The program includes comments from authorities in the music world and explores the reasons for Mozart's popular appeal."
