        "Mr. Dump is not the Grand Baby after all. The Grand Baby passes away and the Moonlings are left to their own devices. Before he disappears, the Grand Baby gives Gamma Jane the secret code which reveals which of the Mellops is to replace him. Michael and Harmony expose Mr. Dump's illegal activities, and Mr. Dump's latest money scheme fails. Michael works out the code and reveals which Mellop family member is to return to the Moon as the new Grand Baby. In an energy transference, the new Grand Baby goes to the Moon and Harmony returns home. Gamma Jane and Alpha Ralph leave and Dad goes berserk over the lunar phonebill."
