        "This is the dramatic story of the anticlimactic life of a greedy gold prospector after he has struck it rich. Gene Hackman performs with credit as a man whose jackpot fortune leaves him bored, surly and paranoid of being exploited by everybody, including his family. Jane Lapotaire plays his alcoholic wife and Theresa Russell his woman-daughter who rebelliously marries a man her father sees only as a merciless fortune hunter. This is an unforgettable tale of the illusory nature of power and the all-consuming violence of possession - whether it be of love or gold. Based on a book by Marshall Houts."
