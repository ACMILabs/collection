        "Al Capone reigned as King in Prohibition Chicago, 1931. A team of determined government investigators, led by a young Federal Treasury agent is committed to bringing Capone to justice. Unbribable and incorruptible, they are \"The Untouchables\". Kevin Costner stars as the legendary Eliot Ness in this bold action thriller by famed director Brian De Palma. Along with Costner, Sean Connery gives an award winning performance as tough beat cop Jimmy Malone, while Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith are the rest of the team. Robert De Niro is chilling as the sadistic but seductive Al Capone; a man who smiles when he kills."
