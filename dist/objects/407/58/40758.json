        "The dingo is currently hunted as a pest in all states of Australia, and its survival as a pure breed is endangered. This documentary presents a case for the dingo's protection. It looks at the history of the dingo, its relationship with Australian Aborigines, and at the current dingo erradication program. Interviews people who are involved with the conservation of dingoes, including people who keep them as pets. This is another early film from renowned Australian filmmaker, Paul Cox."
