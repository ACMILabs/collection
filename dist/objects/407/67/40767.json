        "Thanks to the magic potion made by a Druid, Asterix the tiny Gaul has mighty powers. With his pal Obelix they make life miserable for the Roman soldiers unlucky enough to live near their village. This adventure finds our heroes in Egypt. The Egyptians are famous for their pyramids, but this doesn't impress the Romans when every other building in Egypt is in danger of falling down. So when Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, has a blazing row with Julius Caesar, the Roman Emperor, it's the start of an amazingly funny adventure for Asterix. His task is to build a palace fit for a queen in only a few weeks and win Cleopatra's bet! Based on the popular books by Goscinny and Underzo."
