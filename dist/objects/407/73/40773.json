        "Once again Branagh has successfully brought Shakespeare to modern audiences in a way which will inspire and enthuse even those unfamiliar with the plays. \"Much ado about nothing\" is a romantic comedy which is full of energy, largely due to its inspired casting. The idyllic Italian countryside is the setting for the story of Hero and Claudio, a young couple whose impending marriage is thrown into jeopardy when Claudio is deceived by his brother Don John. Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson, Robert Sean Leonard, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale, Brian Blessed and Richard Briers star in this delightful adaptation while Michael Keaton and Ben Elton in cameos, steal the film with their brilliant comic caricatures."
