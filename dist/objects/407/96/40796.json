        "Mr Dump's waste dump business involves dealings with some very shady characters and strange waste materials. Harmony and Michael are having doubts about the business. The Mellops are trying to find Aunt Jocelyn's magic toothpaste with the linguistic powers. Sam decides that as the Grand Baby is getting weaker, she will leave her family and return to the Moon as she is convinced that she is the Grand Baby. However the Grand Baby test fails on the Mellops and it appears that Mr. Dump may be the likely candidate."
