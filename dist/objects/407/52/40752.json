        "La Ronde is a romantic drama with an all-star cast lead by Jane Fonda, Jean Sorel and Catherine Spaak. It is set in pre-World War I Paris when the city was caught in a fever pitch of gaiety and affairs of the heart. Based on Arthur Schintzler's famous stage play \"Reigen\", the screenplay is given a fresh viewpoint by applying French psychology to the pursuit of love in its various forms. Dubbed in English."
