        "It is 1949. The privations of war are over and there is money to be made! Two conmen have been successfully cheating bookies at racetracks across the United States. When they stop at a small town called Tainuia Junction, their luck runs out. After waging a war with the local police and the owner of the town casino, they enlist the aid of the Tainuia Kid, a Zorro nut and the wildest comic ever to ride the ranges. It is the bad guys versus the not-so-bad guys in this off-the-wall comedy that takes the viewer on a rollercoaster of laughs against a backdrop of horseracing, gambling, fast cars and loose women. Starring Billy T. James, Peter Bland, Phillip Gordon and Marshall Napier. Based on the novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson."
