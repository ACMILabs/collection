        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Fire on the rim\". The lands around the \"ring of fire\" have long attracted people by their beauty, natural riches and promise of great wealth, despite the perilious threat of natural disaster. In Bali, volcanoes have created fertile lands, whereas in Papua New Guinea, centuries of activity have resulted in a gold mountain, the richest mine in the world. In contrast, the movement of the earth's plates have resulted in the geothermic pools and geysers in New Zealand, which have become popular tourist attractions, as have the famous volcanoes of Hawaii."
