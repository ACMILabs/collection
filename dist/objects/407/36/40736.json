        "Young children learn to recognise, solve and enjoy mathematical problems by putting mathematics in a meaningful context. Viewers are engaged in story-related problems involving numbers, measurement and geometry. Ten episodes of 15 minutes duration dealing with a number of concepts. Based on familiar or traditonal tales, children are given challenges to solve, such as how many different ways can the seven dwarfs go to a picnic if they have two cars. Suitable for Lower Primary students."
