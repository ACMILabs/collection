        "Ten short segments dramatise a typical situation in which a tourist may find themselves whilst travelling in Indonesia. The purpose is to present aspects of colloquial language in a meaningful context. Scripted conversations include asking directions, visiting a post office, buying food and snacks and eating in a warung. It should be noted that the language and expressions are \"real life\" Indonesian from the city of Yogyakarta. Students will also gain some appreciation of the cultural differences between Australia and Indonesia. Accompanied by a Study Guide."
