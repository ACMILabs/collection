        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Spaceship Earth\". From space, the way the continents fit together is apparent. The movements of continents set the stage for the present climatic epoch, with its particular distribution of mountain ranges and ocean currents. Satellites make possible the first global watch on volcanoes, from sparsely inhabited regions to the most populous areas."
