        "Two programs designed to examine aspects of Medieval life in Britain. The Magna Carta is one of the most influential historical documents. For the first time, the absolute powers of the King were legally set out. The Magna Carta is linked with not only with the creation of a limited form of \"democracy\" in medieval society, but with the myths and legends of an evil Prince John and Robin Hood. The second program looks at a masterpiece of medieval manuscript illumination, \"The Lutteral Psalter.\" This manuscript is not only an exceptional work of art, but offers us a window into medieval society and its activities."
