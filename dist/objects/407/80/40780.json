        "Based on the novel by David Morrell, \"First Blood\" began a trilogy of action films starring Sylvester Stallone as the tough but troubled Vietnam war veteran, John Rambo. Scarred from his horrific experiences in Vietnam, Rambo is abused by a power hungry \"red-necked\" sherriff in a small town who imprisons him. However, a caged Rambo is a dangerous beast and when he escapes the explosive action begins. Putting credibility aside, this is a prime example of the action movie genre which launched the careers of actors like Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Van Damme."
