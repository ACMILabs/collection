        "This award-winning program takes a stimulating look at trees from a variety of viewpoints. It not only shows the importance of trees to the environment, showing how the trees purify the air and process water, but also to culture, religion, industry, the economy and the future. Taking a global perspective, the program discusses the worldwide use of trees and the threat of deforestation. Suitable for Senior Primary and Junior Secondary students."
