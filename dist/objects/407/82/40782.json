        "Considered by many critics to be the best of the three films in the Rambo: 'First Blood trilogy.' The film's plot takes on a righteous turn as the \"universal soldier\" Rambo seeks to liberate a group of Afghans from under the regime of a brutal Russian General. The action sequences in this film are both spectacular and terrifying, and the enigmatic, not altogether two dimensional character of Rambo rises above the conflagration with more style than in the previous films."
