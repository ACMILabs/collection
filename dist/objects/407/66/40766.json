        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Fire on the rim\". People have devised many methods of surviving the upheavals in the \"ring of fire\". In Alaska, earthquakes are so extreme, that it is an ideal location for continuous research. In Chile and Hawaii, research focuses on ocean and tidal problems. Japan and New Zealand offer insight into anti-quake designs. In San Francisco, planning, communication, training and organisation have assisted in reducing risk to life and property, as well as preparing for future problems."
