        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Spaceship Earth\". People have cleared forests for dwellings, firewood and farming. Can human needs in such areas be weighed against the needs of the planet and its survival? Satellite images worldwide show forest fires and forest clearance, revealing the extent of forest destruction. The program explores the impact of this on the Earth and on the native peoples who live in affected regions."
