        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Spaceship Earth\". An attempt to examine the impact of future human population growth. If the Earth's population is set to double in the next few decades, how can it support this increase? Remote sensing allows scientists to see the patterns of population distribution across the globe as they detect the lights from cities and towns from space."
