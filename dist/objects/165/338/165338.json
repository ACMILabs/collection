        "The 50th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan is in 2016 and to commemorate presented here are a collection of works from the Australian War Memorial and two stories from the ACMI Collection. Young soldiers in the jungle, loading munitions, in the field with 'choppers' flying around them or having some down-time at camp are shown. Hear from the diggers themselves years later in the short ACMI Digital Storytelling titles."
