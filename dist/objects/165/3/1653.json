        "Canadian horror director David Cronenberg puts in an impressive performance as a bored carpert factory executive whose daily routine involves minor flirtations with his secretary and cronic masturbation in the privacy of his office. This explicit and ultimately melancholy tale of pornography and loneliness is intercut with a 1960s era stag loop called 'The bellboy and the bored housewife' and features the film's star reminiscing about her experiences in the sex trade."
