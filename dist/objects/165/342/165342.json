    "description": [
        "In Vietnam thirty seven wounded Australian soldiers in an American hospital at Vung Tau, received gifts from pretty girls during an official visit by the deputy mayor of Vung Tau. The commander of the Australian Logistic Support Group, Lieutenant Colonel D.R. Rouse, greeted the vice mayor, Major Thieu, outside the 36th Evacuation hospital. In wards, Private Kevin Graham of Cowra, New South Wales, was the first to receive flowers and a Vietnamese doll from the girls and the well wishes of the people of Vung Tau from Major Thieu. Many of the wounded were from Delta Company of the Sixth Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, which repulsed an overwhelming attack by a North Vietnamese battalion. Some other soldiers who received gifts were Private Ron Carne, of South Yarra, Melbourne - Private Carey Johnson of Newcastle, Sergeant Jim Todd of Enoggera, Queensland - Private Colin Brown of Brisbane - Private Brian Hornung of Rockhampton - Private John Cash of Brisbane and Lance Corporal Robert Davies of Gympie. American nurse Lieutenant Dianne Parrott who has cared for many Australian wounded, watched the presentations. Source: AWM"
