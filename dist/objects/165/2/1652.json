        "This video work is a mysterious, ghostly geography of cinematic shadows. Silhouettes that never quite take shape shift and glide across the screen, anaemic figures, seen in the negative, forced to wander between narratives restlessly but caught in a loop. These remnants from faint memories of filmic melodrama are a living dead confined to a space they cannot leave. They are the secret that lies between stories."
