        "This showreel is a light hearted look into the Australian experience of South Vietnam through the eyes of those who were there. Using some of the home movies in the Memorial\u2019s film collection and actuality recordings of the time \u2013 including the voice of a young trooper, recording an audio letter for his parents - we take you behind the battle lines and into the mess tent. Maybe you\u2019ll even see someone you know. Source: AWM"
