        "This innovative, intelligent and visually sumptuous horror film is not a traditional werewolf movie, it explores the psychosexual undercurrents of the classic \"Little Red Riding Hood\" fairytale. Set almost entirely within the dreams and fantasy of thirteen year old Rosaleen who is stirred by passion; it foretells the fate of all young girls who stray from the forest path. Director Jordan is a distinctive stylist who knows how to convey the complex emotions and simmering sensuality of Angela Carter's story. Stars Angela Lansbury as Granny and Sarah Patterson as Rosaleen. Screenplay by Angela Carter and Neil Jordan, adapted from a story by Angela Carter."
