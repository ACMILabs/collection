        "This two volume collector's edition contains the film itself and a 49 minute long report on the making of \"Akira\" featuring interviews with the director, the techniques he used and character profiles. \"Akira\" is set in 2019 in the city of Neo-Tokyo which is about to explode. A group of motorcycle-riding teenagers living in Neo-Tokyo tries to stop one of the gang who has run amok after becoming empowered with telekinetic powers in a government experiment. Technically spectacular, with colourful animation \"Akira\" is a must see for adult animation buffs."
