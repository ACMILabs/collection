        "In the savage and deadly world of gangland kings, the man at the top is the ruler, only for as long as he controls everything in his territory. For that man, the rewards are infinite - but so are the dangers. Harold Shand, played by Bob Hoskins, London racketeer, is at the peak of his powers. He is on the verge of a major deal with some Americans, to finance the total redevelopment of the London docklands into an enormous leisure complex. But on one long, never-ending day of terror, Good Friday, he is to see his empire crack and crumble. Co-starring Helen Mirren."
