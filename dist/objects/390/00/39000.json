        "Loosely based upon the book by David R. Reuben, this Woody Allen classic answers some of the timeless (and tasteless) questions about society's oldest taboo: sex. It consists of a series of vignettes, one of which has Gene Wilder experiencing a woolly love affair with a sheep, and another has Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds showing an unorthodox view of sex - from the inside out. Woody Allen once said about sex: \"It's the most fun I've ever had without laughing.\" Allen's confronting style may not sit well with all viewers - you may find yourself squirming uncomfortably in your seat at some of the scenes - and it may not be everything you always wanted to know about sex, but as a comedy it's everything you've always known about Woody Allen."
