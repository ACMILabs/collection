        "A documentary tracing the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany. The National Socialists effectively utilised film, radio and spectacle in order to create a propaganda involving the majority of Aryan, German-speaking people: a vast theatre of fascism and racism. The film traces the philosophical development of Hitler, as well as the history of World War II (including footage on the occupation of Poland, Czechoslavakia and France, and footage of the decisive battles of Stalingrad and Normandy). The most devastating material explores the fate of the Jewish people under Nazi occupation, including footage of the Warsaw Ghetto and the concentration camps where millions of Jews, political prisoners and \"social deviants\" were incarcerated and exterminated. It is the power of the stark black and white visuals which fully expose the inhumanity that underlied Nazi philosophy. WARNING: THIS VIDEO FEATURES DISTURBING AND CONFRONTING FOOTAGE OF WAR CRIMES PERPETUATED BY THE NAZI REGIME."
