        "Based on the long-suppressed sections of Anais Nin's diaries \"Henry & June\" explores the erotic life of two individuals who became 20th Century literary giants. Upon meeting unconvential American author Henry Miller (Fred Ward) in Paris, 1931, Anais Nin (Maria de Medeiros) boldly embarks on a passionate voyage of self-discovery. In their defiant search for new truths, Anais and Henry are tantalized by Henry's enigmatic and hauntingly sensual wife, June (Uma Thurman)"
