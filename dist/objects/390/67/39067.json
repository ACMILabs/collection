        "Woody Allen plays Alan, a fanatical movie buff whose wife has just left him. He has an outrageous recurring hallucination of Humphrey Bogart coaching him on how to make it with the ladies. His married friends, Dick and Linda fix him up with several eligible young ladies, but his self-confidence is low and it makes for a series of hilarious tragi-comic scenes where he fails dismally at every attempt he makes to impress. Eventually he discovers that there has been one woman all along who is right for him - his best friend's wife! The final scene is a brilliant spoof of \"Casablanca\", complete with trench coats and heavy fog. Also stars Diane Keaton as Linda."
