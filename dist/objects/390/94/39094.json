        "Dustin Hoffman stars as college graduate Benjamin Braddock, who spends his first summer out of school being seduced by the wife of his father's best friend. He also falls in love with the woman's daughter to further complicate his life. Nominated for 7 Academy Awards, The Graduate won the Oscar for Best Direction, (Mike Nichols), and its brilliant score by Simon and Garfunkle won 3 Grammies. Ann Bancroft is the memorable Mrs. Robinson, with Katherine Ross as her daughter and rival for Benjamin's affection. \"The Graduate\" is a modern comedy classic to be enjoyed again and again."
