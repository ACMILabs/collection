        "Enter the enchanting world of Willow. An epic tale of pure adventure that takes us deep into the world of sorcery and scary monsters, hope and heroism. Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) is a small Nelwyn farmer with big dreams to be a sorcerer. His chance arrives when he is made guardian of a baby girl, Elora Danan, who is destined to fulfill a prophecy and bring down the evil sorceress Queen Bavmarda (Jean Marsh) and her daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) . It is Willow's task to keep the child safely out of the reach of the evil Queen, and so begins an incredible journey of fierce battles, near misses, danger and romance. Aided by Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), Willow matches wits and strength with the forces of evil for the life of a child whose destiny could change the world. This is a lavish film jam-packed with special effects by the Industrial Light and Magic team, and will delight children of all age with its heartwarming message of the love of a parent protecting their child from the dangers of the world."
