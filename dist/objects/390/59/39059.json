        "After inheriting a mine in Crete, a young English writer (Alan Bates) goes to the Mediterranean island to inspect his property. There he meets Alexis Zorba (Anthony Quinn), a gregarious Greek who persuades Basil that he can help him re-establish the mine. Their encounters with the village community, including an ageing French coquette Hortense (Lila Kedrova) and a beautiful widow (Irene Papas), are by turns amusing and horrifying. Based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis."
