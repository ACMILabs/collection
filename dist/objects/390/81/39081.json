        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Legacy\". In this final episode of Michael Woods' philosophical exploration of civilisation, he turns to the dominant culture of today - the culture of the West and the deep strain of violence which lies at its roots. He traces Western history back to the Greeks who had imbibed ideas from Asia of the cosmos as a harmonious whole, through Alexander, Rome, the dominance of Christianity in the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution to the present time when liberal democratic capitalism seems to have no rival. But are the values of the West enough to guarantee the future of the planet or should we learn from the past and from other civilisations?"
