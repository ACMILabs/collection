        "This is an epic re-creation of the famous Nazi judicial trial, featuring an extraordinary international cast which includes Spencer Tracy, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Maximillian Schell, Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster. Capturing twelve Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, the film won Oscars for Best Actor (Schell) and Best Screenplay. In this stirring courtroom drama, acclaimed producer/director Stanely Kramer dared to ask one of the most emotionally charged questions of our century: who was responsible for the Holocaust? The story centres on the trial of four Nazi judges accused of war crimes, men who willingly distorted the law to perpetuate the greatest atrocity ever committed against humanity. Judgment at Nuremberg has galvanised audiences around the world with its poignant historical commentary, riveting entertainment and compelling performances."
