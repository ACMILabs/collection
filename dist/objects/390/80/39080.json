        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Legacy\". Central American civilisation developed quite independently from those of the rest of the world, yet bears striking resemblances to other great civilisations, from the great pyramids it built, and the invention of writing to the relationship of man, earth and the heavens, expressed in ritual and \"the mathematics of eternity\". In spite of the disastrous past 500 years of history, the descendants of the Maya and the Aztecs have kept faith with their burden of time, through their shamen, and their blend of Christianity and the old religions, in spite of the pressures of western consumer society."
