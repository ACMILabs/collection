        "An assault on the senses and the emotions, this film is at once bold and subtle, comic and confounding, disturbing and ultimately deeply moving. A film whose triumph is its originality and uniqueness in dealing with classical material that has seen hundreds of permutations since Bram Stoker first published his novel \"Dracula\" nearly a century ago. Each delicious shudder takes the viewer deeper into the gorgeously sombre nightmare world that director Herzog has painted in delicate and fragile tones, deriving much from the original F.W. Murnau \"Nosferatu\" silent classic. Stars Klaus Kinski and Isabelle Adjani. English version (dubbed)."
