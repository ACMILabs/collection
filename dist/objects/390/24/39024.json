        "Episode of Series \"Forever Ealing\". A black comedy from the Ealing Studios which features Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers. An innocent little old lady who takes in a sinister lodger finds out that he and four friends have committed a robbery. Once they realise she knows everything, they plot to kill her. However, just because she is the archetypal genteel old lady pensioner, doesn't mean that she is quite as harmless as she seems. Also stars Jack Warner, Katie Johnson and Frankie Howerd."
