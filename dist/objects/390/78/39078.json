        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Legacy\". The civilisation of ancient Egypt was conservative in nature, drawing its optimistic base from the annual flooding of the Nile which brought sustenance to the nation. The unchanging stability of the cosmos was symbolised by divine kingship, centralised power and the massive buildings which represented that power. The many surrendered power to the few - a condition which still exists for the majority of people today. Similarly almost everyone today, shares the ancient Egyptians' concern for life after death. Yet the conquests of Alexander, and the synthesis of cultures which followed, culminating in the dominance of Islam have done little to change these basic beliefs."
