        "This surreal, darkly comic psychological thriller stars Theresa Russell as a young woman, permanently scarred by a teenage rape, which resulted in a pregnancy and the forced removal of her baby. Obsessed by the loss of her child, and married to an equally, but differently obsessed doctor husband, (model trains and playfully masochistic sessions with his nurse), she is confronted one day by a mysterious stranger who claims to be her long-lost son. It seems he also has been obsessed with finding his mother, but at this point reality and fantasy become confused and a deadly and erotic game begins ... Also stars Gary Oldman and Christopher Lloyd with Sandra Bernhardt in a cameo role. Dennis Potter wrote the script."
