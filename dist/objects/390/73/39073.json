        "White Christmas is a treasury of Irving Berlin classics, among them \"Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep\", \"Sisters\", \"Blue Skies\", and the beloved holiday song \"White Christmas\". Two talented song-and-dance men (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) team up after the war. One winter they join forces with a sister act (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen) and trek to Vermont for a white Christmas. The result is \"the stuff dreams are made of\"."
