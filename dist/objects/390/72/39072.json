        "Swedish dialogue, English subtitles. This is a special two-part set containing the full length television version of Fanny and Alexander, running in total over 5 hours, 2 hours longer than the theatrical release version. Told through the eyes of a small boy, this most personal of Bergman's works is both autobiographical and an artistic reference point. Set during turn-of- the-century Sweden, the story is about the well-to-do, loving and ebullient Ekdahl family. When the actor-father of 10 year old Alexander and 8 year old Fanny dies, their mother marries a sadistic minister. His cruelty leads Grandmother Eckdahl's Jewish friend and lover to rescue them. Happiness and balance is restored. Announced as Bergman's final film, it offers a superlative culmination of his 37 years as one of cinema's greatest artists. Oscar Winner 1982 for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. Stars Pernilla Allwin, Bertil Guve, Ewa Froling, Jan Malmsjo, Erland Josephson."
