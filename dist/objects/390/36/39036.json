        "A comedy melodrama of the tragic life of Francine Fishpaw (Divine) an obese housewife whose mere existence burdens her so-called loved ones. Unjustly mistreated by her chauvinistic husband Elmer who runs the local porn theatre and money hungry mother, La Rue, she turns to the bottle for love and support. Life is on the downslide for the Fishpaw household with son Dexter, the reputed neighbourhood phantom foot stomper, daughter Lulu, a crazed pregnant disco groupie and the family dog resorting to suicide. Then, in a Cinderella fantasy, Francine meets her Polyester Prince, Todd Tomorrow (Tab Hunter) and blissfully, they fall in love. Has Francine finally found true meaning to life and happiness or will she return to an unsavoury lifestyle with Elmer, Dexter and Lulu? Co-starring Edith Massey, David Samson, Mary Garlington and Ken King."
