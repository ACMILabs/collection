        "This nightmarish futuristic satire effectively blurs all lines between illusion and reality. Sam Lowrey, an unambitious government statistician, chooses to ignore the decaying drone-like world around him. Whenever real life becomes too oppressive, Sam fantasizes about being a superhero forever rescuing beautiful Jill Layton. When the omnipresent computer that controls everything in the \"real\" world malfunctions it causes the mistaken-identity assassination of an innocent citizen. When Sam routinely investigates the error, he meets Jill, literally the girl of his dreams. It turns out, however, that she is an associate of a terrorist whom the computer had originally intended to target for execution. Cast includes: Jonathan Pryce, Michael Palin, Kim Greist, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins and Robert De Niro."
