        "From director James Ivory comes the magical and compelling film version of E.M. Forster's classic novel; beautifully produced and brilliantly acted. The stoical and unyielding Mr. Wilcox (Anthony Hopkins) is part of the rich, ruling class which traditionally stomps on those who are weaker, his repression causes him to lash out at those who are not. The working class Mr. Leonard Baste is a dreamer, imaginative and intelligent, but he is trapped by his class and the ignorance of others. Two sisters, Margaret and Helen Schlegel (Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham-Carter) form a precarious bridge between these two men's worlds and the result is a compelling and fascinating story about love and betrayal, privilege and poverty, a masterpiece of entertainment. Also stars Vanessa Redgrave, James Wilby and Samuel West."
