        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Not suitable for adults\". This series of comic sketches and songs attempts to show the positive and negative outcomes of peer pressure on teenagers. While friends are valued, the message is clear; individuality should never be threatened by group pressure. Although the program offers few solutions to the problem of peer pressure, it does present the issue from a teenager's perspective."
