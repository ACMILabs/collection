        "The X-rated cartoon based on the characters from Robert Crumb's comic strip became the animated world's Portnoy's Complaint, being the first animated feature in the history of motion pictures to contain nudity and four-letter words. Since its release, it has become an adult \"classic\" - a film everyone wants to see simply because it was naughty and often banned. In the 1960's flower power era of sex, drugs and rock and roll, Fritz is the coolest cat in New York - poet, muso, dope-smoker and sex hound. In his East village apartment, he and his band engage in an orgy and are raided by the Police. He sets fire to his school, incites the local blacks to riot against white oppression and then leaves the Big Apple for the open road where he becomes ensnared by terrorist bikies! Features a rock musical especially written for the film and the voices of Skip Hinnant, Rosetta LeNoire, John McCurry and Phil Seuling."
