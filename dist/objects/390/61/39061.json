        "Pepa, an actress, is tough, sexy and desperate. Her longtime lover and male chauvinist rat, Ivan, to whom she is pregnant, has walked out leaving only a bland message on her answering machine. Pepa simply cannot resist fighting back and is determined to find Ivan. She decides to sublet her apartment. The first couple to look at the apartment are Carlos, Ivan's 20 year old son, whom Pepa had never known about, and Marisa, Carlos' uptight virgin fiancee. To make things even more delirious, Pepa's best friend, Candella, comes looking for refuge from the police. Into this maelstrom of tension walks Lucia, Ivan's ex-wife... A raucously funny depiction of melodramatic and crazy women who get their revenge any way they can. Stars Carmen Maura and Antonio Banderas. In Spanish with English subtitles."
