        "The frenzied, all-out dancing, all rockin' rememberance of Baltimore 1962. A time infested with glamour crazed teens to whom TV was everything. Featuring an electric combination of talents that include Divine, Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry, set around Baltimore's coolest pop show, \"The Corny Collins Show\". Happy teen viewers thrill to watching their towns' coolest teens rock to the country's trendiest new dances. One such viewer is Tracy Turnblad, a tubby teenager who lives her dream by getting her big shot on the show. However, Tracy finds herself in bitter competition with the show's reigning teen queen, bitchy Amber Von Tussle. They battle not only for the crown but also for the true love of teen hunk, Link."
