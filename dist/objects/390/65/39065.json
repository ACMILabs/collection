        "Award winning actor Denzel Washington gives a rivetting performance in Spike Lee's breathtaking film about music and love. Talented trumpeter, (Washington), is obsessed by his music and is indecisive about his girlfriends Indigo and Clarke. When he is forced to come to the aid of his manager and childhood friend (Spike Lee), Bleek finds his world more fragile than he ever imagined. Stunning cinematography, a rousing score and superlative performances combine in an unforgettable feast of the senses. Also stars John Turturro and Wesley Snipes."
