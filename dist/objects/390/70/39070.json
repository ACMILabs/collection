        "A relentless journey into the banalities of everyday life - a film about the body - eating, excreting, sex, violence, masturbation and terror. The voyeuristic camera lewdly follows Phillip Dean, an extraordinarily ordinary office worker, to the office, to the toilet, to the same French restaurant every night and finally to bed. The film depicts the \"body\" as an all consuming machine which has its basis in the consumption and ejaculation of moisture in the forms of salt, saliva, sweat and sperm. Starring Phillip Dean, Jean Kitson, Lyndal Barry, Robert Chuter, Daniel Scharf, Cheyanne Armitage, Nicholas Kanigan and Martina Murray. Best Australian Film - 1988 Melbourne Film Festival."
