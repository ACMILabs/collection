        "A quintiessential \"swinging 60's\" comedy, starring Lynn Redgrave in the title role of Georgy. Gauche and out of place in her flatmate Meredith's sexually liberated world, Georgy longs for a traditional romance with a husband and children. Meredith, (Charlotte Rampling), lives for the moment and the next man. Currently that man is Jos played by Alan Bates. When Meredith becomes pregnant, it is Georgy who becomes maternal, and the object of not only Jos's affection, but that of a lascivious wealthy widower played by James Mason. Ultimately, Georgy gets all that she desires. Lynn Redgrave touchingly conveys Georgy's warmth and naivety, while Rampling gives an excellent performance as the moody and insensitive Meredith. This is an effervescent film, well known for the title song performed by The Seekers."
