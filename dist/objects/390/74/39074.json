        "This musical version of Charles Dickens' timeless and beloved story is a lavish and lively production starring Albert Finney. Ebenezer Scrooge, the miserable old miser, takes a frightening journey through Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. He realizes there is still hope for his salvation on Christmas Day. He dons a Father Christmas costume and visits the home of Bob Cratchit, his loyal employee, to spread his new-found joy to the whole family, especially Tiny Tim. Music by Leslie Bricusse."
