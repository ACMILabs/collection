        "Somewhere in the wastelands of the Soviet Union lives the worst rock- \"rock-'n\"-roll\" band in the world; an outfit with no audience and no commercial potential. They decide to bury their national sentiments and go to the United States to try their luck. This film is the riotiously funny account of their journey over the ocean and across the continent; a story of steamy bars and honest folks in the backyards of the Hamburger Nation."
