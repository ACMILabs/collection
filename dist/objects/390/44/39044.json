        "Beginning with small betrayals, infidelity, lies... and ending in murder; this is a bold and unflinching expose on the choices people make. Martin Landau is a respected, wealthy doctor whose world begins to crumble around him when his mistress (Anjelica Huston) threatens him with blackmail. Desperate, he must decide whether he can face getting rid of her - permanently! As a balance to this chilling tragedy, Woody Allen stars as an insecure documentary filmmaker about to tackle the hardest job of his life - filming a glowing tribute to the man he hates most in the world - his brother-in-law, played by Alan Alda. Also stars Caroline Aaron, Joanna Gleason, Claire Bloom, Jenny Nichols, Mia Farrow, Jerry Orbach and Sam Waterston."
