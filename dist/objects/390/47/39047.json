        "The story of four ordinary men who embark on a canoe trip in the backwoods of America, determined to test themselves against a wilderness they only think they understand. Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox play the four friends whose three-dimensional roles heighten the film's impact and broader significance. Director John Boorman, renowned for his mastery of visual beauty and compelling mystery, maintains a narrative tension that never falters. This film is like a phantom; its images linger in our minds long after the river slows and returns us to real life. Screenplay by James Dickey, based upon his novel."
