        "Joe Orton's plays eroticised the \"kitchen-sink\" realist theatre of the 1960s. In \"Entertaining Mr. Sloane\" a young man lodges with a safely bourgeois brother and sister (Harry Edwards and Beryl Reid) only to find that they are both interested in seducing him, and they will let nothing get in their way of satisfying their sexual desires. Though it is as theatre that Orton's work is most successful, this film is still a satisfying translation of his work onto the screen. The cast is magnificent, especially the wonderful Beryl Reid."
