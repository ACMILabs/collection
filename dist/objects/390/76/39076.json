        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Legacy\". Filmed just before and just after the Gulf War, the first program in this series looks at the effects of \"civilisation\" on the landscape, and the rise and fall of civilisations, particularly in relation to Iraq where civilisation began. The first cities were built 5000 years ago on the banks of the Euphrates in Southern Iraq, and city life soon transformed the human race with the glorious cultures of Mesopotamia such as Ur, Nineveh and Babylon. Michael Woods explores these ancient cultures and the legacy they gave to the history of Iraq right up to the Gulf War. The program is presented in two parts."
