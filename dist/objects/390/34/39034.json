        "This video contains two Australian short films. \"Lover Boy\" portrays a painfully impossible liaison between a 16 year old boy and a 45 year old woman. Brought together by loneliness and their bleak environment, they find some short-lived comfort in each other's arms. Stars Noah Taylor, Gillian Jones, Ben Mendelsohn. \"Bonza\" gives a view of Australian suburban family life through the eyes of a dog. Stars Peter Rowsthorn, Peter Green, Maureen Edwards, Susie Dee."
