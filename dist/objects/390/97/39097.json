        "Two more episodes in the adventures of the socially inept Mr. Bean. \"Merry Christmas Mr. Bean\" gives real meaning to the saying that Christmas shopping is a nightmare. In \"Mr. Bean in room 426\" the great rubber-faced one makes himself at home in a hotel room and is caught with his pants down (literally!). Watch for a cameo appearance by Danny La Rue and hear the great impersonator speak as you have never heard him before."
