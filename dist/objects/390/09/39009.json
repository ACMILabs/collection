        "Felix Crabtree (Michael Lake) and his sister Betty (Rhys Davis) live in a dust blown shack admist a vast desert. Felix is a wheelchair bound \"Dr. Strangelove\" character, obsessed with flying, while Betty is paranoid, child-like, living in a world of her own, surrounded by religous relics and obsessed by the past. When a weatherbeaten fugitive named Smith (\"The Norm\") staggers towards the homestead and collapses, Felix and Betty revive him. Felix learns that he and Smith share a desire to escape - Smith from his hunters and Felix from the dusty world he is forced to inhabit. They begin to build a flying machine to carry them to a new world but Felix soon realises that it is not just physical difficulties confining them to the desert."
