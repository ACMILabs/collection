        "Tough, potent and shocking; an haunting look at the American Dream - turned nightmare. As Ratso Rizzo, scrounging, sleazy small-time con-man with big dreams, Dustin Hoffman gives one of the most unforgettable performances of his career. And as Joe Buck, the good-looking, naively charming Texas \"cowboy\" convinced that he is the salvation of many lonely, love-starved New York women, Jon Voight is magnificent. Living on the tattered fringe of society, an unlikely bond grows between these two outcasts that is powerful and poignant. From first frame to last, this multi-award winning film is a transcendant, compassionate film masterpiece that hits right at the heart."
