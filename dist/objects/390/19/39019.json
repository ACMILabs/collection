        "Who else but Woody Allen would invade the land and spirit of Tolstoy and have audiences laughing all over the world? Meet Boris Grushenko (Allen), the son of a farmer in the Eighteenth Century Russia in hot pursuit of the meaning of life... and his sultry cousin Sonja (Diane keaton). Along the way, such soul-searching questions are posed as \"if Christ was a carpenter, what would he charge for bookshelves?\" and perhaps more importantly \"Are there girls after death?\" Boris reluctantly enlists during the Napoleonic Wars. Hilarious twists of fate lead Boris into battle, inadvertant heroism, bedroom escapades and a scheme to kill Napoleon himself. With its visually impressive and historical setting, this film is a comedy of epic proportions. Also stars Jessica Harper. Written by Woody Allen."
