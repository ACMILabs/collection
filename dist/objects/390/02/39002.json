        "This critically acclaimed but little seen film from Francis Coppola tells the story of Preston Tucker, who opened the door to the future in the 1940's by building a revolutionary car that was called \"The Car of tomorrow, today\". Jeff Bridges stars as family man Preston Tucker, who overcame extraordinary obstacles placed in his path by competitors and politicians, to realise his life's dream, only to have it snatched away again. The film also features Martin Landau, Frederic Forrest, Dean Stockwell and a young Christian Slater. Original music by Carmine Coppola."
