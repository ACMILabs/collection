        "It is the summer of 1694. An ambitious young draughtsman is contracted to draw the house and estate of the wealthy Mrs Herbert. However, what outwardly appears to be a most proper household is thrown into chaos as his contract includes unrestricted freedom on the estate and Mrs Herbert's most intimate hospitality. Not even Mrs Herbert's daughter escapes his charm and magnetism in this intriguing movie of murder, adultery and double values."
