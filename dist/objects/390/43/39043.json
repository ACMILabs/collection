        "A Merchant Ivory adaptation of Henry James' novel in which the young, but charismatic Verena is forced to choose between her loyalty to the women's suffragette movement, represented by her mentor, Olive (Vanessa Redgrave), and the passionate attention of Olive's cousin (Christopher Reeve) who represents everything that Olive abhors. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala adapted the novel for the screen and the film co-stars Linda Hunt and Jessica Tandy."
