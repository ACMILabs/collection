        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Legacy\". When the Aryans invaded India thousands of years BC, they destroyed a rich civilisation, whose legacy may still be alive in the Tamils of southern India. This culture has as its pillars, non-violence, renunciation, the inner life and the female and an eternal quest to identify humanity with the whole of creation, to seek union in diversity. Around 500 BC Ashoka introduced the idea of Dharma or non-violence, taken up by Ghandi in this century. In the sixteenth century, Akbar, the greatest of the Mogul emperors attempted a synthesis of all religions. Now, after years of British domination, the old India is reassertng itself. Written and presented by Michael Woods."
