        "Legend is a fairytale produced on a grand scale, set in a timeless world peopled with fairies, elves, goblins, trolls and demons. It is the story of Jack (Tom Cruise), a young heroic peasant who takes his sweetheart, the beautiful princess Lili (Mia Sara), to see the most powerful creatures on earth, the last surviving unicorns. Unknown to the young lovers, Darkness (Satan) played to perfection by Tim Curry is using the innocence of Lili to set a trap to capture and destroy the creatures of light, the golden-horned unicorns. Children of all ages will be entranced by the magnificent make-up effects, from the smallest elves to the giant Darkness. The latter is unquestionably the most impressive depiction of Satan ever brought to the screen. It is a classic story of good and evil, love and hate."
