        "Kangaroo is D. H. Lawrence's story of love, violence and political intrigue based on his personal experiences in Australia in 1922. In search of a freer, more tolerant world than Europe, in which to rebuild their marriage, famous writer Richard Somers and his wife Harriet come to Australia, where they meet Kangaroo, the charismatic leader of a secret fascist army, who attempts to seduce Somers into his ideas. When Somers refuses his friendship Richard and Harriet are threatened by the same crude, political thuggery which they believed they had left behind in Europe. Stars Colin Friels and Judy Davis who was awarded the Best Actress AFI Award for this role. Photography is by Dan Burstall."
