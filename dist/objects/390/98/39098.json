        "Max's Christmas It's Christmas Eve and Max is too excited to go to sleep, so he sneaks downstairs to await Santa's arrival ... \"Morris's disappearing bag\" Morris, the youngest child, is ignored on Christams morning until he discovers an overlooked present - a disappearing bag! These two stories are adapted from books by Rosemary Wells. \"The Clown of God\" Tomie de Paola's classic picture book of the juggler who is too poor to give a gift to the Christ child. \"The Little drummer boy\" Joyful drumming, glowing illustrations and the voices of the St. Paul Choir School bring this well-known Christmas story to life. Illustrations by Ezra Jack Keats. Each of these stories is also available as an individual title."
