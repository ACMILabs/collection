        "Episode of Series \"Forever Ealing\". When an antiquated railway line is threatened with closure, the villagers decide to run it themselves, entering into frenzied competition with the local bus route. Stanley Holloway as Mr Valentine, the village soak, becomes the railway benefactor and sets the wheels in motion. The antics of this eccentric rural community will provide a comic treat, while train lovers will appreciate the quest to save an old steam engine."
