        "This story begins in 1930 with Sister Luke's (Audrey Hepburn) journey from postulant to nun. Of her solemn vows of poverty, chastity, silence and obedience, Sister Luke knows the last will be the most difficult to achieve. Her strong will and intellectual pride, qualities destined to make her a brilliant nurse, threaten to undermine her holy calling. Unable to be obedient to her heart, Sister Luke comes perilously close to breaking. Highlighted by Audrey Hepburn's performance, this film received eight Academy Award Nominations and also stars, Peter Finch, Dame Edith Evans, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Dean Jagger and Mildred Dunnock."
