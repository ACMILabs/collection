        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Legacy\". China was the last of the great civilisations to develop independently, but it developed a vision of life unique to itself, centred on two quite separate philosophies - moral order, sustained by ritual, as taught by Confucius and the mysticism of Taoism, or the search for the\"right way\". Chinese history is permeated by the search for harmony, and a belief in the self-sufficiency and order of Chinese culture, so that outside contact has been viewed as unnecessary and mostly discouraged - even to the present day."
