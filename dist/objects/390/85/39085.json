        "In the first opera in Richard Wagner's massive Ring Cycle, the Rhinegold is stolen by Alberich from the Rhine maidens and later fashioned into a ring of power, thus setting in train the saga which culminates in Die Gotterdammerung. The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus is conducted by James Levine and the cast includes Christa Ludwig, Ekkehard Wlaschina, and James Morris. Sung in German, the video is accompanied by a synopsis. Wagner's Ring Cycle consists of four parts, in this order: Das Rheingold; Die Walkuere; Siegfried and Goetterdaemmerung."
