        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Back yard permaculture\". In less than four hours, permaculturist Robyn Francis transforms an area of vigorous lawn into a ready-to-plant, landscaped garden without the agonies of digging, turning the soil or removing the weeds. Vegetables, herbs and flowers are companion planted for ease of maintenance and harvest and in six weeks, the first delights of the garden are ready for picking. This gardening technique will suit any soil or climate."
