        "Episode of Series \"Forever Ealing\". This was the first classic Ealing comedy. An ancient document reveals that London's Pimlico district really belongs to France. The community eager to abandon post-War constraints, particularly rationing establish their independence as a ration-free state with hilarious results. Stars Stanley Holloway, Hermione Baddeley and the wonderful Margaret Rutherford."
