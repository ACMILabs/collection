        "This black comedy about high school politics, teenage suicide and trendy cliques, focuses on the 'Heathers', three of the prettiest and most popular rich girls at Westerbury High School, home of preppies, nerds and trendies. They set the trends, make the rules and devise ways of making life hell for the other students. That is until Heather No.4 who is really a Veronica, (Winona Ryder), teams up with her boyfriend, JD, a rebellious new student (Christian Slater), to change all the rules and seek revenge. An ultimate revenge fantasy which has become a \"cult\" movie. Also stars Shannen Doherty."
