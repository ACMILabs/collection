        "On August 22, 1972, a ninety-seven degree day in New York City, an extraordinary robbery took place minutes before closing in a branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank. As the blistering day wore on, details about two incompetent robbers and their victims began to emerge, and in a borough, where the absurd is quite commonplace, these details were to develop into one of the most bizarre news stories of the year. Stars Al Pacino, John Cazale, James Broderick, Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon."
