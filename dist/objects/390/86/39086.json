        "Street smarts demonstrates the Euler circuit, or the quickest, most efficient way around a circuit. Using the example of various street circuit functions, such as parking meter inspection, garbage collection and street sweeping the program demonstrates how a mathematical model such as a Euler circuit will help find the best route. Starting with a very simple diagram to demonstrate the technique, the program concludes by showing how computers can use the same techniques for very complex situations."
