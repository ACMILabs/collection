        "Originally made for television, this is a drama in four parts based on the autobiography of Sonja Davies, New Zealand activist and parliamentarian. It spans 20 years- beginning during World War II when Sonja falls in love with an American Soldier. Pregnant and unwed, Sonja learns that he will not return and once her daughter Penny is born, she returns to nursing to support her. In illness she is reunited with an old boyfriend, Charlie, who aids her recovery. Together they experience great difficulties with shortsighted officialdom, and in response become actively involved in local politics. Sonja particularly finds political strength amongst women and socialist sympathisers, and together they embark on a struggle to ensure that others will share the peace and prosperity of a post war New Zealand. Cast includes Genevieve Picot, Mick Rose, Donna Akersten, Tina Regtien and Erik Thompson."
