        "Life inside a prison in Canada, the Kingston Maximum Security Penitentiary, as seen by the guards and the inmates. Interviews with prisoners and guards paint a harsh picture. The day is punctuated with the sound of metal, and violence runs dangerously close to the surface. A useful film that explains the high degree of recidivism in a sub-culture that operates by a code of its own."
