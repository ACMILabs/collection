        "For the sake of profit, James and Albert Fraser secretly aid a fever ship into Liverpool, however with Daniel Fogarty aiding the public inquiry into the death of local sailors from Yellow Fever, their discovery seems imminent. When the Charlotte Rhodes is quarantined during the middle of a lucrative trip, James suffers significant financial loss and discovers that his estranged wife of one month, Anne, has been taken ill. Albert becomes involved with Carrie Harris, a singer at Fox's Music Rooms, when Elizabeth pays scant affection towards his advances. The affair proves to be more trouble than its worth, despite providing Albert with some comfort. Meanwhile, James finds that he has stirred up trouble amongst the superstitious crew when they retrieve a shipwrecked sailor on return from China."
