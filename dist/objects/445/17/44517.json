        "Albert and Sue's marriage has reached breaking point with both parties suing for divorce. This is despite Robert and Anne's best efforts to prevent a move that would disgrace the Onedin Line. Meanwhile, Daniel Fogerty is soon to become a rich man as Emma Callon finally agrees to name a day for their wedding. James is looking towards expanding the Onedin Line. In Dublin, he bids for a new ship, a fast ex slaver, but finds a rival bidder in Daniel Fogerty. Returning home he finds Anne has had a miscarriage and any plans to try and provide James with an heir will seriously threaten her health. James attempts to become the leading shareholder by purchasing 5,000 Onedin steamship shares, but he's not the only one interested in the purchase. He and Fogerty agree to settle the matter by racing for the first Indian tea crop, with the victor taking the shares. Wily dealings allow Fogerty to turn for home first, but James and his once again pregnant wife, Anne, are closing in. James is forced to make a choice between his wife and control of the company."
