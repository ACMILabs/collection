        "Begins by showing the destruction of human life in wartime from modern weapons of war, and then stresses the need to prevent \"the battle of the roads\" which causes comparable casualties in peace time. The film points out common driving mistakes made by motorists, and shows how the carelessness of pedestrians also causes many accidents. The effects of speed upon the time to brake cars is shown. The huge loss of production each year and the heavy financial burden on the nation due to accidents is emphasised."
