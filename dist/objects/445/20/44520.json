        "Despite losing a ship on the Cape, James Onedin is in an optimistic mood as the American Civil War has ended, and with it are new opportunities for shipping trade. For James to profit however, he needs to add a modern steamship to the line, and gain control of the company. The only thing that stands in his way is Daniel Fogarty. Callon's young niece, Emma, suddenly becomes a new principal share holder to the Onedin Line with the sudden death of Albert Callon and his son in a warehouse fire. Emma places her trust in Fogarty as James sails for the West Indies. Daniel, now elected company chairman, announces his engagement to Emma. Meanwhile, Anne is frustrated by James's apparent harshness to the men, and puts charity before loyalty to her husband. As a result of striking workers, James gives Anne an ultimatum that forces her to leave."
