        "Artist Char Davies' vision of logging expressed in images celebrating the magnificence of the British Columbia forest. This film challenges the myth that stereotypes loggers as insensitive to the act of felling trees. It leaves its audience mindful of deforestation and of our responsibility to it as a living natural resource."
