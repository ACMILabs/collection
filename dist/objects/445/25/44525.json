        "This montage of animated photographs and medieval drawings, superimposed on archival and contemporary film footage, traces the evolution of Canada's system of taxation through the boom times and the bad times of Canadian history. The film examines the persistent struggle for tax revenue waged between federal and provincial governments since Confederation, and concludes with a fast-moving look at Canada's modernized tax system."
