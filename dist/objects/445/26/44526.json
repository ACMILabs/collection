        "A view from the cockpit of a VS880 Tracker aircraft patrolling Atlantic coastal waters and the eastern Arctic from its base in Shearwater, Nova Scotia. The film is a demonstration of the kind of peacetime missions served by the air arm of the Canadian Armed Forces in protecting territorial waters against illegal incursion and pollution, and in safe-guarding national sovereignty."
