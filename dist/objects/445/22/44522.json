        "Based on a true incident, 'The Winslow Boy' (produced by Anatole de Grunwald, directed by Anthony Asquith) tells the simple story of a father's impassioned fight to clear the name of his son - a young naval cadet expelled from college after being found guilty of theft. Arthur Winslow is certain of his son's innocence, and yet is impeded in his task to retain the boy's honour, that is until a famous KC and political leader, Sir Robert Morton, agree to help their cause. Cast includes Robert Donat, Cedric Hardwicke and Margaret Leighton. Based on a short story by Graham Greene, 'The Fallen idol' (produced and directed by Carol Reed) is a sensitive study of the way in which a young boy interprets the strange and seemingly illogical behaviour of the adults who surround him. He witnesses the adulterous relationship that develops between the butler Baines, whom he worships, and a typist at the foreign embassy in London where his father works. He also sees Baines' wife fall to her death while spying on the couple and the boy's interpretation of events places Baines in a perilous situation. Cast includes Michele Morgan, Ralph Richardson, Sonia Dresdel and Jack Hawkins."
