        "A photographic journal covering one hundred and fifty years, showing the women of an upper-class Canadian family. Starting with an early immigrant family, the film gradually narrows its focus from yesterday's women, who lived secure, comfortable lives tied into rigid social patterns, to today's women and the choices that face them. A search for roots and meaning that is both personal and historical. Photography by Susan Trow and Gilles Tremblay and Richard Moras. Edited by Susan Trow. Music by Sharon Smith. Sound by Bruce Mackay and Alain Clavier."
