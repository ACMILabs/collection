        "An assistant elixir salesman (Danny Kaye) is mistaken by the Russian villagers of Brodny as the infamous Inspector General - an envoy of Napoleon. The tale's comic impetus is driven by bungling officials seeking to appease the false general and the tongue twisting talents of the inimitable Danny Kaye. Cast includes Danny Kaye, Walter Slezak, Barbara Bates and Elsa Lanchester. Freely adapted from Nikolai Gogol's classic Russian story."
