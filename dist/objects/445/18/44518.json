        "On the ship Pibroch with Captain Baines at the helm, James has an unsettled feeling about the cargo they is carrying. His suspicions are confirmed when, in rough seas off Africa, they discover that she is a coffin ship - old, rotten and overloaded - expected to sink so the owners can claim on the insurance. It's up to James to save the crew from near death, and to save Captain Baines' reputation. Meanwhile, Elizabeth's discovery of Albert's affair with Carrie Fox threatens their marriage and throws their lives into disarray. Elizabeth is determined to leave him, despite Anne's protest, before she can act however, Albert decides to give her a taste of life alone when he joins James on a journey around the Horn. On reaching Turkey Albert is offered a job he cannot refuse and experiences a glimpse of love far stronger than any he knew in Liverpool."
