        "Set during a Mexican expedition in 1916, Gary Cooper is cast as a self doubting Army Major, who believing himself to be a coward, relieves himself of his combat duties and is assigned the inglorious task of locating five battle heroes and ensuring their safe passage to the Cordura military base. The five heroes are worthy of a medal of honour, something that appeals to the \"cowardly\" Army Major. The mission is going along smoothly until the arrival of an American woman accused of treason (Rita Hayworth), as the film evolves into an intense study of character and endurance. Cast also includes Van Heflin and Tab Hunter."
