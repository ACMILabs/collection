        "A dying Indian entrusts sherrif Mackenna (Gregory Peck) with a map of the legendary Valley of Gold. After memorising the contents of the map Mackenna destroys it, thus placing himself in a precarious position of being a target to the local bandit gang as well as the townspeople. The two parties are united by a greed for gold and a fear of the common enemy, the Apaches. The gold in the canyon belongs to the Apaches and it has been decreed by Apache Gods that the gold remain untouched. Both those who are hunting the gold, and the Apaches who are protecting it have their own reasons behind desiring its possession, leading to a violent climax. Cast includes Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Telly Savalas, Burgess Meredith and Edward G Robinson. Also included on the tape are original theatrical trailers and behind the scenes information."
