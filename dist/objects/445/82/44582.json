        "A cool, scientific look at weather forecasting, and the drama involved. From far-flung meteorological stations and observation posts, to the weather-plotting station of the Meteorological Station of Canada with its automated mapping machines, this examination of what weather is and how it is anticipated on a world scale makes absorbing viewing. Here, for a change, the weatherman is unquestionably the hero. Written by James Carney. Photography by Paul Leach and Gilles Gascon.Editing by William Brind. Music: Karl Duplessis. Sound by Bernard Bordeleau. (Awards: Columbus; Rome.)"
