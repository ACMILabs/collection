        "The Band, the American 1970s rock outfit, were together fifteen years. \"The Last waltz\" is their farewell concert, staged in 1976 and filmed by Martin Scorsese, that featured a plethora of rock stars including Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Diamond, Van Morrison, Emmylou Harris, Ringo Starr, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Muddy Waters, The Staples, Dr. John, Ronnie Hawkins, Paul Butterfield, Ron Wood and The Band themselves. As well as filming the occasion, Scorsese also interviewed The Band about their lifestyles, the rigours of touring and their reasons for discontinuing. His footage, which includes some frank and very personal moments, acts as a bittersweet look at an era that was just beginning to fade. Still considered, in terms of quality, one of the best rock concerts ever filmed."
