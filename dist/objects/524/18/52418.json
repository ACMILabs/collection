        "Johnston's debut feature following on from his award winning shorts 'Night Out' and 'Eternity', is a dynamic re-visioning of actor/playwright John Brumpton's theatre piece \"Containment\" that focused on the situation of inmates in the segregated HIV positive section of an Australian prison. To describe Johnston's beautifully composed, movingly rendered, emotionally shattering film as 'an AIDS prison drama' denies it the full range and reach of its compelling grip on any number of wider issues and universal concerns. Brumpton forcefully fleshes out the lead role of quick-tempered hardened Des, a crim who tests positive and is sent to T2 division. His relationship with his cell-mate Ralph is vividly evoked via subliminal flashbacks and interaction between themselves and amongst the other inmates of T2. Photography, Mandy Walker. Cast: John Brumpton, David Tredinnick, Robert Morgan, Belinda McClory, Noel Jordan."
