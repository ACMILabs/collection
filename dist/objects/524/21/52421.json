        "This drama, which culminates in the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign, follows the fortunes of two public school friends who become officers. In a film of divided, somewhat confined intentions the actual scenes of battle, imaginatively edited with effective use of sound (also intermittently evident in the rest of the film) bear comparison with counterparts \"All quiet on the Western Front\" and \"Westfront\" (1918). But the futility of war theme gives way to the endorsement of the status quo and to more conventional heroics in the British stiff-upper-lip tradition. In the Gallipoli scenes Asquith was greatly assisted by Barkas who had earlier made war record films. Cast includes: Carl Harbord, Tony Bruce, Fay Compton."
