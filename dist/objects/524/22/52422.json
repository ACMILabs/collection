        "This documentary, about the metaphysical poets of the 17th century, is a mixture of historical recreations and interviews. Although about an array of poets, the focus is primarily on John Donne, a renowned poet, whose elegant musings on love, religion and spirituality garnered him great favour with the rulers of the day. The metaphysical poets operated in a time of great upheaval in society. Advances in science meant that long held beliefs were being challenged; indeed this period saw the shift from Medieval to modern. The metaphysical poets specialised in verse that celebrated physical and romantic love, but also combined these sentiments with thoughts on spirituality, government and state, and changes being wrought in society."
