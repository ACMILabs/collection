        "Adhering to the Dogme 95 manifesto, signed by a group of like-minded Danish filmmakers committed to an independent film practice that wishes to see cinema become again an innovative, experimental and politically subversive art, \"Italian for beginners\" is the first comedy Dogme film to emerge. The narrative revolves around the fortunes of several Danes living near Copenhagen. These consist of: Andreas, a lonely new priest; Olympia, a clumsy pastry-shop assistant coping with an abusive and mentally unstable father; Karen, a hairdresser who has to fend off her alcoholic brain-damaged mother; Hal-Finn, a cafe manager with anger management issues; Jorgen, a loyal friend of Hal-Finn's who forms a crush on Italian waitress, Guilia. These protagonists slowly overcome their woes and form meaningful relationships with each other, creating a mini-network of support, whilst also discovering several existing strains of interconnectedness. Written and directed by Lone Scherfig, \"Italian for beginners\" makes the most of its simple premise whilst gently probing the themes of family, relationships, love and romance, through a perspective that presages the absurdity of life. A thoroughly enjoyable lightweight addition to the rather grave Dogme canon. Cast includes Anders W. Berthelsen, Anette Stovelbaek, Ann Eleonora Jorgensen, Peter Gantzler, Lars Kaalund and Sara Indrio Jensen."
