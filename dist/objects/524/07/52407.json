        "Carl Maria von Weber's opera \"Der Freischutz\" with libretto by Friedrich Kind first premiered in Berlin in 1821. This production by Achim Freyer was performed in Stuttgart by the Wurttemberg State Opera Chorus and Orchestra, with Ulrich Eistert as Chorus master and musical direction by Dennis Russell Davies. Romantic, melodramatic, evil and mystical, this German folkloric tale set in the Bohemian forest tells of a rivalry between Max (Toni Kramer) and Kaspar (Wolfgang Probst) over the hand of the beautiful young Agathe (Catarina Ligendza), daughter of Kuno (Fritz Linke) the head Ranger to Prince Ottokar. For Max to be worthy of marrying Agathe, he has to win the traditional shooting contest on his wedding morning. Kaspar has already sold his soul to the devil - will Max do the same? Using colorful set designs, costumes and make-up, this stage performance has a Grimm's fairytale quality, albeit an adult fairytale. Cast also includes Wolfgang Schone and Raili Viljakainen. Sung in German with no English subtitles. Includes booklet with English translation."
