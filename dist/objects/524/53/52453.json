        "A homage to accomplished French actresses, Francois Ozon has conjured a musical/comedy/mystery film featuring an ensemble cast of 8 women snowed in in a French residence in the 1950s investigating the murder of the only man in the house - Marcel. Gaby (Catherine Deneuve), his gold digging and emotionally distant wife; eldest daughter Suzon (Virginie Ledoyen) who has returned home for Christmas; youngest daughter Catherine (Ludivine Sagnier); mother in law Mamy (Danielle Darrieux) a wheelchair bound alcoholic supported by Marcel, along with his sister in law Augustine (Isabelle Huppert) a repressed hypochondriac jealous of anyone more sexual than her, including new chamber maid and Marcel's lover, Louise (Emmanuelle Beart) and Marcel's sister, exotic dancer Pierette (Fanny Ardant). The 8 is completed by maid Chanel (Firmine Richard). Under the pressure of one another's accusations and confined to the sumptuous and sterile indoor settings, secrets are revealed over the space of an evening as the women play Miss Marples in this savvy, satirical, musical \"thriller\"."
