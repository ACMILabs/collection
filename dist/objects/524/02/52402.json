        "Set on a farm in a peasant village in the French countryside this delightful ballet tells the tale of the difficult path of young love. Widow Simone (Brian Shaw) is determined to betroth her wilful daughter Lise (Lesley Collier) to Alain (Garry Grant), the eccentric son of a rich farmer, but Lise and her lover Colas (Michael Coleman) conspire to thwart the widow's plans. Performed by the Royal Ballet under the direction of Norman Morrice at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, choreographed by Frederick Ashton with music by Ferdinand Herold, and featuring the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House conducted by John Lanchbery, \"La Fille mal gardee\" is a whimsical romantic comedy suitable for all ages. The music is beautiful and melodic, and the sets designed by Osbert Lancaster are painted in soft pastel colors and have an almost child-like storybook appeal. Lead dancers Lesley Collier and Michael Coleman compliment each other beautifully but special mention has to be given to Brian Shaw who is just superb in the role of Widow Simone."
