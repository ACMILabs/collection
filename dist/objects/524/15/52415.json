        "An innovative Melbourne artist, James Clayden has worked in theatre, film and painting for more than 30 years. His 'Ghost Paintings' series, produced over the past seventeen years, represents a bold and unique synthesis of film and video art. By combining cryptic fragments of dialogue delivered by actors, with highly saturated unfocused images and a disorienting soundscape, he creates an abstracted visual poetry that defies rational analysis, but that nevertheless invokes thought in the viewer. Cast: Helen Hopkins, Tom Wright, Faruk Avdi, Shelley Lasica, Meg White, Thomas Eckersley. Music: Ad Hoc, The Other (Chris Knowles, David Wadelton, David Brown, James Clayden)."
