        "Giacomo Puccini's opera in four scenes based on the novel \"Scenes de la vie de Boheme\" by Henri Murger with libretto by G. Giacosa and L. Illica. This made for television production of \"La Boheme\" is performed by the Orchestra and Chorus of The Municipal Opera Theatre of Genoa and conducted by Leone Magiera along with Choir master Dante Ghersi. \"La Boheme\" is a tragic love story played out in the Latin Quarter of 1830s Paris where poet, Rodolfo (Luciano Pavarotti) and painter, Marcello (Roberto Servile) live in poverty with their loves Mimi (Fiamma Izzo D'amico) and Musetta (Madelyn Renee). Rodolfo's love for Mimi is a passionate and consuming affair which almost destroys their relationship. However love survives even in the face of hopelessness and despair. The spirit of the young Bohemian students, their gaiety and pathos masking the ensuing pain, is captured beautifully. Excellent performances by the lead singers supported by a complimentary cast including Jeffrey Mattsey, Francesco Ellero d'Artegna, Roberto Scaltriti, Guido Pasella."
