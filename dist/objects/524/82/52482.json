        "The Office is a bitingly satirical British television series set in a paper merchant's office and factory in Slough. David Brent, a delusional manager who believes himself to be witty, universally adored, efficient and effective, runs the branch. Series two sees the office of Slough merging with Swindon. In an attempt to win his new staff over, David utilises his trademark off-colour humour. But his attempt at ingratiation only serves to alienate staff. Brent also has a new boss, Neil, a genuinely appealing, popular and efficient manager who stands for none of Brent's inadequacy. Ep 1: Swindon staff are welcomed to Slough, most of whom get off to a bumpy start with Brent. Ep 2: Brent's envy of Neil's style and charm see him act petulantly and treacherously. Ep 3: Tim forms an attraction to new girl, Rachel; their flirtatious interactions trouble Gareth and Dawn. Trudy celebrates her birthday with a boozy evening. Ep 4: Brent prepares for his highly paid motivational speech. Ep 5: comedy relief day brings out the best and worst in staff. Brent is given a formal warning about his work standards. Ep 6: Dawn is conflicted over her future and her romantic life. Adhering to a mockumentary structure, a camera crew follow the workers around, documenting office life - boredom, bad jokes, uncomfortable moments, embarrassing faux pas and the emptiness of at work interactions that pass the day. Features fine performances and much hilarious to-camera addresses, skillfully capturing the monotony of office work, where relieving ennui is a fulltime job."
