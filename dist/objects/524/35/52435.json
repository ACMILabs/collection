        "We live in a world besieged and besotted by image. Everyone, it seems, wants their fifteen minutes and plenty of people will do whatever it takes to get a piece of the celebrity cake. \"And I cried\" is a film about wishing to be a movie star. Being a star is about shining bright, a brilliant flash of light against a velvety black night sky. \"And I cried\" is an exploration, a celebration, a lamentation, of our obsession with the star and the image. Cast includes: Cassandra Tytler, Engelbert Schmidl, Dominic Redfern, Shane Hennessey."
