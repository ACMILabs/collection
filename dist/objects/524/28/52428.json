        "Ramon is a Puerto Rican graffiti artist who hangs with numerous rap and hip-hop artists whilst marking time in the Bronx. His friends, a mix of rappers, dancers and turntablists, yearn to stage a huge hip-hop concert and give voice to their artistic expression. On the cusp of adulthood, the teenagers face all manner of trials, including fledging romances and the stigma of their class, as they face the future. Despite its dated aesthetic, \"Beat Street\" is a lot of fun, and quite exuberant as it travels from one snappy musical moment to the next. This film is also an interesting view of the Bronx as it existed in the 1980s - a fascinating melting pot of backgrounds, set against the grimy subways, graffiti work, and an underground music and dance scene. Cast includes: Rae Dawn Chong, Guy Davis, John Chardiet, Leon Grant and Robert Taylor. Kool Herc, Kool Moe Dee, The Rock Steady and NY Breakers, Us Girls, Busy Bee, Melle Mel and the Furious Five, Bambaataa & Soul Sonic Force, Tina B., Brenda Starr, Treacherous Three and Doug E. Fresh are among the artists that make an appearance."
