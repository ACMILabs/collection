        "In this romantic comedy Drew Barrymore plays Josie Geller, a nerdy self conscious (and at times self-loathing) twenty-five year old who harbours dreams of being swept off her feet by a prince, and falling in love for keeps. In reality she is perennially single and works for a newspaper as a copy editor whilst fostering ambitions to be a reporter. Part of Josie's dream is realised when she is sent on an undercover assignment - back to high school. Unfortunately for Josie this means a return to the lion's den - throughout her adolescence Josie was mocked mercilessly and once undercover she soon finds herself drawn back into the nerdy circles in which she is most comfortable. But when her editor demands that she joins the cool group Josie must transform herself or lose the assignment. Much of the humour in this film is quite black - the flashbacks (as well as those scenes in the present) when Josie is humiliated, are quite excruciating to watch. But the many sly intentions of the script are undermined by saccharine overtones that swamp the film. Barrymore however displays a deft talent for comedy, essentially carrying the film, playing a very sympathetic and quite believable teen and young adult."
