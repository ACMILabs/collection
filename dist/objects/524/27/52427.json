        "Four friends - Sean, Vincent, Lenny and Jody are nocturnal creatures, meeting each night at a cafe to discuss their boring lives, how well they know each other and share the communal ennui. Sean is a hospital worker who suspects his girlfriend doesn't actually live with him any more. Vincent is a grocery store shelf stacker who models his life on Errol Flynn by endearing himself to an assortment of women for sexual encounters. Lenny is a telephone operator at directory assistance with porno reactions and Jody works at an electronics factory and has recently been made redundant. When Vincent sleeps with Sean's elusive girlfriend, the friends embark on a roadtrip to rescue the relationship, providing them with the opportunity to get out and do something - in daylight hours. This directorial debut by Saul Metzstein is a lightweight, aimless, yet engaging film about twentysomething Glaswegians questioning their relationships, friendships and employment. Cast includes: Luke de Woolfson, James Lance, Kate Ashfield, Enzo Cilenti, Heike Makatsch."
