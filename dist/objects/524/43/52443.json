        "Having failed to win one game in their last three years of competition, the once great Albion Football Club is facing removal from the Melbourne District Football League. The one remaining chance for the Western suburbs team to avoid this fate is to win their last game of the season against top Eastern suburbs team Malvern - an impossible feat. When ex-Albion player Bunner - who was banned from playing football fifteen years earlier because of his violent behaviour - hears of the club's plight, he decides to take extreme action. A parochial comedy about class differences in district footy and the joys of winning against all odds. Cast includes Michael Robinson, Andy McPhee, Damien Walshe-Howling, Natalie Carr."
