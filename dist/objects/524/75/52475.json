        "Originally filmed in black & white in 1942, this colorized version was released in 1986 through Hal Roach Studios. Based on the story \"The Dancing men\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and adapted for the screen by W. Scott Darling and Edward T. Lowe, \"Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon\" is set in 1942 during WWII and has all the usual suspects expected from a Conan Doyle novella. The bomb sight (coveted secret weapon which could win the war) and its world-renowned inventor and physicist, Dr Franz Tobel (William Post, Jr) are rescued from Switzerland and the evil hands of the Nazis to the protection of the British government through a clever guise orchestrated by Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone). However, on arriving in London, Holmes and the rather bumbling Dr Watson (Nigel Bruce) find out that all is not as it seems with Tobel and that London is not the safe haven as first thought, especially when the notorious Professor Moriarity (Lionel Atwill) is in league with the Nazis and will stop at nothing to get Tobel and his invention. Cast also includes Kaaren Verne, Dennis Hoey."
