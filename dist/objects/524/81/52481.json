    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"Buffy the vampire slayer\". Season six of Joss Whedon's cult series is predominately the bleakest one of them all. The 'Scooby gang' are all in the throes of relationship hell. Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Tara's (Amber Benson) love for each other begins to erode as Willow falls deeper into the black arts (addiction metaphors abound in this season), while Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Anya (Emma Caulfield) experience pre-wedding jitters with catastrophic consequences (Hell's bells Eps. 116). Not to mention the fact that Buffy, the vampire slayer, starts this season dead and buried (Bargaining 1&2 Eps. 101 & 102). Considering how downbeat this season is, surprisingly it's the one with the most light and comical villains, the nerdy three, Jonathan, Andrew and Warren (Flooded Eps. 104) - not to mention that they are mere mortals. It's also the season that Buffy went musical (Once more with feeling Eps. 107), a Joss Whedon directed episode that proves once and for all how inventive and original this show can be. Buffy's resurrection (you didn't think she was going to stay dead did you!) proves to be the season's overriding story arch as she grapples with being flesh once again and the dire consequences that entails. One of them being a destructive and highly sexual relationship with resident bad boy vampire, Spike (James Marsters)."
