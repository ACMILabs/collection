        "In this unusual Italian episodic comedy, Vittorio Gassman plays ten different characters, each of whom play out scenarios that humorously explore the absurd complications of love, marriage, adultery, sex and women. Each scenario - from picking up a prostitute to confronting a sister's lover - contains a bizarre narrative twist. Beautifully presented in black and white, the film is like a cross between Fellini (in light hearted mode) and Jacques Tati as it trails Gassman's protagonists around various Italian locations, depicting the frivolity of those living \"la dolce vita\". Directorial debut for Ettore Scola, who would go on to collaborate with Gassman many times in their industrious careers. Fabulous jazzy score by Armando Trovajoli; cinematography by Sandro D'Eva. Cast includes: Donatello Mauro, Giovanna Ralli, Mario Lucidi, Antonella Lualdi, Sylva Koscina, Marco Tulli, Olga Romanelli, Heidi Stroh, Eleonora Rossi-Drago, Jean Valerie, and Edda Ferroao."
