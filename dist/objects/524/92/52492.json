        "Two women decide to alter the course of their lives by seeking new paths away from the roles traditionally ascribed to them by society. One, Isabelle (Geraldine Chaplin), begins directing a video production unit for sociological research into the life experiences and opinions of a broad array of women; the other, Anne (Brigitte Fossey), becomes a successful garage mechanic and foreman despite the challenges of being taken seriously by customers and co-workers. Both women face challenges inherent within their chosen fields, but also encounter difficulties achieving a work and family life balance, becoming acutely aware of the needs of their children/lovers/ husbands. These scenarios act as a means for director Bertrand van Effenterre to examine the complexities inherent within communication between the sexes and the tribulations of relationships for women, but also for men facing female emancipation. The narrative, brimming with intriguing and humorous insights into the plights faced by women struggling to discover ways in which they might find their identity and even happiness, is bolstered by strong key performances. Also stars: Jean-Francois Stevenin, Didier Flamand, Jean-Jacques Biraud and Claire Denis."
