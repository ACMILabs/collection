        "The boys at the local football club go into denial when they hear a rumour that one of their team was seen kissing a guy from another team outside the pub the night before. The best friend of the accused is forced to face some home truths when he confronts his mate. A loving parody of local footy culture that challenges entrenched homophobic attitudes that equate sporting prowess with heteromasculinity. Winner of best Australian short queer film and the Melbourne Queer Film Festival 2001. Cast includes Justin Foster, Neil Hutchins, Ben Redford and Jake Jacobson."
