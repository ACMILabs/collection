        "Slightly naughty, light-hearted and often farcical, this French/Italian romantic comedy tells the tale of a poverty-stricken young Polish princess (Ingrid Bergman) living with her Aunt in turn-of-the-century Paris during a time of political unrest and on the eve of WWI. The whimsical and arresting Princess Elena suddenly finds herself the centre of attention when she joins the street festivities on Bastille Day, firstly by meeting and falling in love with a handsome young count named Henri (Mel Ferrer) and then being introduced to Henri's friend, General Rollan (Jean Marais) who is immediately entranced by Elena's sensuous beauty. However, Henri's priorities, although quite smitten with Elena, are political and lie in his quest to persuade General Rollan to seize power. For this he decides to enlist Elena and her charms. Meanwhile, Elena has already promised herself in marriage to a wealthy, boorish, shoe-maker. What is she to do and who shall she choose? Bergman is simply gorgeous in her role as the Princess Elena, with a smile that would melt even the coldest heart. An amusing and entertaining film not to be taken too seriously. Cast also includes Jean Richard, Juliet Greco, Pierre Bertin, Magali Noel, Elina Labourdette. Cinematography by Claude Renoir. In French with English subtitles. NB: Quality of color and editing inconsistent. Originally 98 minutes in length, the film was inexpertly cut to 86 minutes for its American showings and then restored to its full 98 minutes in 1986."
