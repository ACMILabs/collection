        "In the late 60s, Seijun Suzuki developed a cult following with his re-envisioning of B-grade Japanese gangster flicks, defying the tropes of the genre with his desultory approach to narrative and imaginative stylistics. Here, freed of convention, Suzuki explores the possibilities of his art with astoundingly colourful and inventive vignettes that track the movements of Miyuki Minazuki, (also known as stray cat) a beautiful female assassin who dresses in black (with heels) and is determined to be number one amid her peers. This quest requires her to face down her many formidable foes and do battle, depicted in a series of extraordinarily beautiful tableaux. Stray cat must also deal with her lover and boss, a mysterious woman with whom she shares an explosive relationship. Absurdist and dreamily hallucinatory filmmaking, investigates shadowy, irrational aspects of desire. Somewhere between a remake and a sequel to Suzuki's own cult movie \"Branded to Kill\" (1967). Cast includes Makiko Esumi, Sayoko Yamaguchi, Kan Hanae, Masatoshi Nagase, Mikijiro Hira, Kirin Kiki."
