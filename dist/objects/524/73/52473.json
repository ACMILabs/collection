        "A nostalgic look at the life and times of Charlie Chaplin, still considered to be one of the funniest and best slapstick actors in motion picture history. Born in London on 16 April 1889, to parents of music hall fame who were later to divorce, Charlie lived a fairly harsh existence with his mother and older brother Sidney. However Charlie, attracted to the world of stage, finds himself by his early teens winning parts in the stage plays \"Jim, a romance of cockney\" and \"Sherlock Holmes\". It is not long before Chaplin ends up in the United States joining Mack Sennet's Keystone Films, and the rest, as they say, is history. Narrated by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr this documentary follows Chaplin's career featuring excerpts from many of his films, including \"A Night out\", \"The Tramp\", \"The Immigrant\", Easy Street\" among others and starring such actors as Roscoe \"Fatty Arbuckle, Marie Dressler, Douglas Fairbanks, Oliver Hardy, Mary Pickford, Mack Swain and Ben Turpin. The film also includes additional unused new scenes and rare archival newsreel footage of Chaplin in Hollywood with Stan Laurel, Chaplin at 16 and in a UK Music Hall. The \"Little Tramp\" lives on."
