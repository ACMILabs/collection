        "Based on the novel by Betty Smith, \"A Tree grows in Brooklyn\" follows the fortunes of a family struggling to make ends meet in the tenements of Brooklyn at the turn of the century. The alcoholic father, a singing waiter earning an uncertain income, talks of better times ahead. It is the mother who holds the family together and the daughter who tries to rise above their circumstances. Elia Kazan's first film was praised at the time of its release for convincing performances and the richly detailed studio recreation of working class life. Cast includes: Dorothy McGuire, Joan Blondell, James Dunn, Lloyd Nolan and Peggy Ann Garner. Music by Alfred Newman."
