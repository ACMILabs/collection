        "This is a magnificent production on an epic scale of Giuseppe Verdi's \"Aida\", libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni, recorded live at the Arena di Verona in 1981. Written by Verdi for the new Cairo Opera House which had been built to mark the opening of the Suez Canal, \"Aida\" is set in the golden time of the Egyptian Pharaohs and tells a tale of human drama and emotional conflict, of love, jealousy and manipulation culminating in a climax of tragedy. The lead singers include Maria Chiara (Aida), Fiorenza Cossotto (Amneris), Nicola Martinucci (Radames) and Giuseppe Scandola (Amonasro) accompanied by the Arena di Verona Chorus led by Corrado Mirandola, Orchestra conducted by Anton Guadagne and Corps de Ballet dancers Ileana Iliascu, Rosalba Garavelli, Georg Iancu and Richard Dusquenoy. Vittorrio Rossi's stage sets and costumes are rich in color and design and the setting of the Arena di Verona is wonderfully atmospheric. Sung in Italian with no English subtitles."
