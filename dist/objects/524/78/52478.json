        "Eric Binford (Dennis Christopher) is a movie freak, whose love of old movies goes way beyond the norm. He works at a film distributor's warehouse, lives with his obsessive and controlling aunt Stella (Eve Brent Ashe) and spends most of his spare time watching late-night movies in his movie poster and memorabilia adorned bedroom. Eric lives in a fantasy world of his own, acting out his favourite characters and reciting well-known and well-worn one-liners to all and sundry. This obsession eventually takes a bizarre turn after he has a brief encounter with a Marilyn Monroe look alike (Australian born Linda Kerridge) who embodies all of his cinematic desires, but who also stands him up on their first potential date. Angry and disappointed, Eric snaps, his unbalanced and disturbed mind transforming him into a homicidal psychotic who becomes obsessed in seeking revenge on those who have taunted or oppressed him. Disguising himself in various classic movie characters including Dracula, The Mummy and Norman Bates, Eric embarks on a killing spree, reliving scenes from his favourite horror movies. This slasher/psychothriller cliche-filled film has its moments of humor, creepiness and horror but it lacks in script and direction and some unimpressive acting by the support cast. Special mention must be made, however, of a brief appearance by a very young Mickey Rourke. Cast also includes Tim Thomerson, Gwynne Gilford, Normann Burton, Morgan Paull, James Luisi."
