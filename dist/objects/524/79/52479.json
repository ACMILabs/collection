        "This television adaptation of \"Early days\", a play by English playwright David Storey (This sporting life, 1963) which was specifically written for Sir Ralph Richardson and which became an international stage hit playing to audiences in London's West End, Toronto and Washington, DC., reinforces just how wonderful an actor Richardson is in his superb portrayal of the cantankerous dying Sir Richard Kitchen. Once a powerful politician, Kitchen is living out his last few months in the home of his daughter Mathilda (Sheila Ballentine) and her husband Benson (Gerald Flood). Old age and onset of senility contribute to Kitchen's rambling and reminiscing and he seems generally determined to be disagreeable with all and sundry, including his granddaughter Gloria (Marty Cruickshank) and her boyfriend, and even Bristol (Edward Judd) who has been employed by Mathilda to look after her father. The dialogue is brilliant, witty and ultimately sadly disturbing. Cast also includes Peter Machin and Michael Bangerter. A theatrical experience for viewers of the small screen."
