        "This is a television production of \"Mary Stuart\", an opera in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti, Libretto by Guiseppe Bardari after a play by Schiller, with English translation by Tom Hammond, performed live at the London Coliseum in 1982 by the English National Opera. It would seem that Bardari's libretto is based more on tragedy and popular romance than actual historical facts but this does not take away from the story that has intrigued and fascinated many over the centuries. Janet Baker is magnificent in her portrayal of Mary Stuart, conveying all the emotions leading up to Mary's execution with great feeling and depth. Rosalind Plowright (Queen Elizabeth I), Alan Opie (Sir William Cecil), John Tomlinson (George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury) and David Rendall (Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester) all put in a wonderful performance, supported by Angela Bostock and Leigh Maurice. Features the Chorus and Orchestra of the English National Opera, led by Edmund Reid with Chorus masters, Leslie Fyson and Edgar Fleet, conducted by Charles Mackerras. Includes booklet guide."
