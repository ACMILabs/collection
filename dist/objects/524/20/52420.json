    "description": [
        "Volume three of a three disc anthology of restored early silent American films (1900-1926) from archival prints held in the Library of Congress's Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division. This volume contains 3 short films and one feature by early women filmmakers Lois Weber and Alice Guy-Blache and 2 feature-length gangster films. \"How men propose\": a woman researches male courtship rituals in this comedy of reversed gender expectations. In \"Matrimony's speed limit\" a young man is duped by his fiancee into believing he must marry before noon to inherit a fortune. \"A House divided\" is a comic take on divorce. The feature-length \"Too wise wives\" is a droll satire about women's place in society. Griffith's short film \"The Narrow road\" and Tourneur's feature \"Alias Jimmy Valentine\" both centre on ex-criminals caught amongst the devotion of a woman, the lure of criminal buddies and the suspicion of a dogged detective. Tourneur's film is distinguished by its sophisticated visual style which can be attributed as much to his direction as to the contribution of set designer Ben Carre."
