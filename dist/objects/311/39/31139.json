        "A lot of people consider craft a hobby. Something which is undertaken as a source of relaxation and self fulfilment. Many people, however, treat the crafts as a professional livelihood. This film shows the lifestyle of five of these people, each illustrating a different facet of the crafts: Joe McBain, a blacksmith; David Wright, a stained glass artist; Lilija Duks, a weaver; Greg Wain and Victoria Howlett, potters. Narrated by Rod Mullinar"
