        "Episode of Series \"Our multicultural society\". Murawina is an Aboriginal pre-school in Chippendale, an inner suburb of Sydney. The Aboriginal mothers who run Murawina want a separate pre-school for their children, because they want to develop in their children a black pride that may not be encouraged by the white schools the children will next go to. The film raises questions about prejudice, the influence of past experiences on present day attitudes and the relationship between urban and tribal Aborigines."
