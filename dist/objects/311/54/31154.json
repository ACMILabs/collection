        "This film encourages people to enjoy the solitude and splendour of our national parks, while taking precautions to avoid destruction and havoc. A typically Australian family, the Innes, are mildly satirised as they unwillingly get into a situation that took public money to rectify. Three major problem areas are covered: bushfires started by campers, people trapped on cliffs and people lost in the bush. The fact that it is costly and difficult to save people from these dangerous situations is highlighted."
