        "This animated consumer education film reveals both bad buying habits of customers and the ploys of modern marketing. It is pointed out that in buying situations the facts presented may not be quite as true as they seem, and that careful deliberation is always a good policy including the necessity of obtaining a guarantee and the reading of fine print in any signed agreement."
