        "Episode of Series \"Our multicultural society\". Ana is a Spanish/English interpreter in a Sydney family centre. The film shows some of the problems with which she works - human rather than linguistic ones - and her relationships with English-speaking co-workers. The film is designed to raise questions about the need for communicators like Ana and about the isolation of non-English speaking people."
