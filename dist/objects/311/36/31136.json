        "The great Australian itch! These two films should be seen by everyone because like it or not, they are both afflictions that can affect anyone, regardless of class or social importance. If left untreated they can drive you around the twist. The two films are \"Headlice: They can catch anyone\" and \"Scabies - The Unwelcome itch mite\"."
