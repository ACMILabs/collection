        "Episode of Series \"The Art of silence: pantomimes with Marcel Marceau and his partner Pierre Verry\". Allegorical pantomime performed by Marcel Marceau showing a person struggling to escape from confinement- an enclosure of invisible walls. Marceau's groping movements and final breakthrough, only to find another invisible wall, express mankind's continuing struggle for enlightenment. Marceau believes that \"we have but to walk out of the cage\". Also features his partner Pierre Verry. Suitable for upper secondary school level."
