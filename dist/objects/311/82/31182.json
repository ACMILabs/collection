        "Designed to describe all aspects of the family Day Care Scheme, financed by the Department of Social Security, the film follows a co-ordinator of a scheme in the inner Sydney suburb Marackville. Through her day-to-day experiences we see different kinds of care being given to children's differing needs and we see colourful experiences designed for the children by highly skilled care-givers. Cinematography by John Hosking. In Greek and English."
