        "Episode of Series \"Our Asian neighbours: Indonesia\". Set in the city of Banda Acec, this film traces the daily life of Azhari Ali, a student of agriculture at the University of Syiah Kuala. He is a devout Moslem. His lodgings and some money were provided by the Mosque authorities. This money provides his travel to the University, some extra money is gained by teaching the Koran five nights a week. Only late at night can this ambitious 25 year-old find time to study away from his daily commitments."
