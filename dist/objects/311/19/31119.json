        "Episode of Series \"Our Asian neighbours. Indonesia\". Mastri and Sukit are a young couple from the village on Tunjuk in South Bali. Sukit is a school teacher. They live in the house of Sukit's parents and are saving their money to build a house of their own. Tunjuk has its own small dance company and Gong orchestra which is sometimes invited to perform at the tourist hotels around Denpasar, and Mastri is one of the principal dancers. The film contrasts normal village life with the \"tourist's\" Bali and shows something of the religious life of the people of Tunjuk. Camerman Don McAlpine."
