        "Episode of Series \"Our Asian neighbours: Indonesia\". An Angklung is a Javanese bamboo instrument which is rattled to produce a fixed note. Originally tuned to the pentatonic scale it was used in traditional music. However, today it is usually tuned to the diatonic scale and Western-style music is performed. In this film the Bandung Conservatorium Orchestra demonstrates the complexity of the instrument and plays a well-known waltz."
