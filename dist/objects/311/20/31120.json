        "Episode of Series \"Our Asian neighbours. Indonesia\". Java is no longer ruled by kings and queens. The aristocrats who remain live in their palaces, but they are mostly poor. When they die so will many of their traditions. This passing history is recorded by following the daily life of Pak Menggung, writer and collector of ancient Keris. This film gives insight into the courtly traditions of art, etiquette and ceremony of Java. Photography is by famous Australian cinematographer, Don McAlpine."
