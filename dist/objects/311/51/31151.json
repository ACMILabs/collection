        "The Australian wildlife seen by visitors to Kangaroo Island, South Australia, is the subject of this award-winning film. Koalas, kangaroos, emus, pelicans and seals abound on this island sanctuary, completely unafraid of humans. Their daily activities form a fascinating study. Contains no commentary, only sounds of nature and background music composed by Bruce Smeaton. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
