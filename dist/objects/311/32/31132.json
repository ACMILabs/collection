        "Alcohol plays an important part in our society as a relaxant and a status symbol, but when mixed with driving the results can be disastrous. This film explores the pressures to drink, the myths to which many Australians subscribe about drinking and driving, and the stark fact that alcohol, even in small amounts, seriously impairs driving"
