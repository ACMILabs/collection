        "In 1802, Captain Matthew Flinders explored and charted the last unknown coastline on Earth. We see this magnificent coastline as Flinders saw it, recreating his journey with the help of the record in his ship's log. The coastline is that of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia - a coastline that has been barely touched by man. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
