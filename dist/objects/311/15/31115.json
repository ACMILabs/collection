        "Episode of Series \"Our Asian Neighbours: Thailand\". At 3am the village of Ka Rorn comes to life and work begins. Produce must be taken to market in Phuket, the only major town on the island. Ka Rorn is a tight, relaxed, self-sufficient community of about 30 families. The people grow coconuts and fruit to sell in the market but, being an island village, fishing is the most lucrative industry."
