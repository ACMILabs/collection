        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Frontiers downunder\". The first in a series of six films depicting life in Australia in the late 1970's. It is a compilation of some of the footage and subject matter of the other five films, and is a very brief look at the complexities that go to make up this huge southland - the largest island in the world. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
