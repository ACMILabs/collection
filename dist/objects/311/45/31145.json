        "This program documents the minute details of the \"little\" man's campaign for Federal Election. Peter McIlwaine, the local chemist, stands for the marginal NSW Liberal-held seat of Cook. We see him with the branch's hard-working party faithfuls struggling with limited resources, and we see him in awkward meetings with his leaders."
