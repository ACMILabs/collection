        "Episode of Series \"Our multicultural society\". A portrait of a marriage within the Greek community. George is Greek-born and Toula second-generation Australian. Toula has had a tertiary education and works in social services. She experiences much greater ambivalence about the traditions in which she was raised than her husband. The film is designed to show how an ethnic community shapes the lives of its members."
