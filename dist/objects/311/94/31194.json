        "Episode of Series \"A Man and His Sport\". Australians play several types of football - Aussie Rules, Rugby League, Rugby Union and Soccer. Soccer, however, is the fastest growing game of them all. More and more Australians are beginning to think in terms of soccer. This film tells the story of soccer in Australia, from nursery teams of three-year-olds, right through junior and club football, to international sides that are beginning to show signs of promise. Greek language commentary."
