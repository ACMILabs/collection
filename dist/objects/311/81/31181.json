        "Who are the Australians? The film shows them at work, at home and at play. It depicts the sophistication of the cities and the sparseness of the outback. It reveals that already there are traditions and national pride. A study of Australia and Australians with all the variety and colour of the modern Australian scene. Note: A short version, intended mainly for overseas viewers, of \"After Cook\". In English and Turkish."
