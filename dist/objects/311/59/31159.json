        "South American Olga de Amaral is one of the most outstanding weavers working today. She is particularly noted for the sheer size and scope of her work. An exhibition of her work came to Australia in 1975 and here the camera explores the rich, earthy colors, the texture and intricacy of each piece. Olga de Amaral worked with only two materials, horse hair and hessian, and the way she used these materials is a source of wonder and delight."
