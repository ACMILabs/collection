        "This film looks at common misconceptions about contraception held by many teenagers. Through a dramatised situation, teenagers are shown that they need not fear being ignorant or misinformed, as sound information is readily and easily available from the Family Planning Association. Contraception is also shown as being the responsibility of both partners."
