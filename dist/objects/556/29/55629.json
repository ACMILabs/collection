        "Provides a look at the life forms of the Gippsland forest area. Here the world's tallest hardwood tree, the mountain ash, towers to a height of one hundred metres or more and provides food and shelter at all levels, from the forest floor where the lyrebird scavengers to the tree tops which provide launching pads for the spectacular sugar gliders. Shows also the impact of the area's two enemies: fire and man, and shows a rare glimpse of the family life of Australia's laughing bird, the kookaburra."
