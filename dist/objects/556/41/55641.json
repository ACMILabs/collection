        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". Looks at some of the observations which have caused a crisis in the study of our sun. Until recently it was thought to be a constant well-understood star. But now it is oscillating with frequent vibrations. This may mean a complete revision of our ideas about the inner temperature and composition of the sun and hence all other stars."
