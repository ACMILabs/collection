        "A recruiting film for the Royal Australian Navy, showing life in Australia's Fleet Air Arm. We see how living on an aircraft carrier is exciting and full of non-stop action. We also see how Australia's Navy aviators fly helicopters for rescue and recovery, as well as attack, and the striking force of the fixed wing Skyhawk jets and the two-engined Tracker aircraft as they come and go from the deck of their seabound base."
