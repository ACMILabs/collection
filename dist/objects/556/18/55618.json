        "Presents a series of character studies of what it is like to be old in America, as seen through the eyes of a young nurse and writer in both rural and urban settings. Reel two begins with a quick overview of the physiological signs of ageing. The film then examines the plight of old people, hospital treatment, old-age homes and accommodation in general. Good sharp dialogue used by main characters to highlight the plight of the unwealthy elderly."
