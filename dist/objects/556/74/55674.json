        "John Cleese is joined by John Bird who explains to him why his factory which produces coupled cutlery has gone bankrupt. The film is designed to show the influence of the cost of a product on its price and how the volume produced affects that cost. Also considers how productivity is the only way to increase wages without increasing inflation. Intended for line managers, senior executives and personnel not directly concerned with finance. Suitable for upper secondary level. NB: FOR USE ONLY IN A DOMESTIC SITUATION OR FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY."
