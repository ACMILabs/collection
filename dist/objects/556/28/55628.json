        "Part of \"The World we share\" series. Provides an exploration of the mountains in Gippsland through the changing seasons. Shows how the long winter surprisingly sustains a complex network of life underneath the snow. The brief spring and summer bring a rush of life witnessed in the vocal battle of frogs over territory, the birth of a butterfly, the migration of cockatoos and the life style of the burramy. Suitable for upper secondary level."
