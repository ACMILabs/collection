        "Episode of Series \"The World about us\". The world's greatest river, the Amazon, rises high in the Andes and flows for four thousand miles to the Atlantic Ocean. It is surrounded by the vast Amazon forest, which is seen by scientists as the world's oxygen factory, and by Brazilians as a frontier to be conquered. The forest is being exploited and luxury hotels are being built throughout the hitherto impenetrable jungle. An interesting contrast between the \"tourist\" Amazon and the natural river and its surroundings. Narrated by Frank Windsor."
