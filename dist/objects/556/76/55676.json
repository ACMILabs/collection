        "In the 1850s, Canada meant freedom for many escaped slaves, but the route known as the \"underground railroad\" was a dangerous one at the best of times. This drama tells the story of one group travelling the perilous route. It tells, too, of the people who could be trusted to help, and of the trackers and their dogs, who could cut off the lifeline to the border suddenly and very cruelly."
