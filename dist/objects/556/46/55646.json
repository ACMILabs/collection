        "Provides an example of an early animated puppet film by Ladislas Starevich, a young Polish artist, who gained international recognition for his pioneering work in animated and trick films. Starevich worked at one time for the Khanzhonkov, a Russian studio, but later emigrated to Paris. His work had a light, satirical touch, which in those days, was almost unique among Russian film-makers. Also known as 'The Cameraman's Revenge' Mrs Beetle is involved with a grasshopper artist while Mr Beetle is seeing a dragonfly cabaret performer! An intricate drama of (f)lies, deceit and the just revenge of the cinematographer. One of Starewicz earlier films, possibly the very first cinematic treatment of insect fidelity."
