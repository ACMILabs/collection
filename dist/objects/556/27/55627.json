        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Ways of seeing\". One of a series of films by art critic and author John Berger, which explores the ways in which we look at pictures. John Berger believes we have misunderstood the real meaning of European oil painting because we are normally encouraged to look at only a few exceptional works instead of the hundreds of thousands of unremakable pictures which make up the main tradition. He argues that this still continues today in the modern medium of advertising and publicity."
