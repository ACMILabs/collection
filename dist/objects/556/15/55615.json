        "Depicts the alternative energy sources used at the Integral Urban House in Berkeley, California to transform a typical urban residence into an almost self-sufficient habitat. Shows how solar energy is integrated into the house to provide economical and efficient heating; how the roof and backyard are utilised optimally to furnish the dwellers with a year round supply of vegetables; and how organic waste is recycled and transformed into plant nutrients for use in the garden. Suitable for lower secondary level."
