        "'Honest' Louie Ballou, used-car dealer, explains to us 'confidentially' how fashion and gimmickry create obsolescence and how we can use commonsense to get the most for our money. This film is a vivid springboard for discussion of the concepts of fashion, gimmickry obsolescence, and value for the consumer."
