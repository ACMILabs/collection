        "In a futuristic antiseptic food factory, workers select healthy chicks while the rejects are carried along a conveyor belt until they are crushed by a mallet and dropped into a garbage bin. A single black chick appears among the yellow and is shoved toward the garbage bin. Before the mallet strikes the gasping chick rebels. A terrifying vision of Social Darwinism, rendered as a haunting and powerful allegory. Without narration. Winner of the 1979 Melbourne Film Festival short film competition. NB: CONTAINS DISTURBING IMAGES"
