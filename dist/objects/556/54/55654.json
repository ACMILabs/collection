        "Shows the typical Hollywood of the 1930's and 1940's through the work of David O. Selznick. Includes footage from several films, commentary by some of the stars, tapes and rare footage of screen tests for \"Rebecca\" and \"Gone with the wind\" and the only existing film of Laurette Taylor and Maude Adams (actresses). A useful springboard for discussion. Aspects of the film which would make it useful include the Jewish producer role in the US at a time when Nazism was strong in Europe. Overall commentary by Henry Fonda."
