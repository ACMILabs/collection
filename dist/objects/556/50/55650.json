        "This film begins by showing the building of the Dartmouth Dam on the Mitta Mitta River to flush out the Murray River whose river basin is comparable to the Danube Basin, but has only 17% of the Danube's flow. It shows the devastating impact of ever-increasing salinity in the Murray River on the agricultural productivity and the purity of Adelaide's domestic water supply. Suggests ways of overcoming the salinity problem through saline interception schemes, such as those pioneered by the NSW government. A valuable insight to the political nature of the great Muray River by its custodians, Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. Suitable for upper secondary level."
