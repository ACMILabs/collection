        "Appointed as film commissioner to the Dutch Indies, it was intended that Ivens would create educational films on behalf of the Dutch government and would document the liberation of Indonesia from Japanese occupation. When it became obvious that the Dutch government had no interest in granting independance to Indonesia, Ivens resigned. Working clandestinely, he recorded this film in support of the struggle by the Indonesian people to gain their independance. The film shows efforts by Australian dockworkers and striking Indonesian seamen to prevent the shipment of arms and ammunition to Indonesia aboard Dutch vessels. Cinematography, Marion Michelle. Editing, Joris Ivens and Jock Levy. Script, Joris Ivens and Catherine Duncan. Commentary, Peter Finch."
