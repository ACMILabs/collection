        "Jacob Bronowski discusses the influence of mathematics and numbers on culture throughout the ages. Going back to the time of Pythagorus, he demonstrates how his mathematical formula influenced Greek music and thought; how it was adapted in Alexandria by people such as Ptolemy; the development of symmetry art and culture; to the translation of numerical thought into Latin and its effect on perspective, depth and dimension in art. Throughout, it is stressed by Bronowski how the inner eye of the painter and the logic of the mathematician have combined in the development of art and culture. Written and narrated by Jacob Bronowski. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
