        "This unique animal's story is told in this film. Its place in the Australian fauna is established when it is shown how it is related to the platypus and the marsupials. Points out how the echidna differs from other members of the porcupine family and how this species respresents a link with past ages. Indicates why this species has survived and includes sequences on its appearance, food, distribution and habitat. Suitable for upper primary and secondary levels."
