        "At the 1961 gathering of the Blood Indians of Alberta the exciting spectacle of the Sun Dance was captured on film for the first time. The film also reflects the predicament of the young generation, those who relinquished their ties with their own people but have not yet found a firm place in a changing world. (Awards include: London, Brussels, Toronto)"
