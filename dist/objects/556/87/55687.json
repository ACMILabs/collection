        "Sets out to take a hard look at the main messages that come to us daily from the media, focusing on images of men and women. Does the mass media give us an accurate picture of the sexes or do they serve up a stereotype diet of sexy, passive females and tough, dynamic males? This atempts to answer these questions using satire, songs, cartoons and clips from film. Cast includes Julie Covington, Jane Meadows, Charlie Stafford. Narrated by Gavin Richards, Stephanie Turner."
