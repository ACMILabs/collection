        "When you're fourteen and in trouble, confusion builds on confusion. Kane's secret has become too complicated, too painful, too dangerous, and he can't begin to stop denying. This award-winning and internationally acclaimed film is a study of some of the difficulties affecting all youth growing up in the 90's."
