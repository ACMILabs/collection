        "Mixing interviews, images and tiny fictions, \"Backthenrightnowlateron\" is a funny and moving collection of children's thoughts on their past, present and future. The work is divided into three segments - Backthen, Rightnow, Lateron. Each segment features children from Class 2J, Yeronga State School, with their favourite toy sharing their thoughts with interviewer Georgia Seffrin, and a mini-film starring one of the toys - Chicky goes to nana's house, Red Ted goes to England, Minotaur goes to war. Provides a wonderful and amusing insight into young children's minds. Developed from an original concept and commission by QPAC's \"Out of the Box\" Festival of Early Childhood for the OOTB Symposium, September 2003."
