        "The artists Charles and Sheena Hazzard offer through the lens of their 8mm camera, a unique historical film record of life in the Bundaberg region of Queensland. We see not only their family journeying through life but also their long-term commitment to art in the community. In the triptych format, the narrator, Nicholas Hazzard (the youngest son) is seen concurrently as a baby, teenager and married with children. the notion of chronological time is disrupted and temporal montage is combined with spatial montage. Multilinear narratives occur across the three concurrent streams of video. Nicholas' direct response to the footage presents a historical and geographical context on the Bundaberg region."
