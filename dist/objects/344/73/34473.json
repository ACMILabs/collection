        "A small country community is drawn together by the death of \"Mongrel\" in an accident. But it's not until his mates gather in the pub in their \"Sunday best\" to bolster their courage for the funeral, that they are able to express their real sorrow. Conveniently missing the church service, they give Mongrel a send-off in their own way. Cast includes Sheila Florance, Reg Evans, Charlie Sandford, Neil Robbins, Andrew Klipple, Neil Modra, Alec Maguire and Keith Johnson. (Award: Winner Diploma of Merit, Melbourne Film Festival 1987)"
