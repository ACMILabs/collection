        "This wonderfully wacky animated film looks at two simultaneous conflicts, the macrocosm of global nuclear war and the microcosm of a domestic quarrel, and how each conflict is resolved. Presented with warmth and unexpectedly off-the-wall humour, the film is open to a multitude of interpretations. (Awards: Montreal, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco, Annecy, Hiroshima, Cracow, Zagreb, Tampere)"
