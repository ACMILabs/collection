        "At Saqqara, just south of the Great Pyramids, lies what is arguably the most important archaeological site in Egypt. At this site, the careful excavation work and detective cunning of an Australian archaeologist has uncovered clues to the assassination of a Pharaoh; a plot that involved court officials, the Pharaoh's bodyguard and harem. Narrated by Phillip Adams."
