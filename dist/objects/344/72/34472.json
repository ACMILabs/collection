        "This sensitive program is presented by Victoria Nicolls. It covers the myths surrounding domestic violence, whether the police can help, what the law is, how women have suffered, whether men can change, the effects on children, the secrecy and how some women have survived. In the program we meet victims, refuge workers, counsellors and police who discuss domestic violence."
