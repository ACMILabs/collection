        "In the 1980's high heels are back in fashion and women are back in high heels. Why is it feminine to walk in high heels? What does it do to your spine? Does a woman who is helpless need help? What is the appeal of restrictive fashion? And in what way do high heels restrict us? Why do women wear high heels? Written by Alison Tilson."
