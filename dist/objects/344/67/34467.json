        "A film that goes behind the headlines to look at the extraordinary chain of events that has made the New South Wales Builders' Labourers' Federation the controversial part of Australian history that it is today. It is a story about workers who began to act for themselves and make decisions about issues that affected ordinary people. Also looks at the new policies that saw women introduced into the building industry, limited tenure of office and the use of union power to assist resident action and environmental groups. Narrated by Pat Fiske. (NOTE: 16mm print is black and white.)"
