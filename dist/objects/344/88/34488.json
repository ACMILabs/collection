        "A drama that focuses on a man's reaction to the unexpected success of his wife's first novel. The husband, who sees his wife in a traditional role, is compelled to deal with a radically new perspective on their relationship. Departing from the original plot, the film's ambiguous ending allows viewers to make their own interpretation of the conclusion."
