        "Episode of Series 'Winners'. Carol is a top runner, coached by her father day and night. Then she makes friends with Angie, the new girl at school whose punk looks haven't made her very popular. Angie introduces Carol to the wonderful world of dance, but Carol's father won't let her do anything that conflicts with her track-training. Parental pressure is tough on Carol who wants to succeed. She rebels and plans a new life for herself, but the all-important race is coming up and Carol has to give it all she's got.  Cast includes Nicole Kidman, Terence Donovan and Alyssa Cook."
