        "In answer to the question which has puzzled sages throughout the centuries, this short whimsical film gives us a bug's eye view of the meaning of life. It stars a determined beetle who slowly makes his way across an ocean-side bikepath, humming a medley of familiar tunes while he evades or surmounts a series of obstacles."
