        "Through intimate profiles eight men and women, this film offers a portrait of the 3.5 million gay and lesbian elders in the USA. Contrary to the public stereotype of a youthful homosexual community, gay men and lesbians do grow old. This is a portrait of strong and active women and men who face not only issues of ageing, but also concerns related to sexual orientation. This film intimately profiles eight men and women"
