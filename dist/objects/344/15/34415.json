        "This lively production dispels many widely held misconceptions about opera and shows that it can be as entertaining and exciting as a football match or a bullfight. Excerpts that are featured in this program are from, \"the Pirates of Penzance\", \"The Magic Flute\", \"Carmen\", \"Cosi fan tutte\" and \"The Barber of Seville\". Featuring Graham Blundell and Suzanne Johnston."
