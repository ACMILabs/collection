        "An amusing, fast-paced documentary based on the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" starring Meryl Streep and Raul Julia. The film goes behind the scenes to find out what makes the 400-year-old play relevant to audiences today. Combines excerpts from the performance, with comments by the leading actors and members of the audience."
