        "Patterns is a documentary which explores issues to do with politics, work, art and women's history. A number of threads are woven between the sweatshop and the art gallery, the glory box and the political banner, bourgeois femininity and the question: should a feminist knit? An incisive and kaleidoscopic exploration of needlework and its place in women's lives."
