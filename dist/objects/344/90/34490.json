        "In 1936 on a remote outpost in the Northern Territory, nine aboriginal elders appeared before Ruth Heathcock, a young white nurse who they believed was a member of their tribe before the Dreaming. What she later experienced in her healing work is the subject of this extraordinary documentary. A multi-award winning production."
