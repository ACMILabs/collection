        "This film is about Maureen Sullivan, a woman who practises a radical new kind of sex therapy. She is a sex surrogate. Her clients are men unable to have successful sexual relationships. Her job is to help them learn how to love. What follows is the story of two clients who allowed their entire therapy to be filmed. Maureen saw each man once a week for four months. Supervised by a therapist, she guided the men through a series of sexual exercises that became progressively more intimate. Narrated by Noreen Hennessey."
