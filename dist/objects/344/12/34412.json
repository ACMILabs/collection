        "Fremont High School in Elizabeth Park South Australia is a school that is becoming famous for its musical productions. A group of students who are involved in the production of a Rock Musical from casting to preparation of a backdrop which depicts the area in which they live show the fun and sharing that occurs during rehearsals for the show \"Type Cast\". Students commence on the breaking down of class level barriers that normally exist in schools, on the ease of communicating with teachers as they learn about devising and producing a pop musical. Positive attitudes are fostered, about self and ability and all regard the experience as \"great\"!"
