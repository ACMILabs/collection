        "In a few villages on the west coast of Papua New Guinea a handful of men still practise the ancient ritual of sharkcalling. Colonisation and economic exploitation is slowly bringing to a close this spectacular and dangerous ritual. Dennis O'Rourke lived with the people to learn about sharkcalling and to understand the forces affecting their culture. Edited by Stewart Young. Photographed by Dennis O'Rourke and Chris Owen."
