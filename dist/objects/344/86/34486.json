        "An animated film without narration about a family which operates within traditional stereotyped roles where the woman is mother, housekeeper and wage earner while the man is wage earner only. Shows how the children imitate their parents in these sex roles. A useful discussion starter in the area of sex role stereotyping. Suitable for middle and upper primary and secondary levels."
