        "When an old area of a city is to be demolished to make way for a new low-rental housing development, is there anything that the residents can do to protect their own interests? This film, produced in 1968, airs such a situation in the Little Burgundy district of Montreal. It shows how citizens organized themselves into a committee that made effective representations to City Hall and influenced the housing policy."
