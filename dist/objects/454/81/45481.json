        "Regarded as Herzog's finest film, \"The Enigma of Kasper Hauser\" is based on a true story about a 19th Century genius. His origins shrouded in mystery, Kasper Hauser was found wandering the streets of Nuremberg in 1820. Without speech, nor any sign of parentage, Hauser immediately becomes the object of scrutiny from the town authorities. After learning to talk he tells of living in a cellar, displaying no signs of having had any contact with other human beings since childhood. In his attempts to adjust to adult life, he reveals a highly advanced intelligence and alternative, almost prophetic, vision. Herzog demonstrates his fascination with misfits, and as the story develops, the confrontation between innocence and corruption intensifies. Cast includes Bruno S, Walter Ladengast and Brigitte Mira. In German with English subtitles."
