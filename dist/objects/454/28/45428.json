        "Show-casing her dramatic capabilities, Doris Day gives a surprising performance as the 1930's torch singer Ruth Etting. Etting's big break came when she was discovered by Chicago gangster Martin, \"The Gimp\" Snyder. Using the ruthless methods that he is accustomed to, the Gimp fulfills Ruth's ambitions by providing her with material riches and renown on stage and screen. He also provides her with his hand in marriage. She pays a high cost personally however, living in an atmosphere of violence and fear that worsens when Martin discovers that Ruth has fallen in love with musician Johnny Alderman (Cameron Mitchell). Nominated for 6 Academy Awards, \"Love me or leave me\" is a departure from traditional musicals as it focuses on the trials and tribulations of love, fear and tragedy in relationships, played out against a backdrop of songs such as \"Mean to me\", \"Ten cents a dance\" and \"I'll never stop loving you\". Cast also includes Robert Keith and Tom Tully."
