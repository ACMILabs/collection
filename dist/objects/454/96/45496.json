        "A humorous film in a slightly slapstick style of a trivia quiz show. Asks such questions as: What is the weight of a dry Australian rules football? Where are a crab's teeth found? Can a horse sleep standing up? etc. Relevent shots are shown relating to each question and choice answers are provided with a counting down clock. Includes footage of Melbourne, including Swanston and Collins Streets, and a game of Australian Rules football (Carlton vs Collingwood?). Interesting film from an historic point of view. Photography by David J. Bilcock. Written and narrated by Norman Ellis."
