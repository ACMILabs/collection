        "Arthur Lipsett pieces together his visions of this fragmented world from odds and ends, even leftovers, from other people's photography and sound recording. By juxtaposing his snippets of \"found film\" with snatches of comment or dialogue echoing the banality of human communication, Lipsett shows the emptiness of much of what we say or do. Included is footage from the post-war Singapore hand over; radiation food testing; and the effects of radiation on animals. N-Zone is one man's surrealist sampler of the human condition. Written by Arthur Lipsett and Henry Zemel. Photographed Arthur Lipsett, Henry Zemel, Paul Leach and Wolf Koenig. Edited by Arthur Lipsett."
