        "An intense and enthralling portrait of an intrepid and obsessed impresario with a desire to bring both Enrico Caruso and an opera house to the deepest jungles of South America. The highlight of the story is Fitzcarraldo's Herculean effort to haul a 300-plus ton steamboat over the mountains, for which no trickery was used in filming the gruelling sequence. Director Werner Herzog boldly embarked on the same journey, proving to be as driven and single-purposed as his protagonist, the audience's knowledge of this adding to the excitement. In German with English subtitles. Cast includes Klaus Kinski, Claudia Cardinale, Jose Lewgoy, Miguel Angel Fuentes and Paul Hittscher."
