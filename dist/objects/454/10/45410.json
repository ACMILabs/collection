        "A film of cinematic metaphor, made by students of Queen's University. The world of this film, one in which a growing boy finds himself, is a world of imposed conditions and contradictions. Here children turn adult by putting on the appropriate uniforms - the policeman's, the soldier's. Many of the sequences are surrealistic in effect, creating a social commentary expressed in symbolic language."
