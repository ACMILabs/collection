        "One of the biggest martial arts epics ever filmed. Bruce Lee, determined to avenge the murder of his sister, enters the island fortress of crime warlord Han. Lee staged his own fighting sequences in the movie and the sequences are thrilling in their timing and execution. 'Enter the dragon' was Lee's last film and his untimely death at a young age, a few weeks after the film's completion had made this a landmark film of its genre."
