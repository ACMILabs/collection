        "Frenchwoman Michele de la Becque (Joan Crawford) is a pampered Parisian whose high society lifestyle abruptly changes with the Nazi invasion of Paris. A downed RAF pilot on the run - Pat Talbot (John Wayne), enters her world seeking asylum, which Michele provides by hiding him in her tiny apartment. His escape however is reliant on the co-operation of Michele's rich industrialist finace Robert Corlot (Phillip Dorn) - who may also be a Nazi collaborator, a situation which is fraught with danger when love and allegiance are on the line. Cast also includes Reginald Owen, Albert Bassermann and John Carradine."
