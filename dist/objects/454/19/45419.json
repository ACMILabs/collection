        "Debuting director Frank Sinatra stars in this suspenseful war drama, the first American/Japanese film made in the United States. The story moves tautly between two enemy camps (both stranded on a deserted Pacific Island during World War II, both facing the same struggle for survival), gunfire is their only contact. Then the Japanese leader (Tatsuya Mihashi) offers to swap water for the aid of the American Pharmacist Maloney (Sinatra), whom he's mistaken for a doctor. When Maloney amputates the leg of a Japanese soldier and saves his life, peace breaks out between the two camps. But can it last? There are two sides to every war... this movie shows the heroism of both sides... and the respect that can develop among courageous men at war. Cast includes: Frank Sinatra, Clint Walker, Tatsuya Mihashi, Tony Bill."
