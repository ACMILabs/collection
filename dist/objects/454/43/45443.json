        "The search for life outside our solar system becomes a personal and spiritual quest for Ellie Arroway, a scientist who has lost her faith in God after her parents died when she was a child. However, she has learned to develop a different sort of faith in the seemingly unknowable, working with a group that monitors radio waves from space in a hope that some day she will receive a message from another world- proving there is a world beyond our own. When the team picks up a signal that does not appear to be of earthly origin, Ellie decodes the message and discovers what appear to be plans for a space craft, which she takes as an invitation. Ellie and her researchers soon run into interference however from a White House scientific adviser who cuts their funding and tries to take credit for their achievements. Cast includes Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, John Hurt and Tom Skerritt."
