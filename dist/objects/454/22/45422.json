        "A group of African-American cavalrymen ride into a desolate, racist and inhospitable frontier town. The town dishonours them, their Native American foes honour them, as Apache leader Victorio gives the soldiers a name of honour and strength, Buffalo Soldiers. The trooper's daring hunt for Victorio (Harrison Lowe) frames this stirring tribute to the former slaves and other African- Americans of the 9th and 10th U.S Cavalry Regiments. Cast includes Danny Glover, Bob Gunton, Carl Lumbly and Glynn Turman."
