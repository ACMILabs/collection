        "Between lensing Karloff/Lugosi monsterpieces 'The Raven' and 'The Black Cat' and scaling the further heights of B-film-making with 'Detour\" and 'The Man from Planet X', Ulmer helmed a number of poverty row film commissions. This is one from his East Coast stint in the early 1940's. At the suggestion of his daughter, a cheerfully deranged medical researcher constructs a \"Germ Radio\" in his laboratory/menagerie, and together with his friend \"Mr. Tee Bee\" they discuss tuberculosis and its treatment. More of a hallucination than an actual film, combining animation and live action. Stars James Kirkwood."
