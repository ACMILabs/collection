        "In her final movie appearance Ann Blyth portrays the famed 1920's \"torch singer\" Helen Morgan - from humble beginnings as a carnival dancer, through to the nightclub fame which captures her beauty, talent and success. In 1927 she has her own club as well as a lead role in Ziegfeld's Broadway production of 'Show Boat'. Helen's story is a somewhat tragic one however, as she spends most of her time anguishing over her non committal mobster boyfriend Larry Maddux (Paul Newman), the man who discovered her in the first place and promoted her to stardom. Maddux is not the only man playing an influential role in Helen's life either, she also becomes involved with Russell Wade, a married New York lawyer. Believing that she has been exploited for Maddux's own selfish gains, Helen turns to alcohol, as well as losing her money in the stock market crash and seems destined to disappear into obscurity. Cast also includes Richard Carlson, Gene Evans and Alan King."
