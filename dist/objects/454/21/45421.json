        "Joe Boyd (Robert Schafer), an aging business man and avid baseball follower makes a deal with the devilish Applegate (Ray Walston) to relive his youth and regain a position in the Washington Senators. In the process Boyd becomes the young, handsome \"Shoeless\" Joe Hardy (played by Tab Hunter), a star baseball player that earns his success at the cost of Boyd's soul. Boyd has a plan however - or so he thinks, a plan which seems destined to fail when Applegate sends in a beautiful decoy (Gwen Verdon) to seduce the baseball player. It all boils down to a tense game against the New York Yankees in which winning the pennant will also win back Joe's soul. Based on the Broadway play of the same name and written specially for the screen by Richard Adler, who co-authorised all the original songs with Jerry Ross."
