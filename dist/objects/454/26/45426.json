        "Mark Sway, an 11 year old trailer park kid (Brad Renfro) witnesses the suicide of a Mafia lawyer, who confesses that the Mob was behind the murder of a U.S. senator. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident and soon Mark finds himself torn between what he knows and what he can never tell. Gangster Barry Muldano (Anthony LaPaglia) is on Mark's trail, and in desperation Mark arrives at the office of recovering alcoholic lawyer Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon). With the Mob after them, and a ruthless federal attorney (Tommy Lee Jones) trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her client and his family. Based on the novel by John Grisham. Music by Howard Shore."
