        "Michael Wood travels from Europe to India on an epic 20,000 mile journey in search of the truth behind one of history's greatest stories. Travelling by bus, steam train, ancient sail boat and camel train, Michael follows the tracks of Alexander the Great into the heart of Asia. Along the route through Egypt, the Khyber Pass, Pakistan's Indus River and the dreaded Makran Desert, the history and myths of this great figure are explored. Scholars, Turkish bards, Uzbek herders and those who claim descent from Alexander's army all enlighten a fantastic journey and tell the story of a man who left an indelible mark on the history of the world. A teacher's guide and additional educational resources can be downloaded from the PBS web site: http://pbs.bilkent.edu.tr/mpt/alexander/index.html (Accessed 15/3/2000)"
