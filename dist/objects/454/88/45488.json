        "Woyzeck (1979): This film portrays the tragedy of a soldier who kills his unfaithful mistress who has had his child. He hears terrifying voices, he is victimised by his superiors and, in order to support his child, he takes part in a scientific experiment which results in his malnutrition. All or any of these factors could be the cause of his apparent madness. Cast includes: Klaus Kinski and Eva Mattes. \"Heart of Glass\" (1976): This visionary film with a resemblance to a folk tale is set around 1800. It begins with a prophet shepherd describing the Apocalypse. In the valley below, the foreman of a glass factory has died and with him the secret of producing an exquisite glass ruby from which the whole community lives. In his search for the formula, the factory owner is overcome with a madness that engulfs the village. Cast includes: Clemens Scheitz and Sonja Skiba. Both films in German with English subtitles."
