        "Laugh Lines is a film portrait of animator Kaj Pindal. He is seen at work creating zany cartoon characters, teaching students of animation, and at home enjoying another of his creations, a full-size streetcar that tours his backyard. The laughter in Pindal's life is evident in this delightful film biography. Photographed by Raymond Dumas and Richard Mores. Edited by Ian Rankin. Music by Betty Lazebnik. (Awards: Cracow; San Antonio.)"
