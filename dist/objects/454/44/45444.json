        "In 1913, a gang known as \"The Wild Bunch\", rode into a Texas border town disguised as U.S. soldiers. Silently they entered the railroad office and robbed it. Perched on the rooftops above was a ring of hired gunmen waiting for their prey. When the gang emerged they opened fire. An exciting, provocative and influential film that breathed new life into Westerns, it brings together an all-star cast of fine actors at the peak of their talents to play the band of magnificent losers in a dying, lawless West. A documentary, \"The Wild Bunch: an album in montage\", as well as a new introduction by Ernest Borgnine precedes the movie."
