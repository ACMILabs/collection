        "Science fiction and cult movie fans will warm to Tim Burton's distinct brand of humour in this sci-fi spoof where, once again, Earth is invaded by martians. These mean green invaders from the Red Planet have slimey humungous brains, are armed with Instr-ray guns, and are cinematically supported by state-of-the-art special effects. The stars that shine here include Jack Nicholson (in a dual role), Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, plus many more notable cameos (including one by Tom Jones)."
