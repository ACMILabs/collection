        "This version of Rafael Sabatini's swashbuckler stars Stewart Granger as Andre Moreau, an 18th century French nobleman who disguises himself as an actor to revenge the death of his brother at the hands of a wicked marquis. Challenged to a sword fight by the marquis, Moreau takes refuge in a theatrical troupe, posing as the clown - Scaramouche. Being in disguise provides Moreau with the time to take fencing lessons from swordmaster Doutreval (John Dehner), as well as romancing his leading lady, Lenore (Eleanor Parker). When Moreau/Scaramouche has learnt all there is to know about fencing, it's time to face his adversary, and there are a few surprises in store too that have nothing to do with duelling. This remake credits itself as containing the longest sword fight in cinema history. Cast also includes Janet Leigh and Mel Ferrer."
