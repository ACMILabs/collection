        "Part one of a three part series on the work and life of Carl Gustav Jung, the pioneer of modern psychology. Examines his childhood, student years and early career including Jung's struggle with religion; his discovery that institutionalising the mentally ill did not necessarily produce the best outcome; his marriage in 1903; his initial relationship with Freud and interest in things normality rejects. Contains some b&w footage. Presented by Laurens Van der Post who knew Jung from 1946 until his death in 1961"
