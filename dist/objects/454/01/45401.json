        "Jiminy Cricket explains how the human race has always needed play, recreation and fun. He contrasts unsafe play areas such as excavations, streets, new constructions or abandoned buildings, with safe areas, such as playgrounds, parks, one's own backyard. Safety in various recreations, hiking, swimming, cycling, skating and sailing. Warns against showing off or getting overtired - a tired person is a careless one. Only a \"common ordinary fool\" violates the safety rules."
