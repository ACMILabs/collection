        "Explains that animals have highly-specialised body parts which enable them to adapt to their environment. With close-up photography, shows animals building homes, raising their young, and acquiring and storing food. Includes scenes of a woodpecker drilling in the bark of a tree, a mosquito sucking blood from a farmer's arm, caterpillars spinning a web, ants carrying heavy loads of food, a caddis fly glueing materials together for its home, and beavers building a dam."
