        "The life of a Nigerian woman from birth to marriage, as she faces the basic issues of tradition versus progress, Christianity versus Islam, and colonialism versus independence. The strength of family and tribal ties; the happy village life of her childhood; her first awareness of the different religious faiths around her; going to the mission school and being fired by her father's zeal for independence; growing awareness of political and social problems as she goes to teachers college; her fiance's graduation from university and his decision to work in the service of his country; their marriage in a Christian church."
