        "A beauty-and-the-beast tale, enhanced and embellished by the filmmaker's art. The screen becomes a luminous, shimmering dance of colors from which the story's characters emerge like ephemeral beings from a mystic world, before melting away again into the chimerical void from which they came. The story is based on a west-coast Indian legend. The feats that the youth must perform to win his fair maiden are distinctly Indian ones, and masks are used in the telling of the story. Cast includes Stanley Coles, Patrick Cullen, Molly Dressel, Lubba Goy, Michael Hogan, Susan King, Mary Lou de la Salle, Jack Messinger, Sandy Nicholls, Marshall Webster. Photographed by David de Volpi. Edited by Margaret Wescott. Music by Bruce Mackay. Sound by Claude Delorme, Michel Hazel, Les Halman. (Awards: Toronto; New York)"
