        "Elvira and Michael Kent (Janis Paige and Don De Fore) are about to celebrate their third anniversary, however for the third year in a row, Michael can't make it. Elvira has always suspected her husband of being a philanderer, so decides to tell her husband that she's going away on their anniversary cruise to South America without him, while secretly staying behind and spying on him from an apartment opposite his work. When there's a mix up at the drugstore between Elvira's passport and that of nightclub singer Georgia Garrett (Doris Day), the plan begins to take shape. Georgia has never travelled before, and jumps at the opportunity to take an all expenses paid cruise; the only hitch is she has to pretend she's Lady Elvira Kent. Michael is as suspicious as his wife when it comes to fidelity, and he is surprised by her lack of concern about him not coming on the cruise. Instead of hiring someone to impersonate him, Michael hires personal detective Peter Virgil (Jack Carson) to go on the cruise and keep an eye on his wife. Peter and Georgia are drawn together and fall in love but are held back by their loyalty to the people who have hired them. The film culminates in the carnival city of Rio, where Georgia, Peter, the real Mr and Mrs Kent, and Georgia's friend who wants to marry her are all in the same hotel, where all will be revealed. This was Doris Day's first film role."
