        "One of Clint Eastwood's most engaging films, \"White hunter, black heart\" is based on Peter Vietel's novel about the location shoot of John Huston's immortal \"The African Queen\". The focus, however, is never on Bogie and Hepburn, but rather on the obsessive director who is determined to turn his new film project into a grand personal quest, hunting a wild elephant. Cast includes Clint Eastwood, Jeff Fahey, George Dzundza, Alun Armstrong and Marisa Berenson."
