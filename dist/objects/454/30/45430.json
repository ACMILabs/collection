        "The second \"Dirty Harry\" movie, \"Magnum Force\" concerns itself with a vigilante group that has targeted notorious criminals whose power and influence have made them immune from prosecution. When a prominent gang boss is set free by the air-headed liberal courts, he is soon exterminated by an avenging motorcycle cop. While Detective Harry Callahan is no great friend of civil liberties, he is dead set against wholesale murder as a solution to legal loopholes. Discovering that all the killings have been committed by a .357 Magnum, Callahan suspects his on-the-edge ex-partner is responsible. But the conspiracy is less transparent than that, as Harry learns, almost at the cost of his own life. Co-scripted by John Milius and Michael Cimino. Cast includes Clint Eastwood, Hal Holbrook, Mitchell Ryan, Felton Perry and David Soul."
