        "The viewer is plunged directly into war. The documentary element - the reconstruction of the campaign of General Merrill's American infantry regiment deep behind Japanese lines in Burma - seems to exist on a level independent of the more stylised attempt to abstract the rhythms of combat and survival. Because he experienced combat at first hand as an infantry man in World War II, Fuller has a certain commitment to represent that reality thus bringing the contradictions between re-creation and generic convention closer to the surface than is usual for the combat genre."
