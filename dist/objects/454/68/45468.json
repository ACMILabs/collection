        "Episode of Series \"Pacemakers\". Pininfarina, the world's greatest name in automobile design, founder of a firm which builds 25,000 car bodies a year, and designs many others. Farina has used his uncanny feeling for the look and shape of cars to build a unique industry - an industry which is ideally suited to a comparatively small industrial nation like Italy, and which has given her a reputation unequalled in the world. Commentary written and spoken by Anthony Jay."
