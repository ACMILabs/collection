        "James Cagney stars as a no-nonsense land baron Jeremy Rodock, who plays by his own rules, his own sense of justice and his own code of honour. Young cowhand Steve Miller (Don Dubbins) learns the hard way what it mean's to incur Rodock's wrath when he falls in love with the beautiful Jocasta Constantine (Irene Papas), whom Rodock considers his property. Through the example of the even-tempered Miller, however, Rodock rediscovers his own essential humanity. This excellent adaptation of Jack Schaefer's short story features early screen appearances by Vic Morrow and Lee Van Cleef."
