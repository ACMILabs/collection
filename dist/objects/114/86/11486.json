        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. This short work features a lonely boy dealing with the pain of peer pressure, abuse by fellow students and the depression he suffers as a result. It continues on until he can't cope with it any longer and writes a suicide note in his diary. He goes to the uppermost floor of a skyscraper and meets a lonely girl up there - seemingly suffering the same feelings. Together they jump into the abyss below."
