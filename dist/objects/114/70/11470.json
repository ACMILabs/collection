        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. An abstract narrative about dream flashbacks of a disturbing nature. A child survives a car accident in which his father was killed. He has contiinuing mental flashbacks and consequently this makes him fear death. He is bitten on the arm by a fly, and this begins a surreal experience of messages being relayed to him via the fly bites. A surreal thriller where confusion between the dream self and the real self is explored."
