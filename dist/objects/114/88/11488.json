This animated short recounts the story of 'Nuggit', an alien and his friend 'Goofs' the horse as they go on an exciting adventure into the deep dark forest. They are scared out of their wits as they are surrendered and attacked by enormous black killer spiders. They flee from the forest, never to return."
