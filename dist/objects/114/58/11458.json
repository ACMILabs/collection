        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. This documentary recounts the story of a woman's horrific past experiences of the Holocaust. Photographs and interviews are part of this film which highlights the fact that no matter how abominably bad Nazis treated the Jews during World War 2, this woman's unshakeable faith in her Jewish faith and identity as part of the Jewish race remains strong. A moving story about a race surviving against all odds."
