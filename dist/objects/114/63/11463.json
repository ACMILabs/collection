        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. A fly is desperately fleeing from being eaten by a bird. As he is manically tring to escape, he thinks his time is up when he comes across a frog. Luckily for the fly, the frog is more interested in eating the bird! Just when the fly thinks he is saved from death, SPLAT!! on the windscreen of a moving car."
