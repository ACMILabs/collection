        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. This drama recounts a girl's tragic journey of drug addiction. Feelings of isolation and loneliness mount as a girl struggles with everyday life - at school and at home.  Her friends begin to reject her, as her family does when they can no longer cope with her behaviour. As she tries to come to grips with her dependency, her family bond comes to breaking point and she is eventually thrown out of the family home. A bleak story of how drug addiction can ruin a person's life."
