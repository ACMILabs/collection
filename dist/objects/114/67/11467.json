        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. This animated work relates the story of a young naive boy's horrific beating by a vicious student from his school.  The young boy calls his older brother - a member of a gang, to avenge his beating. The older brother gathers up his friends and visits the student at his school and beats him in the school toilets. The vicious student retaliates by murdering the young boy. A bleak story of revenge."
