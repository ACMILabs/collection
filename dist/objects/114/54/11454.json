        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. A narrative of a schizophrenic girl's struggle to come to terms with her unstable mind and her wish to have a better life. She speaks of a faceless person, her other self, who goads her into self-mutilation and as a result suffers a recurring nightmare. A disturbing tale of the struggles of coming to terms with dealing with inner voices."
