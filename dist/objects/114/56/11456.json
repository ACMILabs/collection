        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. Fleeing from town, a small child finds himself hiding in a seemingly deserted railway station.  One day he is crossing the tracks when a train come hurtling towards him.  A beautifully photographed film, imbued with feelings of isolation and loneliness."
