    "description": [
        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. A day in the life of a blocked screenwriter. A film producer is harassing a screenwriter who is suffering major problems trying to come up with a script for his next movie. This short film visually depicts the film scenarios this writer conjures up - a mystery and gangster style thriller. Neither of these stories satisfy the frustrated screenwriter, and so he ends up writing a simple love story between two ordinary people. Finally he finishes the script and rushes to the post box to send his script to the producer. Upon arriving at the letter box, he meets the woman of his dreams. His screenwriting dreams become a reality."
