    "description": [
        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI secondary school media festival. A claymation short features an older man walking along a street. He is pleased to find an old jukebox with one of his favorite songs in it. He puts a coin in the slot, but needs to insert more money. Not finding any in his pocket, he finds a bottle top on the street, picks it up and pops it into the coin slot, but the jukebox still requires more money.  He decides to take off his pincenez and his nose and proceeds to put them into the jukebox, but alas, still not enough money. He proceeds to take his ears off and thankfully the machine starts to play...but can he hear the music?!"
