        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. A put upon adolescent is faced with the unusual problem of potential self-combustion whenever he gets nervous. As a result, his fear is palpable when it comes to his first date. His reluctance is soon overcome as things go well and he decides to invite his love into the bedroom...what happens next is surprising and hilarious!"
