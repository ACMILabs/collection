        "Early in 2001, the banks pulled out of the small coastal town of San Remo in south eastern Victoria, leaving the community with a challenge. Rather than sit on his hands and accept the inevitable consequences of downsizing, a local hardware store owner, Terry Ashenden, pulled together a committee of residents and business owners to overcome the problem."
