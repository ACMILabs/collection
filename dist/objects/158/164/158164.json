    "description": [
        "Between 1941 and 1945, nearly a million US servicemen came to Australia. Initially welcomed as saviours their glamour soon wore off. Australia became the scene of occasional conflict between returning Australian veterans and US personnel, with their higher pay and superior supplies.  Australian Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey, acted for Australia under the supervision of US General Douglas Macarthur, Supreme Commander of the south-West Pacific Area, who once described Blamey as a \"sensual, slothful and doubtful moral character, but a tough commander\". Even now Blamey is a controversial figure and has been referred to in history as \"that bastard Blamey\"."
