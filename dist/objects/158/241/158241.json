        "In 2002, in amongst raging protests and police reinforcements, more than 40 refugees, rendered desperate by manditory detention, escaped from Woomera Detention Centre in South Australia. Narrated by escaped refugee DJ Moopsie, with powerful music by Mark Daniel, 'Through the wire' captures the heightened emotions, despair and desperation of the day and takes us inside the minds of those imprisoned trying to seek a better life."
