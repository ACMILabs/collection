    "description": [
        "Born in 1917 and raised during the Depression years in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, Frank Hardy later became a member of the Communist Party of Australia. During this time, Hardy collected material for his novel 'Power Without Glory'. This was to become his best-known book and lead to one of Australia's most famous defamation trials. In 1976 the book was adapted for television and became a successful mini-series for ABC-TV. His other novels are 'The Four-Legged Lottery', 'The Outcasts of Foolgarah', 'But the Dead are Many', 'Who Shot George Kirkland?' and 'The Obsession of Oscar Oswald'. Hardy continued to write novels until his death in 1994 and this interview for Australian Biography was his last."
