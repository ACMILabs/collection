        "As the country prepares to celebrate the 152nd Melbourne Cup, the National Film and Sound Archive has been busy preserving a 19th Century flipbook and bringing the 1897 race back to life. The flipbook features 64 pages of tiny printed photographs and after undergoing conservation treatment, still image experts individually photographed each page. Later these were digitally assembled by video technicians to re-create the animated effect and experience, seeing the Cup's finale in \"living photographs\"."
