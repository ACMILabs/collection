        "Melbourne social history through the documentaries and experimental films of Ivan Gaal."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Whether through his photography, experimental films or documentaries, Ivan Gaal aims to make a difference to his audience. After graduating from Swinburne Film School in 1978, Gaal spent 20 years working for the Victorian Department of Education's Film Unit, making films that delved into certain facets of society, making them an important contribution to Australia's social history. Gaal's experimental films, as with his documentaries, are imbued with a political, socially conscious perspective without being didactic. They also capture the Melbourne artist-driven activism of the late 1970s to 1980s, featuring his work with Pram Factory's Max Gillies and his membership with the Melbourne Filmmakers Co-operative. \"...for Gaal is still, at 74, a fully alive, joyful, robust \u2018man with a movie camera\u2019. A man with a gift for cinema, and also with something always relevant and urgent to say.\" ['An Appreciation of Ivan Gaal and His Film/Video Work', \u00a9 Associate Professor Adrian Martin, Monash University Film Studies, July 2012]"
