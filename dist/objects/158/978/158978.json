        "Originally from Ireland, Catherine Gaskin moved to Australia in 1929. Her first novel, 'This Other Eden', was written when she was 15 and published by the time she was 17. In the 1950s she published three best-sellers, 'Dust in Sunlight' (1950), 'All Else is Folly' (1951), and 'Daughter of the House' (1952). Her most familiar work, 'Sara Dane', was completed by the time she was 25 and published in 1955. It went on to sell more than 2 million copies, was translated into many languages and in 1982 was made into an Australian TV series."
