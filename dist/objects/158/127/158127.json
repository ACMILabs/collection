        "Bill Gardner is tackling climate change in his own backyard, with the help of his mates John and Will. Together, these 'Wimmera men', located in western Victoria, are investigating the potential of using gasifier technology, which can be used to convert grain into fuel. Rather than being dismissed as 'crazy', this initiative has received widespread support from both the government and community."
