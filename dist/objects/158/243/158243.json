        "In the Purosa region of Papua New Guinea, the community have worked together to produce some of the world's most sought-after coffee beans. The quality of the beans are such that they are imported to places like Melbourne and have the added benefit of being fair-trade, organic coffee. The growers explain how this industry has been a boon to the community and improved their wealth, while coffee-lovers in Melbourne enjoy good coffee with a clear conscience."
