        "Three day bivouac by Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) who learn to improvise cooking, sleeping and sanitary arrangements, first aid treatment and the correct method of transporting casualties using available materials.  During the early years of the war women were generally unable to make a significant contribution to the war effort in any official capacity. Labour shortages forced the government to allow women to take a more formal role in war work and, in February 1941, the RAAF received cabinet approval to establish the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF).  In this footage, identified personnel are Group Officer Clare Stevenson, performing an inspection, and Flight Officer D J Carter, frying emergency rations."
