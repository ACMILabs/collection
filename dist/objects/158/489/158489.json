        "In this interview, featured as part of the 'Game Masters' exhibition, Peter Molyneux speaks about his career as a videogame designer. While selling baked beans, a once in a life time opportunity presented itself and Molyneux took advantage of his good fortune. His first game, 'Populous', became a huge worldwide success, surprising everyone, including himself.  In this interview Peter talks about his inspirations, his work practise and his never-ending fascination with the notion of morality and choice. Now, as Creative Director of Microsoft Game Studios, Molyneux is one of the best known names in the videogames industry. Making his mark as a games designer and programmer, he has been responsible for a string of bestselling games, including 'Populous', 'Dungeon Keeper', 'Black and White' and 'Fable I, II and III'.  NB: Interviewer is neither seen nor heard onscreen."
