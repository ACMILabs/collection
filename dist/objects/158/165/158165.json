    "description": [
        "Fearful of enemy attack during the war years, and under advice from State Emergency authorities, many Australians constructed their own backyard bomb shelters. The Federal Defence Committee considered the most likely attack to come by air and concentrated their publicity to educate the public how to avoid casualties caused by high explosive and incendiary bombs. Adequate training and equipage of fire fighters was, therefore, also a serious issue. It was estimated that incidence of bomb raids would not be above once a fortnight, but anxieties were no doubt heightened by the Japanese bombing raids on Darwin in February 1942 and their submarine visit to Sydney Harbour later the same year."
