        "Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy talk about their careers designing games at Harmonix Music Systems. While not the first to combine music and videogames, Rigopulos and Egozy were central to the global success of the rhythm genre.  Rigopulos and Egozy\u2019s studio Harmonix\u2019s first two rhythm games, the cult classics 'Frequency' (2001) and 'Amplitude' (2003), were abstract games with trance-like visuals matched to a gameplay of tight precision. They soon moved on to peripheral-based rhythm games such as 'Guitar Hero' (2005), 'Rock Band' (2007) and 'Dance Central' (2010).  NB: Interviewer is neither seen nor heard onscreen."
