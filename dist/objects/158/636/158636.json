    "description": [
        "New York based Australian artist Ian Burns discusses his inventive 'meta-cinematic' exhibition, 'In the Telling'. Presenting a network of close-circuit kinetic sculptures that work together to create live video footage inside the gallery, the exhibition invites audiences to suspend their disbelief and behold a moment of cinematic clich\u00e9 and excess.  In this interview, Ian talks about his art process, influences and goes into the ideas behind works included in the exhibition such as the ACMI commissioned 'Anywhere and Here'."
