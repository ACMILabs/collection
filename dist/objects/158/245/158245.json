    "description": [
        "The debate surrounding the production of nuclear energy goes back to the bombing of Hiroshima at the end of World War II. Since then, the proliferation of nuclear energy and weapons has been used as a deterrant, a bolstering of military power and, in the early 2000's, as a solution to combat global warming.  With the Prime Minister John Howard's comments regarding not ruling out atomic power stations, this documentary considers the implications to the environment, the people living on the land, our health and our future."
