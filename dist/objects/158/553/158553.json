        "The expression \"a Tim Schafer moment\" is used among videogame experts and makers to describe an instance of great creativity or genius. This is a conversation with Tim Schafer, filmed as part of the ACMI 'Game Masters' exhibition 2012.  From studying computer science at the renowned UC Berkeley, to working at George Lucas' game production company LucasArts, and finally to founding his own production company, Double Fine Productions, Tim Schafer has made an indelible mark on the international games industry.  Through his work on titles including 'Maniac Mansion', 'The Secret of Monkey Island' and 'Full Throttle', Schafer has became known for his storytelling and comedic style.  With the 1995 release of his highly acclaimed 'Grim Fandango', a noir adventure game set in the Aztec afterlife that draws its inspiration from the Mexican festival 'Dia De Los Muertos', Schafer cemented his place in games history and demonstrated the most momentous \"Tim Schafer moment\" of them all.  NB: Interviewer is neither seen nor heard onscreen."
