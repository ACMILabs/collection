    "description": [
        "At its inception, TT Games acquired the worldwide rights to LEGO games and began combining the versatility and imagination of LEGO with one of cinema\u2019s more popular worlds to create 'LEGO Star Wars: The Videogame' (2005). The unlikely combination of LEGO, 'Star Wars' and puzzle-solving gameplay was a surprise hit, garnering acclaim not usually attributed to children's games.  Continuing the LEGO series, TT Games branched out into a variety of well-known film franchises, including 'Batman' and 'Harry Potter', creating many entertaining, humorous and beloved titles. With each new title there was an emphasis on improving the formula with new puzzles, gameplay and features.  Producer Phillip Ring and Head of Production, Jonathan Smith, discuss 'LEGO Star Wars: The Videogame' series, 'LEGO Batman: The Videogame' and 'LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 & 5-7'.  NB: Interviewer is neither seen nor heard onscreen."
