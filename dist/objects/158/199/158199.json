        "When Clare Le Serve started a craft group for young mums in the early 1980s, she could not have imagined that it would grow over the next 30 years to become such an amazing community asset. With the help of local volunteers and paid staff, the Community Centre offers essential services that make a positive impact on the people of Bass and the surrounding Waterline region in south-eastern Victoria."
