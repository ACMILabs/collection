        "Two visualisations. The first, the projected opening on May 9th, 2001 for the Cinemedia Screen Gallery. Includes 18 projectors, 16 plasma screens, 16 TFT screens and 24 TFT kiosks. The second on May 9th, 2003 includes 250 screens. Both show moving image clips projected onto different types and sizes of screens, and give a sense of how the screen gallery at Federation Sqaure will look and feel."
