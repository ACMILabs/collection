        "In this interview, featured as part of the 'Game Masters' exhibition, Rob Murray speaks about his career as a game designer. Starting out as a solo developer for hire to becoming CEO of Firemint, Murray is one of the most successful indie game developers in existence.  Firemint's success is due to Murray's vision to create games such as 'Flight Control'(2009) and' Real Racing' (2009), which are both easy to play and elegant and addictive in equal measure. In addition, his prescient reading of the drive towards personalised gaming, led by the ubiquity of social networking on mobile platforms, has kept his games on trend \u2013 'Flight Control', for example, allows players to choose music from their personal libraries to accompany the game.  Rob talks about the rise of mobile based gaming and the development of 'Flight Control' and 'Real Racing' ."
