        "Paulina Bozek started her career at Ubisoft in Montreal, Canada, before moving to Sony as the Executive Producer of the 'SingStar' franchise for PlayStation. Currently she is CEO and co-founder at INENSUA, responsible for overseeing the creative direction and team management for the development of social games and applications. A self-confessed casual gamer, Paulina studied film and communication and has always been interested in pop culture and the combination of technology and entertainment. In this interview she discusses her preference for working on long term projects, as well as the importance of user feedback and engaging the audience early in the development process.  In this interview Paulina talks about 'SingStar', 'Closet Swap' and her new project 'Super Fan'. NB: Interviewer is neither seen nor heard onscreen."
