        "As a driving force in setting standards and codes for children's television, Dr Patricia Edgar became the founding director for the Australian Children's Film and Television Foundation which was established in 1982. The year 2012 marks the ACTF's 30 year anniversary developing and producing children's television, providing programs which have screened in over 100 countries, and have won over 95 local and international awards. Included in this package are highlights from episodes from some of the ACTF's most popular and award winning programs. In partnership with Screen Australia and independent producers, the ACTF continues to ensure high quality children programs are available to Australian children."
