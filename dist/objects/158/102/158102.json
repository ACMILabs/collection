        "Deluxe & Kodak together with the NFSA, have collaborated to preserve 75 Australian films made in the 1950's-90's."

    "description": [
        "It has been well documented that many of Australia's early films have long been lost. However, it's not widely known that Australia's more recent colour films are also at risk. In all preservation work, the National Film and Sound Archive's goal is to represent as faithfully as possible the look and sound of the original film. As film deteriorates over time - increasing with use - it's a challenge to know what the film might actually have looked like when it was made. By working closely with the filmmakers and skilled film technicians, we produce new prints and maintain the original intention and integrity of the film.  The NFSA together with sponsors Deluxe Sydney and Kodak (Australasia) have been preserving Australian classic films since 2000. Seventy five significant Australian films have been produced between the 1950s-90s are now available through this collaboration. This program presents four of these now preserved, classic films."
