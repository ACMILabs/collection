    "description": [
        "Marion Peters loves living on the land. Despite having the opportunity of establishing a life in the city, she returned to her hometown to raise a family with her husband Geoff on a 12-hectare organic farm that they developed from scratch. Having overcome droughts, hailstorms and the large financial strain of maintaining a farm, Marion feels that things are finally looking up, with a bumper harvest of apples and promising yields of avocadoes and lemons. Marion is heavily involved in giving back to her community, pivotal in fundraising and ensuring community activities are maintained in a small town with a small population.  She believes that it is vital for locals to stay involved and active within their own community."
