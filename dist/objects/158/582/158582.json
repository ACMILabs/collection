        "Yu Suzuki talks about his body of work which is one of the most diverse in the industry, ranging from the adrenalin rushes of his early arcade hits 'Space Harrier' (1985) and 'Hang-On' (1985) to the console adventure epic 'Shenmue' (1999).  As the pioneer of immersive, full-body arcade games, Suzuki has never been afraid to explore fantasy, reality and every shade of virtual experience in between.  In 1999, Suzuki moved away from arcades to create 'Shenmue' (1999), an open-world adventure for the Dreamcast. 'Shenmue' was recognised at the time as one of the most expansive and detailed videogames ever made; it pioneered the \u2018open city\u2019 subgenre of open-world games.  NB: Interviewer is neither seen nor heard onscreen."
