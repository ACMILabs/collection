        "Blizzard Entertainment is a world leading developer and publisher renowned for creating some of the industry\u2019s most critically acclaimed games. Blizzard\u2019s first success was in 1994 with 'Warcraft: Orcs and Humans', a game that laid the foundations for the burgeoning real-time strategy genre, introducing gameplay features that would become standards. In 1996 the company released the action-role-playing-game 'Diablo'. With a track record that includes thirteen number one games and multiple Game of the Year awards, Blizzard Entertainment has gone on to establish one of the largest online followings of any game company worldwide.  The company is best known for the subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing games 'World of Warcraft' (2004), and 'StarCraft' (1998) series.
