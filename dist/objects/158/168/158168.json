        "Taken in long shot from a high angle, the following armaments pass by the camera: 3.7 inch Anti-Aircraft (A/A) guns and transporters, 40mm Bofors A/A guns, 2 Pounder Anti-Tank (A/T) guns mounted on Quad trucks, 6 Pounder A/T guns, Bren gun carriers, Dingo Scout cars and Sentinel tanks, produced at Fisherman's Bend. Australian industry did not have the capacity to bend armour plate of the type required by a cruiser tank and so the Sentinel\u2019s makers took the revolutionary step of casting the hull. The Sentinel was a powerful weapon; unfortunately, it did not see action, as Australian armoured units were supplied with US equipment before it could be put into production."
