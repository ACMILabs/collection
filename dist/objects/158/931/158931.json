    "description": [
        "The Roxy Theatre in Ouyen was under threat of becoming an abandoned ruin until the community stepped in to save it. Originally opened in 1936, it eventually became one of the only tropical theatres in the southern region of Australia but was closed in 1971 due to the actions of rowdy youths (according to local myth). After 36 years of closure, Jenny Heaslip took on the challenge of restoring the theatre and rallied over 250 local volunteers to help her. It is now an integral meeting point for the people of Ouyen not only because of fortnightly film screenings, but for community events, launches and celebrations. Run on a shoestring budget The Roxy continues to rely upon volunteers and community fundraising to stay alive."
