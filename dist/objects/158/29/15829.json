    "description": [
        "A thought-provoking short film set in the future. Australia's water has run out - as a result the government has restricted acces to water, issuing citizens with one container of water every three days. Civil unrest has broken out and the military has imposed martial law. This is the story of a father who must protect his daughter at all costs in a society where survival is paramount. Cast includes Tim Ferris, Pepita Emmerichs, Jeremy Kewley. Shot mainly in black and white with some color sequences. Written and directed by Nicholas Carlton, produced by William Hardie."
