    "description": [
        "This demonstration was staged at Williamstown, the site of a naval dockyard. The Swedish-designed Bofors gun was manufactured in Australia from 1941 at the Government Ordnance Factory at Maribyrnong, Victoria. The presentation gun was manufactured in 1943, and issued to the 2nd/1st Composite Anti-Aircraft Regiment, which used it in action in Borneo in 1945. It became standard equipment for Australia's WWII ships, and some RAN ships still carry them. The Oerlikon gun shown here was an anti-aircraft gun, such as the one fired by Ordinary Seaman Edward Sheean, who continued to return fire to Japanese bombers as he went down with his ship, HMAS Armidale, on 1 December, 1942.  The identified in official party are General Sir Thomas A. Blamey; Major General C E M Lloyd; Major General L E Beavis, Master General of Ordnance;  Major General J S Whitelaw, Master General Royal Artillery LHQ."
