    "description": [
        "A film showing the movement of the 3rd Australian Division from Seymour to Bonegilla, Victoria, 1942, including scenes of making and breaking camp in the scrub, wood chopping, and artillery practice.  Now well known for its days as a migrant accomodation centre, Bonegilla was, in the war years, a substantial army camp. The movement of an entire division to Camp Bonegilla marked a significant strategic decision by Australian military, for the town, close by the break of railway gauge, allowed the speedy removal of army personnel and equipment in case of attack. This film was made shortly after the first bombing raids on Darwin."
