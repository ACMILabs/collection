    "description": [
        "A selection of films from the Australian War Memorial providing a brief glimpse of the life of our armed forces. The Australian War Memorial houses a vast record of Australians at war and the activities of the armed forces during peacetime with over 70,000 hours of moving image, over 800,000 photographs and over 8,000 hours of sound recordings.  These works show how Australia and specifically, the city of Melbourne, around 1942, was impacted by visiting troops and the war in general. Backyard bomb shelters, tank and gun construction, women in the workforce and medical innovations specific to the conflict are featured."
