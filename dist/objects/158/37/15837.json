        "\"Ozala\" is an Afghani refugee who spent three years in a detention centre - his only crime was in wanting freedom. During this time in prison Ozala discovered the art of painting, where he could express his emotions, where shapes and colors became symbolic of his life and experiences and where he could escape to freedom. A thoughtful and reflective film interspersed with images of Ozala's paintings. In Farsi (Persian) with English subtitles"
