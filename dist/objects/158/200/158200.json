        "Inverloch\u2019s Clock Tower Committee and Historical Society, in south-eastern Victoria, joined forces to create a maritime precinct along the town\u2019s foreshore. The lovingly restored \u2018Rocket Shed\u2019 and newly built replica of \u2018The Ripple\u2019 sit side-by-side and showcase Inverloch\u2019s connection to the water. \u2018The Ripple\u2019 is responsible for delivering timber for the first house built in Inverloch and the \u2018Rocket Shed\u2019 tells the story of a time when ocean rescues were less sophisticated than recent times."
