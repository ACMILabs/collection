        "Australian animation students' work, reflecting on and developing the lyrical animation style of artists such as William Kentridge."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "William Kentridge's rich work employs the technique of charcoal erasure - shooting a couple of frames of a drawing, then erasing part of the drawing and shooting another frame. Though a painstaking process, the results are breathtakingly beautiful: the form itself embodies a sense of change and metamorphosis, where everything is fluid and organic. Since nothing can ever be completely erased, the previous image is a 'ghost' under the current one, giving the work a reminiscent, melancholic quality. The effect of this form of animation is replicated in the paint on glass animation adopted by many students learning about the art of animation. Some examples of this work, submitted as coursework by RMIT AIM (Animation and Interactive Media) students, have been selected to illustrate the unique quality of this technique, as well as work that captures the feelings of isolation that lay behind the themes of metamorphosis, transition and change."
