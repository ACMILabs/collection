        "This film depicts the activities of the Australian Army Medical Corps Training Depot at Wangaratta, Victoria, 1942, including gymnastics and fitness training, stretcher bearing and a lecture from matron.  The AAMC (Australian Army Medical Corps) units were trained to apply modern medical and surgical methods across the theatre of World War II - from Tobruk, Greece and Alamein, to the regions of the Pacific. One of the Corps' most renowned members, Sir Edward \"Weary\" Dunlop, was taken by the Japanese forces as a prisoner of war in 1942 from Java, and sent with other Australian POWs to the infamous Thai-Burma Railway. He tirelessly tended other Australian prisoners with AAMC techniques which he adapted, where possible, to the tropical circumstances most doctors weren't trained for."
