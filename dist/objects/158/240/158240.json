        "Socially-conscious documentaries from the late Australian filmmaker Pip Starr."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Deeply committed and compassionate, Pip Starr (born Stuart Hill) started film-making after coming to Melbourne to study acting at the Victorian College of the Arts in the 1990s. Spurred on by a need to raise awareness and fight injustice, his documentaries are passionate polemics and important historical accounts of Australia's activist history. As well as producing quality, well-researched documentaries, Starr had a talent for capturing key moments, often bringing the viewer to the frontline of some of the most important protest movements in the last 20 years."
