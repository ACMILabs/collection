        "Mark Rosenthal, curator of the 'William Kentridge: Five Themes' exhibition, joins world renowned artist and filmmaker William Kentridge in conversation days before the official opening of the exhibition. Kentridge talks about becoming an artist in the apartheid era of South Africa, how he developed his art practice and the importance of the studio as a place for safe stupidity.  This is a rare opportunity to hear one of the world's most renowned moving image artists discuss his remarkable work."
