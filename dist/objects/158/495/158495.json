        "Tetsuya Mizuguchi started in the industry working for SEGA developing arcade games such as 'Sega Rally'. In 1994 he was inspired by the street parades in Zurich and soon turned his love of synaesthesia, combining sound and vision, to produce the games 'Rez' and 'Space Channel 5'. Mizuguchi continues to incorporate a notable emphasis on interactive sound design, with his latest game 'Child of Eden'.  Currently he is co-founder of the videogame development firm Q Entertainment. NB: Interviewer is neither seen nor heard onscreen."
