        "This film collection explores cross-cultural intersections between Germany and Australia and looks at the way German history, culture, people and places have been represented over time. From ordinary and extraordinary Australians visiting Germany, to celebrating German heritage in multicultural Australia. The titles included in this collection reveal historically or culturally significant moments in time, while others seek to retrospectively interpret the German experience."
