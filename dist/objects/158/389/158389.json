        "David Greig's experimental films & documentaries capture Australian life in the 1970s & '80s, examining the world of the artist."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "After two years at Swinburne Film and Television School, David Greig started making films in 1972, during the Australian film industry's \"New Wave\". Greig simultaneously made experimental films that screened at the Melbourne Filmmakers' Cooperative as well as editing for other filmmakers. His work as an editor took Greig to Kestrel Film Productions where he became a producer of documentaries. This program is a cross-section of Greig's work. Ranging from experimental works to documentaries, they provide facets of Australian life in the 1970s and 1980s and some insight into the life of the artist, in both Greig's subjects and his own creative sensibilities."
