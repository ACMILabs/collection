    "description": [
        "Active since 1947, The World Festival of Youth and Students is an international left wing event organised by World Federation of Democrative Youth. This silent colour footage extract is from the third festival hosted in Berlin in 1951, which was attended by over 25,000 delegates from 104 countries. Scenes show delegates celebrating and marching for peace and friendship and signs of post war recovery. Shot by Bob Mathews, co-founder of the Realist Film Association and the Realist Film Unit which produced a series of political documentaries and propaganda films in Australia from the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Festival was re-staged in Berlin in 1973 and still going strong with the 17th festival  held in 2010 in Tshawne, South Africa."
