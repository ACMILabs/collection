        "In this interview, featured as part of the Game Masters exhibition, Tim Schafer speaks about his career as a game designer, starting at LucasArts and then founding his own production company Double Fine Productions. Tim discusses his influences, drawn heavily from the cultural folk law of Mexico, the psychological study of dreams, his love of heavy metal music and the writing of Raymond Chandler and Kurt Vonnegut Jr.  With the progression of emerging technology his game aesthetics and character development have evolved, cementing Tim Schafer and Double Fine Productions\u2019 place in games history.  Tim talks about his inspirations and work practices in developing the following games: 'Full Throttle', 'Grim Fandango', 'Psychonauts' and 'Brutal Legend'.
