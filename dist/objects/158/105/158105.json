        "Unloading of lend-lease goods from a ship, at what is probably Victoria Dock. Equipment unloaded includes M3 General Stuart Light Tank and large wooden cases marked \"Buick Motor GM Corp, Melrose Park, Ill Chevrolet\". Like other US produced equipment, the Stuart light tanks were shipped directly from the United States to Australia under lend- lease agreement. The Stuarts served in Papua New Guinea in 1942 and 1943, with the 2/6th Armoured Regiment using them in action at Buna and Sanananda to attack Japanese bunkers and fortifications."
