    "description": [
        "Roxby Downs, in South Australia and run by Western Mining (later BHP Billiton), is the world's largest uranium mine. It also sits on sacred Aboriginal land and proposals to increase production were considered to have possibly severe implications. The population and culture of the Arabunna and Koktha people could be effected, as could environmental and ecological concerns such as local water levels and quality.  In September 1997, the music festival 'Roxstop' was held to prevent these developments to the mine. In amongst the protests and celebrations, activists went on a company-hosted tour of the mine to learn how Western Mining justify their position on expanding operations."
