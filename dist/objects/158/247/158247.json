    "description": [
        "In 1998, over 5,000 people travelled to Kakadu, in the Northern Territory, to stand alongside the traditional owners of the land, the Mirrar people, and lend their support to the Jabiluka Campaign. The fight to prevent the development of the Jabiluka uranium mine was one of the biggest protest movements in Australia's history and over 600 people were arrested in the process. It took film-maker Pip Starr four years to make this film, including one year spent documenting these historic events."
