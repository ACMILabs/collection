        "Gil and Liz Hopkins have lived in Laharum, in western Victoria, for over 30 years. They raised three children there, built their own home, which is nearly completely self-sufficient, with solar panels and reclaimed water. Their hope is to leave the land in better shape than they found it and they're taking their knowledge to the community to help others do the same."
