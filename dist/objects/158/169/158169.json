    "description": [
        "A formal demonstration of Australian mechanical cavalry, cutting edge technology for the time. The first Australian Bren Gun Carrier was built at the Victorian Railways Workshops, Newport, in 1940. As it was fast and agile, the machine-gun was also used by divisional cavalry regiments as scout vehicles and by infantry battalion carrier platoons as transport vehicles. Fifty Australian carriers served with Australian troops in the Middle East, some of which were destroyed or captured in Greece.  Observing the trials are: Australia's Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey; General Sutherland, Chief of Staff to General Douglas MacArthur; Mr Robert G Menzies, Major General L E Beavis, Master General of Ordnance; Mr A R Code, Honourable N J O Makin, Minister of Munitions; Mr A Fadden; Honourable J S Beasley, Minister for Supply and Development (and father of Minister Kim Beasley); Major General H G Bennett."
