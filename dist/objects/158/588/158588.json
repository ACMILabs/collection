        "Fumito Ueda may have only two published games but each one has had such an impact that his influence is felt keenly across the industry. Ueda joined Sony Computer Entertainment in 1997 where he developed his first game, 'ICO' (2001), a beautifully poetic adventure game based on an abstracted boy-meets-girl premise. Ueda\u2019s next game, 'Shadow of the Colossus' (2005) took an opposing theme to ICO\u2019s sacrificial narrative, with the aim being to topple 16 giant mythical beings to restore the life of a girl named Mono.  NB: This interview was conducted in Fumito Ueda\u2019s native language of Japanese and features English subtitles. Interviewer is neither seen nor heard onscreen."
