    "description": [
        "From the earliest years of cinema, novels, plays, musicals, biographies and even poems, have been adapted for film and television screens. Inspired by audiences' love of a screen adaptation, filmmakers and scriptwriters have been engaged in the process of adapting words to images. The argument about which is better, the book or the film  continues to polarise and entertain but for producers, directors and screenwriters, there are different challenges in ensuring the film remains faithful to the spirit of a text, whilst creating something entirely new. Celebrating the National Year of Reading, the NFSA's Film Australia Collection presents a series of insightful programs featuring some of Australia's most significant and successful writers whose works have been adapted to feature film and television."
