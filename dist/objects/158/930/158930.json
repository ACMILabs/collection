        "Several years ago a group of Ouyen Primary School students petitioned their local council to adopt a community-recycling program. To everybody's surprise the council not only provided an unprecedented household recycling service but did so at a loss. Since that time the community has launched a number of forward thinking initiatives with solar power, sustainable agriculture and improved water usage. Whether it's the Ouyen Football Club, High School or local farmers, there's an understanding that sustainable practices must be employed now in order for future Ouyen generations to benefit."
