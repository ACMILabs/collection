    "description": [
        "At Melbourne University, a parade of 2,500 women of the Women's Auxilary Australian Air Force (WAAAF), with RAAF and WRAAAF military bands and open air lunch. Lady Zara Gowrie, Air Commandant of the WAAF, stands at the saluting base.  During the early years of the war women were generally unable to make a significant contribution to the war effort in any official capacity. Labour shortages forced the government to allow women to take a more formal role in war work and, in February 1941, the RAAF received cabinet approval to establish the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF).  Identities in this film are Group Officer Clare Stevenson; Squadron Officer M.Miller, Deputy Director; and Lady Zara Gowrie, wife of the then Governor General, as Air Commandant."
