        "Hideo Kojima speaks about his career as a designer and producer of video games at Konami Digital Entertainment and Kojima Productions. At a time when mainstream action games only focused on attack and defeat, 'METAL GEAR' (1987) introduced infiltration into the gameplay and became one of the earliest examples of a stealth game. In 1998, the first 3D title in the 'Metal Gear' series, 'METAL GEAR SOLID', was released, integrating the most advanced stealth-based gameplay yet seen with cut-scenes that reflected Kojima\u2019s passion for cinema. 'METAL GEAR SOLID' became a worldwide best seller and was followed by three successful sequels.  NB: This interview was conducted in Hideo Kojima\u2019s native language of Japanese and features English subtitles. Interviewer is neither seen nor heard onscreen."
