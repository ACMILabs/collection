        "A small but dedicated group of volunteers provide vital emergency service to their local community. Murray Allomes has been the team leader of the Nangiloc/Colignan Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) for 7 years. The small team of volunteers ensure that if an emergency takes place in their district assistance is provided quickly and with care. Despite the serious nature of their role within the community there's always time for a laugh and a yarn about the strange and wonderful moments they encounter on the job."
