        "This documentary has been produced to raise awareness about the continuing tragedy in the Darfur region of Western Sudan and build solidarity between the Australian people and the people of Darfur. The conflict in Darfur has been continuing for more than three years, has resulted in the deaths of more than 400,000 civilians, the displacement of at least 2.5 million people and there are currently 3.5 million people dependent upon insufficient international humanitarian aid. Darfur is in crisis and the genocide has to stop. The film includes footage from refugee camps in Darfur, artwork and music from a range of local artists, and the perceptions of a range of influential Australians as to why Australians should make NOISE for Darfur."
