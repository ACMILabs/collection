        "The best of the 1967 National Hockey League season, set to music in the Tijuana Brass style and filmed with an eye to grace and style of movement suggestive of the bull ring as well as the hockey arena - a novel view, with soaring sound that gives even more drama to the struggle on the ice. Camera tricks enhance the unusual presentation of this fastest of winter sports. Awards: Cortina d'Ampezzo; Kranj."
