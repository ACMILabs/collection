        "Blood and the Imaginary of blood, both play a prominent part in Christian worship. The most common experience of blood - women's menstrual bleeding - is still widely regarded as 'unclean'. Explores the power and impact of the taboo on menstruating women still practised in society and four major religions - Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Orthodox Judaism. The fears women experience and the guilt and shame induced by centuries of suppression masquerading as religious laws are examined. In this program, women from all cultures describe their personal and social consequences of menstruation."
