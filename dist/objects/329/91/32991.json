        "Episode of Series \"The World about us\". Hualampong railway station is where thousands of children arrive hoping to find jobs but are sold into the misery and degradation of slavery and sin in Bangkok's sweatshops, factories and brothels. Many simply disappear. The fact that children are an integral part of the work force is accepted in south east Asia, but in Thailand it is a cruel and thriving business."
