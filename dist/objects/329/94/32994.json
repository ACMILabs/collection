        "A dramatised re-enactment of the methods used by the Reverend Keith Moon's Unification Church to brainwash young people into joining the church and carrying out its work. Actual ex-members of the group, who have now been deprogrammed, appear in the film as themselves, providing a frightening portrayal of their gradual conversion to the philosophy of the Moonies. Shows the deprogramming methods used by ex-Moonies on young people who still adhere to the beliefs of Keith Moon. An excellent insight into the power of group psychology, highlighting how vulnerable and aimless people can be easily controlled and exploited when removed from such support groups as family and friends. Suitable for upper secondary level."
