        "Presents reasons why Ned Kelly is one of the most infamous Australians in history. Although labelled as a bushranger and murderer, he was still a hero and leader to the destitute selectors of rural north-east Victoria. Features the works of Sidney Nolan, whose many versions of the legend are perhaps the most familiar Kelly images. Irish actor and broadcaster, T. P. McKenna; Irish political activist, Bernadette Devlin; painter, Sidney Nolan; Australian historian, John McQuillon; and filmmaker and Kelly expert, Ian Jones, are all interviewed. Written by Thomas Keneally."
