        "A documentary based on a survey of more than 600 students from kindergarten through high school, that provides an objective view of young people's attitudes toward gender, or male and female roles. Candid interviews and spontaneous scenes of young people interacting at school, at play, and in the community, help create an awareness of one's assumptions about maleness and femaleness."
