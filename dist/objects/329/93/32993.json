        "Experimental film dealing with film editing and the visual image. Contains seven individual sequences of mismatching dialogue/actors/scenes with all scenes based on actual dialogue from \"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\". However, a comic nightmare takes place and a healthy disregard for the text creates quite a bizarre interpretation of this well-known piece of literature. Cast includes Dina Paisner, Ken Burns, Patrick Gerstle, Susan Schneider and others."
