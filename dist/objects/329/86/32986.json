        "Episode of Series \"Forty Minutes\". Looks at the work in France of Dr Michael Odent who firmly opposes standard medical thinking on childbirth practices. He advocates that women should be able to give birth in the position in which they feel most comfortable rather than being forced into the \"stranded beetle\" (legs in stirrups) position commonly used in hospitals. Shows a series of births in which Dr Odent helps women to give birth naturally and with a minimum amount of pain. Also depicts the work of Dr Odent in his pre-birth classes where he encourages women to give birth in different positions: standing or squatting. Suitable for middle and upper secondary, and tertiary levels."
