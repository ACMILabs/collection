        "A filmic insight into Ronald Sharp - the self-taught builder of the Grand Organ in the Sydney Opera House. No Australian building has caught the imagination of the world as much as the Sydney Opera House. Opened in 1973 by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, it was always intended that the main concert hall of this performing arts miracle building should have as its dominant, centre-stage focus a magnificent organ that would rival the splendour of the instrument in the Sydney Town Hall, the city's biggest recital organ."
