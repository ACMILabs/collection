        "South Brunswick, New Jersey; Spring, 1975. Frank Kaler and his family are convinced there is something wrong with their water; vegetables cooked in it change colour, skin lesions appear after bathing in it. The health department claims that it is drinkable, but it is later determined to be some of the most toxic drinking water in the country."
