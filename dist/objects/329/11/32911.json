        "Episode of Series \"World in action\". Alzheimer's Disease is a fatal illness few people have heard of, yet as many as one in twelve old people in Britain are likely to contract it and thousands of young people also suffer from it. The fact that its symptoms - confusion, loss of memory, aggression and incontinence - are similar to those of old age has allowed it to be largely ignored by the medical profession."
