        "The first in a series of films about parenthood, this film aims to give prospective parents a realistic picture of the problems and joys that come with the new addition to the family: the first child. Many young people slip into parenthood without really knowing what to expect. This film could be appropriately subtitled: 'What nobody ever told you about having babies'. Presented by Jacki Weaver."
