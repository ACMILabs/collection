        "The myopic Flank Breeder trundles through life filling a small home with small deeds. The world at large is of no consequence...until the accident. A pedestrian duck lays stricken on Flank Breeder's doorstep. A time has come for action, to quickly lend a hand, but so imprinted is Flank by a small world and its demands, that he finds himself unable to rise to the situation. Script and animation by Bruce Currie."
