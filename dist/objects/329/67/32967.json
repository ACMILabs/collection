        "The day has been declared 'a lawless day'. The film follows a couple through this theoretical day as they leave home to do some quiet shopping and participate in a game of rugby football. As they move through the chaos which the experiment brings, the young viewer is shown the advantages of laws and rules for traffic, consumer affairs and sport. Cast includes: Ross Jolly, Ginette McDonald, John Banas, Keith Aberdeen."
