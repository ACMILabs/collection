        "Using hundreds of examples from magazines, newspapers, album covers and store-front windows, this film exposes the psychological and sexual schemes that underlie many advertising campaigns. With an intriguing mixture of statistics, humour, insight and outrage, Jean Kilbourne shows her audience that although individual advertisements may seem harmless by themselves, they add up to a powerful form of cultural conditioning."
