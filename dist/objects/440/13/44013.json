        "When night descends on earth, it can bring with it solitude and fear, as it is the realm of mythical creatures such as vampires, witches and ghosts. 'Creatures of the night' questions what has led to the origins of these frightening tales, how these mythical creatures fit into natural history, and how they are interpretated today. Narrated by Zoe Wanamaker."
