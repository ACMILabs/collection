        "A saga on the American civil war starring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland and Ronald Reagan. Flynn plays Jeb Stuart, a military man who travels in pursuit of John Brown, leader of a violent anti-slavery campaign. Reagan plays George Custer, romantic rival and West Point classmate of Flynn's. It is an action packed but ambiguous portrayal of the American civil war and its protagonists who held intensively opposing views. In this collectors edition rehearsal footage is also featured, along with \"The Cuba Story\", a documentary on Errol Flynn's interest and involvement in Cuba and in Fidel Castro."
