        "Another hilarious film starring Groucho, Harpo, Zeppo and Chico Marx, 'Cocoanuts' is one of the early talkie films and the Marx Brother's first film. Set in Miami, Groucho Marx plays Hotel Manager, Mr Hammer, struggling to keep his establishment from going under. Hammer's only paying guest is Mrs Potter (Margaret Dumont), whose daughter Polly (Mary Eaton) is in love with aspiring architect, Bob (Oscar Shaw). Mrs Potter would prefer that Polly marry the respectable Harvey Yates (Cyril Ring); little does she know that he is a jewel thief. Throughout this basic story the four Marx brothers create havoc in their usual slapstick manner, with hilarious results."
