        "Kiichi Nakajima (Mifune) decides to relocate his family to the safe haven of Brazil from what he perceives is a nuclear holocaust. His methods of getting them there, by burning down their foundry, leads to his incarceration when the family commits him for being criminally insane. From the confines of the asylum Kiichi drifts into a fantasy world where he believes that the sun is an inferno created by the Earth when it exploded in a nuclear holocaust. 'I Live in fear' is Kurosawa's blatant criticism of the perils of nuclear warfare, and was produced at the height of the Cold War when the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union were all experimenting with nuclear testing. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was also a recent and painful memory. This a powerful study of patriarchy in Japanese society, and what Kiichi is willing to do to convince his family to support his beliefs. Although unpopular at the box office compared to his other films, Kurosawa thought of this film as one his most proudest moments, and thus deserves due consideration. Cast includes Toshiro Mifune, Kyoko Aoyama, Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara."
