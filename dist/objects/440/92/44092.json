        "Roger Corman and future super director Francis Ford Coppola (using the pseudonym Thomas Colchart), are behind this sci-fi adventure of two warring hemispheres competing to be the first on Mars. Instead, they end up lost and landing in a small store where monsters (suspiciously shaped like male and female genitalia) constantly battle it out. The bulk of the scenes come from the Soviet sci-fi adventure Nebo Zovyot, which Corman had purchased a few years before. He dropped the cold-war aspects and assigned young Coppola to rewrite, edit and produce the film. Music by Les Baxter."
