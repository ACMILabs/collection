        "A road safety film which stresses that most accidents are caused by careless and inattentive drivers, or by mixing drinking with driving. Graphic scenes of the resulting tragedies - maiming or death - should convince drivers to concentrate on driving or they may discover that the answer to \"Where have all the drivers gone?\" is \"Gone to graveyards every one\"! Narrated by Jim Berinson."
