        "Keith Carradine is cast as Bowie, one of three criminals who escape from prison and after a period of good behaviour, fall back into crime by committing a series of bank robberies. In typical 'Bonnie and Clyde' (303821) fashion, Bowie falls in love with Keechie (Shelley Duvall), the daughter of the farmer who helped them escape, and she too joins them in their escapades. Bowie and Keechie plan to escape to Mexico, but their dreams for a new start are doomed by the behaviour of the other two criminals, and the couple are destined for tragedy. This remake of the 'They live by night' (1948), is based on the novel by Edward Anderson. Cast includes Keith Carradine, Shelley Duvall, John Schuck, Bert Remsen and Louise Fletcher."
