        "This double set features Australia's highest grossing comedy film, 'Crocodile Dundee', and its significantly less successful sequel. 'Crocodile Dundee' (Producer: John Cornell, Director: Peter Faiman) A New York reporter is intrigued by stories of an Australian crocodile hunter and accompanies him on a journey through the bush. She entices him back to Manhattan where his easy-going approach to the dangers of life in a big city make him a success in New York society. 'Crocodile Dundee II' (Producers: John Cornell, Jane Scott, Director: John Cornell) begins in New York where Dundee now lives with his journalist girlfriend, who he managed to secure in the first film. In order to escape the pursuit of an international drug ring who have murdered her former husband, Dundee and his girlfriend return to the Australian outback where Dundee is well prepared to confront them. Cast includes Paul Hogan, Linda Kozlowski, John Meillon, Mark Blum and David Gulpilil."
