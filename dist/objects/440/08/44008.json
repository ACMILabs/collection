        "Bessie is a strong, sensitive and selfless middle-aged woman who has sacrificed her life to look after her ailing and bed-ridden father and slightly daft aunt. Her younger sister, Lee, shirked off such responsibilities, left home, married and had two children before divorcing. The marked differences between the two have meant that neither sister has been in contact for 20 years. But now Bessie has been diagnosed with leukemia, and her survival may depend on the sister she has long since erased from her life, or her two nephews whom she has never met. Cast includes: Diane Keaton, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, and Leonardo Di Caprio."
