        "Episode of Series \"The Century of cinema\". 2x50 years of French cinema (52 mins, 1995) 'Why celebrate cinema? Isn't it famous already?': Jean-Luc Godard confronts actor Michel Piccoli, president of France's First Century of Cinema Association with his theory that French cinema has been forgotten, that he and Mieville are making a film about a century of French cinema that will be a chronicle of forgetting. Piccoli puts this theory to the test with the staff of the hotel where he is staying and is dismayed to find barely any recognition of names from French film history or even classic movies such as 'La regle du jeu'. Set in Munich, in a magnificent new Kinemathek opened to celebrate the first century of cinema, 'Night of the Filmmakers' (54 mins, 1994) imagines an assembly of German filmmakers such that only the artifice of film could bring together, attempting to find answers to questions such as, what exactly makes a German film German? How much was lost to German cinema with all the talent fleeing the Nazi regime? What was the effect on film-making on the Berlin Wall? Includes interviews with Volker Schlondorff, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, Frank Beyer and Wolfgang Kohlhasse. Actress Hanna Schygulla reminisces about Rainer Werner Fassbinder. In 'I am curious, film' (52 mins, 1995) actress Lena Nyman is Bjoerkman's guide on a journey through Nordic cinema history, attempting to discover the special elements of Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish and Icelandic cinema. Her journey is richly illustrated with film clips and includes conversations with filmmakers such as Lars von Trier, Stefan Jarl, Liv Ullman and Aki Kaurismaki. In French, German, Danish with English subtitles - some sections in English."
