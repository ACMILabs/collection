        "Cats have intrigued us for thousands of years: beautiful but brutal, affectionate yet natural born killers. The Egyptians worshipped the cat. The Pharoahs adopted the lion as the symbol of their power and majesty, building the huge Sphinx at Giza. Mythical Cats explores our complex relationship with these fascinating creatures, from the terrifying Griffin to beguiling eatern tales of tigers on the moon. Narrated by Zoe Wanamaker."
