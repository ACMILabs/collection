        "Two scenarios are presented, the first one being a less than ideal setting for a performance appraisal review, and the second one a more favourable setting. In between the two sessions the tape poses questions, then reflects back on the interview in light of the issues raised. Issues covered include effective management styles, dynamics, opportunities, preparation, personal focus, and dealing with problems."
