        "In Brian DePalma's 1983 adaptation of \"Scarface\", Al Pacino stars as Tony Monatana, an exiled Cuban criminal who lands in Miami after Castro opened Mariel Harbour in 1980. Montana goes to work for a Miami drug lord (Robert Loggia), but soon rises to the top of Florida's crime chain, appropriating Loggia's coke-head mistress (Michelle Pfeiffer) in the process. Once having created a cocaine empire, Montana sees it crumbling at the edges as he descends into drug-induced paranoia, destroying all those who are close to him, and eventually himself. Features screenplay by Oliver Stone and music by Giorgio Moroder. Cast includes: Al Pacino, Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Robert Loggia."
