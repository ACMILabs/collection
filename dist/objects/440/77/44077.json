        "At a Stage Door Canteen in Manhattan, three enlisted men on a one-day pass to New York meet and fall in love with three hostesses working there (Cheryl Walker, Marjorie Riordan, Dorothea Kent). This film is noted for its 60 plus celebrities who star as themselves, rather than the love story that provides the backdrop for their appearance. The setting allows for a cavalcade of musical and comedy numbers as well as cameo appearances. Cast also includes William Terry, Lon McCallister and Michael Harrison."
