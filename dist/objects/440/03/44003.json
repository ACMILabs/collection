        "Two weeks prior to re-election, the President of the United States becomes involved in a sex scandal concerning a Girl Scout in the Oval Office. To keep the media from learning of this, Presidential adviser, Winifred Ames, brings in political consultant and spin doctor, Conrad Brean, a specialist in salvage operations. They both join forces with Hollywood producer, Stanley Moss, and in an attempt to divert the country's attention away from the President, they redirect the media spotlight to a war. Lacking a real war, they create one. Cast includes: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Anne Heche, Woody Harrelson, Denis Leary and Willie Nelson."
