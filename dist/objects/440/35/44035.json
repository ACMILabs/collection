        "Jim Jarmusch's debut feature is a dead pan masterpiece, utilising to great effect its low key performances, static camera movement and grungy, sparse locations. Shot in high contrast black and white by Tom Decillo (who went on to direct 'Johnny Suede' and 'Living in Oblivion'), this quirky road movie presents a unique outsiders view of America and the characters that inhabit its fringes. Structured as a series of three vignettes spaning New York, Cleveland and Florida, 'Stranger than Paradise' stars John Lurie (who also wrote the music) as Wille, a laidback hipster whose meandering lifestyle is briefly disrupted when his Hungarian, teenage cousin (Eszter Balint) comes to stay. The films cool, episodic style, slipping casually between melancholy and off the wall humour became a distinct Jarmusch trade mark, fine tuned in later films such as 'Down by law', 'Mystery Train', 'Night on earth' and 'Dead man'. Cast also includes Richard Edson. (Awards: Winner of the Cannes 1984 Camera d'Or for Best First Feature)"
