        "'The Basketball Diaries' is a horrowing growing-up story based on the true-life exploits of poet and musician Jim Carroll. Jim begins as a high-school basketball star at a Catholic high school where he experiments with drugs and is physically abused by his teachers. When his best friend dies of leukemia, Jim's life suddenly becomes much more than adolescent angst, with him making the dark descent into the hell of heroin addiction and hustling. Jim's poetry is the only thing he has left when he is found, literally on the street, by a tough ex-junkie, who undertakes his rehabilitation. Cast include: Leonardo Di Caprio, Bruno Kirby, Juliette Lewis and Ernie Hudson."
