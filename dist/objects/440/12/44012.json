        "The sea has long provided mankind with a source of fear and fantasy. Tales which involve mermaids can be traced back hundreds of years; the story of Jonah in the Bible, even further. 'Creatures of the deep' is a visual treat in its odyssey to uncover the origins of myths and mythical creatures such as dragons, werewolves, vampires, mermaids and unicorns. It looks at how these creatures fit into natural history, and how they are interpretated today. Narrated by Zoe Wanamaker."
