        "From cockpit to ground to sky, the camera follows the spectacular aerobatics of the Canadian Forces Air Demonstration team who control their 9.7 m long, single-engine jets as if they were extensions of their own bodies. During practice sessions, their maneuvers are videotaped for the pilots' viewing and subsequent correction. Narrated by Alan Bleviss."
