        "This passable low-budget science fiction oddity stars John Agar as the leader of a scientific mission to Uranus (not mentioned in the movie's title in order to avoid the inevitable chuckles), where the crew fall under the control of a powerful psychic force apparently emanating from the planet itself. The entity in question is able to tap into the astronauts' minds, giving physical form to both their greatest desires and most terrifying nightmares. As a B-movie, this film certainly rates high as a premise to \"2001 a Space Odyssey\" and \"Solaris\"."
