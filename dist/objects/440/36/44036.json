        "This film by the talented independent director, Jim Jarmusch, is a collection of five vignettes each taking place in the confines of a taxi ride. Covering one night on earth, the stories occur simultaneously in five different cities and five different time zones: Los Angeles, New York City, Paris, London and Helsinki. Highlights include Roberto Benigni as the Roman taxi driver who recounts his past sexual exploits to a priest who is dying of a heart-attack in the back seat. In the New York scene a novice East German taxi driver (Armin Mueller-Stahl) has trouble with the foot pedals and his passenger ends up driving himself to Brooklyn. Cast includes Gena Rowlands, Rosie Perez, Giancarlo Esposito, Winona Ryder, Beatrice Dalle."
