        "Where once there was only Banff, the number of National Parks across Canada now approaches thirty, in accordance with the federal government's policy of setting aside scenic tracts of land for the enjoyment of present and future generations. This film shows them all. In a coast-to-coast tour it locates each one on a map and shows the scenic features and recreational facilities that each one offers. Sound film without words."
