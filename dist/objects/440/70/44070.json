        "Presented as part of ABC TV's 'Foreign correspondent' in May 1999, this British documentary looks at the devastating, and by Western standards unequitable restrictions that Islam and Pakistani society tradition places on women. It is a tradition that allows beating, burnings, murder and other atrocities to be perpetuated against women. There is also the strong possibility that these activities will continue, with strict Sharia law gaining political favour. 'Murder in purdah' is a testament to the desperation of the women affected by a climate of injustice based on patriarchal and religious tradition. Reporter: Olenka Frenkiel"
