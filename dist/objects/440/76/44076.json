        "Greta Garbo plays a woman accused of adultery and the murder of her husband. Set with a pre-talkies soundtrack this early film of Garbo's highlights early European conservatism and the impact of social scandal on a young woman determined to maintain her dignity and freedom to follow true love. This collector's classic edition of the film also features Garbo career highlights including rare fashion show footage, screen-tests and the star's arrival in the USA."
