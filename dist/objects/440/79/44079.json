        "Ten strangers, each with a criminal past, are invited to attend a party on desolate island off the English coast at the request of a mysterious host, Mr Owen. As the group settle into their sojourn, it gradually dawns on them that they have been gathered on the island to be murdered, one by one, as penance for their crimes. It seems that guests are being murdered according the nursery rhyme, \"Ten little Indians\", but even knowing what murder is coming next can't prevent it- the surviving Indians must find the mysterious Mr Owen, masquerading as one of the guests, to stop the deadly cat and mouse game. Cast includes Walter Huston, Louise Hayward, Roland Young and Judith Anderson. Based on the novel by Agatha Christie."
