        "In his heart-felt cinematic debut, Edward D. Wood, Jr. himself stars under the pseudonym Daniel Davis as a young man with a dilemma: should he tell his lovely young fiancee (played by real-life girlfriend Dolores Fuller) about his burning desire to cross-dress? She has begun to notice articles of clothing missing from her closet; the suspense builds, what should he do? Bela Lugosi plays the omniscient narrator; note his conviction as he \"pulls the strings.\" Amidst this unintentionally hilarious mish-mash of melodrama, social commentary and inexplicable stock footage, there is something for every taste: countless cross dressers, hallucinatory dream sequences, sex-change surgeries, spirited cat fights, borderline-pornographic simulated sex scenes, poetic monologues, a haunted house, and a stampede of wild buffalo. Released under various titles across the country -- I Lived Two Lives, I Changed My Sex -- this fiasco bombed across the board but managed to gain Wood enough notoriety in the \"B\"-movie world to launch a career that is today the stuff of legend. Hailed by most critics as the worst film of all time. Includes Bela Lugosi film promos: 'Dracula', 'The Body Snatchers', 'Frankenstein meets the Wolfman', 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' & 'Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein'."
