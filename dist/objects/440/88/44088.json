        "After local-moonshine swilling trapper Lem Sawyer (George Cisar) sees a giant creature, people start disappearing. While searching for illegal traps Steve Benton (Ken Clark) and girl friend Nan Greyson (Jan Shepard) find Lem dying with giant sucker wounds on his body. One couple, Liz Walker (Yvette Vickers) and Cal Moulton (Michael Emmett), forced into the water by her enraged husband Dave Walker (Bruno Ve Sota), get taken by the leeches. When police refuse to believe Dave's story, he hangs himself. Soon after this, two more trappers disappear, and local Game Warden Steve Benton gets involved. He and Nan's father - Dr Greyson, realize that the people were taken by the leeches and the leeches live in caves under the swamp. Using dynamite, the four missing bodies are discovered, but are the leeches destroyed? Written By Leo Gordon, with music by Alexander Laszlo."
