        "Set in 1985, this romantic comedy is pure 80's nostalgia. Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a singer at weddings and bar mitzvahs who sings hits of the eighties and knows how to keep the crowd happy. Julia (Drew Barrymore), is a waitress at the reception centre where Robbie often performs. When Robbie is stood up at the altar, he finds consolation in his new friendship with Julia, and he starts to fall for her. The only problem is that Julia is engaged to womaniser, Glenn, and asks Robbie to help her with her wedding plans. Robbie has to figure out how to make Julia realise that she is marrying the wrong man. Includes a great cameo by Steve Buscemi."
