        "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: PC; Multimedia capable Pentium running Windows 95.16 megabytes RAM, (32 megabytes RAM recommended). Monitor 640 x 480 resolution, 16 bit colour (thousands of colours), 8X CD drive or faster. External speakers or headphones. MAC; 68040 (30Mhz) or better (Power PC recommended) running Mac 0S 7.5 or later. Minimum of 8 megabytes FREE application RAM. DO NOT USE VIRTUAL MEMORY. Monitor 640 x 480 resolution, 16 bit colour (thousands of colours). 8X CD drive or faster. Optional external speakers or headphones. Jointly funded by the Catholic Education Office in the Kimberley region and two schools - Kururrungku Catholic Education Centre and John Pujajangka Plyrin Catholic School, 'Learning Walmajarri' is the result of digitising elements of the program taught by tribal elders in the Walmajarri-speaking areas around Broome. \"The multimedia format of a CD is well suited to the oral tradition, which is the context in which the elders teach their language, using songs and stories to impart vocabulary and syntax\"('The Australian' Tuesday June 8 199 pg. 20). Designed to assist in improving literacy amongst Walmajarri speakers, this program uses jigsaws and traditional stories and songs as entertaining instruction, although people who have no previous experience with Walmajarri may be tempted to give it a try."
