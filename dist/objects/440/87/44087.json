        "One of the best samurai epics, \"Samuarai Banners\" tells the story of the 16th century warlord Takeda Shingen and his loyal general Yamamoto Kansuke (Mifune Toshiro), embedded in the story of the Takeda clan's rise to power. Outstanding sets, costumes and Sato Masaru's rich soundtrack make the drama highly enjoyable. The story is mainly seen from Kansuke's point of view, and Mifune's towering presence dominates the film. This is the final film directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, who specialised in period drama, particularly samurai films. The video cover includes information about Inakagi and Mifune as well as the context of the film. In Japanese with English subtitles."
