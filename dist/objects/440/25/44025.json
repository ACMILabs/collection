        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Ways of seeing\". One of a series of films by art critic and author, John Berger, which explores the ways in which we look at pictures. Shows how the images used in advertising and publicity are related to the tradition of oil painting, a connection which we fail to notice only because we are encouraged to believe that painting is fine art whereas publicity is simple commerce. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
