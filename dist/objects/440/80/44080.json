        "This compilation of video clips, performances and appearances of the pop icon, Tom Jones, is a must for fans of the singer. The film commences with Tom Jones in the UK with great shots of the Thames, as Tom sings all the old favourites. There is also a great selection of special appearances from The Carpenters, Raquel Welsh, Engelbert Humperdink, Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston and Rudolf Nureyev. Fascinating footage spanning Tom Jones' glittering career provides great entertainment for all devotees of this sex icon."
