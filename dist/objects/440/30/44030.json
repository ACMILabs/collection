        "Using a case study, this program looks at examples of poor supervisory and management skills such as poor delegation, improper use of authority, and being a poor role model. Conversely, it looks at the factors which contribute to good management, such as; effective business planning and review, accurate record keeping, identifying performance indicators, setting realistic goals and objectives, open communication, cost control, continuous training, and promoting confidence and respect in the work place. The guide which accompanies the video outlines the key areas of planning- setting objectives; controlling costs; improving methods and making decisions."
