        "Dreyer's 'Vampyr' (dir. Carl Theodor Dreyer, prods. Carl Theodor Dreyer, Nicolas de Gunsburg) redefined the Vampire by casting an eerie woman as the vampire and shooting the entire film with black gauge on the lens to create a haunting, misty mis-en-scene that lingers with each viewing. Cast includes Julian West, Maurice Schutz and Sybille Schmitz. 'Nosferatu' (dir. F. W. Murnau, prods. Albin Grau, Enrico Dieckmann) is the original Dracula movie, complete with misty woods, wolves, phantom ships, mutes, coaches and grotesque figures, tropes that are considered standard today in the genre. Cast includes Max Schreck, Alexander Granach and Gustav von Wangenheim. Also included on the tape a rehearsals from varying productions of Dracula."
