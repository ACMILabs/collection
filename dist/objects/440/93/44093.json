        "After a car crash, a man keeps his wife's head alive in his laboratory. As if this weren't enough, an evil beast pounds and screams from a locked room adjacent to the lab, for some reason the film ends with the title \"The Head that Wouldn't Die\" instead of \"The Brain that Wouldn't Die.\" Cast includes Jason Evers (Dr. Bill Cortner, as Herb Evers), Virginia Leith (Jan Compton), Leslie Daniels (Kurt), Adele Lamont (Doris Powell), Bonnie Sharie (Blonde Stripper), Paula Maurice (Brunette Stripper), Marilyn Hanold (Peggy Howard) and Bruce Brighton (Dr. Cortner)."
