        "A guide to the home care of that maimed and injured loved one, recently returned from that dust-up in the Pacific. Solemn tone betrays not the least sympathy for the invalided one. In the absence of emotion, the domestic environment becomes a place of chilling austerity. Dutiful wife seeming resigned to her fate as resentful attendant. Frightening for its utilitarian ommissions. United States Office of Education training film for use in the instruction of professional nurses."
