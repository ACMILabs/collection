        "In 1996 the International Air Tattoo celebrated its Silver Jubilee. From humble beginnings, as a small airshow at North Weald airfield in 1971, the Tattoo progressed to become an annual event of international stature, staged to support the ongoing work of the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund. Today, the International Air Tattoo is the biggest multinational gathering of military aircraft in the world. Using recent and archival footage, this tape captures the achievements and history of a movement that has sparked international attention and involvement. Written and narrated by Sean Maffett."
