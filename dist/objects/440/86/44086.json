        "An experimental romantic-comedy, this features Brigitte Bardot in one of her early roles as a highly sexual yet innocent figure. After leaving home to survive on her own, a young woman is lured into the world of cabaret striptease. Her shyness becomes a catalyst in her instant success as she reveals all before a demanding audience. Scripted by Roger Vadim, who introduced Bardot to the film industry, and subtitled in English. In French with English subtitles. Please Note: The poor visual quality of this film is due to the quality of the distributors sourced film masters and their taping and does not reflect on the VHS tape quality."
