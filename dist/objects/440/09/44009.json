        "Traces the history of Melbourne pop group 'Skyhooks' using video clips, concert footage, backstage interviews and segments from Australian television in the 70's and 80's. Formed in 1973, Skyhooks quickly acquired popularity amongst youths, while simultaneously arousing controversy in conservative Australia. This compilation tape presents 19 of their songs drawn from concerts, and video clips interspersed with television appearances, newspaper clippings and interviews."
