        "Mizoguchi's sympathetic film of the plight of women in pre-War society centres on two geisha sisters; Umekichi (Isuzu Yamada), and Omacha (Yoko Umemura). The sisters differ not only in age, but in the attitudes to their profession and the clients they service. The younger sister, Omacha, is disillusioned about men and relationships and actively sets out to destroy a young clerk. The elder sister becomes romantically involved with one of her former clients, bankrupt merchant Omocha (Yoko Umemura), and finds temporary happiness. Ultimately, Mizoguchi suggests they are both victims to circumstance and the position of women in society. Gion refers to the Kyoto district where the sisters work. In Japanese with English subtitles."
