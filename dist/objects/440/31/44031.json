        "This program tackles sexual harassment from a management perspective; as managers and supervisors are the biggest offenders in cases of sexual harassment. The program looks at the effect of harassment on individuals, as well as how it effects the workplace. It covers visual, verbal and physical harassment, and stresses the importance of formulating and communicating a sexual harassment policy. The guide which accompanies the video covers definitions, consequences, setting and implementing policy, the complaint process, and a summary/case study."
