        "This film presents amazing revelations about what really went on at Waco, Texas in 1993 when 76 men, women and children and 4 federal agents died in the siege of the compound of David Koresh' religious sect. Through a collation of news footage, coverage of the Senate hearings after the tragedy, tapes of 911 phone calls, and interviews with experts and survivors, we are given a very different picture to that which the United States Senate would have us believe. There is no narrator in this documentary, rather Gazecki presents the evidence through the words of the experts, those who were on the scene of the tragedy and who knew the sect members. In this film you will see what the media did not show us, and it is an enlightening view of how marginal groups are treated in our democratic society."
