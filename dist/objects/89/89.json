    "description": [
        "Inspired by the works of Thomas Hardy, To Sorrow... is a pastoral meditation. Culled from Fitzgerald's video performance The Return of the Native, this sensuous work layers a haunting score by Peter Gordon with lush imagery of the Irish landscape. With slowed-down, heightened images, Fitzgerald creates a rhapsodic, melancholy tone poem imbued with a sense of impending doom. Images of animals isolated in the landscape resonate with feelings of loss and a deep consciousness of the land. Echoing Hardy's literary themes, she alludes to the relationship between man and animals and the encompassing and reflective nature of the landscape."
