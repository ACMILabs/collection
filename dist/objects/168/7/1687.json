    "description": [
        "\"Self Construct\" explores the personal feelings of a young woman grappling with notions of self identity. The work explores complex ideas of exteranl /internal constructions of \"self\". She asks the question - Where does ones identity come from?  Fontaine uses a cut up graphic style to to reflect her sense of dislocation and alienation from others.  Perceptions of memory and thought, interpretation and meaning, are all ideas explored in this innovative and thoughtful work.  \"Self Construct\" was awarded The Managesoft Award for \"Best Final Year Interactive Project \" in the Victoria University BA multimedia course in 2001.  \"Self Construct\" is also a finalist in the Mayne Award for Multimedia Adelaide Festival Awards for Literature."
