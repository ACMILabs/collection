        "After spending a drunken night together, Jo, a photographer, is compelled to capture the emotional truth beneath the rough exteriors of Sharpie gang members, Darren and Jason. But to what lengths will she go in the name of art? Inspired by the art of Nan Goldin, Diane Arbus and Carol Jerrems, Look Sharp is a gripping one-scene psychological drama set in 1970s Melbourne."
