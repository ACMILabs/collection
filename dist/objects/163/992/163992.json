        "'Survival of the Fittest' constructs the core message that human genetics should not be altered, despite good intentions. Based on a scientific theory by Herbert Spencer that relates to how organisms evolve over time to develop desirable traits. The film explores how scientists can artificially replicate a natural process, which can lead to a negative outcome."
