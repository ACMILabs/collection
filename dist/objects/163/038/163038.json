    "description": [
        "A feral intruder is on the loose. It is cunning, deadly and a master of stealth, so expert at flying under the radar that some believe it doesn't even exist. It is Vulpes Vulpe, the elusive and adaptable European Red Fox, and the hunt is on to destroy the species  before it destroys Tasmania's struggling native fauna. 'Feral Peril' follows the 'Fox Squad', a team employed under the Tasmanian Government's fox eradication program.  We follow the sceptics, hunters, scientists, zoo-keepers and the graziers - as each battles to solve a problem that threatens not only Tasmania's pristine ecology, but its agriculture, its tourism and the strength of its economy."
