        "This selection of material produced during the 'roaring' 1920s captures some of the joie de vivre of a post-war Australia in a decade that saw not only an increase in optimism but more cars on the road! It includes works showing an outing to the beach, sporting events, amusement parks and a feature length silent drama."
