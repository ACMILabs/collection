        "Learn more about the luxury motor car that appears in the series, Phryne's red 'Hispano-Suiza'. One of the luxury cars of the 1920s, the 'Hispano-Suiza' was favoured by royalty, film stars and moguls. The name means \"Spanish Swiss\", but the car was manufactured in France, as explained by its owner, Bob, who spent twelve years restoring what had been \"just a heap of rusty bits\". His successful restoration adds an authentic glamour to Phryne's motoring."
