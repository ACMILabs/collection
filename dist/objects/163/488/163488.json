        "\"Summary: the first part of this film traces the phenomenal growth of chicago since its founding barely 150 years ago. its expansion is related to changing technology, particularly advancements in transport, and how  these influenced the land use pattern of the city. dr. john blunden, of the open university, then discusses with professor brian berry, of the university of chicago, how the changing technology of the meat packing industry first resulted in the concentration of the world's greatest stockyard complex in chicago- the union stockyards, and then how further changes led to its decline and dispersal throughout the western states of america\""
