        "Summary: a great deal of expensive computer time can be wasted in running programs. shows where this time is wasted and how it can be saved by The Use of Operating Systems. The film includes demonstrations of the operator action required to set up and run three jobs with and without a simple batch operation system. slow motion film of card reader and line printer mechanisms reveal that a major source of time wasting is in input/ output operations. the film ends using a special model to show the principle behind a multiprogramming operating system"
