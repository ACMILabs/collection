        "\"Summary: takes as a case study the discovery of a whole group of new substances known at various stages in their history as the inert gases, the rare gases and the noble gases. traces the discovery from the work of Henry Cavendish through the theories of William Prout, to the discoveries of baron Rayleigh and William Ramsay. it is pointed out how improved communication between scientists helped in these discoveries and the importance of technology in the form of the spectroscope and apparatus for liquefying air, and concludes that the interdependence of science and technology is a familiar aspect of much scientific discovery\""
