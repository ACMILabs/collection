        "There\u2019s a new wireless in the Fisher household \u2013 but there\u2019s murder on the airwaves when Dot\u2019s new favourite show is interrupted by an on air panic. The radio station\u2019s bookkeeper and budding announcer is found choked to death but when Phryne gets involved, she finds Jack already undercover as the newsreader. In an ironic turnaround, Phryne is officially engaged to investigate the death - as Jack resorts to more clandestine investigative strategies. In the cut and thrust of the investigation, Dot suffers the terrible realisation that she doesn\u2019t want to relinquish working for Miss Fisher when she marries and takes up her wifely duties.
