    "description": [
        "Every change that David Bowie makes comes with a new haircut. The boy can't help it. As the seventies was his greatest decade as a songwriter and musician, so we marvel at his hair at that time. From Bowie's first steps into the music business in the mid-sixties, he was a keen student of rock history and the supreme importance of an artist's image. Each of his hairstyles from that time on alerted the public to where he was musically. Robert Forster will guide us, and plot the Bowie seventies journey from the hippy locks of 'The Man Who Sold The World', to the famous Ziggy cut and album, to the coiffured soul-boy of 'Young Americans', through to the dramatic renunciation of image that Bowie's return to his natural hair colour and style for the fabled \u2018Berlin Trilogy\u2019 of albums represented."
