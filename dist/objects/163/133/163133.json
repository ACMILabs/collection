    "description": [
        "Meet Marion Boyce, costume designer for 'Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries' as she discusses some of the process involved in recreating the look and feel of the 1920s for the popular television series. Boyce muses on the \"sumptuous elegance\" of fashion in the nineteen twenties, a period she describes as one of \"extreme excess in a lot of ways .... they lived a lot with gay abandon\". She highlights the flattering silhouette bestowed by 1920s men's fashion of the time, dwells lovingly on the exotic and embellished fabrics of the time, and talks about the use of original pieces - buckles, shoes, feathers and furs - to heighten the authenticity of the costumes."
