        "Meet Bella, a soccer obsessed ten year old. She eats, breathes and dreams soccer. There's just one problem. She would rather eat junk food while watching a match on TV than actually play the game herself. When a freak accident occurs, everyone mistakes her for a soccer superstar. However, due to her lack of soccer skills she fails miserably. Will she change her attitude towards exercise or remain a couch potato forever?"
