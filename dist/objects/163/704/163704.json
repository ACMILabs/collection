    "description": [
        "In 1922 at the age of 13, Betty Viazim began her apprenticeship as a milliner with Mark Foys, Sydney's premier fashion department store. She was the last apprentice to be trained in the old methods of hat making, before electric sewing machines revolutionized the millinery trade. In this film she talks about her adolescence working at Mark Foys and what it was like to be a young woman growing up in Sydney in the first half of the 20th Century. When hats went out of fashion in the 1960s Betty turned her considerable skills towards theatre and films. She is credited with designing the headwear in the Australian films 'Careful, He Might Hear You' (1983) and 'For Love Alone' (1986). In 1981 Betty was awarded The Order of the British Empire Medal (Civil) for services to the Performing Arts. [Source: NFSA Film Australia Collection National Interest Program]"
