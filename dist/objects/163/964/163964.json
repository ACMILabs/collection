        "To celebrate 'DreamWorks Animation: The Exhibition', ACMI decided it would be a wonderful opportunity to invite five internationally-lauded Australian auteur animators to take part in a celebration of their careers, and to talk about the Australian animation industry.  Oscar winners and nominees Adam Elliot, Bruce Petty, Shaun Tan, Anthony Lucas and Sejong Park shared their experiences, expertise and perspectives on their craft, their career histories and their production processes in a live event recorded for posterity. The panel was hosted by Melbourne cinematic stalwart Tait Brady.  In addition to the recorded talk from this exclusive ACMI event, presented here are some fine examples of animated works and further informative interviews with these legendary animators."
