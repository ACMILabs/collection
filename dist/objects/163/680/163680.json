    "description": [
        "In this program of talks, Dr Kathryn Johnson shares insights gained during the making of 'David Bowie is' at the V&A, and explains how the exhibition was devised to perpetuate the catalytic and inspirational power of Bowie's art, style and music. Professor Will Brooker poses the question:  \"How do we make sense of the various characters, stories, cultural echoes and cross-references in the work of David Bowie?\" and musician Robert Forster, in conversation with Michael Dwyer, talks about the fact that every change David Bowie makes comes with a new haircut! In addition to these three keynote talks from the symposium held at ACMI 17-18 July 2015 'The Stardom and Celebrity of David Bowie' is an interview with the man himself by ABC TV Countdown's Molly Meldrum in 1978."
