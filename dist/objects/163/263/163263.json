    "description": [
        "Is music part of your youth?  Was there a soundtrack to suit your cultural experience? Music is a cultural avenue by which we are drawn together as a society, to celebrate and relax but it is also a way for particular groups of people to identify themselves and their place in the world. The 1970s was a melting pot of music and cultural happenings both conservative and radical. This program aims to highlight the diversity of music and culture in Australia and the fashion and ethos of various youth groups gathering together in a 1970s Australia."
