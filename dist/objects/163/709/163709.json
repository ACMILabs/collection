        "This short clip was originally filmed on standard 8mm by George Sullivan at the International Hair Stylists Society of Australia Championship at Melbourne Town Hall. The hair models are shown as they are judged and inspected by the committee members. Sullivan made several films documenting the hair industry in Australia. His film collection was donated to the NFSA by Alan Wickes, who was part of the International Hair Stylists Society of Australia from 1961-1988. [Courtesy: Alan Wickes]"
