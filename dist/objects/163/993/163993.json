        "'KnightGame' is a Medieval local multiplayer battle arena, where any stab, shield or shot could be your last. Purchase items at your base to change, strengthen and morph you and your army into fearsome warriors, then march into battle and destroy your opponent's base to claim victory. But be wary, not all items are created equal and many will hinder you."
