        "This tape contains an episode from the television series, \"The Life and times of Grizzly Adams\" created by Charles E . Sellier Jr. Grizzly Adams (Dan Haggerty), flees to the wilderness when accused of a crime he did not commit. He is down on his luck and without hope until he finds a bear cub and through raising him discovers his affinity with animals. Mad Jack (Denver Pyle), and the now grown cub are the only company in his peacuful existence. \"The Renewal\" is about Joseph Bradley and his son, Andy, who rediscover hope after sharing Easter with Grizzly Adams and his companions. Guest starring Patrick Wayne and Ned Romero. Directed by Jack Hively."
