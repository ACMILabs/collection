        "The Doctor from 172 episodes, Tom Baker, stars in this story by Robert Banks Stewart. Two mysterious pods are discovered by a research team digging in the Antarctic. They know that the pods are over twenty thousand years old, but nothing beyond that. The pods are no mystery to the Doctor, who identifies them as Krynoid, a hostile and alien plant species. The Doctor isn't the only one interested in the pods, an insane millionaire, Harrison Chase (Tony Beckley) is eager to get his hands on them, his motives unclear. They cannot contain the pods to the Antarctic and a pod reaches England, setting forth a ferocious carnivore. It's up to the Doctor and Sarah (Elisabeth Sladen) to once again save mankind. Also starring John Challis and Mark Jones."
