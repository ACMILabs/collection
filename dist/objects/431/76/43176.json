        "'Levantes' (translation from the Greek: East Wind) is a personal essay combining documentary images with a fictional narration. It tells the story of a young Greek Australian man travelling through Greece and Turkey, crossing the border to avoid army service. His impressions and reflections on the legacy of the region are told in an intimate monologue that he addresses to a friend back home in Australia. He talks about Greece, the journey, himself and his friend and the two nations, Greece and Turkey, which are as close as they are wide apart."
