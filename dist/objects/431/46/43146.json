        "The Doctor (Tom Baker) and his companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) find themselves in an English quarry when a freak accident traps Sarah beneath tons of rock. Miraculously, she survives, and is found clutching a large stone hand which seems to have assumed power over Sarah who has become possessed. She disappears and the Doctor follows her to a nearby atomic power station. It's up to him to discover the source of the hand's power and to determine why Sarah has found her way to the nuclear reactor. The Doctor's search takes him across the galaxy to a long-dead world."
