        "Jim Hacker has been Minister of Administrative affairs long enough to know he must come up with fresh ideas to show his electorate he is successful. His Permanent Secretary, the urbane Sir Humphrey is there to make sure they never come to fruition, while poor old Bernard must sit uneasily on the fence between them. Features three episodes, \"The Compassionate Society\", in which the minister is obsessed about a new hospital with no patients.... \"Doing the Honours\", in which the minister has trouble enforcing budget cuts... \"The Death List\", in which the minister changes his attitude about buying bugging devices when he hears he's down for assassination by a terrorist group."
