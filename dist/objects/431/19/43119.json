        "Two children in Holland, Jan Brink and Adinda de la Maison are orphaned after they are separated from their parents when a flood washes away their town. They are picked up by an Urker sea captain, along with the pets they have salvaged from the flood; a cat, rabbit, rooster and a dog. The captain proves to be a captivating story teller with the ability to teach values such as love and respect through his stories. Starring Monica Achterberg, Genevieve Ambas, Philip Frame and Theodore Bikel as the captain. Filmed entirely in Holland and based on the novel by Jan De Hartog."
