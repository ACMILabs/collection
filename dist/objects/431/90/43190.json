        "15 year old Sebastian thinks that he is hard done by. He has reached a feeling of boredom with his predictable middle class existence. He learns what hardship is really about when he encounters Sparrow at the local video parlour. Sparrow has more tougher trials to face, such as sleeping in clothing bins, scavenging for food and protecting himself from skinheads and the law. An uplifting story about how friendship can transcend social and economic boundaries. Starring Alexander Bainbridge, Jeremy Angerson and Elizabeth Alexander."
