        "Peter no tail is not like the other kittens in his litter, you see, Peter was born without a tail. He begins an exciting adventure when he finds himself in the big city after mistakenly receiving a ride in a visitor to the farm's car. Peter no tail meets interesting characters such as Molly cream nose, a possible love interest, and Mean Mike, a villainous city cat."
