        "Emily, an adolescent girl lives with her mother and father in a large house in the country. Her father Gerald, who's increasingly away on work trips, tests the relationship with his wife Mel when he's discovered to be having an affair. As Emily is thrust into the throes of puberty, she's faced with the inevitability of change as she witnesses the not so idyllic relationship of her parents seen for the first time with adult eyes. Just when things were getting too grown-up an accident occurs that cements Emily's loss of innocence. Cast includes: Natasha Pincus, Anna Maria Monticelli, Gerard Kennedy, Robert Menzies and Jo Kennedy."
