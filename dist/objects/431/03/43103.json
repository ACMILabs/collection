        "This is a winning black farce and a wistful romantic comedy. Starring seasoned veteran Jean Rochefort as a grave-faced professional hitman who guided by his mother in the family business has reached the pinnacle of his career. He is a control freak and self-improver, meticulous at work and at home and a confirmed bachelor and erstwhile linguist. Hard at work one day he runs into a young man (played by Guillaume Diepardieu) who becomes his reluctant apprentice with hilarious results. In French with English subtitles."
