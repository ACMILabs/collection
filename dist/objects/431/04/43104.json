        "This highly successful thriller from one of France's most renowned and revered directors is set in the countryside of South western France. Hoteliers Nelly (Emmanuel Beart) and Paul (Francois Cluzet) have a marriage made in heaven. Paul is proud of his exceptionally beautiful wife, and Nelly blossoms, radiating a heady mix of innocence and sexuality that is openly admired by their male customers. However, their happiness is threatened when Paul begins to spy on his wife and becomes convinced of her infidelity. His obsessive jealousy turns to anger, which erupts in a cruel and violent climax. In French with English subtitles."
