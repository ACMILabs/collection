        "There is a legend that when a soul can't rest, a crow can bring that soul back form the dead, to seek justice and make the wrongs thins right.. In the film which cost him his life, martial arts phenomenon Brandon Lee stars as a superhuman mystical hero who returns from the grave to exact revenge on the killers of his fiancee and himself. The film contains fantastic special effects, awesome action and a dark, cyberpunk setting. Lee was killed on the set accidentally in a manner similar to his father, martial arts legend Bruce Lee, so a stand-in was used to complete the filming."
