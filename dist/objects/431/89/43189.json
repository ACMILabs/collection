        "This tape includes two wonderful fairy tales featuring puppets from Cosgrove Hall studios. \"The Pied piper of Hamelin\"; set in the fourteenth century this story centres around the greedy councillors who reneg on a promise to pay the piper for ridding the township of rats. They pay dearly for their broken promise. Narrated by Robert Hardy with music composed by David Rohl and Stuart J. Wolstenholme. The presentation of \"Cinderella\" is based on the one by Perrault, with the unusual feature of being told through the music which was specially composed for the film. A spectacular blend of puppetry, animation, music and colour. Music is once again composed by David Rohl and Stuart J Wolstenholme."
