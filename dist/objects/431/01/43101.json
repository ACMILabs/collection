        "Appleby Hardware store and its owner, Billy Apples (Max Cullen), are the unlikely candidates for becoming the newest singing sensation. Billy doesn't have alot going for him; a wife that left him, a so-so business, a rather unsuccessful band that performs at the local watering hole (mainly because Billy is a rotten singer) and a daughter who disowns him. One night Billy witnesses a comet shower and his life changes when he discovers he can sing like Billie Holiday: overnight, Billy Apples becomes a celebrity. Fame renews the affections of his wife, but it also distances him from family and friends, leading Billy to question his new existence. Also starring Kris McQuade, Tina Bursill, Drew Forsythe, Genevieve Lemon, Rachael Coopes and Richard Roxburgh."
