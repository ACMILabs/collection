        "Silverado is an old west frontier town in the evil grip of a corrupt and powerful, smiling-viper sheriff (Brian Dennehy). But things are about to change around town Four unlikely heroes - brothers Emmett (Scott Glenn) and Jake (Kevin Costner), adventurer Paden (Kevin Kline) and a crack-shot negro cowboy (Danny Glover) - saddle up for a series of dangerous adventures on the dusty trail to Silverado. From its explosive, breathtaking opening gun battle to a final, tense high-noon shoot-out, this thrilling, hell-for-leather western is bursting with spectacular action. This is director Kasdan's tribute to the great and much-loved tradition of the Wild West."
