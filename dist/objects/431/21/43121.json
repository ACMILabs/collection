        "Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins turn in seriously sexy performances in this sensational baseball comedy. Charged with pulling the Durham Bulls ou of the longest losing streak in Carolina's Baseball League history, Crash Davis' (Costner) main challenge is to instruct, insult and inspire Eddie 'Nuke' Calvin (Robbins), their indisciplined but bullet-fast pitcher. Sarandon is the team's groupie-cum-English Lit teacher who becomes the fly in the ointment after she catches Nuke's eye and begins to distract him from Crash's tuition with her own slightly bizarre set of off-field rules."
