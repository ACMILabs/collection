        "This video provides helpful advice to sufferers of panic attacks and agoraphobia. We follow two people as they discuss the debilitating effect panic attacks and agoraphobia have had over their lives. They outline symptoms such as feeling that something was physically wrong and the successful techniques they have used to overcome the disorder. The techniques are based on cognitive behavioural therapy, which has proven to be most successful in treating such cases and is taught by Professor Ron Rapee, professor of psychology, Macquarie University, and Dr Lisa Lampe, a consultant psychiatrist who specialises in anxiety disorders. This program is designed for people with panic disorders and agoraphobia, their family and friends and health professionals. It looks at fundamental questions such as what is a panic disorder, what is agoraphobia, what is cognitive behavioural therapy? As well as the role that medication and self help groups can offer to the difficult and often misunderstood condition."
