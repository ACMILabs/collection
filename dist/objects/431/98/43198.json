        "A tough cop and a cunning lawyer begin an unlikely alliance when they partner up to find a murderer. Mooney (Bob Hoskins), a tough and bigoted cop suffers a near fatal heart attack while on the job. His life is saved by a successful heart transplant, courtesy of the recently assassinated lawyer, Stone (Denzel Washington). There is only one unexpected side effect from the operation; Stone's ghost accompanies the transplanted organ. They discover they share more than the operation in common when it transpires that Stone's hooker girlfriend is the former girlfriend of Mooney. The two have different priorities however, and while Mooney wants to regain his former girlfriend, Stone wants to find his killer, making for a confusion between body and mind. Also starring Chloe Webb."
