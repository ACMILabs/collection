        "A strange young man, Martin Taylor (Sting), infiltrates his way into the family of a vulnerable middle aged couple Tom and Nora Bates (Joan Plowright and Denholm Elliot). Martin becomes infatuated with their daughter Patricia (Suzanne Hamilton), who has been comatose for 4 years. The part angel, part devil Martin, mysteriously rouses sleeping beauty from her slumber. Adapted from the play by Dennis Potter, this film is bizarre to say the least and was banned by the BBC shortly after being taped."
