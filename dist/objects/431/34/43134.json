        "Three sufferers of social phobia, a devastating anxiety disorder, share their experiences with the condition and the techniques they used to successfully overcome it. The techniques are based on cognitive behaviour therapy, which has proven to be successful in most treatment of social phobia. The program is intended for sufferers, family and friends, and health care workers. It covers defining social phobia, monitoring anxiety, cognitive behaviour therapy, managing anxiety through meditation, and medication."
