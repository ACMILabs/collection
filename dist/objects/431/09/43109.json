        "Sarah (Mia Kirshner), thought that Eric was the only one to be brought back from the dead to make the wrong things right. In this story from 'The Crow' anthology inspired by the character created by James O'Barr, a young father, Ashe (Vincent Perez) and his son are brutally murdered when they witness a gruesome killing. Ashe is brought back to life by the mysterious powers of the Crow, but is also aided by a human, Sarah, who knows about the crow legend. Ashe must seek vengeance on those who killed him so that his soul, and that of his son can be at peace. Also starring Iggy Pop, Richard Brooks and Thomas Jane."
