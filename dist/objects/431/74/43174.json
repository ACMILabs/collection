        "Julia Roberts stars in this hilarious tale of lovelorn food critic Julianne, who discovers she wants to spend the rest of her life with her best friend the day he pops the question to someone else. She has four days to break up the wedding and help her best friend discover that she's the one. With an outstanding supporting cast including Cameron Diaz and Rupert Everett, this film takes the cake as the romantic comedy of the year."
