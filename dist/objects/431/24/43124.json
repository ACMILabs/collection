        "The Doctor (Jon Pertwee) and Sarah arrive at the medieval planet Peladon, half a century after the Time Lord's first visit. The planet is apparently secure under the benign rule of the Galactic Federation, with the resident Pels enjoying their existence. There is trouble ahead however, as the Federation is at war with Galaxy Five and Peladon takes on a political importance because of its natural resource of the rare mineral, trisilicate. The miner Pels react violently to the warring, believeing mining machinery has woken the spirit of the legendary Aggedor. The Federation counter attacks the inward fighting by sending in a military taskforce led by Commander Azaxyr and his ice warriors. The Doctor and Sarah must act as peace-keepers and discover a few interesting things along the way regarding the evil spirit and corruption amongst the Federation. Also starring Elisabeth Sladen, Donald Gee, Nina Thomas and Rex Robinson."
