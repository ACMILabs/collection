        "One of the most beautifully shot and expensive French films ever made, this is a stunning tale of unexpected love, tragedy and man's boundless capacity for joy. Juliette Binoche is Michele, a young painter trying to escape the one great tragedy in her life. She is slowly but surely going blind. Dennis Lavant is a street performer who shares his makeshift home, Paris' Pont Neuf, with a drunken father figure, Hans. By chance Michele stumbles into Alex's disturbing down and out life. Her pitiable state arouses compassion in Alex for the first time in his life. Love finds Alex and in a world of despair and mere existence he is surprised by joy. In English with French subtitles."
