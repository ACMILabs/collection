        "Felix (Segal) and Doris (Streisand) are two mismatched neighbours. Felix is a writer, and Doris a prostitute and performer in the 42nd street flick, \"Cycle sluts\". They share the same apartment building and annoyance at each other; such as his incessant typing and her numerous male callers. Despite these difference the two become firm friends, facilitating some pretty amusing dialogue between the clash of cultures and morals. The soundtrack is performed by Blood Sweat and Tears. Alan Alda and Diane Sands played the two title characters in the Broadway production, which is based on the play \"The Owl and the pussycat\" by Robert Klein."
