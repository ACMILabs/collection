        "Based on the children's book by Eleanor Atkinson, this delightful movie tells the story of a lovable and faithful terrier named Bobby. Bobby is owned by the family at Cauldbrae Farm, but he chooses his own master in \"Old Jock\"(Alex Mackenzie), caretaker at the farm. When Jock dies, Bobby remains steadfast in his refusal to leave his master's gravesite at the estate where he worked. The new caretaker of the farm, James Brown (Donald Crisp), is not keen about having Bobby forced on him but the dog manages to work his way into his heart. Set against the picturesque Scottish countryside this film also stars Laurence Naismith and Kay Walsh and is a remake of \"A Challenge to Lassie\"."
