        "Vietnam soldiers Luc Devreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), and Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) are killed in combat. Their bodies are used in a secret government experiment of mixing man with machine. The two were sworn enemies in life and the experiment was supposed to have erased all memories but they rediscover the fierce hate between them as two fighting machines battle one another to the death. Also starring Ally Walker, Ed O'Ross and Jerry Orbach. This video contains 11 minutes of extra footage not screened in cinemas."
