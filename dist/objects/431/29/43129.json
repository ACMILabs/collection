        "Steve Martin wrote this romantic comedy, in which he stars as Harris K. Telemacher, a Los Angeles wacky weatherman extraordinaire. After growing increasingly distanced from his socialite girlfriend Trudi (Marilu Henner) and unhappy with his job, he finds his spirit renewed by the arrival of a British journalist (Victoria Tennant). An oddball, but very amusing look at the faux pas and foibles of life in modern Los Angeles."
