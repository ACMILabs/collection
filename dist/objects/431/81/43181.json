        "Kermit the Frog has finally hit the big time and he's heading for Hollywood. With his fellow Muppets including Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Animal, Fozzie Bear, plus the rest of the Muppet Performers, they encounter real life stars along the way. Kermit begins his journey on a humble bicycle, but as the passengers accumulate along the way his means of transport increases in size. Kermit also has to contend with the slimy Doc Hopper who is eager for Kermit to promote fried frog legs, as well as his strong feelings for Miss Piggy. Features a number of cameos as well as paying homage to several classic films."
