        "In 1777 Sheridan was the leading dramatist at age 26, and his \"School for Scandal\" was playing to packed houses. Filmed from original art work from the period, with voiceover, this film surveys life in London at the time. Peoples of different levels of society are seen - in parks, in business, in coffee houses, in shops, in fashion and in the arts. At the end there is a quick biography of Sheridan from this time until his death 30 years later."
