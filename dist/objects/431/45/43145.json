        "The Summer of 1963 is one that Baby (Jennifer Grey) will never forget. While holidaying in the Catskills she stumbles across the daring and exciting world of the dancing staff; driven by the stirring music and sensual moves, known as \"dirty dancing\". She becomes the star pupil of the handsome dance instructor, Johnny (Patrick Swayze), and finds herself becoming more that just his dancing partner. Cast includes Cynthia Rhodes, Jerry Orbach and Jack Weston."
