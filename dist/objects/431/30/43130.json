        "Have you ever had one of those days where you wished you could relive the day and do things differently? Wise cracking weatherman Phil, (Bill Murray) is living the same day over and over. It all begins when he is sent with other crew members to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day Festival; the one day of the year when the seasons weather forecast is decided by an animal. Initially they are to move out after the report but a snow storm leaves them snowbound. With no tomorrow and no consequences to face, Phil is eager to explore every fantasy and possibility, and he does. Trying to enamour himself to the producer Rita, (Andie MacDowall) proves harder than he thought, no matter how long he has to try. Also starring Chris Elliot, Brian Doyle-Murray and Stephen Tobolowsky."
