        "By re-voicing the classic 1976 Crawford's police drama 'Bluey', the D-Generation have created an entirely new story which is at once a subtle rumination on the nature of existence, and a thinly-veiled excuse for some really good fart jokes. It should be pointed out that this is not for the faint-hearted or those who may have just eaten."
