Meg Ryan is a recently engaged journalist who believes she has found the perfect man in her fiancee. Its Christmas, the silly season and Hanks young son has called a talk-back show to try and help his Dad move on with life. Ryan hears his conversation with the radio announcer who calls him Sleepless in Seattle. His words strike a chord in Ryan who begins to doubt if her comfortable life is really all she wants. Thus begins a story of chance and double-chance and of finding true love. This one of the most enchanting romantic comedies ever created."
