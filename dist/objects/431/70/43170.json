        "Episode of Series \"Faerie tale theatre\". A King and Queen who long for a child are granted one through the witch, Griselda. The only request she has for payment is that she may be the child's godmother and attend the christening. The King and Queen learn a painful lesson in keeping a promise when they forget to invite Griselda to the christening; as punishment she turns the prince into a frog! Meanwhile, on the other side of the kingdom a vain princess is about to cross the path of the frog prince, who requires a kiss from the princess to turn him back into a human prince. Starring Robin Williams as the prince and Teri Garr as the princess. Also starring Michael Richards, Rene Auber Jonois, Candy Clark and Roberta Maxwell. Directed and narrated by Eric Idle."
