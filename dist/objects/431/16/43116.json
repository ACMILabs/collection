        "Scottish sailor, Alexander Selkirk is believed to be the inspiration behind Daniel Defoe's famous novel. Intrigued by Selkirk's tale of being marooned in 1704 on a Pacific island for four and a half years, Defoe called his imaginative account, 'The Life and strange surprising adventures of Robinson Crusoe'. This adventure story is brought to life through animation that will appeal to children and adults alike."
