        "The Australian music scene is presented here by producer/writer/director Rob Payne in an entertaining and fascinating way. Includes live performances from popular Australian bands; Spiderbait, You Am I, Powderfinger, Ammonia, Jebediah, Frenzal Rhomb, Bodyjar, Regurgitator, Crow, Custard, Grinspoon, Something for Kate and Augie March. Interspersed with the performances are insights by band members and recognised industry heavyweights Richard Kingsmill and Damien Lovelock. Material covered includes; Attitude; covering the influence of the American grunge scene, Australia's geographical isolation and what sounds Australian; Cross Over; the inability to define Australian music by a specific genre and the cross over between mainstream, alternative and punk; Influences; discusses how different influences contribute to Australian music's diverse sound; Live; the quite healthy existence of the live scene; Festivals; the importance of festivals such as the Big Day Out, Homebake, The Falls and what it means to performers and spectators; JJJ; the influence of 'The Australian Music Show' and Unearthed; Lyrics; how song lyrics come about, or in some cases, don't; Overdrive; a candid discussion of behind the scenes activities, such as accommodation and parties. A fascinating documentary that will appeal to fans of the band as well as anyone with an interest in Australian music."
