        "Tells a haunting story of boyhood on a prairie homestead. The boy, sent to town to find a strong hired hand, returns with a cornet player creating a tense atmosphere at supper. Later while milking, the farmer listens to the cornet, and understands that the boy's need for music is as great as his own need for adequate help in the fields. The cornet player does not stay, but the echo of his music continues through the years. Based on a story by Sinclair Ross. (Awards: New York)"
