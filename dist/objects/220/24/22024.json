        "The Cornish Engine is the name given to the pumping engine built during the 19th century for removing water from the tin and china clay mines of Cornwall. The fame of the Cornish Engine spread through the world but its end was sealed by the invention of more efficient types of engines in the latter part of the 19th century."
