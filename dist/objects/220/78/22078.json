        "This animated folktale from the Liberian rain-forest recounts the death and return to life of the spirit to conquer death. Ogaloussa disappears and is forgotten by his family until a new son, Puli, in his first words asks for his father. A search yields Ogaloussa's bones and his sons magically restore him to life. When Ogaloussa wants to give a beautiful cow tail switch to the son who did most to resuscitate him, he rewards Puli. For, the saying goes: \"A man is not dead until he is forgotten\". The entire story is told by an African mother to her children. Adapted from the book \"The Cow-Tail Switch\" by Harold Courlander and George Herzog."
