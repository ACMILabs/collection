        "The building, embellishment and consecration of the new Cathedral Church of St. Michael at Coventry, from the preliminary earth moving in 1955 to completion seven years later, finishing with a tour of the completed cathedral, and the Consecration Ceremony attended by Her Majesty the Queen. Illuminates the contrasting skills which contributed to this achievement, and pays tribute to the architects, builders, engineers, artists and craftsmen who worked in stone and wood, glass, metal and tapestry."
