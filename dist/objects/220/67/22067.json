        "Thousands of passengers pass through London's main stations every day, and during the rush hour platforms are a sea of faces. How do railway men or passengers retain a sense of courtesy in such a situation? How does the Station Master deal with difficult incidents? These are some of the questions asked in this film, and both staff and travellers put forward opinions. A film more likely to provoke discussions than to provide an answer."
