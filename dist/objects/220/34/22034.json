        "The life and philosophy of the Quebec painter, Ozias Leduc, traced through his own paintings and scenes of his home, \"Correlieu\", and the surrounding countryside. His technique and its influence on other painters is demonstrated, and his consciousness of the turbulent modern schools that came and went during his long lifetime is revealed. Included are some of the large paintings he did for cathedrals and churches. Narrated by George Whalley."
