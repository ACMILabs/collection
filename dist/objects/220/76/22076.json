        "The day-to-day existence of the working cowboy. It examines the life on a Californian ranch of a contemporary \"cowpuncher\", Bill Bailey, and his family. Narrated by themselves, it reveals the hard work and simple pleasures and the profound rewards. Living in the open and close to the land, the cowboy retains the individuality and self-reliance which marked his forbears. Photographed at the Rex Ellsworth Ranch Tehachapi California."
