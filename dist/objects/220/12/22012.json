        "A survey of the copper mine at Peko, seven miles east of Tennant Creek in the Northern Terriitory. The mine is the fourth largest in the Commonwealth and produces ore containing 8.1/4% copper. The mine, still in various stages of development, is shown, and the various processes in preparing the ore for shipment to Port Kembla, via Alice Springs, are illustrated. With potential resources of lead and zinc, the Peko mine is further evidence of the mineral wealth of Australia's Northern Territory."
