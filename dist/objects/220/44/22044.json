        "A study of the parasitic reproduction of the cuckoo. The cuckoo does not build itself a nest, but lays its eggs in other bird's nests and leaves them to hatch and rear its young. However, there are hazards associated with parasitic reproduction; barely ten percent of young cuckoos attain their full growth. Uses natural sound only."
