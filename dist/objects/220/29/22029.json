        "A film about the significance of the coronation ceremony. The opening sequences show, through old prints, pictures and tapestries, the history of the coronation ritual, and its gradual development to its present form. The film then gives, by means of black and white drawings, an artist's impression of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Music composed by John Gardner and performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by John Hollingsworth. Story by Dermot Morrah, spoken by Leo Genn. Original drawings by James Gardiner and R. Jeffryes."
