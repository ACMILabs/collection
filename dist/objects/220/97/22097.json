        "The problems of wing-design in high-speed long-range aeroplanes. With the aid of diagrams and smoke-tunnel photography the film explains in basic terms the relative advantages and disadvantages of varying thickness and span of wings and degree of sweepback. The solution arrived at by the designers is the crescent-shaped win used in the Victor 4-engines jet bomber, which is shown in flight and landing."
