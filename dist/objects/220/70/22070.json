        "Coventry's medieval cathedral was destroyed by air raids in 1940, but a new cathedral is being built from the design by Basil Spence. The architects model is shown and a realistic impression of the beautiful building is obtained. Spence gives an explanation of his work and he makes the point that all cathedrals were modern in their time. The work of artists and craftsmen specialising in stained glass, tapestry and stone are also shown. Commentary by Basil Spence."
