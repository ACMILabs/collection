        "High school students learn to think creatively in a Technical Activities Centre where they apply what they have learned to model building projects. An experiment in science education at Sevenoaks School in Kent; boys apply the principals learned to creating a variety of models, instruments and machines including wireless controlled model boats and racing cars, an instrument to give blind people signals about their physical environment and a simple computer. The nature of this experiment makes this film an important educational record."
