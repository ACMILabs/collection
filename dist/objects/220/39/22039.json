        "Explains the work of costume designers in the production of a feature motion picture. The costume designer must create - whether for one star or a mob scene - costumes that are appropriate - historically, geographically and, most important, dramatically. The designer must have each design, plus the cost breakdown, approved by the director, producer, and art director. To make any improvements needed, the costume designer stays on the set until production ends."
