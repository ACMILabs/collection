        "Three typical conflicts between teenagers and parents are dramatised: a girl's mother nags her; a boy's father regularly seems to criticise and argue with him; another boy says his mother \"has no time for me\". The narrator then shows them how to change the situations by changing their response and by understanding people's basic needs. Each dramatised situation is replayed, using the narrator's suggestions and shows a positive solution to the problem."
