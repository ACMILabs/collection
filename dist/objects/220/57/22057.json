        "For many centuries much of India's trade has been carried out by the country craft, the sailing vessels which carry produce along the 3,000 miles of India's coastline. They carry the products of the interior and the south to the east of Calcutta, Rangoon, and Indonesia. They travel to the west to Bombay and Karachi, and across the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, loaded with the coffee copra, coir, rope and textiles, the products of their ports of call."
