        "Illustrates the partnership of science and nature in producing today's version of the fibre which has served the human race for 5,000 years. Time-lapse photography shows the cotton plants emerging from the ground, growing, flowering and growing fruit. Animated drawings show the cellular development and structure of the cotton fibre. The wonders of the laboratory are shown where new finishes make modern cottons crease and wrinkle resistant, easier to care for, waterproof and stainproof."
