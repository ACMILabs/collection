        "Episode of Series \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\". The coral reef with its myriad of little homes, caves and crevices is an attractive centre for tropical marine life. A delicate balance is maintained by all its inhabitants, for life on the reef is a continuous struggle to survive. Jacques Cousteau and the crew of Calypso are shown examining the different varieties of plants and animals in the reefs. Commentator: Rod Serling."
