        "Recounts the journey by the men and women who left the Mississippi and Ohio valleys in 1848 to migrate to Oregon. Most of this Western epic was shot on location and captures the beauty of America's vast frontier landscape. Essentially a romantic drama focusing on the leader of a wagon train who falls in love with the daughter of another wagon train leader. Before he can win her heart, he must clear himself of false cattle theft charges. During the journey, the wagon trains are exposed to forces of nature and the wrath of native Americans Indians defending their land against intruders. Script by Jack Cunningham based on the novel by Emerson Hough. Photographed by Karl Brown. Edited by Dorothy Arzner. Starring Alan Hale, J. Warren Kerrigan, Charles Ogle and Lois Wilson. Based on the novel by Emerson Hough."
