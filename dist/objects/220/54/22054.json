        "A film about the population polices of five developing countries: Haiti, the Central African Republic, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania. Haiti, a crowded island with few resources, is contrasted with relatively uncrowded African nations rich in agricultural potential. Population planning for these countries begin with a census and education and family planning is accepted only after infant mortality has been sharply reduced. Narrated by Ruby Dee."
