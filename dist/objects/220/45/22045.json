        "Offered as a tribute to the thousands of British broadcasting engineers whose initiative, inventiveness and skill have enabled British radio and television to achieve its present position, this film traces the growth of broadcasting from the first experiments in a hut at Writtle, Essex, to the coverage of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Told by the men who were actually involved, the story is both amusing and informative."
