        "Released with a synchronised music disc in 1930, but essentially regarded as a silent film. Anthony Asquith last 'silent' film was considered a rival to Hitchcock's 'Blackmail'. Presents the unrequited love of a barber's assistant for a manicurist and the results of his jealous rage when she becomes engaged to a customer, relayed in a long flash-back during his attempted escape from Dartmoor. Cast includes: Norah Baring, Uno Henning, Hans Schlettow and Judd Green. Photographed by Stanley Rodwell. Story by Herbert C. Price."
