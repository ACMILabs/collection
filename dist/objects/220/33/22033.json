        "The roping and riding of a high-spirited half-broken horse is the subject of a film which makes visual poetry of this theme. Movement and music combine to tel a story without words, set in the foothills of Alberta, as we watch a cowboy perform a task which is part of a centuries-old tradition of the West. The music, played on guitar, is an original score containing variations on Western Ballad. (Five awards, including Venice; Edinburgh)"
