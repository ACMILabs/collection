    "description": [
        "A film record showing how John Antill and his assistant choreographers and artists translated the music and movements of aboriginal ceremonial dances into vivid classical ballet. Eugene Goosens, when in Australia, described Antill's Suite as \"comparable to anything in the world\", and the finale of the suite as the most exciting passage in contemporary music. The film shows preparations for the ballet and extracts from some of its seven dances or movements. Many of the scenes were actually photographed on stage during the ballet's world premiere at the Empire Theatre, Sydney, mid-1950. Composed by John Antill and choreographed by Rex Reid with the National Theatre Ballet Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Australian artist, William Constable, played a major part in creating the set and costume designs."
