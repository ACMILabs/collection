        "Illustrates the work done by the Jennings enterprise in pre-war years, and then on an increased scale during the period of post-war planning and development. Shows how raw materials such as timber, plaster, and roofing tiles were produced for the Heidelberg Housing Commission project, and how the production organisation built up in this way has made possible large housing projects throughout Victoria and also interstate."
