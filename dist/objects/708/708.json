        "'Sleepy Haven' is a dreamy experimental film experience made up of home movie pieces and appropriated footage. It is a homoerotic journey full of bare-chested sailors awaking from sleep, images of ships, and boat interiors, and the human surface, all shot and manipulated in a way that seems to bring the film's surface, as well as the sailor's bodies, to life. Each appears to be entered and travelled through along the way in this erotic rumination on public and private lives."
