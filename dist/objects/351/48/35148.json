        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This colourless, odourless, naturally occurring gas turns the atmosphere into a giant greenhouse, trapping more of the sun's heat and raising the temperature each year. This informative documentary looks at the causes behind the greenhouse effect and the resulting possible changes in the earth's environment."
