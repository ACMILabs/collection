        "The issue covered in this video is that of civil rights for gay and lesbian people. The event is the 1986 public hearings in New York City Council Chambers on a proposed local bill to outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual preference; a Bill which was finally passed. Never before have pro-gay and anti-gay arguments been so passionately and bluntly argued on film."
