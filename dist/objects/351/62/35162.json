        "Time Bandits is a Pythonesque fantasy jaunt through time and space. The 11 year old hero finds his bedroom invaded by amiable, rascally dwarfs, absconding employees of the Supreme Being. They take him on an exhilarating journey through time and space. As might be expected, the giants of history and legend turn out to be engaging eccentrics."
