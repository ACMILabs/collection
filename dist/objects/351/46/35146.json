        "Through her films, writing and lecturing, Maya Deren had a seminal influence on the emerging American avant-garde. She was able to work at her full intellectual and artistic capacity at a time when few women could do so. During the last ten years of her life, she became increasingly involved with Voudoun and the Haiti religion. In this film, the intensity of Maya Deren's spirit is evoked by those who knew and worked with her, with rare recordings providing intimacy."
