        "Formed in 1946, Ballet Negres was the first all black dance company in Europe. It reached its creative and popular peak between 1948 and 1950 but by 1952 it had dissolved. The company created a unique style, fusing Afro Carribean dance with classical ballet. It used mime as a third distinctive element to develop a narrative reflecting Black/White relations and Black folklore. The film explores the Ballet Negres story, using reviews, news coverage and showing a reunion of the original members. Young dancers are also seen rehearsing and performing the ballet \"They Came\"."
