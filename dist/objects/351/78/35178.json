        "This original comedy with sparkling dialogue, delightful music and of course the Marx brothers, is one of the funniest to come from the MGM studio. The action romps along at madcap pace as Groucho, Chico and Harpo go into the grand opera business in Italy, dash across the Atlantic and stage an opera in New York, that has the city on its ear. It is an opera such as has never been seen before. Rated: G"
