        "Tai Chi is a gentle art with slow, yet precise, movements. This video methodically guides us through each graceful movement, clearly emphasising the careful attention which must be given to posture. Master Erle Montaigue one of the foremost authorities on the original Yang style of Tai Chi, demonstrates and discusses the movements with the viewer and reaffirms its healing powers which contribute to that special sense of wellbeing.
