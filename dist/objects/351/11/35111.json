        "In December 1975, 20,000 Indonesian troops invaded East Timor. Australia turned a blind eye and the United States increased its military aid to Indonesia. This conflict is the least reported in modern history and this film brings to light eyewitness accounts of the real events - the massacres, famines, corruption and the resistance that still continues."
