        "Music is an important part of the lives of Latin Americans, closely linked to the expression of their personal and political feelings, hopes and aspirations. In Central America, where the press is censored, and the radio and TV gagged; the U.S.-backed regimes have failed to stop the music. Although the penalties for singing the wrong song can be jail or death, the music goes on. This video is a powerful musical tour which starts in Cuba, and moves to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Narrated by Midnight Oil's Peter Garrett, the film is a moving testament to the bravery and courage of those who pursue freedom."
