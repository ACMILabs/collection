        "David Puttnam brings to the screen an intense and personal story of loyalty, friendship and survival amidst the torment of war and the incredible strength of one man's will to survive. Based on Pulitzer prize winning correspondent, Sydney Schanberg's 1980 article \"The Death and Life of Dith Pran\", this gripping movie is a factual account of Schanberg's friendship and professional relationship with his trusted interpreter, trouble-shooter and colleague - Pran - during the turbulent period that saw Cambodia fall to the Khmer Rouge. Stars Sam Waterston and Haing S. Ngor. Film soundtrack music score by Mike Oldfield."
