        "Ravaged by time, wind, water and a scorching sun, the world's most extraordinary landscape has evolved - a landscape of contrast, mystery and awe. This film is an explanation of how the deserts, salt lakes, monoliths, escarpments and gorges of the planet's only island continent were created. It also portrays the endearing animals and plants which have adapted to an often hostile environment."
