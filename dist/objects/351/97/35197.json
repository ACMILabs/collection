        "Episode of Series \"Star Quality : The Stories of Noel Coward\". At first a young writer, whose new play is being staged, thinks that the production will be plain sailing, but soon he's convinced that he and his play are doomed, when the star quality of the leading lady and the director come into conflict. Screenplay by Stanley Price, based on the original by Noel Coward. Starring: Susannah York, Ian Richardson and David Yellan."
