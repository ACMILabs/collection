        "Dreamings is a journey into the lush mangroves and scarred heartlands of Australia to see traditional aboriginal artists at work. From the air we view some of the landforms and waterways incorporated in the imagery of paintings by Michael Nelson Jakamarra. He talks of his family's association with the land and his intrinsic faith in spiritual connections with animals and plants. Our voyage continues to the Great Western Desert and a sacred waterhole. This program begins to unravel some of the mysteries behind creations of immense artistic beauty."
