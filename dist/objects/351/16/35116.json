        "A documentary about a group of women who worked on farms during the World War II in Australia - \"the land girls\". Officially established by the Australian Government in 1942, the Australian Women's Land Army was set up to help fill the shortage of manpower on farms. Their story is symbolic of a far greater number of women who participated in the vital war activity of food production."
