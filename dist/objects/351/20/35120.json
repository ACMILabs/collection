        "The work of four Aborigines working in the visual and written arts, are examined. The video dramatises some of Archie Weller's work and films him and his community in Perth. Also featured are Kath Walker, whose poetry is of international standing, Trevor Nicholls, an urban aboriginal painter in Melbourne and Banduk Marika, who has an intimate knowledge of lore and art. The artists speak for themselves and reveal the relationship between aboriginal art forms and contemporary work."
