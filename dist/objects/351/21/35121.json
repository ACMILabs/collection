        "First Citizen charts the life of aboriginal painter, Albert Namatjira. Born in 1902, Albert Namatjira rose to star status through the acceptance of his art by white Australia in the 1950s. As a result, he was awarded Australian citizenship in 1958. What followed was an often tragic life, caught between white Australian and Aboriginal cultures."
