        "This video comes with an education kit produced by the Autistic Family Support Association. Together they promote the early detection and diagnosis of autism in young children. The video is a visual representation of the behavioural characteristics of autism, and, through three case studies, shows the difficulties arising from living with a child who appears normal but whose behaviour is disturbing. Most importantly, it stresses the role of parents, people working with young children and health professionals in picking up the first clues that a child may be autistic."
