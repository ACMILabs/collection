        "This film is a compelling exploration of the 40 year tempestuous relationship between the legendary American writer and lecturer, Gertrude Stein, and her beloved companion, Alice B. Toklas. Based entirely on historical materials and the personal letters of Toklas, it provides an intimate portrait of these two unique and unconventional women. Stein's thoughts on Alice, the arts, America's Hemingway and other characters are revealed. Scenes from their public and private lives are interwoven with Alice's recollections of their time together."
