        "This film focuses on the season of Barker's work produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Barbican in 1985. It juxtaposes extracts from the plays with comments from actors, directors and critics. However, it makes no attempt to pin an evaluation of the work to the personality or biography of the writer."
