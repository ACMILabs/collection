        "This program focuses on the myths and realities of prostitution as revealed by seven former prostitutes. These women are struggling to return to the mainstream of society and they meet in a group counselling session that offers mutual support and guidance. This film does not record \"street life\". Instead, it shows women coming to grips with the great problems of their lives. It also demonstrates the powerful dynamics of group therapy and the therapeutic value of self-help organisations."
