        "This is the dramatic story of the newsreel cameramen who lived and worked in Australia during the golden era of the newsreel from 1948 to 1956. Len Maguire (Bill Hunter) is a top cameraman whose devotion to his work and loyalty to his company creates conflict with both his colleagues and the people he loves. Amy (Wendy Hughes) is a production assistant working in a predominantly male environment and Len's brother, Frank, (Gerard Kennedy) heads the Australian branch of an American newsreel company in competition with Len's company."
