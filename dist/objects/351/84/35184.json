        "Ruth Cracknell and Gary McDonald are brilliant as Maggie and Arthur. Henri Szeps is Robert, the brother you love to hate, with Judy Morris as his wife, Liz. Maggie appears to be losing her memory, but still knows how to enjoy life. Arthur yearns to be free from the responsibility of caring for Maggie, but he's stuck, and Maggie makes the most of it. This tape includes three episodes: \"The Money\" - Maggie has been saving up her pension cheques and hiding them away. \"The Aunt\" - Arthur invites Maggie's sister, Lorna, over for a visit. \"The Accident\" - Arthur injures his foot and Maggie has to look after him."
