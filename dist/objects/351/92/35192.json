        "This documentary follows a baby for the first five days of her life in a Sydney hospital. We see the various tests and examinations that the baby undergoes. The medical staff discuss the main concerns of parents in these first important days: feeding, jaundice and any behaviour by the baby that doesn't seem absolutely \"normal\" to the parents. The mother describes her feelings and reactions during these first emotional days with her new baby."
