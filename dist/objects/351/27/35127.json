        "This is a love story - both real and imaginary - told in dance and music, and filmed on location in the London Underground. The real world of commuters, buskers and tube trains is the setting for a journey of the imagination. In the underworld beneath the underground a story without words unfolds. Boy meets the girl of his dreams but their love is shattered."
