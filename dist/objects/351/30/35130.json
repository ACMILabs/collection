        "The film follows Aubrey Williams to Georgetown, the capital city of Guyana, where he is to restore one of his murals. But this visit is special as Aubrey is to travel on to Hosororo in the far north-west of the country, where forty years earlier he worked as an agricultural officer. It was then that he first came into contact with pre-Columbian art in the form of rock painting or \"Timehri\", an Arawak word that translates literally as \"the mark of the hand\". His experiences there were decisive in forming his identity as a painter and have remained a creative source for his paintings."
