        "In this documentary the lives of three working class women are examined as they grow up from the \"not so innocent\" age of fourteen, to \"it's happening too fast\" at eighteen, through to \"well we survived\", at the ripe young age of 26. During these years we witness the women confronting the very real issues of teenage pregnancy, love versus sex, and career choices."
