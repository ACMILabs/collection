        "Many elderly people fall victim to Senile Dementia, an incurable mental disorder which gets progressively worse and causes great distress not only to the sufferers, but also to their families. David Wheatley's sensitive adaptation of Brenda Kidwele's autobiographical book, graphically illustrates these problems - the anxiety, despair and feelings of helplessness."
