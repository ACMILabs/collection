        "A poetic documentary which focuses on laundry as an aspect of women's lives and work in the home. The film is composed largely of tales and memories, and through the acts of hanging, folding, arranging, ironing and placing laundry in drawers, \"Clotheslines\" demonstrates how these have become symbolic actions for mothering, living properly and, most of all, providing a sense of security."
