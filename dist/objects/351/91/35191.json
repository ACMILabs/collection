        "Charles Chaplin was born on April 6, 1889 in South London of not so successful music hall entertainers. At the age of eight he joined a variety act called \"The Eight Lancashire Lads\" and worked all over England and parts of Europe throughout his childhood. He toured America in 1910-11 and returned to that country again in 1912 to 1913 where he was seen by Mack Sennett and joined the Keystone company for $150 per week. This cassette features: \"The Cure\" (1917) and \"The Adventurer\" (1917)."
