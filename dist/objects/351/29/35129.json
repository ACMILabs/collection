        "This is an imaginary cabaret where songs from the past unexpectedly meet. It celebrates with irony, tenderness and sophistication, broken hearts and mysterious rugs. Simply staged and beautifully lit, the film brings together a range of music written between 1900 and 1940 by composers and lyricists as diverse as Satie, Schoenberg, Brecht and Weill, Benjamin and W.H. Auden."
