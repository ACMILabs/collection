        "This film documents four stories - three about girls leaving school (Daniella who wants to become a model and an actress; Karen who is already engaged and planning to be a wife; and Kelly who applies for a job in real estate), and the other about Dianne, married with two sons, who is successfully employed in a male dominated trade. In this frank and informative investigation, the issues taken into account are gender stereotyping, influences and expectations of peer groups, parents and boyfriends in both rural and city environments and the effect of the \"Girls Program\" courses currently being taught in Australian High Schools."
