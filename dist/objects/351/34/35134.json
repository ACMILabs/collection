        "The choreographer and dancer, Gaby Agis, has a unique style, taking dance out of the confines of the theatre and into new spaces and contexts. For this film she has taken the dance to the city, essentially London. Gaby and her Company move through narrow streets and alleys, over rooftops, constant building sites and sudden, quiet green spaces, touching in a synthesis of choreography and place only possible through film."
