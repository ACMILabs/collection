        "This feature film is the story of three men and a boy who leave the city for the bush and a three-day hunt. For the hunters escaping the routine of daily life and work, the hunt is a move towards freedom. And above all, it is a chance to prove their virility in conquering the wild. Their attempts end in failure and tragedy. Cast includes Monique Mercure, Francoise Berd, Marcel Sabourin, Frederique Collin, Pierre Dufresne. Preview before screening for a general audience. Dubbed English version. (Award: Toronto)"
