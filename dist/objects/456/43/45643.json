        "Episode number 4 of Series \"People's century: 1900-1999\". This tape contains episodes eleven to thirteen of the 'People's century 1900-1999' series. \"1945: brave new world\"; post war euphoria gives way to a new war - the Cold War, as the Communist East and the Capitalist West are separated by the Iron Curtain. The Occupied powers begin deciding how Europe will look following the war and Churchill visits America, warning them of the terror rising in the Soviet sphere. Berlin represents a pocket of capitalism in the communist landscape. When Russia gains itself an atomic bomb, Stalin has all the power he needs. Narrated by Veronika Hyks. \"1948: boomtime\"; the Marshall plan moves into full swing as America make a concerted financial effort to rebuild Europe after the war. Heavy industry is re invigorated and Europeans visit America to learn valuable lessons in productivity. As time passes confidence builds and Europe begins exporting back to America on their home turf. The consumer society would rides on a wave of mass prosperity until 1973 when the cheap oil required to facilitate progress is no longer available. Narrated by Sean Barrett. \"1947: freedom now\"; when Gandhi showed the world how the masses could successfully defy their colonial masters, thousands across Africa and Asia joined the fight for control of their own destinies. Africa is paid particular attention to in this episode - as the European colonial powers retreat, a lack of resources and the language barriers left by imposed European boundaries detract from the peace process. Freedom would come at the cost of civil war. Narrated by Veronika Hyks."
