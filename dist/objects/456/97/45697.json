        "This film is a study of the rehabilitation of disabled American servicemen of both world wars, showing not only their training during hospitalisation, but their mastery of many jobs in industry. The film makes it clear that a handicapped veteran is not a business liability, but on the contrary is an efficient and reliable worker. The insurance companies' attitude is an indication of the esteem in which the disabled veteran worker is held."
