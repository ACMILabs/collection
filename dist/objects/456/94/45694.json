        "This film is an album of Native womanhood, portraying a proud egalitarian matriarchal society that for centuries has been pressured to adopt different standards and customs. All of the women featured share a belief in the importance of tradition as a source of strength in the face of change. Ethnographic documentation of Native Canadian 'American' post colonialisation which includes documented accounts of the 'stolen generation' in Native American tribes and personal accounts of racial discrimination. Directed, written, produced and narrated by Alanis Obomsawin. (Awards: San Francisco; Dieppe)"
