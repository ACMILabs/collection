        "What do ghost ships, the American Civil war, Scott's antarctic expedition and the gold rush have in common? What do humans, guinea pigs, monkeys and some fish have in common to the exclusion of other species? This video briefly covers vitamin history, emphasising how poor our knowledge has been and how recent our understanding is. It explains what vitamins are and what they are not. Explores common misconceptions; the relationship of deficiency to illness/disease; fat soluble vitamins and the problem of toxicity; the importance of water soluble vitamins in the diet; doses, megadoses and how to choose from the label; best sources and lists the important do's and don'ts. Points to controversies but does not discuss the studies. Content in food based on American foods Suitable for secondary and elementary tertiary diet/nutrition study."
