        "Written by Jeffrey Schrank, the main tenet of this video is that taste is a cultural bias - you eat/enjoy what your culture teaches you is edible/enjoyable and similarly reject as inedible what your culture rejects too. So what may make a person from one culture gag (monkey brains, haggis, raw fish, sheep eyeballs, cheese, frog's legs, pigs feet etc) yet become delicacies in another culture? The program also looks at the physical/philosophical differences of how we eat. The second half provides an interesting look at the multi-cultural origins of many foods that have became part of the American national diet and its identity as well as looking at the influence of slaves, native Americans and immigrants on the eating habits of Americans."
