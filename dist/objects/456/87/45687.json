        "What do toilet paper and ice-cream have in common? What does Newton's Law of Rotational Inertia have to do with eggs? This program looks at the scientific principles and explanations behind traditional preparation of everyday foods. In question and answer form it examines such things as: Why does cream stay whipped but milk doesn't? Why does popcorn pop in oil but not in water? Why do some eggs crack but others stay whole when boiled? Why do we beat eggs and sift flour? Why do cut onions cause tears but uncut onions do not? In posing these questions the program includes the scientific reason behind processes and provides a clear, entertaining and useful tool suited to secondary level science students."
