        "Robert Bresson's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's \"The forged note\" is a bleak tale of a minor transgression which spirals out of control, releasing an avalanche of broken lives and murder. Told in the director's usual minimalist style, 'L'Argent' (Money) traces the path of destruction a forged bank note leaves when two upper class school boys try to pass it off onto an unsuspecting photography shop. The shop owner then knowingly hands it over to a delivery driver who is arrested for carrying the counterfeit money. As a consequence the delivery driver's life descends into a series of tragic misfortunes which lead from petty theft to cold blooded murder, while the privileged school boys and shop keeper remain untarnished. In French with English subtitles. Cast includes Christian Patey, Vincent Risterucci, Caroline Lang, Sylvie Van Den Elsen, Marc-Ernest Fourneau, Andre Cler and Bruno Lapeyre. (Awards: 1983 Cannes Film Festival-Best Director Robert Bresson, 1984 National Society of Film Critics Awards USA- Best Director Robert Bresson)"
