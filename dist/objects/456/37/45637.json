        "Computer expert Paul Hackett accidentally stumbles into an all-night adventure through the rain-soaked streets of SoHo, Manhattan, when a chance evening encounter with a beautiful girl goes wrong. It all begins when his money flies out of a taxi and gets progressively worse from there, as he is led through a nightmarish chain of events. Eventually, his troubles become so horrible and convoluted that it seems he has wandered into a secret antechamber of Hell. All he wants is to get home, but events conspire against him in an hilariously appalling fashion. This nerve-wracking, blackly comic, paranoid nightmare is among Scorsese's most entertaining and overlooked films. Cast includes Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Verna Bloom, Teri Garr, John Heard, Cheech & Chong and a special appearance by Martin Scorsese."
