        "A story of life in an IRO Displaced Persons' Camp in Germany. Housed in an old Nazi army barrack, the people live from day to day, always hoping that some country will accept them as immigrants. The film captures the austere living conditions in the camp and the frustration and lonliness of the people. In spite of frequent disappointments, most people have not given up hope of finding a home and useful work. Narrated by Henry Fonda."
