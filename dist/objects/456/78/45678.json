        "Screenwriter Pier Paolo Pasolini's tragic story delves into the underbelly of lowlife brute povery to create a fascinating tapestry of human behaviour. A prostitute is brutally killed in a Rome park, while offscreen police investigators interrogate as variety of male suspects, the events depicted on screen display their alibies from each individual perspective, however their narrations do not necessarily match their actions. In Italian with English subtitles."
