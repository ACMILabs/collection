        "This is a portrayal of a young woman left alone to cope with family problems. Laurette is a young secretary, separated from her husband, with a daughter to bring up. Her thoughts, feelings and fears are shown. As she tries to make sense of the broken reality of her life, she must each day convince herself that life can go on while she provides a home for her child, that living as a \"solo\" parent is possible.
