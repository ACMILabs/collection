Develops a technique in combatting the price argument by taking into consideration factors other thatn price only. Shows problems of the retail merchant in getting salesmen to conserve and plan their time. Illustrates with a number of articlea what is meant by 'showmanship in selling'. Though not intended, this film presents an amusing stereotype of a 1940's American saleman."
