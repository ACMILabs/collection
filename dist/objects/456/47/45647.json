        "Episode number 8 of Series \"People's century: 1900-1999\". This tape contains episodes twenty three to twenty six of the 'People's century 1900-1999' series. 1975: WAR OF THE FLEA; success by guerilla fighters in Cuba, Vietnam and Afghanistan are used to illustrate how minority groups were able to overthrown government authorities, and are united by their religious idealogy and the uneasy peace that followed their actions. Narrated by Sean Barrett. 1979: GOD FIGHTS BACK; the secular liberalism of many Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries is rejected as the Ayatollah Khomeini's Iranian revolution inspires Muslims to seek fundamentalist Islamic governments. Narrated by Sean Barrett. 1989: PEOPLE POWER; from the 1980 strike in Poland's Gdansk Shipyard to the army's attempt to lay siege to the Russian White House, eyewitnesses from an historic era recall the fall of the Eastern Bloc. Narrated by Veronika Hyks. 1997: FAST FORWARD; the collapse of Communism and the end of the Cold War heralds a new era of global capitalism. It also brought with it a bloody price, as resurging nationalism and old animosity brought forward ethnic violence, and an increasing divide between rich and poor brought social unrest. What will the twenty first century bring? Narrated by Sean Barrett."
