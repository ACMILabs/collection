        "This video provides a basic introduction to the concept of fractions - whole, halves, quarters, thirds, eighths and sixteenths. It uses both a 10th birthday party and the irascible puppets from the ABC program \"The Ferals\" to provide examples of common everyday usage of fractions. Suitable for Lower-Middle Primary Level students."
