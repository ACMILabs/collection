        "This is a subtle, ironic fable, an allegory of the religious hypocrisy of a plantation owner towards his slaves, set in a time just after the Haitian revolution of 1795. The Cuban landowners are suddenly instilled with the fear of slave rebellion at the same time that the disruption of agriculture in Haiti offers them the chance to improve their position in the international market, but only on condition that they buy more slaves and intensify their exploitation, which only increases, of course, the dangers of rebellion. Trying to convince himself of his spiritual purity, a wealthy and guilt-ridden slave owner stages a Last Supper for 12 black slaves and himself as Christ. In Spanish with English subtitles."
