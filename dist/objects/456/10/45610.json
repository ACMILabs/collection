        "Episode of Series \"Wonders of weather\". The first two 25 minute segments - \"Forecasting\" and \"Weather and waves\" dramatically explore the subject of weather. \"Forecasting\" contains a history of weather data collection and use such as the invention of the thermometer (Galileo), the barometer (Toricelli), the synoptic approach, the mathematical basis of modern forecasting, and the use of satellites and the supercomputer. Also discusses the Chaos Theory (Edward Lorenz), weather folklore and war outcome in relation to forecasting. \"Wind and Waves\" emphasises the destructive power of natural forces. Discusses what creates wind energy and direction, its connection with tides, ocean currents, rough seas and temperature. Examines tidal waves, tsunamis, superwaves, coastal erosion and the \"el nino\" cycle of effects resulting in floods or drought and fire. The final segment, \"Splendor in the sky\", looks at the specialist work of Simon Carroll, an Australian time-lapse photographer. His potent, beautiful and often rare images, such as volcanic lava flowing onto a beach in the moonlight, are used extensively in this series to reveal the complex energy interaction involved in the phenomenon called weather. He talks briefly about the technical aspects of working in extreme weather conditions, in isolated places and also about the poetry of what he's trying to capture. There is a greater than average Australian example content in this series."
