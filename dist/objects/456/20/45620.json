        "Why does a housewife concerned for her family's welfare feed them so inadequately that she endangers their very lives? The film is a humorous and satirical attempt to remind the average housewife that it is not enough to be aware of modern food facts; they must also be applied in daily food purchasing and preparation. Cast includes Kay Tremblay Robert Berger, Norman Ettlinger, Mireille Goulet, Frank Heron. Written by Herb Hosie. Photographed by Reginald Morris. Edited by David Mayerovitch Music by Eldon Rathburn. Sound by Michael McKennirey."
