        "Episode number 7 of Series \"People's century: 1900-1999\". This tape contains episodes twenty to twenty two of the 'People's century 1900-1999' series. \"1949: great leap\"; in 1949 Chairman Mao heads a resounding victory to Communism and the beginning of a Cultural Revolution intended to end the social divide between rich and poor. Throughout his reign Mao would gain support from the peasants and students, but at a high cost to human life through natural disasters such as famines, and persecution for those who did not follow party policy. Only death would stop the master plan. Narrated by Veronika Hyks. \"1968: new release\"; a generation of baby boomers brought up to \"respect their elders\" become teenagers and with the transition comes a new freedom as reflected in music, film and advertising at the time. Resistors to authoritarian rule became international heroes and youth across the world became involved in draft resistance to the Vietnam War. It was the start of a decade of student activism across Britain, Europe and America concerning issues such as the environment, women's rights and gay liberation. Narrated by Sean Barrett. \"1970: half the people\"; women achieve a sense of purpose as they fill the roles of men who have left to fight, roles which do not seem destined to continue as the men return. A post-war generation of women take up the fight for equality and recall the battle for equal pay and opportunities and the sexual freedom obtained with the development of the new birth control pill. The situation would not be the same for women in third world countries such as Asia and Africa. Narrated by Sean Barrett."
