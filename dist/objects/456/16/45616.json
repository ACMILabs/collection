        "A red-hot story of corporate negligence sends ace-reporter Jason Brady into battle against big business, as well as against himself. But can he risk his world--his marriage, his job and possibly the lives of his family and himself--to save innocent children from the devastating effects of industrial pollution? Can one man buck the system and still survive? This gripping drama sensitively portrays one man's confrontation with himself, his ideals and the realities around him."
