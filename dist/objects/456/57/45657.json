        "Interesting animation techniques are used in this version of the Grimm Brothers' tale about the donkey, dog, cat and rooster who set out for Bremen to become town musicians. On their way they sing outside the hideout of some robbers, and make such a din that the robbers take fright, leaving the animals with a comfortable home. Animation by Armin Schaffer, Dan Hunn and Stephen Muffat."
