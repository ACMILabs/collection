        "Episode number 1 of Series \"People's century: 1900-1999\". This tape contains the first three episodes of the 'People's century 1900-1999' series. \"1900: age of hope\"; as the century begins, a trade exhibition in Paris captures the optimism of the new century as the powerful countries of the world showcase their material progress. The state funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901 undermines progress however, reminding the country of its ties with the old order of European dynasties. Russia too is caught firmly in the grip of autocracy, leading many Europeans to migrate to America. Mass literacy vastly changes the political awareness of ordinary citizens and newspapers bring politics to the masses in Britain and the United States. The suffragette movement is also in full swing, while the colonies work towards self government. Europe is caught up in strategic alliances, a situation which ensures world involvement should a war begin. Narrated by Sean Barrett. \"1914: killing fields\"; Europe and Germany are drawn into a new kind of war - an industrialized war in which logistics and machine guns make a devastating and significant debut. There is the first full scale project of propaganda against the Germans, as battles at the Somme, Verdun and Ypres facilitate the slaughter of thousands of soldiers on both sides of the battle. The war ends in 1918 with an armistice and no clear victor, as well as a new distrust of public figureheads who allowed the slaughter to continue. It seems doubtful the world can return to the idyll of 1914. Narrated by Veronica Hyks. \"917: red flag\"; in the Soviet Union the people finally make a move to overthrown the tsar, Nicholas II, and put an end to autocratic power. An uprising, led by the Marxist socialist Lenin succeeds in overthrowing the tsar and his family. He replaces it with another system which would have international repercussion, Communism, which appealed to America during the Depression due to its productivity and opportunities for women. Narrated by Sean Barrett."
