        "On March 8, 1922, Agnes Campbell Macphail became Canada's first woman Member of Parliament. For the next nineteen years, the Independent MP used her wit, courage and honesty to fight for prison reform, old-age pensions, the co-operative movement and the many other causes she believed in. Made up of old photographs, archival footage and quotations from her speeches and writings, this film documents a significant Canadian and the turbulence of her times. Agnes Campbell Macphail died on February 13, 1954."
