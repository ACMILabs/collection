        "This program explores the common myths and confusions of weight control. It covers the role of fats in food, body energy, diet, crash diets, diet drugs, the notion of \"ideal\" weight, obesity, role of genetics, good food/bad food, the quantitative role of exercise and finishes with a series of recommendations for long term weight loss. It does not investigate other nutritional aspects of food such as vitamin and mineral content, refined versus unrefined etc. Suitable also for secondary students, although there is a strong American cultural bias and statistic base."
