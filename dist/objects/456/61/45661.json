        "Inspired by a hollywood gossip mag, our animated amphibian, \"Flip the Frog\" apes Chaplin, woos a Manequin, and infiltrates a movie studio to various slapstick ends. Laurel & Hardy appear in parody form. Curious for its use of exagerated gestural style for comic effect. NOTE: This is a silent print of a sound cartoon."
