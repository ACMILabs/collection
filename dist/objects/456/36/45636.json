        "Acclaimed worldwide as the `Gone With the Wind of the Cuban film industry', 'Lucia' is indeed Cuba's first film spectacular, an epic, three-part feature film dramatizing three separate periods in the Cuban struggle for liberation in order to show the participation of Cuban women in that fight. In 1895, Lucia is embroiled in a tale of love and betrayal during Cuba's war for independence from Spain; in 1933, Lucia leaves her middle-class family and becomes involved in the overthrow of the Cuban dictator Machado; and in the 1960's, Lucia is taught how to read and write during Cuba's literacy campaign and, as a newlywed, confronts her husband's macho attitudes. Each episode is filmed in a distinctive visual style which translates the spirit of each historical era, with the themes of love, death and war achieving epic proportions, and providing the viewer with a good example of the role of women in history. In Spanish with English subtitles. Cast includes Raquel Revuelta, Eduardo Maure and Eslinda Nunez. (Awards: Golden Globe 1969)"
