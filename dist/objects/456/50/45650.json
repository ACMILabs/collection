        "A stunning and gruelling adventure about a band of Spanish conquistadors led by Aguirre, and their descent into the heart of darkness while exploring the Amazon in search of El Dorado, the legendary city of Gold. As the expedition moves further into the jungle, they leave reality behind and enter a dreamlike, otherwordly land of delusion and madness. In German with English subtitles. Cast includes Klaus Kinski, Cecilia Rivera, Ruy Guerra, Helena Rojo, Del Negro and Daniel Zacapa. In German with English subtitles."
