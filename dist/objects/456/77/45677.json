        "A reformed gunfighter returns to a woman he had abandoned years earlier. She is now the proprietor of a gambling saloon opened in anticipation of the arrival of the railroad and in the face of hostile opposition from the local townspeople. The film's bizarre, even baroque, intensity derives in part from the central antagonism between two women (virtually unique in the western), and in Yordan and Ray's expressed intention of seeking an anti-McCarthy parable."
