        "This program focuses on the physiological and psychological landmarks of the first year of life: noting that the order, not the timing is predictable. Using footage of infants to illustrate each point of maturation, areas covered include; motor development; muscle control and strength - from birth; reflex actions - smiling, rolling over, sitting, crawling, walking; hand-eye co-ordination; exploration of world and link to feeding and digestion; sensory development; language and speech development; developmental norms; attachment, separation and anxiety; development of thinking, planning, goal directed actions and; symbolic representations. Informative and useful to both students and parents of newborns."
