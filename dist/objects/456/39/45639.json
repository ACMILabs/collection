        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Wonders of the universe\". The first episode \"Cosmic catastrophes\" explores the impact cosmic collisions have had on shaping our earth and the rest of the galaxy, describing the extent of the damage that even a relatively small piece of 'spacejunk' can have on life on Earth, and the surprising regularity with which collisions occur. Examines dwarf and giant stars, novas and supernovas, pulsars, black holes, shooting stars and comets. (25 mins) Episode two, \"Home star\", looks at the birth, life and death of the nearest star to Earth, the Sun and describes how the universe is shaped by the influence of the Sun's light and heat. (25 mins) Episode three, \"Moonflight\", takes a tour of the most exotic moons in the solar system, including Earth's only natural satellite, covers an in-depth exploration of the surface and features of the moon. (25 mins) Episode four, \"Alone in space?\", is an investigation of the possibility that there are other life forms and forms of life in the universe - what is life and where did it begin? Looks at the use of Radio Astronomy in trying to detect life on other planets. (25 mins)"
