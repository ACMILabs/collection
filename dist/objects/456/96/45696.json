        "Life in a typical nursery school in Britain, capturing their involvement in games, painting, modelling, climbing and acting and ending with a birthday tea party and a dip in a pool. Traditional gender roles can be observed as the girls cook in the kitchen, while the boys occupy themselves with building. A non-narrated film with musical accompaniment."
