        "This is a \"nowhere tour\" of Montreal, a sort of parody of the world we live in, where all is confusion, aimlessness and noise. A recurring figure in the film is a Highland piper walking his beat on a lonely patch of ground beneath an elevated highway. The busload of sightseers encounters him as they do other objects of curiosity. At one point, the tour guide, a young woman, and the piper have a fling at dancing. It is a bus tour where everything is unexpected. Cast includes Don Ares, Cheryl Davis, Ron Sutherland. Photography by Thomas Vamos. Edited by Donald Rennick. Sound by Ted Haley, Claude Hazanavicius, Victor Merrill."
