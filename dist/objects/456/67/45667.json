        "Documentary on obesity, its causes and effects. Psychiatrists suggest that over-eating is a form of emotional disorder leading to addiction and that in the United States in particular, food has become symbolic as a state of well-being. It appears that children are actually encouraged to over-eat leading to difficulties in adult life to break the habit. The program's main aim is to educate in the area of health and nutrition."
