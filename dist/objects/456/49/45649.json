        "Guilty beyond a reasonable doubt - such is the incontrovertible law which pardons the innocent and condemns the guilty. But just how fallible is the process of law? To what extent can deceit, prejudice - and the cruel powers of fate - intervene to set a murderer free, or send an innocent man to the electric chair? Dana Andrews plays Tom Carret, a writer who becomes obsessed with the idea of proving that it is possible for a completely innocent man to be found guilty of murder. And when a pretty showgirl is found strangled in a ravine, and no killer can be found, the perfect opportunity presents itself. This dark and chilling drama is the last film Lang made in Hollywood."
