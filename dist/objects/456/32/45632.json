        "This film is an uproarious comedy and a masterpiece of film satire. A model worker who invented a machine for manufacturing plaster busts of Cuban national hero Jose Marti, dies in an accident while working on the machine. He is buried holding his \"carnet laboral\" (labour card) as a symbol of his proletarian pride. The widow, upon applying for a pension, discovers that it cannot be processed without first turning in the card. In the film, the story has been elaborated to provide innumerable opportunities to parody Hollywood comedy. In Spanish with English subtitles. Cast includes Salvador Wood, Manuel Estanillo, Silvia Planas and Gaspar de Santelices."
