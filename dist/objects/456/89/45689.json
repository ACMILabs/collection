        "When you encounter someone who is physically or mentally handicapped how do you react? Pity? Discomfort? Either reaction will influence your ability to communicate. This program is essentially about improving communication and relationships with the disabled. Good guidance (\"enabling tips\") is given by a deaf woman, a boy whose wheelchair is an extension of his body, and a girl blind from birth. The benefits of integration (mainstreaming) and 'coaching' are explored as we learn about the school lives of a child with Down's Syndrome, a boy with cerebral palsy and the blind girl. The power and importance of non-judgemental language is also covered."
