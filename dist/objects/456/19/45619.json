        "A story of land use and abuse in south-west USA. We see the area as it was before the advent of the colonists a few hundred years ago, and the same area as it is at the time of making this film (1937). Overgrazing and intensive farming has depleted soil binding vegetation, and the result is destruction of the soil by floods and erosion. Remedial measures are suggested, with emphasis on the urgent necessity for soil conservation practices."
