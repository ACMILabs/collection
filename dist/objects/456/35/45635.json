        "A profound but sensitive treatment of class differences in the so-called classless society of post-revolutionary Cuba, 'Up to A Certain Point' tells a story about universal themes such as love and friendship within a unique setting. This film \"chronicles the confused, troubled romance between a middle-aged screenwriter and the female dockworker picked to be the subject of his next film. The lingering presence of Latin-style machismo in post-revolutionary Cuban society has been treated extensively in recent Cuban films, but what distinguishes 'Up To A Certain Point' is the class dimension that Gutierrez Alea gives to this problem\" (Richard Pena. Idera website http://http://www.vcn.bc.ca/idera/colorsite/index.htm). In Spanish with English subtitles. Cast includes Oscar Alvarez, Mirta Ibarra, Omar Valdes and Coralia Veloz."
