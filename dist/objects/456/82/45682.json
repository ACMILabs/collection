        "Director Paul Wagner along with his cast and crew posed as tourists with video cameras to shoot this film on location in Tibet, avoiding Chinese secret police and security cameras in the process. The film follows a number of story lines that depict the plight of Tibetans at the hand of Chinese aggressors. Cast includes Dadon, Jampa Kelsang, Richard Chang, Lu Yu and Taije Silverman. Many cast and crew have asked that their names be withheld to protect themselves and their families. In Tibetan and Chinese with English subtitles."
