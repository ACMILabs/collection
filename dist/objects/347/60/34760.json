        "Episode of Series \"Life Support\". Highlights the importance of a commonsense approach to emergency situations. After covering the life threatening priorities of airway, breathing and circulation, the program goes on to explain in detail history (what happened), signs (what you see or feel) and symptoms (what the patient feels). An accident scene highlights this approach and stresses the need for urgent action."
