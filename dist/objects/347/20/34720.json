        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". P.G.R. starts this topic by talking with a group of people about how they became single parents, and how they coped during the early stages. We then examine the problems of being a single parent, including household and financial management, helping children through this difficult period of their lives, and sharing the responsibility for the care of the kids. Finally, our guests reflect on their experiences, discussing the hardships and what they have gained as single parents."
