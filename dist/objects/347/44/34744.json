        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". Children's birthdays can be a pleasure or a disaster. PGR speaks with two mothers, seasoned party givers, on how to plan a successful party. The questions of where to hold a successful party. The questions of where to hold the party - indoors/outdoors, guests, duration, safety, food, and possible plans for entertainment to offer the children, are discussed. Encouraging the children to paint a table cloth and how to make party hats and invitations introduces some novel ideas. An excellent tape for parents wanting to ensure their children's birthday parties are happy and successful events."
