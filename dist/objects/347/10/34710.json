        "Episode of Series \"Safetycare\". As a safety issue manual handling is easily the most contentious. In every workplace manual handling occurs in some form or other - lifting, pushing, pulling, pouring, wearing weighty clothing, all fit the category of manual handling. This video examines the types of manual handling, the resulting types of problems and injuries and explains through a hierarchy of control measures how all manual handling situations should be addressed."
