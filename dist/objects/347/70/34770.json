        "Hendrika was a fine Dutch cow who was very unhappy on Mr. Hofstra's farm. Then one day she fell into the canal and floated down to the city on a raft. Peter Spier's delightfully zany illustrations are a perfect complement to this rib-tickling tale. Based on the book of the same title written by Phyllis Krasilovsky and illustrated by Peter Spier. Narrated by Owen Jordan."
