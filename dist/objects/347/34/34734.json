        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". PGR examines the effects disabilities have on children and their families. One young man whose mother had taken the drug Thalidomide speaks about the effects his disability has had on his life. He has won world records for five of the six events open to armless swimming competitors. He firmly believes anyone can achieve anything they want in life, provided they want it badly enough and are willing to work and persevere in order to achieve their goals. He speaks with sensitivity and humour on the reactions of his peers, his aunt and sister, and his mother, to his disability. His happy and positive nature leaves no doubt he will continue to achieve whatever he sets his mind to."
