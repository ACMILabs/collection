        "The Tibaldi brothers add a light-hearted touch to the problem of alcohol. It covers reasons for drinking - boredom, rebellion, adult role models, peer pressure and the media - and looks at how some young people have developed a responsible attitude. An excellent discussion starter for young people about the use and abuse of alcohol."
