        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". Examines how difficult behaviour can be defined in terms of a child's development. Can a baby's behaviour be called difficult? The \"terrible two's\" is this a myth or a reality? PGR also suggests strategies that parents can use in coming to terms with any child's difficult behaviour. The roles of childcare workers, counsellors and play are also explored."
