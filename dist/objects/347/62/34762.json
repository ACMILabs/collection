        "An elusive fly and a single-minded bear create a disaster of amazing proportions from what is initially a tranquil dinner in the bears' house. A full orchestral score and sound effects reminiscent of classic slapstick comedy highlight the hazards of losing your temper. Based on the book by Paula Winters."
