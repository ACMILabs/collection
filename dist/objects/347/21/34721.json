        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". Combining work with parenthood provides numerous pressures for working parents. P.G.R. looks at some of these problems, including house duties, mother's re-entry to the workforce, workplace issues affecting women's rights, managing chores while caring for children, and becoming a house husband. We talk to a number of people from a variety of backgrounds who have managed to balance the competing needs of their careers and their children."
