        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". Children can be disoriented by change, and here we discuss this process. Parents describe the effects on their children of moving house, changing childcare centres, and emergency admissions into hospital. We discuss behaviour patterns which may indicate change is disturbing to a child. Two families talk about the deaths, one expected, the other sudden, of younger children. Finally we discuss ways of dealing with change."
