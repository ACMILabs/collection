        "Episode of Series \"Safetycare\". Identifying potential fire hazards is an extension of a basic good housekeeping policy - preventing fires by identifying and removing potential fire hazards should be regular practice in all workplaces. This video tells what to look for to make sure safety precautions such as fire doors are functioning properly and will serve their intended purpose in an emergency. Sprinklers, safe storage, controlling incoming goods, proper ventilation are some of the points."
