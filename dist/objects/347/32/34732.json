        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". Some tips are given which may help to take some of the fear out of toilet training. The timing of toilet training is important and we provide advice to help parents recognise the signs and encourage the performance. We survey a range of pots, and discuss some of the emotional background to toilet training. We also discuss viewers' letters and examine the subjects of constipation and urinary tract infection. The medical and therapeutic approach to bedwetting and faecal soiling are each explained and we complete this program by offering a selection of brief practical advice on toilet training."
