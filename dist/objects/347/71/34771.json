        "The film follows the adventures of a stuffed teddy bear called Corduroy who waits to be selected from the shelves of a department store. To make sure he is not mistaken for used property, he embarks on a quest to find a button that is missing from his overalls. In the process, he discovers a new and deserving owner. Based on the book by Don Freeman."
