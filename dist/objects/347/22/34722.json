        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". This title is introduced by a discussion on babysitting, including co-operatives. We follow this with an introduction to Childcare centres, visiting two centres and talking with both a provider and a user of Family Day Care about this domestic alternative. A third, bi-lingual, Childcare centre is visited, and we describe Childcare Co-operatives. Two parents, a mother and a father, discuss their decisions to care for children full-time at home and we suggest guidelines for choosing and using Childcare facilities."
