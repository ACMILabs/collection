        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". This title covers the following topics: Circumcision - we provide information about why and how this operation is performed on male babies, and discuss the care of the uncircumcised penis. Teeth - the symptoms and some solutions to teething problems are discussed and PGR looks at how to keep teeth healthy. Feet and Legs - children often appear to have bandy legs, knock knees or pigeon toes in early years of walking. An orthopaedic surgeon discusses these in the context of the development of a \"normal\" walking pattern. Body Awareness - PGR discusses children's body awareness illustrating the way in which children discover and play with their bodies. Questions - groups of parents talk about how best to answer those awkward or embarrassing questions children ask about their bodies."
