        "There is a subtle elegance in this traditional Welsh tale about a young cowherd, his harp, and the shining white cow it summons from the depths of a mountain lake. The cowherd's purity, his struggle with a proud and greedy father, and their inevitable confrontation springs from the author's childhood travels to Aberdovey, Wales."
