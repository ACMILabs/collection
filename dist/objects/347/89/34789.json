        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Improving Performance\". Ian works in an art department. His work has become sloppy, he makes long personal phone calls, he drinks and he is constantly late or off work. His supervisor, Hugo, has spoken to him twice previously and now adopts the hard approach. Peter Quarry then assumes the role of supervisor and uses the 3 step approach."
