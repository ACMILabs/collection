        "Two audio cassettes, Notes for teachers and a workbook to accompany the videorecorded course in French, A vous la France! Together they provide more structured reinforcement of the vocabulary introduced in the programs. The script of the programs is presented in the workbook with exercises and the Teacher's notes give suggestions as to how best use the materials. The audio-cassettes give examples of correct pronunciation with opportunity to practise at intervals."
