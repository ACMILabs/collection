        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Under southern skies\". Continued life on this planet is dependent on our ability to maintain a balance with our biosphere and our resources. In the pursuit of a sustainable world, humans need to examine their direction on behalf of all living species. Sue Hanckel examines the paradox of a world which is trying to feed its billions and develop economically yet at the same time create a sustainable future for the generations to come. Particular attention is paid to our over dependence on fossil fuels and ways in which alternative forms of energy can be developed."
