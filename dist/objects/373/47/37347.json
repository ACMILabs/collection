        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Under southern skies\". Series presenter, Dr Susie Hanckel, leaves her city environment to examine what makes the ecosystems in our 400million year old country distinctively Australian. She looks at the adaptation of plants to the extremes of Australian climatic conditions - from the arid deserts and the snow covered eucalypts of the Australian Alps to the rainforests of North Queensland. This episode features distinguished scientist and specialist on Australia's High Country, Alec Costain."
