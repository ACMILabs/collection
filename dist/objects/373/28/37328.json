        "Animated versions of two stories about Babar, King of the Elephants. \"Babar's first step\" tells how Babar's mother was killed by a hunter when he was very young leaving Babar to cope on his own. \"City ways\" tells how he fled to the city which he found dangerous and confusing until an old lady tried to teach him how to fit into her world. Adapted from the picture books by Jean and Laurent de Brunhoff."
