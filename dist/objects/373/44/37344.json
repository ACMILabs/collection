        "Bruno Lawrence plays a scientist who wakes up one morning to find that an experiment has gone dreadfully wrong and all living things seem to have disappeared from the planet. He searches for other living humans trying to fight off approaching madness and despair. He eventually meets up with two other survivors but as they realise the consequences of the science experiment on the Universe, their relationships fall apart. A haunting and provocative science-fiction film. Based on the novel by Craig Harrison."
