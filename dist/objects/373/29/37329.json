        "A re-telling of the famous conflict between Captain Bligh and Mr. Fletcher Christian aboard the ship \"The Bounty\". The conflict eventually led to a mutiny against Bligh, led by Christian, and to Bligh's miraculous escape in an open boat across 4,000 miles of ocean. Featuring beautiful Pacific locations and a star-studded cast including Daniel Day Lewis, Edward Fox and Laurence Olivier. Mel Gibson plays Christian. But it is Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Bligh which is most memorable and he makes the Captain a believably human character rather than the monster he is usually portrayed as. Music by Vangelis. The script is by Robert Bolt based on the book \"Captain Bligh and Mr Christian\" by Richard Hough."
