        "Jeanette MacDonald stars as Marcia, an opera singer in Paris who falls in love with a penniless American voice student (Nelson Eddy). Unfortunately she has just accepted a marriage proposal from an egocentric voice teacher, Nazaroff, played by John Barrymore. Years later, when chance reunites the two lovers, the enraged Nazaroff grants them their freedom... but in his own way."
