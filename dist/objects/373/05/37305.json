        "From Daphne Du Maurier's short story, Hitchcock has created a bizarre and violent allegory for the apocalypse. A peaceful Californian coastal town is set upon by birds of all kinds who start attacking humans with increasing ferocity. Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor star in the film, as a pair of young lovers, but the real stars are the realistic special effects, the chilling sounds and music of maestro Bernard Herrmann, and Hitchcock's gleefully sadistic flair with the film medium. Also stars Suzanne Pleshette and Jessica Tandy."
