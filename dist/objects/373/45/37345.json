        "Phil Stone's best-selling novel about a country fair was originally filmed in 1933. This technicolour remake features a bright Rodgers and Hammerstein score and the wholesome pairing of Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews as a couple who fall in love at the fair. The songs include \"That's for me\" and \"It might as well be spring\". The film also stars Fay Bainter and Dick Haymes. Academy Award winner for Best Musical Score in 1945."
