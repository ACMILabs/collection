        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Under southern skies\". The south-west corner of Western Australia has a relatively undisturbed ecosystem where 85% of the plants grow nowhere else in Australia. Grant Wardell-Johnson, a committed ecologist, guides series presenter, Susie Hanckel, through this region of giant Karri and Jarrah forests and swamps, revealing how the the impact of man's encroachment on this ecosystem can be gauged by studying certain unique species of frogs in the area."
