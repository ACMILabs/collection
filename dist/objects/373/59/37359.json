        "The Grand Hotel is a luxurious hotel in Berlin, a hive of activity where lives and futures are altered. Based on the novel by Vicki Baum, \"Grand Hotel\" features a formidable line-up of players - Greta Garbo as a lonely, aging ballerina, John Barrymore as the Baron and a gentleman thief, Joan Crawford as a street-wise stenographer, Wallace Beery as a vicious, lustful tycoon and Lionel Barrymore, a doomed man hoping for a last glorious fling at the \"Grand Hotel\". Winner of an Academy Award for Best Picture, 1932."
