        "A poignant and gently paced portrayal of one day in the life of M. Ladmiral, a French painter nearing the end of his life. As is usual on Sundays, M. Ladmiral is visited at his country home by his children from the city - the devoted Edouard with his petit bourgeois wife and three children and the lively Irene, M. Ladmiral's beautiful daughter. This Sunday, as the day unfolds, a telling family portrait is gradually revealed with the sensitivity that only Tavernier can bring to the screen."
