        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Under southern skies\". Paleobotanist Mary White explains the origins of the unique plant life of Australia, when it was part of the huge land mass, Gondwana, and the resulting evolution of plant life as it adapted to warmer conditions. Mary White challenged presenter Sue Hanckel to consider the earth as a complex balanced system, like the human body, with man, the virus, that threatens Earth's very existence. Sue discovers a reaffirmation of Carl Jung's observation that the future of our world hangs on a delicate thread."
