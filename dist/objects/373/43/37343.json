        "Utu is a Maori word for revenge, and this film traces the fortunes of Te Wheke (played by Anzac Wallace), who became a 19th Century rebel leader against the European settlers to New Zealand. Te Wheke originally supported the British until his village is wiped out by British soldiers. This violent act, in turn, leads to Te Wheke committing increasingly cruel and violent reprisals. Filmed in rugged New Zealand high country. Also features Bruno Lawrence and Wi Kuki Kaa."
