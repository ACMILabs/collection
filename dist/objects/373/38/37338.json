        "A lavish re-telling of the Tarzan legend which stays remarkably faithful to the original Edgar Rice Burroughs' story. The film recounts the circumstances which led to the child Earl of Greystoke being raised by a family of apes until he is discovered by a Belgian explorer, who teaches him human language, and takes him back to the aristocratic Greystoke manor in Britain. There Tarzan must deal with the cruelty of human snobbery and hypocrisy. Christopher Lambert is Tarzan, Andie MacDowell is a pure-hearted Jane. Also starring Ralph Richardson, Ian Holm, and James Fox. Partly filmed on location in Cameroon."
