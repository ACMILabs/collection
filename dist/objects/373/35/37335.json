        "This film captures the spirit of a romantic age when Johann Strauss created some of the world's favourite melodies. French actor Fernand Gravet plays Strauss with Luise Rainer as his wife Poldi. Soprano Miliza Korjus plays Carla Donner, the opera singer with whom Strauss was infatuated and for whom he wrote some of his greatest works including \"Die Fledermaus\""
