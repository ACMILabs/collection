        "Episode of Series \"Hollywood's rebels\". A documentary incorporating footage of Montgomery Clift's most memorable films; interviews with family and with friends of Clift (including Jane Fonda); and rare archival material stretching back to his childhood. What develops is the story of an intense young boy who yearned for stardom, achieved notable success in such classic films as \"From Here to Eternity\" and \"I Confess\", only to be ruined by alcohol addiction and his inability to face his own fears and homosexual desires. Montgomery Clift, as this video portrays him, may have not been a happy man but he never compromised his acting talents for Hollywood."
