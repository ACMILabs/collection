        "Episode four, \"Being in a union\", is about the various functions performed by trade unions. In \"Using public transport\" a man used to driving everywhere finds that public transport can turn out to be much more convenient: but only once you can understand timetables and how to access information. And in \"Using a phone\" information is given on some of the barriers that inhibit people from using a phone effectively."
