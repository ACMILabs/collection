        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Under southern skies\". Fire is the generative force that has been essential in the development of Australia's unique flora. Botanist Ian Telford reveals the resilience and ingenious adaptability of eucalypts after fire, when dormant buds protected by thick bark shoot out and seeds cracked open by heat, germinate. Even from the most severe destruction of fire, new life emerges on this continent. Presented by Ruth Hanckel."
