        "Deformed at birth by a rare disease, penniless John Merrick is forced to become the star attraction in a travelling freak-show. Treves, a compassionate surgeon, rescues him from the fairground taunts, coaxing out of the terrified, disabled man a touchingly unembittered personality. This multi-award winning film stars Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt, John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft. Based on \"The Elephant man and other reminiscences\" by Sir Frederick Treves and in part on \"The Elephant man: a study in human dignity\" by Ashley Montagu."
