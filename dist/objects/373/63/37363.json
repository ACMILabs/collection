        "Looks at ways Australia could expand trade to other countries, particularly the Arab world, by drawing on the language skills of its ethnic population. The video looks at examples of industries and individuals who have benefited by acknowledging their cultural roots, maintaining their language and recognising their own potential, for the key to trade with other countries is communication and understanding of other cultures. Accompanied by Teacher's notes."
