        "A documentary examining the fight by contemporary Aboriginal people, for land rights and for the recognition by white Australia that the British colonisation of this continent was illegal and has yet to be compensated for. Interviews with Aboriginal activists from the Northern Territory and New South Wales make it clear that while the government pays lip-service to the language of land rights, Aboriginal people have yet to receive full access to their land. Includes interviews with Pat Dodson, Marcia Langton and Michael Mansell."
