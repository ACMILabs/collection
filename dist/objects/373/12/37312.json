        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Miracle Planet\". Volume 5 examines glacial ice, its movement over thousands of years and what we can learn from it. The massive changes that the planet has endured are now being compounded by the effects of humans on the Earth's surface. The natural cycle of the Earth's orbit suggests that long-term, the planet is getting colder, yet it is showing signs of warming due to the increased levels of man-made gases in the atmosphere."
