        "In this black comedy, Cary Grant plays Mortimer Brewster, a drama critic about to marry Elaine Page (Priscilla Lane) who discovers that insanity runs in his family. His maiden aunts poison lonely old men, and his uncle buries the victims in the cellar. Mortimer attempts to conceal these crimes as police search for the murderer. Grant donated his fee to war relief."
