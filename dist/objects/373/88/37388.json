        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". This documentary explores what it means to be an Australian citizen and just what a new citizen is welcome to. In interviews with historians, social planners and ordinary people, 'Being True Blue' looks behind the facade of the national anthem, the sports hero, the bushman and the other cheap barometers of identity."
