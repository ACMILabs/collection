        "The first two episodes of a thirteen part survey by Hugh Johnson of the history of wine. \"First pressing\" looks at the origins of winemaking in the Caucusus mountains of Georgia and its enjoyment in ancient middle eastern cultures until the prohibition enforced by Islam. \"Drinking the god\" looks at the role wine has played in religious ceremonies from pagan sacrifices, Dionysian orgies and Jewish ritual to the Christian mass. The programs look at how Georgia and the Middle East use and produce wine today."
