On his deathbed, Ada's father tells her to journey south to seek her true inheritance. But Martha, who is a witch, is determined to get to the inheritance first. She orders Agnes to follow Ada, kill her and steal her map. Agnes is unable to kill her friend and the two are drawn together on a journey for buried treasure."
