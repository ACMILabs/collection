        "An inspirational film on the production of the Aboriginal musical 'Bran Nue Dae' and the life of Jimmy Chi, its creator. Chi has suffered from schizophrenia since he was a university student but remains undaunted by his illness. 'Bran Nue Dae' is largely the work of Chi with the pooled talents of Broome band, Knuckles. The musical is a story of an Aboriginal boy's flight from the city of Perth to his homeland at Djaridjin. His journey in search of identity, love and security takes us across the state in a blend of rock-opera, road-movie, comedy, song, dance, and romance."
