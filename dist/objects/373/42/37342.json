        "The film begins with our innocent pair of lovers, Brad and Janet, stranded in a rain storm with the only available shelter being the weird Dr. Frank N. Furter mansion. Before the night is out Brad and Janet will lose their respective virginities to the Doctor, be introduced to his muscle-bound creation, Rocky, and battle the evil beings from the planet Transylvania. The plot is ridiculous, the music enjoyable and the whole thing is an outrageously good time. Possibly the most popular cult movie of all time and based on the original stage musical by Richard O'Brien. With Richard O'Brien, Susan Sarandon, Nell Campbell and Patricia Quinn all doing the \"Time warp\". Tim Curry steals the show with an over-the-top performance as the sex mad Doctor."
