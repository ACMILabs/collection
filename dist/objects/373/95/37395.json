        "This Oscar winning film celebrates five individuals who have died from AIDS. Through interviews, photos, home movies and other remembrances, the portraits of these five people and their loved ones show how they came to terms with their loss by participating in the AIDS Memorial Quilt. The film also encapsulates the history of the AIDS epidemic as reported by the news media in the U.S. from 1981-89. Including an interview with writer Vito Russo. Narrated by Dustin Hoffman."
