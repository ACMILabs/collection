        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Under southern skies\". Sue Henckel travels to far north Queensland to meet Thancoupie, an Aboriginal healer, who explains the ancient tradition of holistic medicine that nurtures, heals and protects. Thancoupie provides an education on the qualities and properties of Australian native flora, showing that it is the hunter gatherers who have provided the rich source of essential substances used in modern medicines."
