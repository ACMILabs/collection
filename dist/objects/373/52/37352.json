        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Under southern skies\". Within 30 years, at the present rate of logging, all available old forests will have been felled for timber. This program takes us to Eden on the south coast of N.S.W and Pemberton in W.A in an effort to understand how we can balance our commercial need for a timber industry with our vital need to conserve and protect the environment. Presented by Ruth Hanckel."
