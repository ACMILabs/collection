        "A series of videos examining the changing nature of work in contemporary Australian society and primarily aimed at audiences from non-English speaking backgrounds. In episode 1, \"Improving your skills\", Rosa undertakes English classes to learn to read and write, and in the long term, to be able to take further courses to improve her skills. In \"Finding a career\" Trahn is encouraged by a work friend to learn English and find work similar to the job he left in Vietnam. In \"Looking to the future\" workers on a building site discuss the long-term importance of superannuation."
