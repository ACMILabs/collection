        "Jane Elliott divided her classroom into blue-eyed and brown-eyed children to teach them the degrading effects of discrimination. \"A Class Divided\" shows the result of her teaching on the adults who took her class as children in the 1960's. Her teaching method was so successful that it has been used as a basis for training workshops on racism within the US prison system, and is used by business companies to expose racist attitudes amongst employees and employers. Elliott herself says that the \"necessity for this exercise is a crime. But I think this exercise ought to be taught by every teacher.\""
