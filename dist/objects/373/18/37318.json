        "Set in Tudor London, Edward IV, Price of Wales, is only thirteen years old, yet he is heir to the throne. For amusement, he changes his clothes with Tom, a pauper, who bears an uncanny resemblance to him. Circumstances, however, conspire to turn their childish prank into a dangerous game. Stars Errol Flynn and Claude Rains. Based on the novel by Mark Twain."
