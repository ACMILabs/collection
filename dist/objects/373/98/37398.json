        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Under southern skies\". Host Sue Henckel rekindles her passion for wildflowers while touring through two parks. She also visits artist and philosopher William Ricketts whose sculptures in the 1930's expressed his understanding of the Aborigines' relationship to the environment. She also meets the descendants of the artist's subjects who as commercial artists in the 90's continue to express their relationship to the landscape and plant life."
