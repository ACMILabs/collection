        "After the sinking of Nazi U-boat 37 by the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, six Nazi survivors of the attack reach an Eskimo village and commit every sort of crime in their effort to reach the neutral territory of the U.S. This is an important and effective example of propaganda films. Cast includes Laurence Olivier, Leslie Howard, Raymond Massey and Glynis Johns."
