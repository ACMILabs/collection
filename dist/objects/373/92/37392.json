        "Episode number 7 of Series \"A World of Festivals\". Every year since 1606 the town of Ballycastle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland has held the Lammas Fair to which people come to trade, barter and generally have a good time. Originally the fair was set up for the Scottish overlords of the time to trade their horses for black cattle and other goods that they needed. The nearby islanders of Rathlin also participate in the fair by selling seaweed."
