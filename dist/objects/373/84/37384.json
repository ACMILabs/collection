        "In 1986, the world witnessed its worst civil nuclear accident when one of the reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power station exploded during safety exercises. The consequences of that accident confirmed the dangers associated with radiation. Inhabitants of the villages surrounding the Chernobyl zone have been resettled, and the health of many regularly monitored. However, the full impact of this tragedy will only be revealed as illness, death and the long-term environmental consequences are exposed with time."
