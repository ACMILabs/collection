        "This trilogy re-creates the life of New Zealand's prize winning author Janet Frame, based on her visions of herself and her times. The first part 'To the Is-Land' deals with Janet's childhood in Oamaru in the 1930's. Part two 'An Angel at my Table' is an account of her disturbing experiences after being committed to an institution. In the final part 'The Envoy from Mirror City', after an uneasy fellowship with Europe's artistic-set, Janet returns to New Zealand conveying a sense of confidence and hope. Adapted by Laura Jones from the three volumes of Frame's autobiography. Starring Kerry Fox. Cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh."
