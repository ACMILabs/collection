        "A six hour mini-series based on the lives of Sr. Catherine and Sr. Paul who enter the convent in the early 50's. Behind high convent walls, their lives are circumscribed by centuries old traditions, rites and disciplines, yet they must become part of a changing world. For many, their faith will be sufficient to carry them through their personal crisis. In their care are spirited teenagers, schooled in the old creed, yet eager to taste the new freedoms. Starring Brenda Fricker, Sandy Gore, Josephine Byrnes, Lisa Hensley, Naomi Watts and Kym Wilson."
