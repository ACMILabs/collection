        "Considered one of John Ford's finest Westerns, \"She wore a yellow ribbon\" is the epic tale of cavalry life on the harsh American frontier. John Wayne is Captain Brittles, about to retire from the cavalry, but called back by his troops to defend them from the Apache Indians who have declared Holy War on the white man. Only Brittles has enough knowledge of Apache life to devise a strategy which will prevent a bloody massacre. The stunning locations are in Monument Valley and the cinematography won an Academy Award for Winton C. Hoch. Also starring John Agar, Joanne Dru, Victor McLaglen and Ben Johnson."
