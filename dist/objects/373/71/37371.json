        "An adaptation of the Morris West novel, set in spectacular scenery in the Northern Territory. John Stanton plays a station-master, whose inland journey involves him in a nightmare of violence, intrigue, tribal law and double-dealing. Directed by Burstall in his usual purple manner: plenty of gore, sex and colourful scenery. Cast includes John Stanton, Rebecca Gilling and Ivor Kants."
