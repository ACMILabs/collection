        "Episode 7, \"Paying tax\", follows a group of employed and unemployed young people to illustrate how the Australian taxation system works. In \"Working together\" workers and employers at a car factory find that co- operation and dialogue can go a long way in removing problems between staff and management. In episode 9, \"Reading and writing\", we discover that problems in effective communication and literacy are common and often the reason for poor work performance."
