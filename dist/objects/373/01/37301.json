        "Cary Grant is an absent-minded zoology professor who needs one million dollars for his nature museum. Katharine Hepburn, in her first foray into real comedy, is an heiress who is determined to get him the money, and to win his heart. However, first she must get him to drop his fiance, find his dinosaur bone which she has lost, and convince him to look after her pet leopard named Baby. An outstanding, fast-paced comedy and one of Howard Hawk's most loved films."
