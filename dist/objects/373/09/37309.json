        "A leading American screenwriter arrives in London in the mid-50's to make a new life. Back in Hollywood, a famous movie star shoots himself. The link between these involves a girl and a history - that of the McCarthy witch hunts and the careers they destroyed. Asa Kaufman (Ron Silver) finds work writing a Robin Hood serial in the eccentric world of Britain's new ITV, but he can't escape the psychic and political pressures that drove him into exile. With Daniel J. Travanti."
