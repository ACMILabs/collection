        "Tony Randall plays seven fantastic and magical characters in this imaginative film based on the novel, \"The circus of Dr. Lao\", by Charles G. Finney. A mysterious Chinese gentleman, Dr Lao, rides into the western desert town of Abalone. There he sets up a circus in which the townspeople are confronted by physical manifestations of their own fears and desires. With the arrival of Dr Lao the people of Abalone are to change forever. Randall is excellent in all his roles. The film also stars Barbara Eden."
