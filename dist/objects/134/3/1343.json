    "description": [
        "\"Using the signature gridwork of alleyways of Melbourne city as a device to explore alternative representations of scale and space, this time-lapse portrait of Melbourne explores the traffic flows; human, vehicular and meterological. One of the main aims of my artistic research is to explore new ways of perceiving the world we inhabit. By using machines to work outside of 'realtime' I hope to expose new modes of perception and uncover new forms of spatio/temporal representation. To this end I have developed systems for the control and manipulation of both spatial and temporal 'camera' positioning. Accurate and repeatable motion control combined with non linear frame capture and sophisticated digital post production provide the freedom to explore alternative visual representations of space/time, isolating and exaggerating the interwoven physical variables that construct perspective and motion.\" Daniel Crooks, 2004"
