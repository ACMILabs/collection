        "During the World Economic Forum (WEF) held in Melbourne in September 2000, a group of protesters went to the Herald Sun newspaper to voice their concern the paper's exceptionally biased coverage of the protests outside the WEF. Screened as a news story for SKA TV's Access News, a grass-roots alternative to mainstream news and current affairs, broadcast weekly on Melbourne's Community Television station Channel 31 since 1994."
