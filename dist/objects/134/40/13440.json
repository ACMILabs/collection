        "A tour through a newly-independent East Timor"

    "description": [
        "Report on a group of performers and activists who stowed away on a UN flight bound for East Timor to raise awareness of the plight of the Falintil people and their 20 year struggle against the East Timorese military. A tour through a newly-independent East Timor, still shell-shocked and facing an uncertain future. This story examines the possibilities for and obstacles to building a democratic nation. Produced as a news story for SKA TV's Access News, a grass-roots alternative to mainstream news and current affairs, broadcast weekly on Melbourne's Community Television station Channel 31 since 1994."
