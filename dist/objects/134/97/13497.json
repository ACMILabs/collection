        "Clive \"Bidja\" Atkinson reminisces about his childhood, firstly in the Goulburn River region and then later in Echuca. He speaks of his love for the land and the Murray River and of his respect for the Yorta Yorta culture that has been passed on to him by his family. Clive became the first Koorie in Victoria to obtain a qualification in graphic design but no matter where his travels will take him, Clive will always return to the land of his mother."
