        "A report on the concerns over the private toll road which was built at the expense of over 2 hectares of public parkland in inner Sydney. Hundreds of Sydney residents take over the streets to protest car-dominated public space and offer a vision of urban sustainability. Their celebration is met with a brutal police response. Produced as a news story for SKA TV's Access News, a grass-roots alternative to mainstream news and current affairs, broadcast weekly on Melbourne's Community Television station Channel 31 since 1994."
