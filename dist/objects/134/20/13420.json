        "A report on the environmental damage that the Western Mining Corporation is causing to the Arabunna people by the siphoning of 42 million litres of water a day from the Great Artesian Basin. The world's largest uranium mine is located at Roxby Downs in South Australia. It is owned by multinational mining corporation WMC and is built on Arabunna and Kokotha land. This story follows the nuclear trail from an occupation of a WMC borefield by Arabunna elder Kevin Buzzacott and his supporters to a daring mission by videoactivists into the heart of WMC headquarters in Melbourne, surprising the boss himself.Produced as a news story for SKA TV's Access News, a grass-roots alternative to mainstream news and current affairs, broadcast weekly on Melbourne's Community Television station Channel 31 since 1994."
