        "From the sun, to green plant, to chloroplasts to grana, this film focuses on the basic life-sustaining process of photosynthesis. The approach is experimental: paper, chromatography, variable lights, spectrophotometric analysis and re-creation of the experiments of Theodore Engelmann, and Melvin Calvin illustrate the physics and chemistry of the photosynthetic process."
