        "One of a series of films designed for use in junior social studies classes. Shows how city people get their milk. Opens with scenes on a dairy farm- bringing in the herd, and milking the cows. The milk is taken to a depot, where it is tested for cleanliness, then sent by rail to the city. Here it is pasteurised and bottled then taken by the milk van to be delivered to homes in the city."
