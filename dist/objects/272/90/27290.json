        "Lake Ellesmeer south of Christ Church is a popular breeding ground for many water birds. Every year some 5000 black swans nest on the lake's shores. White swans multiply less prolifically. Mallard ducks, gulls, terns, wading birds including stilts and herons, all inhabit the Ellesmeer district. Canada geese fly down from the hills in December and January for their molting season. As more wet lands are drained these birds are in danger of losing their home."
