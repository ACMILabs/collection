        "This proposed public imaging piece shows a series of close up portraits of domestic objects being burnt to abstraction, creating an inventory of domestic combustion in this piece. Punctuated with subtle yet deliberate, almost mechanised camera moves and cut in a very subdued fashion, this piece will be predominantly shot with a macro lens and will also be given a highly colour saturated visual treatment in post production."
