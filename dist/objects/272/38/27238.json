        "Intrinsic in many great paintings is a sense of movement. Rather than seeming static, the figures appear to be caught in motion. A young Czech animator, Jan Trmal, has taken ten such paintings and by separating their elements has actually set them in motion for a brief time to the music of Gianfranco Maselli, Antonin Vranicky and Johann S. Bach."
