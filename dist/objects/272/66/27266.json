        "Describes the work in laying out a 500 mile long pipeline from new oil-field in West Texas and Mexico to Illinois. Illustrates the difficulties involved and the care with which the work had to be carried out to avoid damage to the pipe itself or its protective wrappings. Includes a shot of the dynamite explosions used to clear a passage for the pipe-line through rock, also unusual machinery developed for specialised tasks."
