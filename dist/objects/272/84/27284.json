        "Confident student docu-drama is a polemical work outlining the benefits of more liberal work farms over traditional prisons. Initial fictional sequence is a brooding and highly stylised play of light and shadow, the mood heightened further by Hoyt S. Curtin's dramatic score. Revolves around the experiences of a young boy is caught by sheriff officers during an attempted burglury. Sentenced to a labour farm, he finds confident and sympathetic supervision and constructive activity that enables him to regain his self respect. In this 'place in the sun' there are no walls or any of the oppressiveness of prison atmosphere. The boy finds, instead, hard work, an opportunity to acquire useful skills, and the knowledge that he can become a useful member of society."
