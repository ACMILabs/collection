        "The problem of maintenance in factories. An over-strained maintenance engineer collapses on the job, and the manager and his deputy set about selecting an assistant, to take over when the first man retires. Three candidates discuss the value of lubrication routine, spare parts in store, scheduling of maintenance, job cards and records, cost analysis, staff conferences and other factors. Underlying policy questions and personal attitudes come up in the course of the interviews and flashbacks to situations on the job."
