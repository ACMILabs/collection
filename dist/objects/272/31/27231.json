        "Sir Kenneth Clark introduces paintings by the Spanish painter Pable Picasso. Filmed in the Tate Gallery, London, where the paintings are displayed in chronological order, we see how, as he matured, his approach changed. From 30 selected paintings, Sir Kenneth shows Picasso's earliest work, while still in his teens, through various impressionistic works and the great era of his murals to his present works."
