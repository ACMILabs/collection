        "Episode of Series \"Man builds - man destroys\". Human struggle for shelter is as old as the struggle for food. The film examines the problems to be faced in the future of human settlements. How can they be solved in industrialised urban areas like New Zealand, and how different are the requirements of rural areas in a developing country like Indonesia. A significant feature of the film is the on-going comparison between Djkarta and Auckland - with some interesting changes 21 years on."
