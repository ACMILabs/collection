        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television training film\". Deals with the art and techniques of writing film commentaries. Illustrates the best way of making shot lists, timing the words with the pictures, and letting the pictures speak for themselves. Shows the pitfalls of various techniques, how the same pictures can tell a different story with a different commentary and what a skilful writer can do. Ends in the dubbing theatre with commentary, music and effects being recorded to the pictures."
