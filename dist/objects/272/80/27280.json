        "Whitehall, connecting Trafalgar Square with the Houses of Parliament, is a street steeped in tradition. Horse Guards Parade, the Cenotaph, the Foreign Office, the Admiralty and at either end Big Ben and the Whitehall Theatre are its landmarks. Lord Mancroft tells the story of this famous street down which he has so often walked during his distinguished career as politician and statesman."
