        "Ansel Adams, American photographer, has achieved a rare degree of harmony between the work for his clients in commerce and industry, his own deep interest in nature and conservation, and his task of making photographs that are works of art. As an introduction to professional photography, for both the novice and the non-photographer, the film presents many original ideas, and gives a high goal to aim for."
