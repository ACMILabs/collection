        "A rugged landscape compounded of vineyards, rocks and mountains forms the province of Rousillon. At Perpignon, carnival festivities with dancing, masks and fireworks, culminate in a solemn Easter procession through the streets. Traces of various cultural influences remain today in the colour of the bullring and the quaint abbey town with rock-hewn walls and narrow streets. This rich variety of life and architecture makes a painters' paradise, as ancient traditions are kept alive."
