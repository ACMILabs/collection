        "An experimental abstract film. Animated sketches form and dissolve to background of music by percussion instruments. Stick figures and leg outlines glide and dance, flit and disintegrate into hail, through which a little girl wends with her umbrella. Occasionally the lively lines weaves into shapes that suggest the background of cymbals and drums."
