        "The life of the German settlers in the Barossa Valley of the Adelaide Hills. Tells of an organist's return to the Barossa Valley after forty years. He goes to the Valley to play for a wedding and as he recognises landmarks en route he recalls the times when, as a young man, he played in the Valley churches on organs designed and built by Lutherans living there. Features Pym Walker."
