        "Philadelphia was originally built as a city of fine homes and buildings, but just as the city and its industries grew, so did the areas of dilapidated housing. Life was a struggle for existence for those unfortunates in the abysmal slums. However with moves under way for urban renewal, new housing will arise where the ruins were. The life a mother leads with her young son and daughter in the slums with their hope for something better in the future is the story line."
