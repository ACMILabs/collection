        "Tells the story of a nin year old girl and her aunt, a young, childless woman, whose marriage has ended. Kathy thinking that Aunt Lois must be lonely without a husband and children, attempts to introduce her to Bill, the handsome man who operates the rides at the amusement park. But Aunt Lois is a woman who stands at the beginning of a new life, and who accepts herself as an autonomous individual, quite capable of living that life fully. Eventually Kathy comes to the conclusion that it does not matter whether her aunt is married or not, whether she has children or not, whether she is the perfect physical idea of the time or not. What does matter is the kind of person Lois is."
