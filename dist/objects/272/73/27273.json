        "Our hero looks forward with great anticipation to enjoying his new swimming pool, only to be thwarted at every turn. The pool becomes a magnet for trespassing children, sailboats, a spaceship complete with astronauts, a thirsty elephant and a ten-car pile-up. In utter frustration, he gives up, fills in the pool and plants a tree - only to be hit on the head by a falling apple. Written by Bruno Bozzetto."
