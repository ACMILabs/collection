        "Interesting documentary on how St Louis' magnificent new metal arch, the Gateway to the West, was built. Designed in a daring and innovative parabola by Eero Saarinen, the arch commemorates the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The arch's construction posed new and unique challenges and this film shows the gradual mastery of the many difficulties."
