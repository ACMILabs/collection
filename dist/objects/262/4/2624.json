        "Marks and Sparks will explore the minute, often subtle, fashion and bodily adornments of cultural resistance. From badges and t-shirts to jewellery, tattoos and haircuts, this will be a clever and often light examination of cultural markings disassociated from the faces and bodies that they adorn. Filmed in and around the streets of Melbourne, each marking will be distinguished by its intention to create a spark of jolt or resistance when worn on the street."
