        "Here is screen magic at its best. Virtuoso stage entertainer Monsieur Pointu (his real name is Paul Cormier, renowned beyond his native Quebec), becomes even more animated through the art of film animation. He and his violin are literally taken apart - head, feet, limbs, various items of stage attire, bow, strings, and box go into their own separate acts, with strange and amusing results. Film without words. (Four awards, including Oscar nomination, Hollywood)"
