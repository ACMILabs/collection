        "A young man, following his first offence, is placed on probation. Members of the public are asked to explain what \"probation\" means to them. A professional probation officer explains that it in fact means \"giving another chance to a person in trouble\". He, along with volunteer probation officers and probationers, explains the work done by volunteers, who sharing interests with the people placed in their care, end up thinking of them as a friend."
