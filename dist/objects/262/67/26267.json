        "This film shows over one hundred infants and their mothers who were studied to try and work out a pattern of behaviour during the baby's feeding. Seven types were noticed within the schema of empathy, control and efficiency. Those mothers who showed positive signs of all of these did best. Many mothers showed little sensitivity to the needs of their babies and this was still obvious a year later."
