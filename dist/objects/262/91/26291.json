        "Episode of Series \"Earth and it's peoples\". This film describes the life and characteristics of the mountain valleys of Switzerland, including the Emmenthal (German), the Engadine (Italian), and western Switzerland (French). All available land is used , being divided for the most part into small holdings of approximately fifteen acres. Water power is a natural resource, providing electricity. Crops vary in each region, as do habits and customs. Co-operatives flourish. We are shown the farm and family life of farmer Hofer, a typical farmer of the region, including glimpses of work and play, in summer and winter; the daily lives of these mountain farmers."
