        "Activity at Sydney's Stock Exchange and ways this activity can affect the man in the street. Includes an investment group meeting to discuss their plans, one of the classes held by the Stock Exchange to explain how the stock market works, and actual buying and selling on the floor of the Exchange. The cameras catch some of the tremendous activity which followed the announcement of the easing of credit restrictions."
