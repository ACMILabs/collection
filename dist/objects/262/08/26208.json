        "Shows Roman coins produced during the 5th century BC and succeeding centuries, depicting the grandeur and fall of Rome and the qualities of its emperors and leaders. The coins show that money was needed everywhere to build colosseums, for state funerals and for negotiations with Africa, Spain and Gallia. It was the Senate that decided to replace the small bronze coins with silver ones. Commentary in Italian."
