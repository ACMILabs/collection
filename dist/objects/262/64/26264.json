        "Years ago all America was the outdoors but only the Indians understood the true beauty of it all. As immigrants built roads, the meaning of the outdoors changed and became more accessible. Now outdoor enjoyment tends to be more organised, but whether it is bike riding in Central Park in New York or walking in the Grand Canyon, all interests can be catered for. \"By being outdoors we all gain a special look at ourselves through Nature\"."
