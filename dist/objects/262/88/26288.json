        "Located in the Western Highlands Province in central mainland Papua New Guinea, Mount Hagen's various regional groups come together to celebrate their cultural heritage at one of the first shows in 1965."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "A mass gathering of highland tribes of diverse customs was indicative of the beginnings of unity and prosperity in Papua and New Guinea. This was the hope expressed by Lord de L'Isle when he declared the Mount Hagen Show open. But it is only the beginning. The response of brightly painted feather bedecked natives to the throb of drums; the incongruousness of their participation in bicycle racing and dodgem cars; the mixed expressions of curiosity and distrust amongst the native spectators, clearly show that the path to change is a long one."
