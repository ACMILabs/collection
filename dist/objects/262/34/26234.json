        "Episode of Series \"Developmental psychology today\". Examines two opposing theories of moral development, that of Lawrence Kohlberg who believes that there are stages of moral development tied to cognitive development, and that of the learning theorists who contend that moral behaviour like all behaviour is learned, and that reasons for actions are irrelevant. Using Dr Stanley Milgrim's famous obedience experiment each of the six stages of moral reasoning is represented in this film, one at a time, by six different participants. The stages differ in the types of reasons a person gives for making a decision about a moral dilemma and in the type of concern the person shows for the self, society, and authority."
