        "Joy is a research biologist, a consultant to a large company. She is also a widow with two school-age children. In discussing her own dilemmas she speaks for many other women. \"The powers that be know that women do work, but they turn a deaf ear.\" Apart from \"discrimination against women,\" Joy sees the absence of universal day care as a loss for children too."
