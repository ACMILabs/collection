        "The pursuit of the utopian dream has no boundaries. Synthetic performance in a synthetic existence. Athlete as guinea pig, sportfields as laboratories. We're all taking something - something to make us happier, stronger, calmer, faster...  Lost in the landscape of delusion and hullucination, super-strength and super-stress, the euphoric wins and unbearable losses - is a 13 year old boy. A boy destroyed by drug technology beyond the control of its administrator, his swimming coach - mentor, father figure and Frankenstein.  Panacea looks at the personal and political world of drugs - their design, use and implications. Liberating constrained definitions for 'drugs'. Panacea will confront a nation's love of sport, the pysche of winning, the media's need for a hero, and the ambiguity of drug taking for medicine, profit or performance."
