        "Greg Mcainsh's 1974 film 'Sharpies' documented a massive gathering of the Melbourne Sharpies at a Lobby Loyde concert. The final black and white short film is an exemplary cultural document of a time, a place and a powerful gathering of cultural resistance. This work uses the original footage and materials to present a silent exploration of the Sharpies at this particular moment in Melbourne's history."
