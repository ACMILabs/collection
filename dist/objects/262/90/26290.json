        "By using animation and models, various events in geological history are re-enacted. The film opens by giving a survey of the evidence scientists have for such interpretations of geological history as are given in this film, and, in the last sequences, mention is made of the importance to engineers and metallurgists of the scientist's ability to interpret past geological history."
