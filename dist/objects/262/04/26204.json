        "A Victorian high school teacher, Gil Freeman, tells of the problems in his present school - a typically old, poor, overcrowded, ill-equipped metropolitan high school, and his approach to teaching in this environment. He finds that teaching higher forms is only a form of cramming necessary for entrance to university or college; with younger forms he has the opportunity to experiment and acknowledge each child's individuality. Also tells of his own background, and includes a meeting of a teachers' association. Commentary by Bill Hannah"
