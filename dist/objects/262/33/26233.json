        "A scout training film showing the patrol system at work. The activities of a patrol, \"The Mopokes\", including a weekly patrol meeting, a patrol outing and a patrol camp. The broadening of the patrol leader's outlook is shown by his trip to a jamboree and his ability to help his patrol by virtue of having gained his 1st Class badge. How the patrol system offers the Scoutmaster the opportunity of developing leadership in boys."
