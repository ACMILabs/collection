        "This film tells how Acari, a town in the interior of Brazil, came to possess a modern Maternity and Child Welfare Clinic. Initially, the clinic was established in a small house, but when UNICEF commenced the distribution of powdered milk, a bigger and better clinic became necessary. For the mothers of Acari, it was a new experience to receive constant care before, during and after the birth of their babies."
