        "An animated film for inclusion in programs of sex education for young people. The subject is venereal disease and the film was produced by young film-makers. The approach is in the form of a cartoon reporting the findings of two students assigned to investigate venereal disease as part of a health studies classroom project. The facts they gather, and convey in this film, are what all young people should know."
