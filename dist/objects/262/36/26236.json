        "Design plays an important part in our lives, and this film has been made to show the remarkable breadth, variety and ingenuity of design which gives colour, form and dimension to everyday life in Scotland. Interviews with Scottish designers who give their opinions on design are mixed with use of design in the manufacture of tapestry, pottery and jewellery and renovation of an ancient castle. Commentary by Magnus Magnusson."
