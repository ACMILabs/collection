        "A ballet choreographed by Anna Sokolow and designed for camera by Shirley Clarke, featuring movements and images physically impossible to perform on stage. Depicts the passion between two lovers who meet in the clouds and move through a world of fantasy. The dancers are Carmela Gutierrez and Paul Sanasardo. Music, Norman Lloyd. Cinematography, Bert and Shirley Clarke. A film without commentary."
