        "The sights, sounds, beauty and rhythm of the ocean are used as a back- ground for various types of surfing from \"hot-dogging\" at Malibu to riding the \"big ones\" in Hawaii. Music, sound effects, colour filters and slow motion capture not only the glamour of the sport, but also its dangers. Without narration, the art, skill, endurance and courage required to face the powerful vagaries of the ocean are conveyed. (Awards: New York; Columbus; Cortina)"
