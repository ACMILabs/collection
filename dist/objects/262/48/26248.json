        "The story behind the morning delivery of milk to some 2 million homes. The milk is transported in bulk from the farms to the depot where the process of pasteurisation and bottling takes place. Tests for fat content and purity are constant through every stage. The nation's health and security are greatly dependent on a reliable supply of fresh pure milk."
