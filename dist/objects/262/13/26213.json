        "Episode of Series \"World in action\". The Mongolian People's Republic which began with the Revolution of 1921, was once domoinated by nomadic herdsmen but today is becoming a self-sufficient, agricultural and industrial nation. Of the one and a half million people, about a quarter live in the capital city of Ulan Bator. Anthropologist Owen Lattimre looks at life in Ulan Bator including cultural activities, horse racing and schooling. Highlights the recognition of women at work, production and education."
