        "A picture of unusual movement, colour and sound, created in a unusual way. It is an example of \"op\" art in film, a play on the retina of the eye. Basis of the film is a single tiny square that divides, eventually forming a colourful mosaic to the animators musical orchestration. (Awards: New York; Melbourne; Buenos Aires; Vancouver.)"
