        "The work and responsibilities of stockbrokers and jobbers in the financial world are revealed to two teenagers, Peter and Susan, who are suddenly transported from the hurly burly of their local market to what they believe to be a \"Champagne and Caviar\" wonderland in the Stock Exchange. However they learn that the people involved are ordinary people, and that without a free Stock Exchange turning shares into money and money into shares at tremendous speed, the whole economy of the country would slow down. Featured also is the pop group The Koobas originating from Liverpool, England."
