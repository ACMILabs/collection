        "Hammy awakens to find that the river outside his house looks as though it were on fire. He decides to investigate, and heads upstream in a motor boat. He is soon engulfed in a white cloud, but the sun breaks through - it is the morning mist. Lost in a strange cave, Hammy is eventually rescued by Roddy and Guinea Pig."
