        "Poet Archibald Lampman describes in verse the dazzling beauty of Quebec's Lievre River as it winds past maple-wooded hills in late September. Every tree is ablaze with colour, and the riot of reds, golds and greens is caught and held in the mirror surfaces of the water. In \"Morning on the Lievre\" you see the river through the poet's eyes. Sole accompaniment is the reading of the poem, and music specially composed. (Awards: Eight including Edinburgh; Boston; Brussels)"
