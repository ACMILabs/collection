        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Man in the Making\". How important is the bond between mother and baby to the future emotional development of the child? Here the latest scientific evidence is examined through experiments with baby rats and monkeys. Experiments on human babies are impossible, but the film shows the effect of depriving babies of mothers or even substitute mothers in cases where this has unfortunately happened. Speakers include: Dr J.A. Ambrose, Dr R.A. Hinde and Dr Seymour Levine."
