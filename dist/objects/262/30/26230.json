        "The moon is still held to influence the earth and the souls of the dead are thought to help catch white whales. On I'lle-aux-Coudres, a small island in the St. Lawrence, the inhabitants (for centuries) trapped white beluga whales by sinking a corral of 3,990 saplings into offshore mud at low tide. After 1920, the practice was abandoned. This is the unrehearsed story of what happened when old-timers of the island were persuaded to revive the practice. Cinematography, Michel Brault, Bernard Gosselin. Narration, Stanley Jackson. Editing, Werner Nold. Sound, Marcel Carriere, Pierre Lemelin. Music, Jean Cousineau, Jean Meunier. (Eight Awards, including Canadian Film Awards; Melbourne; Toronto.)"
