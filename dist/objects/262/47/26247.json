        "An impression of life and opinion in the back streets of a northern industrial city in England, showing the warmth, the vitality and humor. In the early morning the streets are drab and wet but gradually they awaken, to human sounds and movements. The film ends at midday when the children come out of school, their shouts and songs drowning the voices of the old. (Award: Italia)"
