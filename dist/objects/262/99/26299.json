        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Discovery and Experience\". The outside world consists of experiences rather than objects, to the young child. Socialisation of the school child takes place only after a series of explorations and discoveries about being a person. Music, movement, and drama once considered recreational functions, are now regarded as ways of exploring space, time and personality."
