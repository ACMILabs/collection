        "The soil erosion caused by introduced animals in the mountains of New Zealand. The vegetation in the alpine country around the head-waters of the Waitake River has been destoryed by deer, hare and thar. Burning off the natural tussock to create sheep pasture has added to the problem. Erosion and flooding of valley farms has resulted."
