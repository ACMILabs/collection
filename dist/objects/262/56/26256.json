        "Demonstrates the techniques, basic elements, and creative aspects of the mosaic medium. Experiments in tesserae, smalti, and Blenke glass which emphasise the richness in variety of materials and forms. Stresses the possibilities of using new and unusual structural elements - bathroom tiles, buttons, pebbles - and points out how commercially available elements can be used in new ways."
