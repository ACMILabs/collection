        "Reveals the inroads of erosion and desert on South Africa's arable land. Shows how rivers have shrunk, bore-holes failed, and dams become silted up. Shows agricultural experts in the Bantu lands; and earth-moving equipment being used in eroded areas. Asks for the cooperation of all South Africans to \"heal\" their land."
