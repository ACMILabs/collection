        "This film is a survey of Canada in terms of its national air service. Far below a Trans-Canada Airlines (T.C.A.) passenger plane, the new map, a continent wide, unrolls, patterned with high mountains and orchard valleys, prairies with their rectangular grainfields, the Great Lakes and the eastern farmlands. One T.C.A. flight soars over Cleveland and New York; another service crosses Qu\u00e9bec and the Maritimes; while a trans-oceanic air liner heads out across the broad Atlantic. Title and credits missing."
