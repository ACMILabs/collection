        "A survey of the status of women today (1970) and yesterday and of what the future must hold. Women, \"the weaker sex\", it is said, are intended by nature to look decorative, to rear children and to look after their husbands and homes, but they also represent a powerhouse of intelligence, creative energy and practical realism which society needs today more than ever before. Commentator: Rex Keating."
