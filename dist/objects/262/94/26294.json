        "The mountain is Mount Warning in the north-eastern part of New South Wales. Its domain is the warm, colorful scenery of the Tweed and Byron Rivers and Gold Coast region. This tourist film is packed with landscape, but it also dwells upon the people of the north-east who are as important to the region as its climate and natural beauty."
