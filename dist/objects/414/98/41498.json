        "A geographical and physical survey of uncharted land in the Northern Territory by the Royal Australian Survey Corps. Working from a base, parties go inland by road and track, waterways and air. Field parties are set up and radio contact is established. Surveys are carried out with the aid of light aircraft. Work completed, men and equipment are moved to coastal areas by helicopter and ship. On completion of the survey all information is sent back to Headquarters and another area of Australia is put on the map."
