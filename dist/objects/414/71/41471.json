        "From the acclaimed director of \"My life as a dog\", \"What's eating Gilbert Grape?\" is a moving and at times comic portrayal of an unusual family in a small town. Gilbert (Johnny Depp) must keep a vigilant eye on his family, particularly his intellectually disabled younger brother Arnie (Leonardo Di Caprio) and his reclusive mother. When a stranger (Juliette Lewis) comes to town, she not only captures his heart, but also turns his life around."
