        "Episode of Series \"China: unleashing the dragon\". China's emergence as a global economic force and dramatic changes within Chinese life are due largely to the policies instituted under Deng Xiaoping. This program examines Deng's career and the continuing impact of his economic policies. The old style of communism, with its policy of isolation from the West and self-sufficiency, is evolving into a socialist market economy. Joint ventures and foreign investment are becoming popular. The program profiles several such projects and also looks at \"special economic zones\" such as Hainan which have greater autonomy from the central government. Also looks at some of the problems emerging as a result of rapid change and economic growth, such as prostitution, rural poverty, untempered greed and corruption. Narrated by Joan Chen."
