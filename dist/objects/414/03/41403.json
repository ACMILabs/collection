        "A double bill feature. \"Brighton Rock\" written by Graham Greene is a post-war thriller starring Richard Attenborough as Pinkie, a hoodlum. Pinkie marries a young waitress as his alibi for murder, then tries to get rid of her and a rival gang intervenes. \"Eight O'clock walk\" once again stars Attenborough in the title role as a taxi driver falsely accused of the murder of a little girl and his struggle with his wife to prove his innocence. A courtroom drama with excellent performances."
