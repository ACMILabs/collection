        "A young Cuban Communist Party cadre is shocked to find himself pursued by a witty, handsome homosexual. By exploring the friendship that develops between a straight man and a gay man in a culture which forbids open expression of homosexuality, \"Strawberry and Chocolate\" manages to raise important political questions while remaining delightfully comic throughout. The film exposes Cuba's anti-gay laws by showing the important role gay and lesbian revolutionaries, writers and artists played in Cuban culture and examines how political censorship in any context only impoverishes a society. Jorge Perugorria and Vladimir Cruz are excellent as the two friends and Mirta Ibarra steals every scene she is in as a vivacious and sexy Cuban woman who refuses to allow Latin machismo to dictate her life and choices."
