        "This classic Hollywood drama scooped the Oscars in 1945 and it is not surprising. Ray Milland is an alcoholic writer who cannot control his binge drinking. Over a torturous weekend we see how the lure of alcohol has destroyed his confidence, his self-respect and his ambition. As it threatens to eat away at his talent, he comes closer and closer to suicidal despair. From a contemporary perspective the moralistic ending may appear trite but what is undeniable is Billy Wilder's talent at creating a film which seems to visually simulate the terrifying perspective of a drug user's imagination. Milland too is excellent as a man who is unable to reach the goals he sets himself. As a study of writer's block, \"The Lost Weekend\" is both perceptive and illuminating. Jane Wyman appears as his long-suffering lover, however the book's original narrative linked the writer's fear of failure to his ambiguous sexuality. An outstanding film. Based on the book by Charles Jackson."
