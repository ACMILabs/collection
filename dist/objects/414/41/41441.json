        "Episode of Series \"The Great commanders\". Julius Caesar was a brilliant politician and military tactician. He used his power to shape the history of ancient Rome. Massively in debt, he led his armies through a decade of conquest in a bid for wealth, glory and power. Julius conquered not only Gaul but the Celts and Britons. At the Battle of Alesia he won against a force outnumbering him 5 to 1."
