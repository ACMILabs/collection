        "This surreal documentary about animator and director Robert Crumb was partly financed by David Lynch. Crumb was an underground counter-cultural comic artist who confronted taboos by examining sex, drugs and violence in his animated films and comics, most famously in \"Fritz the Cat.\" Crumb has continued to work in his anarchic manner but the collapse of the counterculture led to his increasing alienation and separation from the commercial art world. This documentary is confronting as an intimate study of an eccentric life, but it also reveals much about the nexus between imagination and personality, between family history and present relationships. Sometimes almost brutally naked, \"Crumb\" is an innovative study of a uniquely talented animator and comic. Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival."
