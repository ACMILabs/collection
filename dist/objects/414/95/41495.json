Wicked Queen Gnorga of the Trolls sends Stanley to New York where there is little green growing. He takes refuge in Central Park where he befriends Gus and Rosie. Unfortunately for the trio Queen Gnorga decides to spoil their fun and lets her mischief magic wreak havoc in the Big Apple. With the voices of Dom DeLuise, Cloris Leachman and Hayley Mills."
