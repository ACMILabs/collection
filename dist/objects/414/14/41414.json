        "Part of an award winning trilogy which focuses on war from a humanist rather than a political perspective. The conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina has divided families and friends. The area, once a famous tourist haven has suffered under a terrible war in the '90's. This program looks at two women who have been neighbours for many years; one is Muslim, the other Catholic. Their friendship is under constant strain due to the civil unrest in their village, and yet, though fragile, it continues to endure. Other stories focus on the hardships individuals face during the conflict such as lack of supplies and family seperation."
