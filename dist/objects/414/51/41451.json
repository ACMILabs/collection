        "Episode of Series \"Goosebumps\". Carly Beth is so quiet that people tease and make fun of her. Her tormentors are always playing practical jokes until one Halloween, she finds a spooky mask which makes them run in the opposite direction. The only problem is that Carly Beth refuses to take it off and eventually the mask begins to do strange things to her. A wonderfully spooky story from the popular series written by R.L. Stine."
