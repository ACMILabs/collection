    "description": [
        "Known as \"the Doc\", Evatt was an idealist, internationalist, a lawyer and a politician. He was the only Australian elected as President of the United Nations (1948) and the decisions he handed down as a High Court Judge had lasting effects on the course of Australian political history. Evatt fought to defeat an attempt to ban the Communist Party, only to find that his own party, the Australian Labor Party was deeply divided on the issue and his contentious role in 1950's politics overshadows his many notable achievements. This excellent documentary blends commentary, newsreel footage and interviews with historians, family and public figures to offer a rare and moving insight into the life of one of Australia's most notable political figures."
