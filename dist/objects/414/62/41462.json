        "A science expedition in an isolated Arctic outpost discover that a mysterious craft has landed. Flown to the spot by Air Force Captain Hendry, they uncover a large saucer shaped object from the permafrost. They rescue its passenger, frozen in a block of ice. When it accidentally thaws, a giant humanoid vegetable (James Arness), stronger and swifter than a man, devoid of emotion, asexual and completely merciless is unleashed. The group are forced to defend themselves against the lone alien who plans to colonize Earth with its own kind. This first film about a space monster also happens to be the best. A classic blend of science fiction and horror, loosely based on the story \"Who goes there?\" by John W. Campbell, Jr. with tense direction, excellent performances and an eerie score by Dmitri Tiomkin. Co-starring Margaret Sheridan and Kenneth Tobey."
