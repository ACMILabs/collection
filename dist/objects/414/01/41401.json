        "Based on the Sidney Kingsley play and scripted for the screen by Lillian Hellman, \"Dead end\" is one of the most acclaimed crime films. William Wyler directs the young cast of the Dead End Kids in this film which looks at the New York East Side as a breeding ground for potential criminals. Bogart plays gangster \"Baby Face Martin\", Joel McCrae is Dave, the student architect trying to break free. America in the Depression is vividly portrayed and while the message of the film is less than subtle, the performances are excellent, as is the script. Co-starring Sylvia Sidney as the sensitive, caring sister of one of the boys."
