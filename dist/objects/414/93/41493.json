        "Surrounding the deep forest of Lake Taganyika is a family of chimpanzees which have been studied for over twenty years by naturalist Jane Goodall and filmed by acclaimed wildlife cinematographer Hugo Van Lawick. Narrated by Donald Sutherland, the documentary traces the life of the old mother Flo, her sons, daughters and grandchildren. A fascinating journey into a community of animals who have developed complex social relationships and behaviour patterns."
