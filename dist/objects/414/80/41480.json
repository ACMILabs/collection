        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Ancient lives\". John Romer goes in search of the lost tomb of Herihor, emulating Howard Carter and his discovery of Tut's tomb. He looks at the role of the scribe and in particular one man who collected the ancient coffins of pharoahs whose tombs had been plundered, and reburied them in order to safeguard them. When the plundered tombs were discovered, the Egyptians of the day, sang the funerary songs of their ancient counterparts as the pharoahs and their sarcophagi were taken down the Nile to a final resting place in the Musuem. The program also highlights recent archaeological investigations in the Valley of the Kings."
