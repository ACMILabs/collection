        "Drama student Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) envisions the acting challenge of a lifetime in the desperate predicament of boyfriend Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) who is framed for murder by the flamboyant stage star Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich). To prove Jonathan's innocence, the naive Eve impersonates a maid and works for Charlotte but discovers that where murder is involved, life does not follow a script. Representing the glamour and bitchiness of the theatre, movie legend Marlene Dietrich makes the vain, manipulative Charlotte one of her most colourful characterisations and her rendition of Cole Porter's \"The Laziest gal in town\" is both sexy and provocative. Co-starring Michael Wilding, Richard Todd, Alistair Sim, Sybil Thorndike, Joyce Grenfell and Kay Walsh. Based on a novel by Selwyn Jepson."
