        "After the controversial success of \"Romper Stomper\", Geoffrey Wright's second feature was a critical and commercial failure. However, this story about four young teenagers who find their only joy and exhileration in drag racing, is a mesmerising study of contemporary working class alienation. Set in Melbourne's western suburbs the film is a hyper-kinetic study of the fractures and tensions at play in Australian society. The young cast is excellent as is the editing and cinematography."
