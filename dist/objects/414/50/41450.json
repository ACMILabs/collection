        "Peter Mayle, author of successful children's information books such as \"Where did I come from?\", examines the issue of divorce in an attempt to reassure children about the anxieties they may be facing in their own lives. The program is geared towards making children understand that divorce is not the end of their family; focusing on why couples fall in and out of love; what happens to parents when they separate and how the family must cope with new responsibilities. The program seeks to comfort children who may be blaming themselves for the family breakup. Animated and simply narrated, this program is more suited to middle primary school children and above."
