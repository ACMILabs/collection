        "A behind-the-scenes look at political manouevering during the Mayoral elections for the Leichardt Council. Incumbant Larry Hand, while popular with the voters is not so popular with the Council. In the Mayoral elections, the Council not the citizens vote, so Hand and his opposition engage in a battle of political tactics including calling in favours, backstabbing and media leaks. Gripping real life drama with a knuckle biting climax."
