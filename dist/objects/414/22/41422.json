        "Episode of Series \"China: unleashing the dragon\". Illustrates how changing values and economic pressures are influencing popular culture and traditional values. Profiles a young salesmanager in women's fashion, who is estranged from her family and communist values and compares a female rock singer with a former star of the Peking Opera. The second part of the program looks at some of the pressures on rural families resulting from the new materialism and rapid economic growth. A range of people voice their concerns about the decline of traditions and the danger of losing the soul of China in the rush for economic and social change."
