        "Based on the well-respected novel by South African author, Alan paton, \"Cry the beloved country\" is a film whose simplicity disguises the richness of its humanism. Two very different South Africans; one a wealthy white farmer, and the other a poor black priest, are united in the tragic deaths of their two sons. Despite the social and political realities of their country, the two extend a hand of friendship towards one another, and in that gesture raise the hope of peace and an end to the turmoil in South African society. Poitier, as a young preacher is excellent and Canada Lee gives a restrained but heartwarming performance."
