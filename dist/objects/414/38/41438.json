        "Three women share a car going West and laughs, tears and togetherness unfold along the way. They each have secrets to reveal, strengths to impart and vital moments of self discovery; and their shared friendship subsequently becomes family. Whoopi Goldberg (a wisecracking, lesbian club singer), Mary Louise Parker (a finicky HIV+ real-estate agent) and Drew Barrymore (a free spirit) join forces in this celebration of camaraderie, the art of survival, the gift of laughter and the miracle of friendship and caring by Herbert Ross, the director of The Turning Point and Steel Magnolias. Co-starring Matthew McConaughey, James Remar, Billy Wirth, Anita Gillette, Dennis Boutsikaris, Amy Acquino, Stan Egi and Estelle Parsons."
