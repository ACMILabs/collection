        "In the tradition of 'Akira', 'Ghost in the shell' features excellent animation which will impress. Set in the cyberspace worlds of artificial intelligence and sophisticated computer technology, this violent and complex adventure revolves around a ghostly agent whose job is to determine who is real and who is a cybernetic creation. When a master hacker learns to break into the minds of his victims, the 'Ghost in the shell' must foil his evil attempts."
