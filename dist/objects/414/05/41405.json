        "Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche star in this Louis Malle erotic film about dangerous sexual obsession. Irons, a respected MP, becomes attracted and then involved with his son's fiance Anna. Despite his promising career, his successful marriage to Miranda Richardson and the love he bears for his son, he cannot bear to give Anna up, and they pursue a dangerous affair which ultimately ends in tragedy. Martin, played by Rupert Graves becomes the innocent victim of their deceit. Miranda Richardson gives a strong albeit brief performance, while Leslie Caron makes a cameo appearance as Anna's mother."
