        "Reconstruction of Taiwan began after World War II. For a number of years Taiwan received foreign aid from countries like the United States. These monies were used to develop agricultural and industrial resources. In the 1980's Taiwan was able to assist other countries with foriegn aid but as the country is not a member of key international organizations, it is restricted from doing more. This program examines Taiwan's desire to \"share the fruits of its progress.\""
