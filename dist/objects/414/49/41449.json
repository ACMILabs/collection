        "The purpose of copyright is to protect the intellectual property of writers thus ensuring they are given the renumeration to which they are entitled. This program explains copyright issues such as the function of CAL and why it conducts copying surveys, the importance of copyright protection not only for authors but the whole community and the advantages of a centralised licensing and CAL sampling system. The program uses role play with actors to impart the important message about copyright."
