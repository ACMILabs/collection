        "Episode of Series \"The Great commanders\". Nelson is considered Britain's greatest naval hero. Throughout his early career, he was considered insuboridinate and reckless, but the genius of his miltitary leadership ensured him a place in history. His battles against rival European fleets were unparalleled successes. At the Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson ensured that Britain had mastery of the seas which brought about the subsequent expansion of the British Empire."
