        "Norman Maclean's novel has been brought to life under the skillful direction of Robert Redford and fine performances by Tom Skerrit, Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer. Set in the mountain wilderness of Montana between 1910-1935, the story focuses on the relationship between two brothers. Their upbringing at the hands of their strict missionary father influences the boys to chose different paths. One brother goes down the road to success while the other's path is filled with trouble and heartbreak. The two brothers share little in common except their passion for fly fishing which unites them."
