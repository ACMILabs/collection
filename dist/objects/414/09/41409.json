        "A childless couple, Harry (Edmund O'Brien) and Eve Graham (Joan Fontaine) apply to adopt a child in their home city of San Francisco. The meticulous adoption agent, Mr Jordan (Edmund Gwenn) suspects something is awry and investigates every corner of Harry's life before approving the adoption. He soon discovers that Harry has another life and another wife (Ida Lupino) in Los Angeles. Before Jordan reports Harry to the police he listens to his story. Ida Lupino was one of the few women directors working regularly in Hollywood during the 50's, 60's and 70's. She also produced and wrote for both film and television during this period. Her acting career spanned fifty years from the 1930s to the 1980s."
