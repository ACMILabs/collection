        "This documentary traces the history of Nazism from its earliest roots in 1918 and focuses on the antisemetic nature of its doctrines. The rich cultural, religious and social world of Eastern Europe with its large numbers of Jewish people were destroyed by the evil flames of the Holocaust. The horror of the concentration camps, the bravery of the resistance fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and the Jewish partisans who desperately tried to save their people is documented in this moving analysis of what remains one of the greatest crimes in human history: the deliberate and systematic attempt to exterminate human beings on the grounds of race, colour and religion."
