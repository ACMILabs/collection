        "A memorable tribute to more than 100,000 Canadians who gave their lives in the service of their country on foreign battlegrounds. The film visits battlefields of the first and second World Wars and cemeteries where servicemen are buried. Filmed from Hong Kong to Sicily, this documentary is designed to show Canadians places they have reason to know but may not be able to visit. The footage shot on location by Eugene Boyko is imaginatively intercut with archival footage. Douglas Rain narrates this award winning film scripted by Donald Brittain. Edited by Rex Tasker. (Awards: Columbus, Victoria, Toronto)"
