        "Two girls are born on the same day - one in Poland, the other in France. 25 years later they share the same looks, name and a great musical talent. They also share a potentially fatal heart disease. Though they live a world apart, Veronique and Veronika, (both played by Irene Jacob) are deeply linked in a way that defies explanation. In a mystical twist of fate, these two women will meet in a crowded city square and set in motion a series of dramatic events, ensuring that one must die so that the other can live. French and Polish dialogue with English subtitles."
