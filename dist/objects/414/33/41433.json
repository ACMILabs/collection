        "Sergeant Bernie \"Whistling\" Smith pounds the beat on Vancouver's east side - the hang-out of petty criminals, down-and-outs, and a variety of unsavory characters. His policing is unorthodox. To many a drug user, petty thief, or young woman drawn into prostitution, he is more than the iron hand of the law, he is also counsellor and friend. Here is a revealing insight into one side of big-city life and a tough cop with a big heart."
