        "It is in games many men discover their paradise. Robert Lynd. H.G. Nelson (Greig Pickhaver) and Rampaging Roy Slaven (John Doyle) host an amusing, often hilarious exploration of the fascination of men with balls; whether it is a cricket, football, tennis, basketball, soccer, bowls, table tennis, hockey or golf ball! Celebrities including Ted Whitten, Ron Barassi, Merv Hughes, Derek Kickett, Andrew Gaze, Lindsay Gaze, Francis Awaritife, Brad Mackay, Greg Champion and the average bloke and kid next door share favourite childhood memories of their sporting idols, humerous moments, coaching temperaments, the importance of rules and umpiring, and the incidence of sporting violence. Interviews, archival footage and famous quotes are intermixed in this perceptive program."
