        "In 1959 a group of Australian artists banded together and called themselves the Antipodeans. They were opposed to non-figurative painting and re-asserted the need for recognisable images and the importance of subject mattter and feeling. The artists involved, Arthur Boyd, David Boyd, John Perceval, Charles Blackman, Robert Dickerson, John Brack and Clifton Pugh have their work surveyed in this film which examines the themes explored by the 'antipodeans' with illustrations of their works. Early documentary by Australian feature film director Tim Burstall."
