        "Based on the book \"Lost Moon\" by astronaut Jim Lovell, Ron Howard's film captures the tension and drama of the fated Apollo 13 mission. Less than a year after Neil Armstrong's historic walk on the moon, the American people were losing interest in the mission. However when Apollo 13 blasted off and the words \"Houston, we have a problem\" filtered back, the world was on the edge of their seats as Mission Control worked around the clock to save the three astronauts. If you have ever wondered what it must be like to fly in space, \"Apollo 13\" provides a clear idea. A superb cast including Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kathleen Quinlan and Ed Harris give excellent performances."
