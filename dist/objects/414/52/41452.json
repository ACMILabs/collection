        "Bureaucracy shapes our lives and guides us from the cradle to the grave. This documentary lays bare the idiosyncrasies of bureaucracy whether in Canada, Austria, Hungary, the Vatican, or the Virgin Islands. Looks at the strengths and weaknesses common to all bureaucracies, the importance of paper and written authority, resistance to change, hierarchical organisation, absense of individual accountability. Examines the relationship between the public service and those it serves and the power politics at the top of the hierarchy. It also attempts to make the functioning of public service more comprehensible. The absurdities of bureaucratic behaviour are exposed with humour and irreverence. Written by Donald Brittain, Ronald Blummer and John T. Random. Narrated by Donald Brittain. (Awards: Toronto)"
