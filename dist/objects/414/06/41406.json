        "Barbara Stanwyck again plays the femme fatale, with her usual flair, in this adaptation of Clifford Odets' Broadway play. Mae Doyle returns to Monterey, California, after seeking a life of adventure in the city. Disillusioned and bitter, she forms a relationship with her brother Joe's friend Jerry (Paul Douglas). A quiet fisherman, Jerry is a decent hardworking husband, but Mae is drawn into an illicit affair with her husband's friend Earl Pfeiffer (Robert Ryan). Marilyn Monroe makes a brief but memorable appearance as a young girl. \"Clash by night\" is the age-old story of the \"Eternal Triangle\" where one woman must choose between two men."
