        "A documentary which addresses the issues of homophobia in women's sports. In particular, homophobia is seen as a political tool which is used to control the lucrative sports industry. Interviews with aspiring young women athletes, coaches, administrators and professional athletes such as Zina Garrison-Jackson and Martina Navratilova offer a rare insight into the insidious nature of homophobia and how athletes can confront and deal with the problem."
