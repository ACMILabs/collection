        "Episode of Series \"The Great commanders\". After participating in the Russian Revolution, Georgi Zhukov quickly rose to become Stalin's deputy in the war against Hitler. In the Battle of Berlin, Zhukov's abilities as a military commander turned the tide of the war. His ultimate triumph was victory in the Battle of Berlin which destroyed the Nazi regime. By taking Berlin, Zhukov earned his place in history as one of the greatest commanders of the the 20th Century."
