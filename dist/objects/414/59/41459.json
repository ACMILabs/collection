        "Katie Holmstrom (Loretta Young in an Oscar winning performance) leaves her farm seeking a nursing career in Capitol City. She accepts a ride with sign-painter Adolph Petree, but a car accident forces them to spend a night at a motel while repairs are undertaken. Katie helps pay for damages and arrives in the City penniless. She works as a maid in the Morley household and impresses the Congressman and his family. Morley runs for re-election and wins, but his colleague dies soon after taking office, and the party nominates a political hack named Finley to replace him. Katie is furious, tells off Finley at a rally, drawing so much attention that the rival party drafts her as its darkhorse candidate, building her campaign on her refreshing honesty and openness. However, someone she once helped turns on her and threatens her new position. Co-starring Joseph Cotten, Ethel Barrymore, Charles Bickford and Rose Hobart. Adapted from the play Hulda: Daughter of Parliament by Juhni Tervata."
