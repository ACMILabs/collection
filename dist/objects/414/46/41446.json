        "Sir Percy Blakeney, Baronet, alias \"The Scarlett Pimpernel\" was the literary creation of Baronet Orczy. Sir Percy's escapades during the French Revolution, where he and his band of young English noblemen risk life and limb to rescue the 'aristos' from the clutches of the guillotine, are vividly brought to life in this film made for television. Anthony Andrews is the dashing and elegant Sir Percy, Jane Seymour plays his lovely French wife Marguerite and Ian McKellen is Chauvelin, Sir Percy's arch enemy. The costumes are sumptuous and the dialogue witty."
