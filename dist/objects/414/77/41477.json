        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Ancient lives\". The villagers of Deir El Medina, just outside Thebes, was the home of the Royal Tomb builders and painters of ancient Egypt. John Romer, British archaeologist explains how the villagers' lives fitted into the highly organised Egyptian society. He explores the tombs in the Valley of the Kings and explains how the beautiful wall paintings and carved reliefs were executed and their changed design over time. The program visits Tutankhamun's tomb, the temple of Deir El Medina, the village tomb of Ipy and the tombs of Kha in Turin."
