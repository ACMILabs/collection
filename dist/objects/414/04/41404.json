        "They were sauve, sophisticated and dangerous. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, as Steed and Emma Peel delighted audiences worldwide in the sixties espionage thriller \"The Avengers.\" Two episodes are featured. \"The Town of no return\" shot in black and white in 1965, sees four agents disappear from a small remote village on the Norfolk coast and Steed and Peel are called upon to solve the case. \"From Venus with love\", shot in colour in 1966, sees Steed and Peel in their own version of the \"X-files\" as astronomers are dying with their hair bleached white by an unknown killer."
