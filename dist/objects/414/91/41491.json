        "Rene Levesque and Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Canada's chief political protagonists, are the focus of this two part documentary. Part one covers their early years up to 1967. Using rare photos, newsreel footage and interviews with close political colleagues, the film provides the background to the struggle between the two men and their ideologies. In doing so, it helps to illuminate a great crisis in Canadian history. Awards: Toronto"
