        "The Fugitive, one of the most popular television series of the 1960's was brought to the screen with Harrison Ford playing the role of Doctor Richard Kimble. Kimble, a Chicago surgeon, is falsely accused of murdering his wife. Convicted of the crime, he escapes from custody to pursue an unknown one-armed man, whom he knows is the killer. Hot on his trail is Sam Gerard, US Marshall, (Tommy Lee Jones), who won an Academy Award for this performance. Andrew Davis as director has created a thrilling, action-packed film which moves at a hectic pace towards the final moment when Kimble meets his man."
