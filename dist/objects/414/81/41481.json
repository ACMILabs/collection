        "Daniel is a young actor who, like most of his friends, flits from commercials to stage to television trying to find work. Asked to take on a production of the Passion for a local Church, he finds himself increasingly obsessed with the story of Jesus and his redemption on the Cross. Daniel and the young cast begin to create a retelling of the Passion which resonates with a contemporary audience. However, the radical reworking upsets both the Church and the commercial sponsors who are uncomfortable with the interpretation. \"Jesus of Montreal\" is a sublime and deeply spiritual film. It is to director Denys Arcand's credit that he has not only made a film that is ravishing to look at and experience but one which is not afraid to ask the big, difficult questions about life, faith and meaning. Winner of the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Winner of a Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival."
