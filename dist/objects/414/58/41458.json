        "Episode of Series \"Lonely planet: the experience\". Ian Wright has a great time in Jamaica - dining with rastas on curried goat, diving off the cliffs of Negril, cutting sugar-cane and riding a motorcycle through the Blue Mountains. His journey provides a lively slice of life, both rich and poor, from the polo club to the Easter Carnival in Kingston. There are plenty of ideas and tips for the independent traveller on where to go, what to do and what to watch out for."
