        "An off-beat, devilish black comedy based on the popular stage play by Bill MacIlwraith. Bette Davis rules the roost as the matriach of a most unusual family. The mother of three grown sons, the one-eyed Mrs Taggart is a relentless dominatrix and will stop at nothing to keep her spineless offspring under her thumb. Although the husband she despised has been dead for ten years, she continues to observe her wedding anniversary by insisting that her sons return home for the celebration. However, this year they arrive with something else on their minds - independence from her grasp. Co-starring Sheila Hancock, Jack Hedley, Christian Roberts, James Cossins and Elaine Taylor."
