        "Posing as a Russian count, Stroheim preys on women; regardless of social class or status. Set in Monte Carlo, the subject matter was considered \"repulsive and continental.\" Stroheim, bewitching in his monacle is a satanic seducer intent on possessing the wife of an American diplomat from under his nose. The wife is more than obviously attracted to the Count's fatal charm. \"Foolish wives\" was an expensive production in its day, and the excellence of the sets and costumes, along with Stroheim's masterly direction make it a cinema classic."
