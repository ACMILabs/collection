        "Episode of Series \"The Great commanders\". Ulysses S. Grant had a meteoric rise from working in a store at the start of the Civil War, to commanding the Union Army within four years and then to President of the United States within eight years. The Battle of the Wilderness was a bloody encounter which was significant. Fought in dense forest terrain, it was a tactical stalemate which was a vital strategic victory for Grant which led to the downfall of the Confederacy."
