        "Based on Desmond Morris' book \"Babywatching\", this program provides insight into the behaviour of the smallest human beings - babies. Morris combines his skills as a people watcher and zoologist and addresses questions such as why babies cry, how important is a mother to a baby and why childbirth is so difficult. \"Babywatching\" entertains and informs as well as presenting the world through a baby's eyes. This program has an \"info-tainment\" rather than an academic focus."
