        "Most people would rather have a broken leg than a mental illness. This stigma attached to mental illness often prevents people from seeking help because they feel ashamed of their problem. This program demonstrates how a sensible approach to \"nervous\" disorders can liberate people from fear and restore good health. Through interviews with psychologists, psychiatric staff and patients at St John of God Hospital in Sydney, the program looks at nervous breakdown, trauma from sexual abuse, trauma from suicide, agressive behaviour, depression, substance abuse, agoraphobia and panic attacks. An informative and helpful program for lay people and health professionals, accompanied by guide notes."
