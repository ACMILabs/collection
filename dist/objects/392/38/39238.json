        "The hit of the Cannes Film Festival of 1992 is a spirited, allegorical musical about a young, competitive ballroom dancer who outrages his mother and the \"establishment\" by insisting on dancing his own provocative steps and taking on a new ugly-duckling partner who blooms under his tutelage. Ballet dancer Paul Mercurio shot to fame with this film. He is partnered by Tara Morice and supported by Barry Otto, Gia Carides and Bill Hunter."
