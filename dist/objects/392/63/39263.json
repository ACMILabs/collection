        "It started in Greece In this program Sol Garfunkel looks at the beginnings of mathematics and in particular of geometry and trigonometry, in ancient Greece. In particular he discusses Euclid and his techniques to measure spatial relationships which form the basis of Euclidean geometry. He then moves to discussing how distances can be calculated using triangles, and the discoveries of Thales and Pythagoras, which leads to a discussion of the development of trigonometry and Aristothanes. He concludes with a brief look at non-Euclidean geometries, such as Elliptic geometry and Hyperbolic geometry."
