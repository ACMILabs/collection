        "Narrated by Bob Sessions this is the story of the development of song and dance in the Hollywood film. Concentrating on the performances of the thirties and forties it explores how song and dance routines became more sophisticated with advancements in technology. Most of the emphasis is on the extensive range of clips selected from the films of those decades, featuring such greats as Al Jolson and including early performances by Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Peggy Lee.... Other more surprising performances include Laurel and Hardy, James Cagney and John Wayne! Legendary actresses such as Betty Grable and Yvonne De Carlo show the range of their skills, and Barbara Stanwyck's early singing debut is recorded - in a costume that caused censorship problems in more than one country. The peerless Fred Astaire delights in an energetic orchestral number epitomising the golden era of song and dance. \"Song and Dance\" is a deserving tribute to some great performers."
