        "Episode of Series \"Hancock's half hour\". This video presents three classic shows from the dearly loved \"Hancock's half hour\" television series of the 1950's. 1. \"The Economy drive\": Sid forgets the pre-holiday cancellations, resulting in crates of milk bottles on the doorstep; a bale of papers on the mat; a mountain of bread at the back door and the TV left on throughout the three-month Balkan holiday! 2. \"The Cold\": Hancock coughs and splutters his way through the sixth cold of the winter but none of the medications seem to do the trick. Perhaps it's time for Sid's more robust remedies? 3. \"The Radio ham\": A motor yacht is holed beneath the waterline off the coast of Sierra Leone. The good news is that its desperate messages have been picked up by a keen radio ham in England - the bad news is that it's the lad himself at the receiving end!"
