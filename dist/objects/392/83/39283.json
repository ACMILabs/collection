        "The Royal Opera Chorus and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, conducted by Placido Domingo, appear in this traditional Viennese comedy - the best known and most loved operetta by the King of the waltz, Johann Strauss the younger. Sung in German, with libretto in German and English, but no subtitles. This version has Kiri Te Kanawa as Rosalinde, Hermann Prey as Eisenstein, Hildegard Heichele as Adele and Benjamin Luxon as Falke. Music is directed by Sir Colin Davis."
