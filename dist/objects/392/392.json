    "description": [
        "As regional character disappears and corporate culture homogenizes our surroundings, it's increasingly hard to tell where you are. Landscapes from L.A. to New Jersey, Vancouver to Melbourne, share a strange indeterminate quality. A new Wal-Mart megastore opens, somewhere, every four days. CHAIN is a multi-screen installation in CHAIN, this global, 'superlandscape' sets the mood and serves as mortar for a series of linked narratives and mini-documentaries that will be joined into a unique hybrid feature. CHAIN explores the effects on humans of an altered environment made not only of architecture and geography, but of the shift in economic and social horizons brought on by the increasing commercialism and surveillance that mark the 'Age of Information'.  Cohen was in residence with ACMI during 2000. The idea for this project was developed during his time in residency."
