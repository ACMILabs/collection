        "The Great Karoo stretches for over a quarter of a million miles occupying most of the inner land mass of the Cape Province of South Africa. It was called \"The Great Dry\" by early human inhabitants and its harsh climate with extreme temperatures make it a hostile environment for its animals. From the Black Eagle, to the tiniest mouse, the animals survive. This is an opportunity to explore one of the most arid, but most beautiful environments in the world."
