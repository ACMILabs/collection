        "Episode number 9 of Series \"The Best of British\". All at sea focuses on the fine English tradition for \"messing about in boats.\" This episode explores action on the high sea from intrepid explorers like Columbus to heroes in submarines, as well as those heroic sea sagas and comic \"fun on the ocean waves\" films. \"Film fun\" highlights the visual comedy from Britain's rich source of comedians such as Norman Wisdom, Frankie Howard, Peter Sellers and the Carry On crew who demonstrate the art of immaculate timing and pure visual technique. Narrated by Sir John Mills."
