        "Marlon Brando stars as a G.I., made a paraplegic in combat during WWII. Returning home to face the torturous ordeal of rehabilitation, the courage and strength of the soldier are now betrayed by the fear and insecurity of the man who learns he will never walk again. It is the courage and determination of his fiance, Ellen (Theresa Wright), who, fighting his bitterness, social prejudices and the wishes of her parents, forces him to confront the reality of his condition and come to accept the reality of his disability. In characteristic style Brando prepared for his role by actually living with paraplegics in an effort to better understand their problems and challenges."
