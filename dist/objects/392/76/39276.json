        "Episode of Series \"Hancock's half hour\". This video presents three classic shows from the dearly loved \"Hancock's Half Hour\" television series of the 1950's and 1960's. 1. \"The Blood donor\": Our public-spirited hero decides 'to give so that others may live' and, as with any ordinary bank, Hancock discovers that deposit can be all too quickly followed by sudden withdrawal. 2. \"The Missing page\": A detective story holds Hancock in its cheap thrall. At whom will Johnny Oxford point the accusing finger? But the last page is missing, (\"perhaps someone lit a fag with it\", muses Sid),. So the intrepid pair embark on a hunt for the killer's identity. 3. \"Twelve angry men\": Justice takes a back seat when Sid discovers that jury members who cannot reach agreement receive 30 bob a day during their deliberations. Hancock is the eloquent foreman, haranguing the good men and true with tear-jerking protestations of the accused's innocence."
