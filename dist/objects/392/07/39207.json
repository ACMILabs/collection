        "Set in a hospital awaiting a royal visit to celebrate its 500th anniversary, this film combines black humour with social criticism to expose the misuse of National Health funds. Malcolm McDowell plays a reporter who sneaks into the hospital with a video camera to capture a mad doctor's experiments, from funds meant for socialized medicine, to create Frankenstein creatures."
