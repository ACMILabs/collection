        "The Plank is a classic silent comedy starring Eric Sykes and Arthur Lowe as two builders who find they are missing a floorboard. Untold confusion and mayhem follows as they travel across town with a replacement. Features almost every British comic actoar you can think of. \"Rhubarb rhubarb\" is another of Sykes' comedies without words except for the occasional \"rhubarb\". Eric Sykes is the Police Inspector whose passion in life is golf and, with the help of Jimmy Edwards tries to win no matter how. Bob Todd stars as the Vicar who is the only person left in the golf club who will play with the Inspector, but unfortunately he is a born loser."
