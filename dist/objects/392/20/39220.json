        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Best of British\". Fine and dandy illustrates the fame of British costume dramas in all their lavishness. A wonderfully romantic outcome was the main feature of these films which focused on the purity of love, whether the character was a lusty lord or a defenceless maiden. From malevolent spirits to demonic murderers, benevolent ghosts to spooky fortune tellers, British horror films will have you screaming and laughing in turn. Narrated by Sir John Mills."
