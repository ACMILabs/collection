        "He wears a battered felt hat and a tattered old cardigan instead of a top hat and tails but one glimpse of those agile feet and you know he's Fred Astaire. This exuberant, delightful film is well up to the honour of being his last musical. Based on the 1947 Broadway hit, Fred Astaire plays an Irish rogue with a whimsical economic theory: bury a stolen crock of leprechaun gold in the soil near Fort Knox and stand back! Mixed up in the shenanigans are his spirited daughter (Petula Clark) and love-struck leprechaun (Tommy Steele). Director Francis Ford Coppola skilfully updates the Broadway hit and lovingly show cases its most enduring treasure - the Burton Lane/E.Y. Harburg score. This charming film garnered an Oscar nomination for Musical Direction and includes well-known numbers such as 'If this isn't love', 'How are things in Glocca Morra?', 'Look to the rainbow' and 'Old devil moon'."
