        "Deals with malaria in New Guinea and research to find a cure. The film travels with a medical anthropologist to the rain-forest clad Schrader mountains where the Hagahai people live. The Hagahai people are being treated for malaria and other related infections transmitted through contact with the malaria-rife coast due to new road and air links. Researchers are looking at the way immunity to malaria works while treating people like the Hagahai."
