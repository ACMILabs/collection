        "Hailed by critics as a classic of the American cinema, \"Mister Roberts\" is an adaptation of the smash hit Broadway play about life on a small naval cargo ship floating 'somewhere between the Islands of Tedium and Ennui' in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. Fonda is outstanding as the gentle cargo officer who protects his men from the shop's tyrannical captain, played by James Cagney. Also in the cast is Jack Lemmon in his Academy Award winning role as Ensign Pulver and William Powell as Doc Daneeka."
