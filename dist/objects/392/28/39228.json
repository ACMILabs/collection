        "A superbly crafted drama, a moving tribute to the great jazz musicians who lived and performed in Paris in the late 1950's. Dedicated to the jazz giants, Bud Powell and Lester Young, the film features real-life jazz veteran, the gravel-voiced Dexter Gordon. It dramatises the friendship between an aging jazz saxophonist (Gordon) and a passionate young French admirer who is ready to make personal sacrifices to help his idol. Set to Herbie Hancock's superb Academy Award-winning score, \"Round Midnight\" is an elegant, evocative ode to the free-spirited but technically demanding jazz music which blossomed in post-war Paris."
