        "The Impossible dream is the search for the perfect voting method. This program describes 5 different methods of voting, and dramatises their operation with an election involving five different candidates. Each voting method results in a different candidate being elected, thus demonstrating Kenneth Arrow's impossibility theorem which states that no voting method can satisfy fairness criteria. The voting methods demonstrated are: Plurality method, Plurality with runoff, Sequential runoff, Borda count and the Condorcet method."
