        "Episode of Series \"Sweat of the sun, tears of the moon\". In the sixteenth century, Spanish conquistador, Pissarro, and just 150 men overran the Peruvian Inca empire, an extremely well organised, productive empire stretching 3,000 miles, consisting of over 6 million people. Ultimately, the Spanish invasion resulted in the deaths of 80% of the Incas, with the remaining Incas condemned to serfdom under harsh Spanish landlords. Jack Pizzey visits Peru to discover what it means to be Inca today. In rural areas, he finds their descendants living and farming much as their ancestors had done, but in the cities, he finds a different story with slum-dwelling Indians aspiring to the wealth, possessions and careers of the modern world."
