        "Moving picture show Computers can be used to produce a remarkable range of graphics and this program looks at how these graphics are produced. Pixels are the fundamental unit of computer images, and nothing can be drawn smaller than a pixel, which means that lines can be jagged rather than smooth. We look at anti-aliasing techniques which solve this and algorithms which solve the problems of limited time and memory. We then look at three programs from Symbolics Inc. - \"Geometry\" which creates 3D objects, \"Dynamics\" which moves them and \"Render\" which makes them realistic. Demonstrated techniques include splining, translation, scaling, rotation, texture mapping and opacity."
