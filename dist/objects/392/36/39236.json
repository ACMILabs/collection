        "To clear his name, disgraced city cop Tony Bourke (Jerome Ehlers) is sent to file a report on the \"suicide\" hanging of a local Aborigine in a remote outback gaol. His orders are to clean things up quickly and quietly but, in a town ready to explode with racial tension, Bourke uncovers a web of suspicion and the truth behind a deadly secret. A fast-paced thriller and intriguing and powerful story of conspiracy, cover-up and cold-blooded murder. Features Tony Barry and Bill Hunter."
