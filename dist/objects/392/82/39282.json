        "Thorton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize-winning play was adapted to the screen, bringing to life an array of wonderful characters played by an impressive cast. Set in Grover's Corner, New Hampshire, the typical American small-town of the early 1900's is vividly recreated. Frank Craven as the narrator takes us on a \"peephole\" tour where we are given a simple yet dramatic account of what goes on in the lives of people from childhood to courtship; from birth to death. A young William Holden and Martha Scott in her first screen appearance, are the focal characters. Sam Wood's techniques: a series of dazzling dissolves, evocative lighting and effective montages capture the essence of the period, so much so, that \"Our Town\" has become a cinema classic to be treasured in the hearts of film lovers."
