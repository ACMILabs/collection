        "An affectionate portrait of Port Pirie, the South Australian port and smelting town in which filmmaker, Graham Chase, grew up in the '50s and '60s. This is not merely a sentimental return to the long distant past. Rather, \"Modern Times\" presents an intimate insight into contemporary survival in an industrial town in decline, a story told with a mixture of empathy, scepticism and humour. Through the eyes of the \"mates\" who stayed behind in the town Graham Chase left, we receive a vivid picture of a small community facing an uncertain future as it struggles with new industries, the deadly legacy of lead pollution from the smelters and limited employment prospects."
