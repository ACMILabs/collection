        "Episode of Series \"History of the Motion Picture\". An edited version of Clyde Bruckman and Buster Keaton's 1926 comedy feature, showing Buster Keaton in his most successful period as an actor and director of this satire on Civil War espionage. Combines good examples of Keaton's dry wit and acute sense of timing. This edited work, narrated by Paul Killiam, indicates the significance of 'The General' in film history."
