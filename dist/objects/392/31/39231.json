        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". La Tour is a recently rediscovered painter, whose few works were previously attributed to a variety of painters, from Murillo to Velasquez. This painting fits into the genre of paintings of the early sixteenth century which depicted fortune tellers, gamblers and prostitutes. This program compares the painting to another version of the same painting, explores the symbolism of the painting, La Tour's technique and the historical context."
