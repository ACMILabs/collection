        "Internationally renowned Max von Sydow heads a cast of acclaimed actors, including Carol Drinkwater, Julia Blake and Steve Jacobs, in this powerfully moving film. It tells the story of a family whose lives are shattered when their elderly father is accused of being a Nazi war criminal. Torn between family love and loyalty and the devastating realities of wartime Nazi Germany, all relationships are tested to the limit. Photography by Dan Burstall. AFI Awards were won by Max von Sydow and Julia Blake."
