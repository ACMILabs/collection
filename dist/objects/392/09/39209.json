        "The old inner city suburb of Port Melbourne has been the traditional home for generations of working people whose community is bound by ties of class, church, sport and family. But the cohesion of the neighbourhood is threatened by the pressures of modernisation and an influx of young professionals. Filmmaker, Brian McKenzie, lets the people of \"Port\" tell their own stories in this affectionate portrait of a community who have always felt they \"belonged\" but increasingly find their children are moving away to other suburbs in the struggle for affordable housing."
