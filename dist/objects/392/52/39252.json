        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". David Niven narrates the remarkable story of three year-old Harriet, a female leopard and her relationship with conservationist Billy Arjan Singh, who had raised her from a cub. Returning to the wild of her own accord, Harriet mates with a wild leopard but rears her two cubs in a tree house, built for her by Billy at Tiger Haven, until she moves them back to the jungle after a few weeks. A moving testament to a beautiful and fascinating creature whose natural habitat is being eroded by a land-hungry human population."
