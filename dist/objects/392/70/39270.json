        "In May 1988, Elizabeth died after a long battle with cancer of the liver. She chose to die at home, and this sensitive film documents her decision and the resources and support needed to carry out her wishes with dignity. Not only did Elizabeth decide against dying in a hospital but, in consultation with friends and family, she decided what should happen to her after death. This is not just Elizabeth's story. It is the story of the friends and family who cared for her in dying and grieved for her in death. It is also a story - or rather the stories - of those left behind. A moving account of the elements necessary to make the choice to die at home."
