        "Episode of Series \"Olympic glory: the golden years\". Live through the unforgettable action for the first time the Olympic Flame blazed in the Southern Hemisphere. This program captures the momentous highs and lows Australians were able to savour first hand. It includes footage of the remarkable first, second and third places captured by Australian swimmers in the women's 100m final, headed by the fabulous Dawn Fraser. The explosive confrontation between Hungarian and Russian water polo teams, less than three weeks after the Russian invasion. The pride of Betty Cuthbert's glorious wins in the 100m, 200m and 4 x 100m relay races. Plus all the local magic of a youthful nation hosting the world's premiere sporting competition. Narrated by Norman May."
