        "A selfish, successful lawyer (Peter Gallagher) - whose wife (Andie MacDowell) has been turned off sex is having an affair with his sister-in-law (Laura San Giacomo). He welcomes an old college friend (James Spader) for a visit, not realising the amazing effect that he will have on all of them. A finely honed tale of adultery, impotence and dangerous liaisons. Strong women, weak men; a quartet defined by their erotic impulses and inhibitions. This is Steven Soderbergh's first feature, and it won him Best Film and James Spader Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival in 1989."
