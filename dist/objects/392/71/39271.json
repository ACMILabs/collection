        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". The krater of Heracles and Antaeus describes a famous fight in Greek mythology. It is one of the most beautiful pieces in the Louvre Museum and is signed by Euphronius, a painter whose refined style can be found on numerous objects around 510 B.C. when a pictorial change came to pass. The program describes the krater in detail, explains Athenian ceramic techniques and something of the life of Euphronius."
