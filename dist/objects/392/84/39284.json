        "Episode of Series \"Famous Five\". In \"Five run away together\", the children run away from Kirrin Cottage, when the bad Mrs. Stick, who is looking after them for a week, threatens to lock Timmy in the shed. They escape to Kirrin Island, where all is not as it should be. \"Five have a wonderful time\" introduces us to a snake-charmer called Miss Slither, and a fire-eater called Alfredo. While on their caravanning holiday, the children find that they must enlist the help of these new friends when they uncover a mystery at nearby Faynight's Castle."
