        "In old New South Wales a new batch of convicts arrives including the little convict, young Toby Nelson. Consigned to a Government farm they are subjected to the cruelty of their tyrannical overseers, Sergeant Billy Langden and Corporal Weazel Wesley, finally resulting in the death of the pickpocket, Old Dipper. Toby escapes and flees into the alien Australian bush where he is saved from death by the aboriginal boy Wahroonga. Together with another escapee, highwayman Jack Doolan, and Wahroonga's animal friends, they launch a spectacular mission to rescue the blacksmith Big George and Toby's sister Polly. With Rolf Harris as a storyteller and the magic of live action and animation, this wonderful Australian historical adventure comes joyously to life."
