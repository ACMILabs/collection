        "Francis Ford Coppola's lavish new version of Bram Stoker's classic novel is visually stunning, filled with images of both beauty and horror. James V. Hart's screenplay sticks fairly close to Stoker's novel although costuming and special effects give this film a very definite contemporary feel. Dracula is played brilliantly by Gary Oldman, and his arch-rival Dr. Van Helsing is played by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Also stars Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves."
