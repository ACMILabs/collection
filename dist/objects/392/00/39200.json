        "Five couples find themselves in a Beverley Hills hotel during the week of the Oscars. Four stories blend with an all star cast and the slick writing style of Neil Simon, to produce a comedy about human behaviour in all its variety. Maggie Smith won the Oscar for this 1970's comedy which made the transition from the New York Stage to the big screen. Also stars: Jane Fonda, Alan Alda, Michael Caine, Walter Matthau, Elaine May, Herb Edelman, Denise Galik, Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, Gloria Gifford and Sheila Frazier."
