        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". In this program Theresa M. Amabile demonstrates how to make calculations based on normal distributions and using a Z table. Examples taken from testing for automobile fuel emissions, cholesterol levels and the size of the American soldier, are chosen to illustrate how to compute relative frequencies, how to find percentiles and how to interpret quantile plots."
