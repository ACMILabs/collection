        "Animated interpretation of Oscar Wilde's allegory about selfishness, sharing and love. A beautiful garden is beset by perpetual winter after a greedy giant forbids children to play there. Then he is compelled to help a mysterious child who enters the garden and spring comes. At his life's end the giant is led to another garden by this child."
