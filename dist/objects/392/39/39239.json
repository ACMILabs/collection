        "Italian director Franco Zeffirelli stunned the screen world when he cast two young unknowns to portray the star-crossed lovers. It was a gamble that resulted in one of the most popular motion pictures of our time winning international acclaim and four Academy Award nominations. Filmed in Tuscany and in the palace once owned by the Borgias, the magnificent sets, excellent supporting actors and attractive costumes lend a breathtaking atmosphere to this wonderful film. Starring Olivia Hussey, Leonard Whiting and Michael York with Laurence Olivier narrating. Screenplay by Franco Brusati, Masolino D'Amico and Franco Zeffirelli. Music by Nino Rota."
