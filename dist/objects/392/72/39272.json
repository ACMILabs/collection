        "The Harley-Davidson has legendary status. It has grown from cult appeal to mass appeal. Kids dream about them and grandparents own them. Harley is more than a motorcycle - it's a state of mind. This program is both a history of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a visual feast containing fantastic shots of old, new and limited edition Harleys. Harley enthusiasts will revel in the adoration of their dream-machines, and those interested in the historical development of motor vehicles in society will be fascinated by this tribute to one of the main forms of transport. Harley loyalists run the gamut from celebrities, to librarians, to the guy down the street. Harley-Davidson will always stand for freedom, independence and the open road. Its place in history is assured. It remains, and will forever be a legend."
