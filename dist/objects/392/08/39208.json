        "Inspired by the famous \"Monkey Trial\" of 1925, when a school teacher in Tennessee stood accused of teaching Darwin's theory of evolution, this outstanding courtroom drama embodies the century old debate between Evolutionists and Creationists. The tightly woven script is highlighted by the timeless performances of Spencer Tracy and Fredric March as the defense and prosecution attorneys, Gene Kelly as the cynical, progressive reporter and Dick York as the young teacher."
