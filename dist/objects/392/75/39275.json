        "Episode of Series \"Hancock's half hour\". Three classic episodes from the famous \"Hancock's half hour.\" In \"The Bowmans\", Hancock who has been uncermoniously sacked from the radio serial he is in, comes back with revenge. Hancock and Sid James team together in \"The Two murderers\", and their friendship is put to the test. As the world's worst lawyer, it seems only fitting that Hancock defends his less than trustworthy friend Sid, in \"The Crown v James S\"."
