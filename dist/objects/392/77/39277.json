        "Episode of Series \"Hancock's half hour\". In \"The Bedsitter\", Hancock at his masterly best, conveys the boredom and loneliness of the perpetual bachelor. To kill time, he paces the floor, tries to read and watch television. Even though a phone call prompts him into action, he inevitably ends up the day as he started it - alone! The memories of old friends are often more lasting than the friends themselves, as Hancock discovers in \"The Reunion party\". When a girl makes fun of his nose, Hancock feels that he cannot face life anymore, unless he can find a plastic surgeon."
