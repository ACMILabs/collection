        "Episode of Series \"Take Six\". An investigation of lightning as an arbitrary intervention in people's lives, with devastating consequences. It is made disconcerting by the idiosyncratic combination of the bizarre and the everyday. While the film technique is sophisticated, much of it is very amusing."
