        "Documentary arising out of the 7th International Symposium on Atherosclerosis, held in Melbourne 1985. This documentary examines atherosclerosis and focuses on how it develops, how it may be acquired, and steps that can be taken to reduce the risks of heart disease. The issue of lowering cholesterol by controlling the diet, eating a balanced diet with less fatty and high cholesterol foods and more vegetables and high fibre foods is stressed. Interviews with delegates to the symposium, cardiologists and dietitians are conducted."
