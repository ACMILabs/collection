        "A bus breaks down in the wilderness. Eight elderly women, average age 71, are stranded at a deserted farmhouse. They have only their wits, their memories, and eventually some roasted frogs' legs, to sustain them. Through the long days and nights this remarkable group of strangers share their life stories and exchange intimate thoughts; turning the crisis into a magical time of humour and spirit. Featuring non-professional actors and spontaneous dialogue, this memorable film dissolves the barrier between fiction and reality, weaving a heartwarming tale of friendship and courage. Cast: Cissy Meddings, Mary Meigs, Catherine Roche, Michelle Sweeney, Beth Webber, Alice Diabo, Constance Garneau, Winifred Holden. Script, Gloria Demers, Cynthia Scott, David Wilson and Sally Bochner. Cinematography, David de Volpi. Music, Marie Bernard. Editing, David Wilson."
