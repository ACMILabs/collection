        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". Narrated by Orson Welles this is a description of the Luangwa Valley in Zambia. This is one of the last remaining unspoiled wildlife sanctuaries left in Africa where wild animals still exist in the variety and quantity of the days before the white man and the gun with no poaching, hunting, tourism or exploitation. The reserve contains on of the greatest concentrations of large animals in Africa including an estimated 100,000 elephants, 20,000 each of hippos and crocodiles, as well as great numbers of antelope, giraffe and of course, lions. The valley is also the last stronghold of the notorious Black Rhino said to number at least 4,000. Shot over two years this documentary records the harsh and varied lifestyle of the valley's inhabitants through the seasons. See just how vicious a hippo can be, and how quarrelsome lions really are! The film also sounds a warning about the future of the elephants living in this untouched paradise. They have thrived being unmolested by humans but are in danger of eating themselves into a decline."
