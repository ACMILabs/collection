        "This performance, sung in English, of Franz Lehar's \"The Merry Widow\" was recorded live at the Sydney Opera House, February 23, 1988. The Baron Zeta attempts to obtain the Merry Widow Hanna Glawaris' fortune for his impoverished country of Pontevedria by getting his companion Danilo to marry her. The sub plot deals with the flirtation between Valencienne, Zeta's young wife and Camille, an officer. Features Joan Sutherland, Ronald Stevens and the Australian Opera Chorus. The performance is directed by Lofti Mansouri. Richard Bonynge conducts the Elizabethan Philharmonic Orchestra."
