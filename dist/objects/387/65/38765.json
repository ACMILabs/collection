        "Through a series of interviews with members of Victorian Aboriginal communities, this video gives a broad understanding of the unwritten and undocumented history of Victoria. Issues such as the protection of sites of significance, the return of Aboriginal skeletal remains to their home and the significance of passing on Koorie culture to the young are all raised in this program, which stresses the importance of the Aborigines managing their own land. Accompanied by Teacher's notes."
