        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". In this program Carl Sagan looks at information storage, from genes, to brains, to books. Beginning with whales and their songs, which transmit messages incomprehensible to ourselves, Sagan then looks at the information which is stored in DNA. He then describes the evolution and the structure of the brain and how it stores and transmits information. He concludes with the unique human capacity to store information in books and other media and the message which was launched into outer space on the Voyager spacecrafts."
