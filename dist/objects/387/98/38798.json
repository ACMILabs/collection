        "Episode of Series \"We all have tales\". Narrated by Whoopi Goldberg this African tale is beautifully animated, with illustrations by Reynold Ruffins. Koi, disinherited at the death of his father the chief, is given a Kola tree. He makes the decision to leave the village and go to a place where he will be treated with the respect he deserves. Along the way he befriends a snake, an alligator and an army of ants. Koi with his bag of kola nuts, and with the assistance of his new found animal friends, finds his rightful place in the world. This story is part of a non-violent children's series which celebrates musical and cultural traditions from around the world. Music by Herbie Hancock."
