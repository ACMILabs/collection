        "In the pollution-ridden future, the city of Detroit is crumbling into decay and poverty. The drug-lords have introduced a new drug, Nuke, which is so seductive a majority of the population have become addicted to it. The only solution to the spiralling catastrophe of crime is the superhuman strength of Robocop, the world's most efficient crime-fighting machine. This fast- paced, action-crammed sequel features superb special effects. Stars Peter Weller and Nancy Allen."
