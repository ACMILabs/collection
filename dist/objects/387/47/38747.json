        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Hitler's Germany\". The most urgent problems facing Germany in the 1920's and early 30's were inflation, massive unemployment and political violence. This three part series is about how Adolf Hitler solved these problems and the rise of the Third Reich as told by the people who were there. Part 3, spans the period 1937 to 1941, and examines Hitler's moves to unite Germany and restore its economy through the introduction of \"Labour Camps\" which saw rich and poor working together. Hitler's ambition to make every German in Europe part of his Reich is witnessed. Through the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Poland and France, Germany was now master of Western Europe. With only the East to conquer, Hitler on June 22nd 1941, declared war on Russia."
