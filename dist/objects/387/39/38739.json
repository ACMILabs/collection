        "In the search for energy alternatives to fossil fuels, a number of ways have been discovered to employ the methane rich gas produced from various waste materials. This video explores a number of situations where this valuable resource has been harnessed. These include a municipal land fill tip and a sewage treatment plant. Various aspects of science, technology and society are examined."
