        "An adult and incisively intelligent comedy by Woody Allen. Michael Caine is attracted to his wife's youngest sister (Barbara Hershey), while his wife (Mia Farrow) is still having trouble with her ex-husband (Woody Allen). Juggling an enormous cast, Allen has produced a rich portrait of the contemporary mores of New York's professionals and bourgeoisie. Though tackling similar themes to earlier movies, in \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" Allen develops a stronger emotional tone through his warm celebration of the foibles and struggles of family life. The superb cast also includes Carrie Fisher, Maureen O'Sullivan, Max Van Sydow, Dianne Wiest and Julie Kavner. The jazz score is a stand-out."
