        "A young boy (Fred Savage), bedridden with the flu, is less than thrilled when his grandfather (Peter Falk) arrives to read aloud the book \"The Princess bride\". The story, set in the fairyland kingdom of Florin, recounts the adventures of Buttercup (Robin Wright), the most beautiful woman in the world, and Westley (Cary Elwes), the man she loves. The grandfather promises fencing, chases, escapes, love and miracles. His grandson soon discovers that his adventure story delivers much more. Appearances by Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, Mel Smith and more. Music by Mark Knopfler. Based upon the story by William Goldman."
