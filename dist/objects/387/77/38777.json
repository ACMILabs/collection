        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". All over the world, our ancestors in every culture taught themselves astronomy. Their lives quite literally depended on it. But the journey from the earliest astronomers to the modern day detoured into the pseudo-science of astrology. The last scientific astrologer, was also the first modern astronomer: Johannes Kepler, and this program looks at Kepler's struggle to find a harmony in the heavens, in the process making the critical step which was to move us into the scientific age."
