        "Episode number 22 of Series \"Time to grow\". Part of an open university psychology course. This episode focuses on the cognitive development of teenagers and the often conflicting emotional and physical reactions brought on by adolescence. Physical adolescent development is understood to begin with the maturing of the teenager's reproductive system but there are no clear indicators for the specific cognitive processes brought on by adolescence. As this program shows, the onset of physical and sexual changes, combined with a move away from the family into the social world of peers and abstract education can often lead to confusion and uncertainty for the teenager. At the same time the ability for teenagers to take on responsibility and to begin to think for themselves is one of the most crucial aspects of growth in our society."
