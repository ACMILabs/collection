        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Botanic man\". Using remote locations that physically resemble how the planet must have been millions of years before there was life on earth, David Bellamy tells the story of how the basic chemical elements of the planet were forged into the earliest forms of life. He also describes the significance of the giant supercontinents and how continental drift structured the great land masses we know today."
