        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". What is the origin of the universe? What is its fate? Will it continue to expand forever, or someday collapse upon itself? Carl Sagan explores the time when stars and galaxies began to form, and shows how, in this century, humans discovered the expansion of the universe. He also explores the philosophical and religious questions that these musings create. Topics discussed along the way include galaxies and their many different forms, the Doppler effect, tessaracts, the Big Bang and quasars."
