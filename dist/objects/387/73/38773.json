        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Infinite voyage\". Examines a wide range of imaging techniques and their many and varied applications, such as anthropologists using computer technology to probe the remains of Egyptian mummies to discover previously unknown facts about the health and life-style of these people, or doctors using magnetic imaging to view the brain and other organs to provide treatment without resorting to invasive techniques like exploratory surgery."
