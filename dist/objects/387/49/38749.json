        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Battle for the planet\". Profiles a serious form of air pollution in the West: acid rain particularly addressing the export of air pollution to the Third World as evidenced in Mexico and Brazil. As meaningful attempts seek to solve acid rain in Europe, European and North American corporations are relocating their dirty industries to countries with lower pollution standards. Third World governments admit polluters as they bring the promise of employment and wealth. Examines the impact on the people of Mexico City and the refinery city of Cubatao in Brazil. In both cities 45-50% of the major polluting companies are foreign and have been attracted by weak environmental legislation. In Mexico City, 20 million people, 3 million cars, 100,000 buses and thousands of trucks create an enormous pollution problem. In Cubatao, in the Amazon rainforest forest, air pollution, water pollution and soil degradation are in tragic dimensions with 30% of deaths caused by respiratory problems."
