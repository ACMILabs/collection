        "Two Somerset Maugham novels, which became classic films are here presented on one video. In \"Of human bondage\" Bette Davis made her name as a cheap and vulgar cafe waitress who taunts and ridicules a besotted Leslie Howard, as a crippled professor. Joan Crawford stars in \"Rain\" as the bad girl Sadie Thompson who attracts the fanatic obsessions of a missionary, which leads to her spiritual reformation. Set during an epidemic on South Sea Pago Pago island, the film caused much controversy on its release."
