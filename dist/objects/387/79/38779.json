        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". Mars has fascinated humans for centuries, and become the mythic arena on to which we have projected our earthly hopes and fears. In this program Carl Sagan begins with H. G. Wells' vision of Martians, shows us the telescope through which Lowell studied the \"canals\" on Mars, touches on Robert Goddard's experiments with rockets and looks in depth at the Viking landers and their observational role. He concludes by discussing the possibility of microbiotic life and the potential for future colonisation of \"the Red Planet\"."
