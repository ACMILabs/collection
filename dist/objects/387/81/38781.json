        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". In this episode, Carl Sagan describes man's long exploration of the cosmos as a voyage of self-discovery. His thesis that \"we make our world significant by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers\" is illustrated by man's quest to explain the cosmos through periods of intellectual growth and periods of repression. From our primitive ancestors' ideas of the heavens, through Greek science and philosophy, to the Renaissance, the age of reason and the modern day, Sagan attempts to convey a sense of wonder and excitement about the exploration of the natural universe."
