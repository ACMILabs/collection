An enchanting child, she is sent away to her mother's birth-place on Prince Edward Island when her father's business looks certain to crash. In Avonlea, on the island, she meets many friends and cousins with whom she shares many mischievous and charming adventures. This beautifully photographed film is a delightful family film. Starring Sarah Polley with a special guest appearance by Colleen Dewhurst."
