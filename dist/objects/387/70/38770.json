        "Rainforests are among the Earth's most ancient and diverse natural communities. They are very fragile habitats. In Victoria, rainforests are limited to scattered patches because of previous climatic conditions and the impact of European settlement. The video examines the rainforest theme in three segments: The Living Ark: looks at the ancient link between Australia's rainforests and those in other parts of the world and gives an introduction to life in a rainforest. Rainforest Odyssey: examines the types of rainforest in Victoria and their distribution. A Fragile Heritage: looks at the importance of Victoria's rainforests and factors that threaten their survival."
