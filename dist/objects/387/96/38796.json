        "Episode number 9 of Series \"The Pacific century\". This program looks at American attitudes towards Asia, from 1776 to the present. This is the story of merchants, missionaries and U.S. marines who, however well-intentioned, often saw in Asia what they wanted to see, rather than what was really there. The episode focuses on China and the Philippines, where policies of cold calculation mingled with deep sentiment for the region continue to influence US relations with Asia."
