Anil Agarwal, India's foremost environmentalist, presents this strong case for community involvement in reafforestation to control and wind back the spreading deserts in Third World countries. He takes us into two regions: the Sudan in Africa and the Himalayas in Northern India. In the Sudan, an old man in a small village tells how he remembers when the region was covered in left in the region. In the Himalayas, the famous Chipko movement led by Brother Bhatti has had great success in preventing the further destruction of forests in north India."
