        "In August 1928, in the desert of Central Australia, seven white Australians murdered seventeen members of the Walbiri tribe. The Coniston Massacre, as it became known, was the last large-scale massacre of Aborigines in Australia. This video dramatises the massacre and the subsequent Federal Inquiry, as well as the eventual victory of the Walbiri for the right to return and live where they were born. The cast includes Ray Barrett, Max Gillies and Martin Vaughan. Narrated by Bob Plasto. Teacher's notes accompany the video."
