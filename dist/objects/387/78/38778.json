        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". In this episode Carl Sagan examines comets, their discovery, and the evidence of their relationship with our Earth and other planets. He then moves to Venus, once thought to be the remains of a giant comet, and its hellish atmosphere, down to its broiling surface, which has been created by a greenhouse effect. Concluding with the idea that Venus may be a cautionary tale for our world, Sagan urges a wise and protective stewardship of the fragile blue planet Earth."
