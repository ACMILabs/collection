        "Robyn Williams narrates this history of the Aborigines in Australia and the archaeological discoveries that have pieced together this history. Until the 1960's it was thought that the Aborigines had only been here 10,000 years, but discoveries made since then have pushed this timespan as far back as 50,000 years. The predecessors of the modern Aborigines had a sophisticated culture during the ice age, making Aboriginal culture the longest surviving culture in the world."
