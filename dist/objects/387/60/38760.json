        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Botanic man\". Highlights the problems caused by the development of agriculture, focusing on India with the agricultural revolution in Assam which caused one of the first man-made ecological disasters. As the trees were felled to make way for cultivation, the soil was unprotected and the vital minerals were eroded from the soil by the heavy rainfall. It is an example of a paradox that has plagued almost every one of the developments modern man has achieved."
