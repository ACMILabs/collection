        "Episode number 7 of Series \"The Pacific century\". This program looks at the rise of the South East Asian industrial powers of Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and their rapid rise to the forefront of the world economy. Through portraits and interviews with business leaders and politicians, including Lee Kwan Yew and the chairman of Hyundai, the program grapples with fundamental questions about the role of government in economic growth, and the way rulers and ruled alike have invoked traditional values of loyalty to the state to meet modern economic goals. A study guide and faculty manual are available to accompany this series."
