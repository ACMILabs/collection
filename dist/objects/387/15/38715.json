        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Faces of culture\". For two million years we were hunter-gatherers. For the Bushmen of the Kalahari, it is still the way of life that is best suited to their environment. Women's work counts for 85% of the group's diet. The men provide the meat. The first half of this program covers various peoples around the world who still hunt and gather as the main form of their subsistence. The second half deals with the pastoralists. In semi-arid lands, with little water for crops pastoralism provides an ingenious adaptation to the needs of food production. Instead of hunting prey, it would be collected and protected in herds. Covers Netsilik Eskimos, Tribesmen of Africa's Sudan and Tribesmen of Iran. Narrated by David Carradine."
