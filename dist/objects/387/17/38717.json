        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Faces of culture\". Across the earth can be heard the lilt and cadence of different languages. Each language is a framework for our feelings, our dreams and our wishes. Between three and five thousand languages are known to exist in the world today. Language is the primary vehicle through which culture is shared and transmitted and it is through language that we learn our culture. Various experts speak on this subject. Comparisons are made with the animal world. Touches on basic semantics, body language, and ritual codes. Also includes an interesting discussion on African-American dialect. Narrated by David Carradine."
