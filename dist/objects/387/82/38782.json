        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". In this episode Carl Sagan explores the relationship of space and time. He begins by showing how the shape of the constellations would change over millions of years, as the stars move and evolve, and then launches into a discussion on the speed of light and Einstein's theory of relativity, concluding with the tantalising possibilities of time travel and parallel universes."
