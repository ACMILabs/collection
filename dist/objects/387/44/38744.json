        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Hidden depths\". Psychotherapy, both in groups and singly, offers those suffering from depression a non-drug solution to their problems. In this program sufferers, psychologists and counsellors discuss the causes of depression (low self-esteem, childhood trauma from physical and sexual abuse, loneliness) and the value of psychotherapy and counselling. Professor David Smail outlines the three stages of therapy and stresses the importance of accurately assessing the limitations on resources for change available to each client and an awareness of the potential for client over-dependence on the comfort offered by the therapist."
