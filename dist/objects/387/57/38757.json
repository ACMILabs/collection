        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Botanic man\". New Zealand is botanically unique in that, thanks to continental drift, an enclave of flora and fauna, without large predators and herbivores, is isolated in the South Seas and contains a virtual museum of the early development of land plants. In this program, David Bellamy looks at the adaptation of plant reproductive systems including the role of animal life in terms of pollination and seed dispersal."
