        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Hitler's Germany\". The most urgent problems facing Germany in the 1920's and early 30's were inflation, massive unemployment and political violence. This three part series is about how Adolf Hitler solved these problems and the rise and fall of the Third Reich as told by people who were there. Part 1 spans the period 1933 to 1936, in which Hitler became Chancellor and then President following the death of Hindenberg. Hitler's attack on communism, the development of the Hitler Youth, the takeover of the army by the stormtroopers and the establishment of the infamous SS are examined in this episode."
