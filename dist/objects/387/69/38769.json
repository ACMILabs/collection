        "All Greece's wonders lie 'in the lap of the gods' - the birthplace of European civilisation. Here are the magnificent remains of a bygone era where all the splendour and glory of the past comes to life. Beginning with the fairy-tale Palace of Knossos on the Island of Crete, through the famous Delphi Sanctuary, with its celebrated oracle, and the majesty and serenity of Olympia, to the heights of Athens' Acropolis, we come to understand the search for the perfection of the body and the soul that was the glory of Greece."
