        "A superb cast, including Vincent Price and Jennifer Jones triumph in this Academy Award winning film that tells the story of Bernadette Soubirous, the poverty-stricken, pure-hearted adolescent who saw a vision of a \"Beautiful Lady\" near her home town of Lourdes in 1858. The wondrous news spreads rapidly throughout France, leaving in its wake a variety of consequences. This true story, told with profound sincerity, sensitivity and reverence is both first rate filmmaking and an inspiring tribute to faith, personal courage and the glory of the human spirit."
