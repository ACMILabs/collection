        "Archival material, descendants of Pacific islanders and historian Robert Dansie recall the foundation of misery upon which the Queensland sugar industry was largely built. The institution of indentured labour by Queensland's Governor Bowen and wealthy Queensland pastoralists resulted in a slave trade reminiscent of the southern United States before the American Civil War."
