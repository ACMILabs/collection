        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Hitler's Germany\". The most urgent problems facing Germany in the 1920's and early 30's were inflation, massive unemployment and political violence. This series examines Hitler's solution to these problems and the rise and fall of the Third Reich as told by people who were there. Part 3 is set against the growing nightmare of mass bombing, invasion and finally defeat by the allied forces. The war against Russia brought no triumphs and in 1942 the war came to Germany with constant bombing raids ruining factories and placing heavy demands on medical and food services. We see the 1943 bombing of Hamburg, the retreat and submission of the German army and the final demands of Hitler, leading to 250,000 deaths in an attempt to defend Berlin."
