        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Botanic man\". Botanist and ecologist, David Bellamy, takes us deep into the Amazonian jungle to illustrate the complex ecosystems which have evolved there. The Indians, animals and plants exist in harmony, each dependent on the other in cycles of growth, decay and regrowth. Bellamy stresses the importance of this balance between man and nature and explains the adaptations plants have made in this hot, wet, dense environment to maximise photosynthesis, the by-product of which is the all important oxygen on which our world relies."
