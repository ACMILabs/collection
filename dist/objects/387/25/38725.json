        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Faces of culture\". In many societies, kinship helps to structure the behaviour of an individual. Because most societies organise themselves around kinship lines, anthropologists study these lines in great detail when studying a particular group of people. Covers the matrilineal society of Navaho Indians of North America, the \"Yanamamo\" people of South America (patrilineal) and the Kipseli village on Thera island in Greece. Narrated By David Carradine."
