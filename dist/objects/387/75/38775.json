        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". From the shores of the great ocean of space, Carl Sagan begins his contemplation of the universe. His aim is to find out how we achieved our understanding of the cosmos, how the cosmos shaped us and what is its future. A tour of the universe is followed by a detailed look at the library of Alexandria, where the intellectual adventure which led us into space began. The program concludes with Sagan's \"cosmic calendar\" to make comprehensible the vast expanse of time from the Big Bang to the present."
