        "Young women talk about the damaging effects that cigarettes have had on their lives. This video was produced with the cooperation and involvement of teenagers themselves. They recount their reasons for taking up smoking, the physical, emotional and financial costs of addiction, and their struggles to give up the habit. Never didactic, this straightforward account of tobacco addiction also uses dramatised sequences to explore the ways in which the cigarette industry targets young female smokers. Canadian comedian, Sandra Shamus, appears in the video delivering a monologue on her battle to give up the \"deadly weed\"."
