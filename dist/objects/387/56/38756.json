        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Botanic man\". David Bellamy explores the crucial step in evolution when life emerged from the sea on to the land. The swamps and estuaries of Brunei are the setting for this exploration as the conditions there mirror the conditions where plants and animals took there first steps on to land. He looks in detail at the formation of peat and coal, from the first plants such as pitcher plants and tree ferns storing the sun's energy in cellulose and then only semi-decomposing in the watery conditions of the swamp."
