        "Episode number 21 of Series \"Faces of culture\". The arts are at the heart of man's search for meaning, self-expression and immortality. Every song, dance and work of art provides a reflection of the common beliefs a culture holds, its deepest wishes, its treasured dreams. In most cultures, except modern industrialised societies, where art has become the realm of the specialist, every man or woman is at some time an artist and when the culture dies all that is left are the objects it created. This program looks at societies where art still plays a central role and also at the art of the west and its very different role. Narrated by David Carradine."
