        "Being assertive isn't about speaking loudly or aggressively. It isn't about bullying or winning. It's about standing up for your rights without violating the rights of others. It's about striving to achieve a \"Win-win\" situation. In twenty-two brief episodes we are shown eleven verbal manoeuvres and how to combat them, using four key assertion skills - regaining and holding your ground, being specific, sticking to it, and fielding responses."
