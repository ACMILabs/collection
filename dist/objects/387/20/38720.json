        "A detailed analysis of the Bolshevik revolution that transformed Russian society and which led to the creation of the Soviet Union. The video explores the reasons for the Bolshevik success including their brilliant intellectual base. The widespread opposition to the autocratic rule of the Tsars, and the famine and destruction resulting from Russia's participation in the imperial First World War, also led to wide support for the Bolsheviks amongst the Russian population. The video also examines the pivotal role of Lenin as both theoretician and leader of the Revolution. Includes the use of archival footage of the period."
