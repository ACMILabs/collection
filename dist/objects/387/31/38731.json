        "The AIDS epidemic is one which affects both the heterosexual and homosexual community - and being young isn't a guarantee of immunity, in fact the young are probably one of the most vulnerable groups. Using clever animation, this production broaches the topic of AIDS prevention through the careful use of the condom, the only known way of avoiding the disease.
