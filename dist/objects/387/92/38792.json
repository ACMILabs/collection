        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Pacific century\". This program looks at the peculiar relationship between Japan and the United States that emerged in the wake of World War II. Set to the tunes of big band jazz and including footage of the period never before seen, \"Reinventing Japan\" captures the spirit of a strange era, full of idealism and democracy as well as bitter betrayals, when one country tried to reinvent another in its image - with surprising and unexpected results."
