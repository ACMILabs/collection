        "This very frank and explicit animated video covers many aspects of sexuality in an entertaining and educational way. The program was made in Denmark where they don't 'beat around the bush' on the topic of sex. The program uses a general question and answer approach; answering many questions which may often be asked by young people. It touches on anatomy, sexuality, hygiene, contraception, AIDS and STD's, condoms, orgasms, homosexuality, relationships, masturbation, just to name a few. WARNING: THE MATERIAL IS VISUALLY EXPLICIT."
