        "Winona Ryder plays a strict Catholic schoolgirl growing up in the conservative early sixties and saddled with the grooviest and sexiest mother in town. A very funny romantic comedy, \"Mermaids\" celebrates the tensions, love and agonies of mother-daughter relationships. With Bob Hoskins and featuring an outstanding performance by Cher as the free-spirited mother of a very unconventional family. Based on the book by Patty Dann."
