        "A refreshing fast paced pastiche of rap, drama animation and interviews. This program dispels many of the popular myths about AIDS and HIV and presents the facts impartially, but also at times with a touch of humour. The main emphasis is on preventative behaviour and includes not only information about safe sex and needle sharing, but focuses on the issue of personal responsibility and making the right choices. Includes moving interviews with AIDS sufferers, high school students and a guest appearance by Pat Mastroianni (Joey) from Degrassi High."
