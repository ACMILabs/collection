        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Faces of culture\". This program covers the invention of food production, horticulture and agriculture. Notions of property and ownership came about due to the advent of horticulture. The domestication of plants brought about a drastic change in our way of life. Covers Melanesian villages where the principle crop is the yam, Cambodia in ancient Angkor where sophisticated irrigation systems were invented. Also covers the use of tools for farming, eg. the use of draught animals and machines, fertiliser and herbicides. Program goes on to compare the modern world, how wheat provides its subsistence and how many of us have lost contact with the land. Narrated by David Carradine."
