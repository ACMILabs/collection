        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Pacific century\". This video looks at how two men - Ho Chi Minh and Sukharno destroyed the myth of western supremacy by tapping into the innate spirit of nationalism which had been repressed in the peoples of Vietnam and Indonesia. The video mixes archival footage, eyewitness accounts and expert commentary to show the roots of the Vietnamese war and the rise of Indonesia as a political power."
