        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Pacific century\". Revolutions often arise from the writings of men of ideas. This program looks at the crucial influence of Lu Xun and Kita Ikki on the Chinese revolution and the revolutionary transformation of Japan into a dominant military and economic power. Lu Xun set out to destroy traditional Chinese culture which he saw as backward, corrupt and complacent and became the greatest Chinese author of the 20th century and a major influence on Mao. Kita Ikki, by contrast sought a return to a pure and traditional spirit of nationalism which led to Japan's imperialism prior to World War II. Rare archival footage, some of which is very distressing, enhances this fascinating program. A study guide and faculty manual is also available."
