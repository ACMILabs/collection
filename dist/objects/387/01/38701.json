        "A Donald Duck cartoon made at the peak of the series' popularity, and an outstanding use of the medium to explore the psychology of guilt. Donald Duck needs money to take his girlfriend, Daisy, to a dance, so he steals his nephews' piggy bank. Tormented by guilt, Donald returns the money before his nephews discover what has happened."
