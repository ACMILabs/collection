        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Pacific century\". Under the reign of the Emperor Meiji (1868-1912) Japan threw off centuries of tradition to become a modern world power. Through a collage of feature films, woodblock prints, photographs, production footage and interviews, \"The Meiji revolution\" tells the dramatic story of a nation that mobilised itself to do, in 44 years, what it took Europe and America from the high Renaissance through the Industrial Revolution, more than two centuries to accomplish. A \"Study guide\" and \"Faculty manual\" are available to accompany this series of videos."
