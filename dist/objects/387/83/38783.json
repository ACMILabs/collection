        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". Carl Sagan explores the infinity of the very small - the atom and the infinity of the very large - the universe. The first half of the program describes the structure of atoms, the mathematics of very large numbers, and the chemical elements. The second part examines how stars are born and die and the phenomena of white dwarves, red giants, supernovae and black holes."
