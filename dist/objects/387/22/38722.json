        "In 1972 a small number of lesbians and gay men held the first Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in Sydney, a then militant solidarity march for gay rights. Over the last two decades the Sydney Gay Mardi Gras has become one of the biggest festivals around the world, attracting hundreds of thousands of international and domestic tourists every year. The film explores the history of the Sydney lesbian and gay community, a community organised around relationships of love, solidarity and pleasure and which is challenging the traditional ways society has understood family, love and commitment. Many of the activists interviewed discuss the changes in gay and lesbian politics over the last twenty years and the changes in the lived experiences of non-heterosexuality."
