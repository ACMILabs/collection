        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Pacific century\". The stereotypical view of Japan today is of a people working in harmony. However this is far from the truth. This program highlights the struggle of the Japanese people to gain basic rights in the workplace, and to find some purpose other than that of making money. The program also looks at how Japan Inc. has been allowed to prosper, partly through the triple alliance of politics, business and the bureaucracy, within Japan, and partly due to mistakes made by the Western world, in particular the United States."
