        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". In this final episode Carl Sagan makes his historic plea for the urgent need of a planetary perspective to meet the madness of the nuclear arms race. He speculates that all civilisations come to a point when the very technological and scientific skill which created them threatens also to destroy them, as in the 5th century when the Alexandrian Library was destroyed through ignorance and fear. Although Sagan's fear of a nuclear holocaust may seem less relevant today, other threats persist, which could be addressed if the Earth were to be seen as one fragile planet in a vast and ancient cosmos."
