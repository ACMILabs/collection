        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". In this episode Carl Sagan tackles the question of the possibilities of life on other planets. In spite of the lack of compelling credible evidence that alien visitors have visited our planet, Sagan demonstrates the probability of life existing elsewhere in the universe, and some of the possible forms this life might take. He also discusses the possibility of interstellar communication and how this might be interpreted, using the example of the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphics by Jean Francois Champollion, posing the notion that the laws of science are a common language, a kind of Rosetta Stone."
