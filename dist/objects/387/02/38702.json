    "description": [
        "Set in the fast-paced world of small-time entertainers looking for the \"big break\", \"Broadway Danny Rose\" is a delightful comedy celebrating the Italian and Jewish roots to the American theatrical tradition. Woody Allen is a struggling manager trying to boost the careers of an eccentric range of comic performers (including balloon \"sculptors\" and singing and dancing psychics). He becomes involved with protecting the girlfriend (Mia Farrow) of one of his \"artists\" who is running from the Mafia. Though set in contemporary New York, Gordon Willis' painterly black and white cinematography evokes the romantic Broadway of the jazz age. The video also includes the Australian student short, \"Tennis Elbow\", an anarchic comedy about making movies, playing tennis and dope-smoking policemen."
