        "Episode of Series \"We all have tales\". Accompanied by the haunting, folksy violin of Jay Ungar, Anjelica Huston tells the classic Washington Irving story of the charming but feckless Rip Van Winkle and his legendary twenty-year nap in the mysterious Catskill Mountains, into which Henry Hudson and his crew had disappeared hundreds of years before whilst exploring the Hudson River."
