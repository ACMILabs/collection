        "This hard-hitting documentary addresses many of the significant problems encountered by today's youth: addiction, violence, pregnancy, AIDS and depression/suicide. \"Teenage crises\" attempts to shake up the notion of teen invincibility by talking to young people who have come through hard times, including Olympic gold medal swimmer Nelson Deibel, an ex-drug addict. Stresses the importance of finding positive role models and being secure enough to make the right choices."
