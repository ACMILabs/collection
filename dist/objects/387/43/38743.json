        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Hidden depths\". Depression is a state where nothing outside is of any interest any longer (Ruley) \"It's like not feeling quite alive\" What exactly is depression? Is it a physical illness or a state of mind? What are the symptoms of depression? Are some people or families more prone to depression than others? Does medication help, or merely prolong the cure? Using the experiences of two depressives, Ruley and John and the opinions of clinical psychologist, Professor David Smail and GP, Dr. Brian Harris, this program attempts to provide some answers on this condition which can affect up to one in four people at some time in their lives."
