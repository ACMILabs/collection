        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Pacific century\". This program traces the current economic and political issues facing China today back to her past history. The thesis of this program is that there has been a long-time balancing act in China between the interior and the coast, between conservatism and isolationism and the openness of the coastal communities. This conflict is still apparent in the conservatism of China's current rulers and the commercial and economic growth of the South."
