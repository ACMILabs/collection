        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". In this episode Carl Sagan follows man's passion to explore, from the Dutch sailors of the seventeenth century to the Voyager project and its rendezvous with Jupiter and its moons in 1979. He compares the change in vision that came with Christian Huygens' study of light and astronomy in the seventeenth century and the impact of the detailed pictures sent back by the Voyager spacecraft on the scientists of today. The video includes a fairly detailed look at Jupiter and its moons and at life in seventeenth century Holland."
