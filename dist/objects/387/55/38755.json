        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Botanic man\". It was in the water that the first forms of life occurred. Primitive plant planktons still exist and play an important part in the complex web of life. In the Peruvian trench, one of the most productive living systems on earth, we see the complete food web in action from microscopic plankton through to anchovy harvesting by man and birds. Written and presented by David Bellamy."
