        "A powerful and moving documentary about a family in search of itself. After 18 years in Australia, photographer Hanh Tran is making his first journey home to Vietnam. It's a dream that has finally come true. Amidst the reunion of tears and laughter, an extraordinary family saga emerges. This film is not only a personal picture of Hanh and his family, but it also about life in contemporary Vietnam - a society in transition."
