        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Hidden depths\". The director of MIND in Camden, Dr. David Hill, outlines the services offered by his drop-in centre for former patients of psychiatric hospitals, emphasising the need to raise self-esteem so that patients can successfully re-enter normal life without suffering from depression. His methods of counselling, as well as those employed by the women running Women's Action for Mental Health, are shown. Both organisations concentrate on encouraging and empowering the depressed person through attentive listening, emotional support and client centred group activities."
