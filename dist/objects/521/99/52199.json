        "From the opening scenes played out under the credits sequence, Abel Ferrara lays bare the central concerns of the this urban drama - the tensions that exist between Italian-Americans and Chinese-Americans. In New York the areas of Little Italy and Chinatown border one another, which means that the situation is rife for incendiary racism and violent interactions between the youths and gangs that proliferate there. Amid this chaos Tony (an Italian-American) and Tyan-Hwa (a Chinese-American) meet and fall in love, despite an overwhelming chorus of objections. Inflaming the situation are vicious territorial gang wars that erupt between various factions. Honour, traditions, ritual and loyalty are key themes elicited by Ferrara as he explores the frissons that arise when love and cultural loyalty come into conflict. There are also the difficulties that exist in relation to gender roles and the generational differences within the clans. It is Tyan-Hwa's brother (and key gang member) who tries to control his sister's movements and desires, much to her chagrin and frustration. This is a powerful film that ably encapsulates the violence and danger of the streets of New York. Cast includes David Caruso."
