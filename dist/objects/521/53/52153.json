        "Larry and Richard have just discovered a fraud and embezzlement scheme that's costing the insurance company they work for millions. Their Mafia connected boss Bernie is behind the crime and invites them for a weekend so he can rub them out. After some major bungling, it's Bernie who ends up dead and Larry and Richard have to convince everyone Bernie is alive. As the tagline states, \"for a corpse, Bernie sure gets around.\" Cast includes Andrew McCarthy, Jonathan Silverman, Catherine Mary Stewart and Terry Kiser."
