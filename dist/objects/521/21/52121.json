        "Bull McCabe (Richard Harris) and his son Tadgh (Sean Bean) have sacrificed their lives for the sake of turning the land of a local widower into a successful field but when she says she wants to sell to the highest bidder at public auction, there is no guarantee that the McCabe's history with the land will guarantee future ownership. Bull's biggest fear that the field will be taken over by an outsider becomes a reality when \"The American\" (Tom Berenger) arrives in their small Irish town. Without any cash or other means at their disposal, the only resistance the McCabes can offer is violence, continuing a trend of tragedy that has dogged the family for years. Brenda Fricker co-stars as Bull's silent and long suffering wife, John Hurt as the simpleton \"Bird\". Set in Ireland in the 1930s and based on the play \"The Field\" by John B. Keane."
