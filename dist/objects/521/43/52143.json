        "Episode of Series \"TheEYE\". Part of a series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain. Martin Creed is one of Britain's most engaging contemporary artists. His self-effacing work reflects an anxiety to communicate in a world already full of too many things. A solo exhibition organised by Southampton City Art Gallery in 2000 provided the first opportunity to reflect on a wide range of Creed's creations, produced over a decade, including sculpture, installations, interventions, statements and also musical compositions performed with his band owada. Much of this work is illustrated here. Creed discusses his uncertainties about making new works and his reluctance to name what he does as 'art'. He also illustrates how simple, ordinary objects, seen in new ways, can suggest often complex and contradictory meanings."
