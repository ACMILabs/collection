        "Described as black comedy \"Harry, he is here to help\" is a taut serial killer thriller, \"Hitchcockian\" in tone. Sergi Lopez plays Harry, a wealthy man of independent means, given to acts of largesse, who runs into an old school chum, Michel, in the lavatory of a service station. Michel, married with three daughters, is in financial straits with a country family retreat that is in essence a money pit. Recalling Michel's juvenile high school poetry, and believing that Michel has lost his artistic drive due to domestic demands, Harry insinuates himself in order to 'fix' Michel's life. Harry, a handsome, sexually avaricious and amiable sociopath, is capable of a seemingly ceaseless slew of deaths in his determination to enable Michel to fulfill artistic aspirations. The friendly fiendish stranger, who poses a threat to the nuclear family, is familiar in cinema, driving such films as \"Strangers on a train\" and \"Fatal attraction\". Moll offers few fresh insights into such narrative ploys other than proffering a spin in regards to Michel's suppressed art, and the homoeroticism of the male lead, as he eliminates the perilous reproducers - the female presence. Cast includes: Laurent Lucas, Sergi Lopez, Mathilde Seigner, Sophie Guillemin, Liliane Rovere, Dominique Rozan."
