        "Episode of Series \"Bonanza\". The Ape (dir. James P. Yarbrough): Hoss befriends Arnie Gurne - a lumbering, disabled, man who knows how to fight. Hoss, respectful of his physical prowess, puts Arnie to work on the farm. His best intentions backfire however when Hoss is accused of harbouring a criminal after Arnie turns on the object of his affection, saloon girl Sharie, and kills her. A posse is set out to capture the misunderstood Gurne. \"The Savage\" (dir. James Neilson): Shoshone Indians kill two fur trappers after they enter a sacred burial ground. Of this tribe, two of them cross over the forbidden stone to find the spirit of White Buffalo Woman to save their ailing tribe. When one of them makes contact with her, they discover she is a flesh and blood white woman, not a spirit, and vow to kidnap her and return to the village exposing her mortality. Adam is injured by Indians protecting the woman and finds himself nursed by White Buffalo Woman with whom he falls in love. Cast includes: Dan Blocker, Michael Landon, Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts."
