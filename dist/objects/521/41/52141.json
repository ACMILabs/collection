        "Two daft Texan brothers, Scooter and Junior, are left bereft and domestically helpless when their dear old Ma dies. They hatch a plan to get a woman to replace her, searching strip bars, and even approaching a prostitute to fulfil the role. When these attempts fail they kidnap DeDe (Tara Chocol), who, due to the sadistic nature of her marriage, decides to stay with them. After DeDe's husband, a Texas Ranger, burns their house down, the brothers rob banks to support the burgeoning family. Junior, who has emotional problems, falls for DeDe whilst Scooter forms an attraction to a bank teller, Margaret, at a local branch they frequent. \"Dirt\" is a black comedy and farce that apes the style and energy of a Coen brothers' film (in particular Raising Arizona) but screenwriter, director and star Michael Covert fails to achieve the same distinctly outlandish tone. Despite some slyly inspired moments, and witty one-liners, Covert ultimately opts for conventional narrative outcomes over his subversive intentions. The film trots out a slew of familiar Texan movie cliches (bigoted and corrupt police, violent husbands, dim-witted simple folk) whilst amid all the darkly themed humour, it attempts to make some salient points about the futility of male violence. Also stars Tracy Fraim, Patrick Warburton and Olivia Rosewood."
