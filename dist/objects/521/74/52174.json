        "In this laconic Australian comedy an immature thirty-something male discovers something of life when he becomes involved with an ailing local lawn bowls club under threat of closure at the hands of mercenary developers. Mick Molloy (who co-wrote the film with brother Richard) plays Jack, a shabby and exploitative ill-mannered oaf, whose interest in being a member of the club begins and ends with the cheap inner-city parking it provides. When the elderly members of the club call upon him to play the game or forfeit his membership, Jack soon learns lessons in humility, a love of the game and respect for his elderly companions. With a broad comic tone, Australian idiosyncrasies (albeit familiar ones) - excessive swearing, drinking, smoking and jokes about the sexuality of octogenarians - abound. The gender roles are well defined; women in charge of baking, whilst mateship and honour are the ideals to which men aspire. Like \"The Castle\" (Rob Sitch, 1997) this film embraces the classic David versus Goliath structure, as the morally sound little man faces an evil corporate developer seeking to undermine a certain spirit and camaraderie of society. Melbourne comedian Judith Lucy plays Nance, a local reporter who becomes concerned for the future of the club and forms a romantic attachment to Jack. Also stars Samuel Johnson."
