        "Fleeing her trailer trash mother, 18 year old Lidda (Kirsten Dunst) calls into a video store to invite a guy she has seen from afar on a road trip with her to Las Vegas. Colonel (Vincent Kartheiser) begrudgingly accompanies her after he is left with no choice when she saves his life. Predictable bickering ensues and the two are destined for romance, especially when circumstance continues to pit them together. Las Vegas is a dazzling, sleazy, drug infested milieu populated by scantily clad women, prostitutes, and is home to Lidda's estranged professional poker playing father (James Caan) with whom she seeks a reunion. In Vegas Lidda and Colonel do what it takes to survive: Colonel with gambling, Lidda with stripping, as they become embroiled in the dangerous world of her father in seeking answers at a crossroad in her life. Cast also includes: Luis Guzman, Robert Miano, Jennifer Gareis, Theresa Russell."
