        "An addition to the anime genre by the makers of \"Ghost in the shell\", \"Jin-Roh\" is based in Japan ten years after World War Two. The cities are racked with fighting between terrorist groups and the police and the despised counter-terrorist unit. The film focuses on one of the counter-terrorists, Fuse, who fails to kill a young female suicide bomber when he has the chance. Fuse's confidence is shaken after the event, however he tries to reintegrate himself into the unit. During this time he decides to try and find out about who the bomber was. In doing so he meets with the sister's bomber who seems to value Fuse's friendship. Behind this, the tension of the police and counter-terrorism unit comes to a head, with Fuse and the girl caught in the middle. The story of little red riding hood is used as a metaphor for many of the characters throughout the film. Fuse is torn apart as he sees visions of himself as one of the wolves, killing the bomber and her sister (who are depicted as little red riding hood). \"Jin-Roh\" keeps the audience in suspense as the story slowly unravels to reveal whether Fuse really is a wolf in human armour."
