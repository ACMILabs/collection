    "description": [
        "Japanese television show from the 1960s, \"The Samurai\", set in 17th century medieval Japan, is about the fortunes of Shintaro, a master swordsman and samurai. His eternal quest is to hunt down his enemies, namely ninjas, who dress in black and are armed with a diverse array of weapons as well as being schooled in the art of hypnotic illusion. This tape, Volume eight, consists of four episodes. \"Dogan the Master ninja\": Only eighty miles separates Lord Sadanobu from his destination. Of the original ten, six of the Iga ninja have died. To assist the remaining ninjas Momocki Genkuro attempts to recruit a fearsome ninja, Dogan, the master of Iga ninja. \"The Stolen case\": Shintaro requests the assistance of Dogan's pupils as does Genkuro. Genjuro convinces Dogan that Shintaro is guilty of murder. \"Wolf ninja\": The three pupils of Dogan join Shintaro. Genkuro recruits the Wolf ninjas to assist his attacks on Sadanobu. \"The Last duel\": Genkuro has one last chance to stop Sadanobu from reaching Kyoto. The ninjas, and their respective leaders, face each other in an almighty showdown. Authentic locations, inventive kung fu action and a wonderful score make \"The Samurai\" an imaginative and fun action series, a clever combination of martial arts, swordplay and magic in a historical setting. Cast includes Koichi Ose and Fuyukichi Maki; original music by Hiroki Ogawa; written by Masaru Igami and Yasushi Kato. Please note, dubbed into English."
