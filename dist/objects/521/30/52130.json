        "Episode of Series \"TheEYE\". Part of a series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain. Richard Wilson is an internationally-renowned sculptor and installation artist who often works on an architectural scale. By turns amusing and disturbing, Wilson's creations are about upsetting our preconceptions of who we are and what kind of world we live in. In this profile, Wilson outlines the genesis and meanings of a selection of key works, including 'Slice of Reality', a 20-metre-high cross-section of 600-ton dredger set in the Thames riverbed near the Millennium Dome. Like this monument to Britain's shipping industry, many of Wilson's works are created for specific places, and he reflects here on this, on the importance of collaboration and on his spectacular performances throughout the 1980s with Paul Burwell and Anne Bean in the Bow Gamelan Ensemble."
