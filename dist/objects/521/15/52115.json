        "This Argentinian/Spanish co-production is a dance film within a dance film which blurs the lines between rehearsal, real life and performance. Set in Buenos Aires, the film's slender plot centres on the creative processes of a womanising, middle-aged director who, whilst recovering from a marriage breakup, decides to make a musical centred on the tango. Bearing a close resemblance to the protagonist in Fellini's \"8 1/2\" the director dwells on his childhood memories, middle-aged regret and wounded heart as he prepares his film. With only the thinnest of narrative threads linking scenes and moments together, the film relies far more heavily on colour, movement and music than on dialogue or characterisation. The bulk of the film is devoted to expertly-choreographed performances which explore both the fictional director's personal demons and moments in Argentinian history. Stunningly photographed by Vittorio Storaro. Cast: Miguel Angel Sola, Cecilia Narova, Mia Maestro, Juan Carlos Copes, Carlos Rivarola. In Spanish with English subtitles."
