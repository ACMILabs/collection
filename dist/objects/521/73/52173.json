        "This Irish documentary plots the legendary musician Shane MacGowan's rise to fame, and infamy, as the lead singer of Irish band \"The Pogues\" and his subsequent dismissal. Along with footage of live performances, video clips and an extended contemporary interview with MacGowan, this documentary also contains illuminating discussions with friends, family, colleagues, and fellow musicians Nick Cave, Philip Chevron, and Paul Simonon from \"The Clash\". Extensive footage from MacGowan's past, in particular performances from the 1970s and 80s, presents an artist influenced by the traditions of Irish music and song, but also spurred on by the anti-establishment ethos and damaging excesses of the Punk Rock movement. Sarah Share presents an honest and compelling portrait of an evidently talented musician whose addiction to drugs and alcohol has seriously impeded his ambition and ability to maintain stability, in life and in his art. Songs featured include: Paddy public enemy No 1, If I should fall from grace with God, Infatuation, Gabrielle, Waxie's dargle, Streams of whiskey, Dirty old town, The Irish rover, Fiesta, A Rainy night in Soho, Fairytale in New York, White city, Summer in Siam, Song with no name, That woman's got me drinking, Haunted and Lonesome highway."
