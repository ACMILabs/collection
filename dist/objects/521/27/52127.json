        "Episode of Series \"TheEYE\". Part of a series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain. This profile of sculptor Anish Kapoor focuses on his extraordinary sculpture 'Marsyas' completed in October 2002. Installed in the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, London, 'Marsyas' is a challenging and overwhelming artwork, a vast red PVC membrane stretched between three massive steel rings. This film follows the making of the work, from the earliest maquettes to the complex installation at Tate. Kapoor comments on each stage of the process, and on the ideas and concerns of his art. Also illustrated are a range of his other sculptures including two recent large-scale works: 'Sky Mirror' and 'Taratantara'."
