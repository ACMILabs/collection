        "In this animated feature, three exuberant teenage friends, Chrissie, Ping and Mac, are ambitious cheerleaders and students at Bay City High School. After a freak accident, and much to their delight, they are transformed into super-heroes obtaining the skills, respectively, of extraordinary strength, X-ray vision and flying. Joining the dynamic trio in their quest to combat the evil-doings of various villains is Adrian, their funky hairdresser and Zeke, a boy who nurses a serious crush on Ping. The girls however don't neglect their cheerleading duties but continue to practise their rigorous routines in readiness for the Bay City cheerleading championships. As head cheerleader, Chrissie is frequently in conflict with her colleague, Star, a wealthy girl who covets Chrissie's status. As the Groove squad learn to comprehend the extent of their powers (which come and go, not always at their behest) they learn the value of working as a team in the spirit of friendship. This film, suitable for children and pitched at teens and pre-teens, has an endearing comic tone that supports the neo-feminist values of 'girl power'."
