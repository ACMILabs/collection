        "Oklahoma cattle baron George Washington (GW) McLintock, feared and respected, is also the eponymous McLintock of McLintock hamlet. He is reputedly afraid of nothing, except his estranged wife Katie (Maureen O'Hara) who has unexpectedly returned from the East Coast to try and convince their daughter Becky (Stefanie Powers) to join her in the city. During the period of separation (and rather close to her return), GW has employed new ranch hand Devlin (Patrick Wayne) who is beginning to enjoy the company of his daughter, as well as Devlin's mother, Louise (Yvonne De Carlo), who will soon be a cause of jealousy for the returned Mrs McLintock. Littered with stereotypes that don't stand the test of time, Wayne and O'Hara have plenty of fun bantering as they did in \"The Quiet man\" and \"Rio Grande\". With plenty of sight gags, the film culminates in an infamous spanking scene in which Wayne places the wet undergarment clad O'Hara on his knee, giving her what he considers to be her dues."
