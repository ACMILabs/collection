        "A satire on the music business, \"Tapeheads\" is about two childhood friends who, after losing their jobs as security guards decide to scam their way into the music video industry. Ivan (John Cusack) is the exuberant friend who is accustomed to getting the more reserved Josh (Tim Robbins) into trouble. Forming Video Aces, Ivan encourages Josh to develop his creativity whilst the business-like Ivan helms the operation. Initially the pair work on a hilarious rapping commercial for a chicken and waffle outlet and a dying man's video-will. Whilst doing the thankless rounds of the production companies, Ivan meets music impresario Mo Fuzz, and after hiring them (on spec) they embark upon their first successful rock music video. From there the irrepressible duo encounter all manner of swindles and mishaps on a twisted route to success. This film tapped into the cultural moment that was the origins of the MTV generation with a fast paced script and rapid editing, but perhaps the filmmakers were ahead of their time because despite its infectious and irreverent humour \"Tapeheads\" was a box-office failure. Cameos includes Weird Al Yankovich, Ted Nugent, Jello Biafra, Junior Walker and Sam Moore."
