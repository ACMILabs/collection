        "French psychological drama starring Charlotte Rampling as Marie Drillon, a woman deeply in love with her husband, Jean, who goes missing one day whilst they are on holiday. The narrative intimately follows Marie's journey as she grieves over her loss. Unable to cope with the difficulties of grief and implications that he may have committed suicide or fled to escape their mundane marriage, she becomes delusional. Despite all evidence to the contrary, the elegant Marie, an English literary professor, continues to behave as if Jean is alive. She converses with him and is even beset by visions of his presence. In an outstanding performance Rampling adroitly conveys Marie's weariness and aging, vanity and disillusionment, sexual needs and stubborn denial about her predicament. Ozon's skill lies in his observation of the everyday - Marie's world is peppered with the trappings of sophistication, with the elegantly muted clothes and tasteful urbane Parisian surrounds - signifiers for Marie's inner lifelessness and crushing grief. Unlike the over the top histrionics of \"Sitcom\" or the gaudy excesses of \"Eight women\", Ozon infuses \"Under the sand\" with a lyrically understated beauty and rare cinematic pathos. Cast includes: Bruno Cremer, Jacques Nolot, Alexandra Stewart, Pierre Vernier, Andree Tainsy and Maya Gaugler. In French with English subtitles."
