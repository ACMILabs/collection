    "description": [
        "American lawyer Paul Sullivan (Brad Dourif), is working in Northern Ireland as part of a group similar to Amnesty International, when he is assassinated by police who claimed that he failed to stop at a road block and was in the company of a suspected terrorist. His fiancee and fellow activist Ingrid Jessner (Frances McDormand) is left shattered. She has a glimmer of hope that justice will prevail after the arrival of British policeman Paul Kerrigan (Brian Cox) who has been sent to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, and the actions of the three men implicated in the deaths: members of the undercover anti terrorist squad, the SSU (Special Support Unit). Kerrigan is initially fearless in his investigation, refusing the protection offered to him by the RUC in an effort to remain impartial to people who may be involved. However, when he uncovers a conspiracy to destabilize the previous Labour government, he is faced with the consequences of disclosing the information. Ken Loach based his film on the Stalker affair - the real life case of senior police official John Stalker, assigned to investigate a killing by British security officials. Stalker was removed from the case amidst speculations that the then Thatcher government was unhappy with his findings. Screenplay by Jim Allen."
