        "Robert Winston presents this series that looks into what it means to be human: the instincts we have and why we behave the way we do. Part one looks at the most basic instinct of all, the one that we are born with - to survive the trials of life. The program looks at studies on human babies utilising the only means they have at their disposal, crying. Our universal fear of snakes and the inability to overcome it is also examined, as well as food cravings, the important role of taste as a life saving sense and adrenalin to the fight or flight response - graphically illustrated through a volunteer who ran with the bulls at Pamplona, rigged up with medical equipment to represent his physical reaction. Winston also spends time talking to a woman completing studies on degrees of disgust and how it relates to instinct."
