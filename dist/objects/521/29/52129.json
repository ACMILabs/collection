        "Episode of Series \"TheEYE\". Part of a series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain. Artists Matthew Dalziel and Louise Scullion have worked together since 1993, based in the remote north east of Scotland. Using photography, video, sculpture, sound and installation, they have created a collection of work that is recognised for its distinctive vision and sensitivity to its context and the environment. The point at which nature and culture intersect is a continuing theme throughout their work. Well known for their site-specific works, which include important public commissions, their art reflects on the primary themes of landscape, evolution, religion and time, and represents a rediscovery of landscape as a means of reflecting on fundamental ideas about the world we live in today. In this profile, Dalziel and Scullion discuss their continuing fascination with timescales and how their work attempts to reflect on the vast gap that exists between the limits of human history and the incomprehensible span of geological processes and creation."
