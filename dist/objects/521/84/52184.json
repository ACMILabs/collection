        "Winning is great and losing feels bad - the desire to succeed can be traced back 3 million years ago where fighting for everything was the only way to survive. The competitive instinct is present in us all, as is the tangible physical response to victory - a natural high. This episode in the \"Human instinct\" series looks at how we assess potential rivals, when to fight and when to stand back, what makes certain people dominant and how behaviour affects perception. Provides footage of experiments involving small children and behaviour patterns. Also touches on the phenomenon of the fear of failure and the fear of damaging our reputation."
