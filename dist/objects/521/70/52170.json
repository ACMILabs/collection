        "Executed on his 21st birthday, Alex Corvis (Eric Mabius) proclaimed his innocence until the end and attributed the horrific murder of his girlfriend to a mystery man with a distinctively scarred arm. Now dead, the former prisoner is brought back to life by a crow who leads Alex to salvation, revenge and justice. Along the way he also gets to save the virtue of several young women imperilled by a corrupt posse of police and investigates a conspiracy theory involving his murdered girlfriend. Thanks to some carefully applied face paint, Alex is unrecogniseable to all who knew him, although don't expect any great scenes of transformation as Alex is content to stay in his prison garb. Moving from one brutal encounter to another, Alex eventually discovers the real killer leaving a body count and bloody trail behind him. Relentlessly and gratuitously violent, this is the third instalment in the million dollar Crow franchise that hit the big screen in 1994, directed by Alex Proyas and starring Brandon Lee in his ill fated last screen performance. Cast also includes William Atherton, Grant Shaud and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe."
