        "Japanese television show from the 1960s, \"The Samurai\", set in 17th century medieval Japan, revolves around the fortunes of Shintaro, a master swordsman and samurai. His eternal quest is hunting down enemies, namely ninjas, who dress in black and are armed with a diverse array of weapons as well as being schooled in the art of hypnotic illusion. This disc, Volume five, consists of three episodes. \"Secret mission to Kyoto\": When a high-ranking minister, Lord Sadanobu, plans a trip to Kyoto, he has a secret mission planned - to foil a conspiracy against the government. Numerous Iga ninja are hired to assassinate Sadanobu before he reaches his destination, led by the fanatical Momocki Genkuro. Against his wishes, Shintaro agrees to protect Sadanobu on his treacherous journey. \"Rocket attack\": The Iga ninjas continue their cunning assaults on Lord Sadanobu and his party. Shintaro remains instrumental in outwitting them. \"The Bribe\": As Sadonubo continues his journey, the ninjas plan to kill him whilst he rests at a remote country inn. An impoverished woman is bribed into assisting them. Two sets of ninjas engage in a furious showdown. Authentic locations, inventive kung fu action and a wonderful score make \"The Samurai\" an imaginative and fun action series, a clever combination of martial arts, swordplay and magic in a historical setting. Cast includes Koichi Ose and Fuyukichi Maki; original music by Hiroki Ogawa; written by Masaru Igami and Yasushi Kato. Please note, dubbed into English."
