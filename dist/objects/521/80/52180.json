        "This highly entertaining, Grammy award-winning video by Mike Nesmith, former member of the 60s band, The Monkees (America's answer to the Beatles) has it all - music, dance, comedy skits, and a cast of thousands! Using satire, nothing in this video is sacred as Nesmith takes a shot at American culture, politics, the Hollywood movie industry and the music industry, game shows, etc etc. Original, clever, witty, \"Elephant parts\" features several of Nesmith's songs (all written, produced and sung by Nesmith) including \"Rio\", \"Cruisin'\", \"Magic\", \"Tonight\" and \"Light\". Contains some b&w scenes."
