        "Two animated and humorous adaptations of fairy tales for children. \"Goldilocks and the three bears\": Goldilocks is a girl from a tropical village, an impish scallywag with an uncompromising attitude, unfazed even when getting others into strife. But when she wanders into a forest she meets a spider, snake and bat, who try to warn her off the three bears that could land her in serious trouble. This amusing and funky short underpins the values of friendship and selflessness. \"The Little mermaid\": Beneath the hustle and bustle of Taipei international trading port, a secret underwater kingdom exists where a mermaid, Princess Mija and her best friend, a starfish named Nuri, live happily under the watchful eye of Queen Hul-muh-ni. At fifteen years of age, Mija's life changes forever when she falls for a human prince and has to choose between love and life in the ocean with her family. Features the voices of Tia Carrere, Margaret Cho, Raven Symone, Alfre Woodard, Jennifer Lewis and Lou Rawls."
