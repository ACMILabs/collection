        "Finding himself in a home for the sons of fallen leftists in the Spanish Civil War, the naive Carlos (Fernando Tielve) discovers the desolate hideaway has more to offer than the ominous unexploded bomb in the centre of the playground. Assigned to the former bed of Santi, he soon encounters a supernatural presence shared by all but mocked with disdain by rival and bully Jaime (Inigo Garces). Meanwhile, Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega) a former resident of the orphanage poses as a janitor and becomes the lover of the headmistress Carmen (Marisa Paredes) to seek out the gold stored for the cause. As the personal history and intimate secrets of the orphanage unravel in front of Carlos' eyes, Del Toro's use of the war as a background serves as a political allegory on both the past and future. Cast also includes Federico Luppi, Irene Visedo."
