        "Set in 1954, post-Korean War, \"Going all the way\" examines the personal choices of two men, both at crossroads, following discharge from the army. Sonny Burns is self-conscious, shy, sexually inexperienced and in awe of his new friend Gunner Casselman who is confident with women, but questioning his former frat-boy ways after experiencing a cultural awakening in Japan. These two men face choices that will affect them for the rest of their lives when they return to their hometown of Indianapolis but find dissatisfaction with their lot. For his part, Sonny is drawn to the sexually lascivious Gail despite his engagement to girl-next door Buddy. Casselman, who becomes interested in modernist art and is drawn to the concepts of Zen Buddhism, is attracted to an independent Jewish girl, despite the anti-Semitic ranting of his over-affectionate mother. As a coming-of-age drama \"Going all the way\" plods a fairly predictable path but manages some impressive flourishes, in particular its 1950s aesthetic, ably captured by cinematographer Bobby Bukowsk, and the performances of Jeremy Davies (Secretary, The Million dollar hotel) and Ben Affleck (Pearl Harbour, Good Will Hunting), the latter emitting appropriate charm. Cast includes: Lesley Ann Warren, Rachel Weisz, Rose McGowan, Jill Clayburgh, Amy Locane."
