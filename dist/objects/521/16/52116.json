        "The premise of writer/director George A. Romero's curious revenge fantasy has timid office worker Henry Creedlow (Jason Flemyng) wake up one day to discover that his face has become a featureless white mask. His new found anonymity gives him a surge of power as he proceeds to wreak revenge on anyone that has done him wrong in the past. Free of moral consequence, Henry finds himself spiralling into a murderous rampage as he attempts to regain some of the authority he lost when he was a disrespected office worker and cuckolded husband. As an examination of white male urban angst, Romero heavily plays the metaphor of the blank mask. This white featureless facade pointedly alludes to the alienated individual whose sense of self has been completely eroded by personal circumstances and general societal mores. Any overt reference to Georges Franju's 1959 eerie horror classic \"Eyes without a face\" (which also featured an outcast character with a blank white mask as a face) remain conspicuously absent as Bruiser aims for more visceral thrills than it's eloquent predecessor. Cast includes: Peter Stormare, Leslie Hope, Nina Garbiras."
