        "Japanese television show from the 1960s, \"The Samurai\", set in 17th century medieval Japan, revolves around the fortunes of Shintaro, a master swordsman and samurai. His eternal quest is hunting down enemies, namely ninjas, who dress in black and are armed with a diverse array of weapons as well as being schooled in the art of hypnotic illusion. This tape, Volume six, consists of three episodes. \"Betrayed by a ninja\": Leading the murderous Iga ninja, Momocki Genkuro uses mind tricks and artful disguise to capture Shintaro. Within the ranks of the ninjas dissent surfaces. Lord Sadanobu and his party settle for the night in a remote castle continuing their important journey to Kyoto. \"A Spy's revenge\": Two ninjas battle it out in a furious display of expertise. Okei, a skilled ninja, blames Shintaro for her brother's death and seeks revenge. \"Poison blade\": Momocki Genkuro, who possesses outstanding powers and skill, confronts Shintaro in the forest. Authentic locations, inventive kung fu action and a wonderful score make \"The Samurai\" an imaginative and fun action series, a clever combination of action, martial arts, swordplay and magic in a historical setting. Cast includes Koichi Ose and Fuyukichi Maki; original music by Hiroki Ogawa; written by Masaru Igami and Yasushi Kato. Please note, dubbed into English."
