        "Irishman Shawn O'Hara (Barry Fitzgerald), a horse trainer with the gift of being able to tell whether a yearling is going to be a winner or not, arrives in Paris, Kentucky, with his niece, Margaret (Shirley Temple) to take up a position at Millford Farms. He is drawn to a horse called Seabiscuit which initially no-one else credits with winning. At the same time a romance slowly blossoms between his niece and jockey Ted Knowles (Lon McCallister). Margaret is reticent at falling in love with a jockey however as she has already lost her brother, also a jockey, when he fell to his death while riding one of Shawn's horses. The incident caused uncle and niece to flee their native Ireland. Written by John Taintor Foote. Music by David Buttolph. Filmed in Technicolor."
