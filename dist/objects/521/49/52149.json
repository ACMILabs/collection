        "Two animated and humorous adaptations of fairy tales for children. \"Mother goose\": When Mother Goose tires of her role as a keeper of fairytales, and of constant criticism from the various characters that pepper fairytale land, she decides to give up her role finding it all too bothersome. With the future of rhyming couplets in jeopardy, the characters (including Jack and Jill, Bo-Peep, the Three little pigs, Humpty Dumpty and Little Miss Muffet) band together in order to affirm their appreciation of her and convince her to stay. \"The Golden goose\": Drexel, Axel and Simpleton are three strapping boys who live with their parents in a small kingdom. The youngest brother, who is regarded as a simpleton by his selfish brothers, is rewarded for his kindness to a wizard (dressed as a beggar) and receives a golden goose, which transforms his fortunes. These amusing shorts have affirmative African-American overtones and underpin the values of friendship, generosity and selflessness. Feature songs by Rockapalla and Salt 'n' pepper and includes the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Heavy D., Jimmy Smits and Denzel Washington. Narrated by Robert Guillaume."
