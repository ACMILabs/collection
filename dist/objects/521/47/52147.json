        "Pinocchio (Gabriel Thomson) and best friend Lampwick (Ben Ridgeway) visit the carnival of Madame Flambeau (Udo Kier) and hear of the miracle elixir that she claims will act as the fountain of youth. On returning home and finding his father Gepetto (Martin Landau) exhausted and unable to complete producing toys, Pinocchio and Lampwick return to the carnival to get some of the elixir. Unbeknownst to Pinocchio, Flambeau knows about the puppet boy's past and wanting to make him part of the show, produces a \"special\" potion. The effects of the elixir aren't as expected and Gepetto and Lampwick are turned into wood. Having agreed to work for Flambeau until the price of the elixir is payed off, Pinocchio and his father are forced to work as an act in the show until they can think of a way to reverse the spell. Set in Luxembourg and featuring puppets created by the Jim Henson Group, \"The New adventures of Pinocchio\" should appeal to adults and children alike."
