        "James Earl Jones presents two previously unscreened \"Twilight zone\" episodes written by Rod Serling and made for television in 1994. \"The Theatre\": Commitment shy theatre technician Melissa goes alone to view Cary Grant's \"His girl Friday\" at the cinema, only to witnesses scenes from her life earlier in the day appearing before her, but no-one else can see what she sees. Leaving the theatre to speak to her partner whom she believes has set up the stunt, she returns to the movie theatre having spoken to him who declined the claim, only to find the last 30 minutes of her life projected on the screen also, some of which present alarming future scenarios. Cast includes Amy Irving and Gary Cole. \"Where the dead are\": Boston 1868, Civil War surgeon Dr Ramsay treats a charity case brought in but the man dies on the operating table. Investigating further, Ramsay discovers a scar indicating a skull fracture that should have taken the man's life years ago. Ramsay's obsession with death and belief that life is tantamount is piqued by the case and he travels to a mysterious island where he meets retired apothecary Dr Jeremy Wheaton who has conducted experiments in tissue regeneration as well as treating Ramsay's mystery patient. Cast includes Patrick Bergin and Jack Palance."
