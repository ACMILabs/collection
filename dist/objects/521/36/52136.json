        "Grant Gee accompanies Radiohead - Colin Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, Jonny Greenwood, Thom Yorke and Philip Selway on their 1997-98 world tour following the success of \"OK Computer\" with images in keeping with the eclectic and cutting edge style synonymous with the band. Still images overlay live footage and competing noises of the band themselves, interviewers and critics, screaming fans and street sounds. Includes extensive footage of the band in concert across the world with lead singer Thom Yorke posing an alienated figure head, sometimes not even required to sing the songs that have been taken over by adoring fans who know them by heart and the hype surrounding the band as an entity. Shot on tour buses, photo shoots, taxis and hotel rooms, in black and white and colour, the band accused of creating an album to \"slash your wrists to\" share their thoughts on being celebrities, radio, and the integrity of modern rock sacrificed at the expense of advertising. The motif of transport and the frenetic pace at which the image changes effectively conveys the inability of the band to stop and reflect their wave of success. At times amusing, the documentary does present the lighter sides to being a famous band, such as being rejected from their own party because the bouncers didn't recognise them."
