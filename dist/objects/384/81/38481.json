        "Episode number 7 of Series \"History in action\". Aldolf Hitler was imprisoned for his part in an abortive military coup in 1924. Released nine months later, Hitler began to rebuild the fragments of the National Socialist Party. At the General Election of 1930, the Nazi Party became the second largest party in the Reichstag. This program profiles the developments that gave Hitler and the Nazi's popular support, and the means they used to broaden and consolidate their power."
