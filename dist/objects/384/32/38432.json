        "Episode number 24 of Series \"Time to grow\". Adolescence is a time of stressful change for teenagers often due to higher expectations, increased social pressures and more responsibilities. Approximately 20% will have trouble in coping and some will never recover from the traumatic effects of this period in their life. The majority however, through family and adult support and care will weather the storm. Divorce can be a major influencing factor in teenage anti-social behaviour. This program helps provide an understanding of this and other issues such as teenage pregnancy, anorexia/bulimia, dropping out of school and drug and alcohol abuse, through frank and open interviews with several young teenagers experiencing the challenges of adolescence."
