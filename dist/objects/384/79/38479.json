        "Episode number 3 of Series \"History in action\". In November 1920, the last of the White Army was evacuated which signalled the end of 'Old Russia'. Millions died and millions were homeless. Industry was wrecked and farms were ruined, but Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks was able to retain his power through the use of propaganda, charismatic leadership and where necessary, force. This episode focuses on the abdication of Tsar Nicholas and the gaining of power by the Bolsheviks, and includes archival footage."
