        "Episode of Series \"History through art\". The twentieth century has been a time of great change. Parts 1 and 2 of the program follow a chronological course of modern art through its different directions. The diversity of movements and their fleeting time frames are examined in this time line of the century of change and experimentation with form, reality, media and perception. The artists have been followed by musicians, photographers and film makers."
