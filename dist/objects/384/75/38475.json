        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Painter's world: changing constants of art from the Renaissance to the present\". The way we see works of art, and therefore value them is one of the key changing constants of art. This program looks at the history of the economics and the exhibition of art from the Renaissance to the present, beginning with the great Renaissance patrons, including the Medicis and the Popes, through the royal collections of France, the development of art museums and the current chaos of the art market."
