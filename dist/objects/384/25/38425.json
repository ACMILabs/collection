In this episode, Raquel and Angela spend some time in San Jerman, a town not far from San Juan. Angela talks about her father, and finally shows his trunk, in which they find something amazing, to Raquel. No new vocabulary is introduced in this episode, instead, the viewer is asked to listen carefully to the history and culture of the town and to everything the characters are saying."
