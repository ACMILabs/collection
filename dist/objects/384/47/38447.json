        "This is a ski video directed towards intermediate and advanced skiers. Professional ski instructor, Martin Heckelman, author of the \"Hamlyn Guide to Skiing\", takes the viewer through the shortswing turn, wedelning, recreational racing and all the advanced manoeuvres that make skiing on moguls and steep slopes easier. Using easy to follow freeze-frame and slow motion sequences the video demonstrates both the correct way to perform each manoeuvre and all the common errors to be avoided."
