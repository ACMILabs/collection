        "Episode of Series \"History through art\". Hosted by Nancy Sellers, this two part video examines the period known as the 'Age of Enlightenment'. Part one examines the decorative style of the Rococo in the early 1700's. Examples of this are shown in the palaces of the nobility as well as in the paintings of artists such as Watteau and Fragonard. Part two looks at examples of the enlightenment artists showing their desire for order in their world and their respect for ancient civilisations."
