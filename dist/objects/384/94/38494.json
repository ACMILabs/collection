        "Episode of Series \"History through art\". This three part program shows how Rome, throughout its history, took the best ideas of those it conquered and adapted them to their own world view. Part one looks at the founding of the Roman republic, its impressive architecture and the realism of its sculpture, in contrast to the idealism of Greek art. Part two deals with the period of the great Roman emperors, which culminated in the reign of Trajan. This part compares Greek and Roman architecture, sculpture and bas-relief. Part three follows the decline of the empire, Hadrian's love of all things Greek, the Pantheon which is a unique blending of Greek and Roman styles and the final flowering of Roman art under Constantine."
