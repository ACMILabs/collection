        "This is an excellent video for beginners and intermediate skiers. Professional ski instructor, Martin Heckelman, author of the \"Hamlyn Guide to Skiing\", takes the viewer through every step leading to the parallel turn including putting on your skis correctly, skiing on ice, and turning on moguls. Using easy to follow freeze-frame and slow motion sequences the video demonstrates both the correct way to perform each manoeuvre and all the common errors to be avoided. Filmed entirely on location in Val D'Isere, France."
