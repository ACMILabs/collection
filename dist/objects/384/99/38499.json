        "Episode of Series \"The Human face of Indonesia\". Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country and the fifth most populous nation. This program shows different aspects of the effect of this huge, but unequally distributed population, on the lives of individuals. \"Debra Yatim: journalist\" describes this young journalists attempt to bring to public notice the plight of the Djarkata poor. \"Two doctors\" follows two young doctors serving their compulsory term in some of Indonesia's most remote communities, and the education and self-help program they are putting in place. \"The Sannarto family\" follows the fortunes of an urban family taking part in a resettlement program designed to develop Indonesia's outlying provinces, and the difficulties this produces both for the migrating families and for the indigenous population. Teacher's notes accompany the video."
