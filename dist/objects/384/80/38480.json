        "Episode number 6 of Series \"History in action\". In 1929, Joseph Stalin celebrated his 50th. birthday. This event was celebrated across the USSR in a blaze of glory not seen since the days of the Tsar. 176 million people venerated Stalin at that time. Stalin had been a leading revolutionary figure since 1903, eclipsed by Lenin, but becoming the key political figure after Lenin's death. This program looks at Stalin's rise to become leader of the USSR."
