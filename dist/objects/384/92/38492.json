        "Episode of Series \"History through art\". The age of the Baroque in Europe was filled with turmoil. The loss of faith in man, in God and in previous knowledge was central and earth-shaking. The rebuilding of this faith on sturdier foundations was an exciting creative process. The works of the artists of the period reflect, with great insight and sensitivity, the excitement, the conflict and the richness of the time. The video is in three parts - Part 1 surveys the historical basis for the conflicts of the Baroque - Part 2 uses marvellous examples to discuss the influence of the Church on Baroque art and architecture - Part 3 uses examples from different parts of Europe to show local character of Baroque art."
