        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Painter's world: changing constants of art from the Renaissance to the present\". A good portrait is never just a likeness. It always involves exploration, choice and pictorial invention. The style of portraits has changed from profiles on coins and medallions, through portraits limited to the rich and famous prior to the Renaissance, to the abstract portraits of anyone in any setting, of modern times. The program explores the conventions of pose, of setting, of painting those in power, of painting men and of painting women. Viewers also study the impact of photography on portraiture."
