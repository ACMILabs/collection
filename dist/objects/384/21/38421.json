        "Episode number 18 of Series \"Destinos: an introduction to Spanish\". Eighteenth in a series of Spanish language programs. Raquel and Arturo exchange a sad farewell at Buenos Aires Airport. As she is waiting for her plane, Raquel sits down to write to Segnora Suarez about all that has happened so far in Argentina. So this episode is revisionary, covering all the major points and events that happened to Raquel in Argentina. No new vocabulary is introduced."
