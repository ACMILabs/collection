        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". John Thomson, a retired forester from Western Australia, and a committed conservationist gives his view on the destruction of the Karri forests and the subsequent effects on the land in Western Australia. His views are reiterated by Norman Lockyer, a farmer and by Dr. Chittleborough who failed in his attempt to put through a comprehensive State Conservation Strategy. Although largely pessimistic in its outlook the program does suggest that attitudes are changing to the hitherto wasteful and destructive forestry and agricultural practices."
