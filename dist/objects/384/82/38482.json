        "Episode number 8 of Series \"History in action\". Why are the Jews being persecuted? Why do the Nazi's regard themselves as the Master Race? The upsurge of anti-Semitism immediately after the Great war is examined. The Nazi's exploited the anti-Jewish feeling with extreme propaganda. This program attempts to bring about an understanding of the events and actions which resulted in the wholesale persecution of a race of people by a political system."
