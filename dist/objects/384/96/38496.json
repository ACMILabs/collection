        "Episode of Series \"History through art\". This is a 3-part program which discusses the age and art of Ancient Greece from the Archaic Period through the Hellenistic Age. Each program presents many examples of architecture, sculptures, paintings, monuments and inscribings placing the art and architecture of Ancient Greece into its proper perspective. Part 1. Introduces many of the Greek treasures and shows how their humanistic outlook influenced all aspects of Greek life. Part 2. Looks in detail at the architecture of the Parthenon and the Acropolis. Part 3. Architectural and sculptural treasures portray the Greek vision of immortality and strength found in the Archaic period."
