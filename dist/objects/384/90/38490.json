        "A general survey of the major developments in US painting and sculpture in the 70's, following the emergence of Pop Art. Part 1 discusses hard-edge painting, minimalism, shaped canvasses, industrial processes, environmental sculptures and earthworks. It features the work of painters Barnet Newman, Ellsworth Kelly, Mark Rothko, Charles Hinman, Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland, and of sculptors Donald Judd and Christo. Part 2 concentrates on Op art and its interest in illusions of motion, kinetic art, neon and fluorescent art, video art, happenings, holograms and lasers."
