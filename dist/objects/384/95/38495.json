        "Episode of Series \"History through art\". Nancy Sellers hosts this three part program. \"AD 1 - AD 475\" covers the early Christian era during which pagan art was given a new, Christian meaning. Exterior beauty was rejected in favour of the interior of the soul, thus plain church exteriors and elaborate interiors. \"AD 475 - AD 1000\" Known as the Dark Ages this period featured withdrawal into monasteries and castles as Europe was besieged by marauding tribes. The crudeness and boldness of this era is vividly represented in illuminated manuscripts. \"AD 1000 - AD 1450\" This period saw an amazing burst of religious energy which expressed itself in the great Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals of Europe."
