        "Episode of Series \"History through art\". In the 15th Century Western civilisation developed the printing press and the resulting accessibility of knowledge led to renewed interest in the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome. In the wealthy cities of Florence and Venice the superstitions and anti-humanism of the Middle Ages began to be replaced by philosophies in which human potential and creativity was deemed infinite. Through the art of this period this video explores the historic conditions which gave rise to the Renaissance. In this period philosophies of art, culture, science, politics and theology were to be developed which still have a central role in contemporary Western consciousness and social practice. The video features the works of da Vinci, Michelangelo, Donatello, Botticelli as well as the sculpture, architecture and craft of the Renaissance."
