        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Painter's world: changing constants of art from the Renaissance to the present\". 20th century art has been dominated by Abstraction which could be said to be its legacy to art. This program traces the antecedents of Abstraction in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and then goes on to explore the work of notable Abstractionists, such as Miro, Kandinsky, Mondrian, Barnett Newman, Pollock, Rothko, and Frank Stella, stressing the risk taking aspects of this form of art, and dividing it into two main strands - the geometric and analytic, and that inspired by organic life."
