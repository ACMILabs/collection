        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Painter's world: changing constants of art from the Renaissance to the present\". Few painters have become artists without training. But can art be taught? This program looks at what has been taught and why, from the Renaissance to the present and the relationship between prevailing styles in art and corresponding art school doctrine. Filmed at the Slade School, London, Royal College of Art, Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, Rhode Island School of Design with archival footage of Joseph Albers teaching at Yale University."
