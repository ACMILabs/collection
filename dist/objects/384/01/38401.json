        "Killer whales are found in every ocean of the world - magnificent, highly intelligent animals that must kill to live. Each family pod has its own unique dialect, skills and traditions which are passed on through the generations. From British Columbia where they hunt down salmon, to Norway for the schools of herring, to the sub-Antarctic where the penguins and elephant seals are pursued relentlessly, and finally to Argentina where sea lion pups are picked off the beach, this outstanding video portrays the killer whales as they are - wolves of the sea. However it is presented with great empathy and understanding and is accompanied by some of the most stunning photography creating an absolute visual delight. Highly recommended family viewing. Narrated by David Attenborough."
