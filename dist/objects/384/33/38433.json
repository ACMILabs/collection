        "Episode number 23 of Series \"Time to grow\". Since the beginning of this century changes in patterns of labour and consumption in the developed world have led to the emergence of a distinctive period of human social development we call being a \"teenager\". The teenage years, which correspond to adolescent physical development, are a time in which older children begin to move away from relationships centred on their families and to develop strong relationships with their peers. The teenager's move towards autonomy can often result in friction between themselves and their family and friends as they seek to define their place in the world, and as they come to terms with their sexual and emotional maturing."
