        "Tom is in his final year of High School, desperately fighting against his attraction for the athletic Matt. In the overtly homophobic environment of school there is no-one Tom can talk to about his sexuality. Except, maybe, for the new teacher Mr. Reece? This bittersweet short film is a very funny and very poignant story about coming out as gay in the late seventies, in the disco years, where liberation began on the dancefloor. With Matt Nolan and Dennis Christopher."
