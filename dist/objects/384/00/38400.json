        "Anthony Quinn and Sir Laurence Olivier head a distinguished international cast in this passionate drama about a Russian bishop, who, after twenty years as a political prisoner, is elected Pope. This stirring adaptation of Morris West's bestseller about the election of the first Russian Pope and its effect on world peace presents a powerful image of a world on the brink of self-destruction. Also stars Sir John Gielgud, Vittorio de Sica, Oskar Werner and Leo McKern as members of the Vatican's inner circle."
