        "Episode of Series \"History through art\". The pre-modern period traces the many diverse artistic movements that developed during the second half of the nineteenth century. This video looks at realism and artists such as Gustav Courbet. The development of impressionism with artists such as Edouard Manet, and the emergence of post-impressionism including the formalists Seurat and Cezanne and the expressionists Van Gogh and Gauguin are also examined. Hosted by Nancy Sellers."
