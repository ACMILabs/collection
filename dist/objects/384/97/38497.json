        "The Australian environment is in severe ecological crisis with soil degradation, salinity and deforestation all taking their toll on the land. But it is not all doom and gloom. Through satellite technology using remote sensing and computer analysis, scientists are able to plot the landscape on a daily, even hourly, basis and chart such occurrences as bushfires, floods, vegetation regrowth etc. This allows for future planning both environmentally and economically. \"Continent in crisis\" is a celebration of Australia's natural beauty from the red centre, to the rainforests to the Great Barrier Reef and of the world-ranking environmental research being undertaken by CSIRO and others."
