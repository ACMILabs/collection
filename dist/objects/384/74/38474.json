        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Painter's world: changing constants of art from the Renaissance to the present\". The human body has been the most persistent theme in art. Sinners and saints, children and old men and, of course, women, have all appeared nude in art over the centuries. The nude has been used both as a vehicle for competing ideals of beauty and to portray independent visions of reality. This program details the nude's changing roles in art and examines why this popular form, though closest to home is hardest to master."
