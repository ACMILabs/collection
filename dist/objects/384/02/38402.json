        "A successful barrister and keen amateur gardener, the headstrong and totally perverse Clifford Mortimer banged his head while climbing a tree and was blinded for life. For the next twenty years he refused to admit that anything had changed. His family had to pretend there was nothing wrong and life had to go on as normal. However, life became increasingly complicated and absurd. This is John Mortimer's warm, witty portrait of his father and his family - filmed in the places where the events actually occurred. The scintillating dialogue and Laurence Olivier's intensely accurate performance, brilliantly tease out the contradictions in this selfish, heroic man. Also stars Alan Bates and Jane Asher."
