        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Painter's world: changing constants of art from the Renaissance to the present\". This program explores how painters have achieved movement in a still image and have told stories in a single frame. Before photography, it did not occur to artists to isolate single moments. Medieval art saw the eternal moment, but with Renaissance art action became central. The program looks at how Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, Leonardo and Caravaggio treated movement and then moves to the post-photography era and the works of Muybridge, Hockney, Duchamp and Pollock."
