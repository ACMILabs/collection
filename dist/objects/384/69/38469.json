        "Four adventures from Noddy and his friends in Toyland. 1.\"Noddy loses sixpence\" - Everyone's losing things in Toyland today - the milkman's watch, Dinah Doll's new bag and the pink cat's tail. 2.\"Noddy and the goblins\" - The goblins have tricked poor Noddy out of his car and hat. 3.\"Noddy and the naughty tail\" - Look out! Bert Monkey sold his pencil box, forgetting his magic rubber that rubs out everything it touches. 4.\"Noddy and the pouring rain\" - It's raining in Toyland, and Noddy's passengers are getting wet - until Big Ears has a good idea. Based on the stories by Enid Blyton."
