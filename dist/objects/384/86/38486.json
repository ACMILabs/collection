        "Episode of Series \"History through art\". This two part program looks at aspects of the Romantic period. Part 1 chronicles the blind faith in progress and the triumph of the individual. Part 2 explores the imagination of the Romantic artists through their paintings of exotic lands and classical antiquity. The Romantic movement is seen as the re-emergence of the spiritual side of man's nature. Hosted by Nancy Sellers."
