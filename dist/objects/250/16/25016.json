        "Kepler's life story, his discovery of the three Laws of Planetary Motion and work of optics. Contemporary prints illustrate his early life and education at the University of Tubingen; concepts of planetary motion held at the time, and the way Kepler's work altered them; work in Prague leading to the Laws of Planetary Motion; study of optics, astronomical calculations and other publications; his last years, overshadowed by the Thirty Year's War."
