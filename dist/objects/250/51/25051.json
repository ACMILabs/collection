        "In this study of King Penguins in their natural surroundings in the Antarctic, and also in the Edinburgh Zoo, the use of the flippers and feet in swimming are shown by underwater slow-motion cinematography. The birds are shown preening themselves, moulting, courting and mating, incubating their eggs, hatching and rearing their young."
