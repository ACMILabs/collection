        "Episode of Series \"B.P. Road Safety\". A car is a coach of steel weighing a ton or more, with about a 200 plus horse power engine. The driver should know what this weight and power can do, especially before breaking any of the road rules. Don't take your car for granted - make sure that brakes are in good condition, that all tyres are in good order, that wheels alignment is right and that all you car lights are working - know your car and stay alive."
