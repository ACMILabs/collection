        "The progress made in Kenya since the Mau Mau uprisings of 1952. Kikuyu natives concentrated in villages for protection - the beginning of land consolidation and planned farming. Many Kikuyu work on large European farms growing sisal, or coffee, Kenya's main exports. The co-existence of Africans, Indians, Arabs, and Europeans poses complex racial problems."
