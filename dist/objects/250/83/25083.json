        "Prior to the 1920's the koala was in danger of becoming extinct in Australia because it was unprotected. This film looks at the koala, its biological characteristics and the various types of species which are determined by its climatic region in Eastern Australia. Those features which make the koala particularly adaptable to its territorial environment are described and its life cycle is surveyed. Photography by Dean Semler."
