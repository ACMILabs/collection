        "An illustration of approved methods of psychological care of the newborn infant. A home situation is shown where other children are present, and the consideration and understanding necessary until the family adjusts itself to the demands of the newcomer are noted. Many aspects of the care of the infant are dealt with, and their psychological implications stressed, including such points as clothing and bedding, the bath, breast feeding and bottle feeding, maintenance of normal home atmosphere, prevention of any feeling of neglect in older children, and the need to develop the interest and participation of brothers and sisters in the care of the new baby."
