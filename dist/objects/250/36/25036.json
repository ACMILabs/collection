        "In an anthill of five million ants, there is always one ant out of step. Based on a Yugoslavian children's song, this animated film tells the story of an ant who unintentionally disrupts the harmony and order of the ant-hill. A sardonic survey of insect behaviour, charming and genuinely funny using a striking yet simple visual style."
