        "A study in detail of the koala, a marsupial which inhabits the eastern and southern parts of the Australian continent. Shows mating habits, birth of the young, nurturing in the pouch and its later development outside the physical protection of the mother, though it still remains dependent upon her for survival. The koala is fully protected throughout Australia today but there is still a great need to set aside large areas of forest country to ensure its continued existence."
