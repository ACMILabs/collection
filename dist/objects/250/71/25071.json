        "Demonstrates how an old fashioned farm kitchen may be updated into a modern and convenient 1945 kitchen through careful planning and efficient conversion of existing space and materials. During the planning stage, the following are considered: saving steps in the kitchen; provision of adequate shelf space; facilitating house cleaning; provision of ample laundry space; washing and cleaning area; and a well-lit desk for children's homework. Shows the planning, design, construction and enjoyment of a new kitchen."
