        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Kindergarten child series\". In this film a teacher gives egg cartons filled with magnets to the children, encouraging them to discover which have magnetic properties. Various children explore contacts with iron filings, a compass, paper clips, and numerous other objects. Freedom not to be involved is open to the children here, but they are on the whole, quite involved in the project."
