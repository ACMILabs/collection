        "A Greek refugee camp is shown through the eyes of children playing \"kryfto\" (hide and seek) in and out of the cubicles of a converted tobacco factory. The Greek government is trying to close the camp but homes and employment still have to be found for 400 people. We see one friendless old woman who is settled in a home, built to house old people from refugee camps all over Greece. Introduced with an appeal by HRH the Duke of Edinburgh."
