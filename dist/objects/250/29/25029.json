        "One of Australia's major silent features, 'The Kid Stakes' concerns Fatty Finn and his gang. As they are preparing to enter their pet goat, Hector, in the goat-cart race, a member of a rival gang lets Hector escape on the very morning of the race. The adventures of Fatty and the gang in their attempt to rescue Hector are told with charm and humour. As a document of Australian clothes, customs, jokes and appearances of the era, this film is a valuable historical record. Based on Syd Nicholls' comic strip characters that appeared in the Sydney Sunday News newspaper. Cast includes Ray Salmon, Frank Boyd, Robin Ordell and Charles Roberts. Cinematography by Arthur Higgins."
