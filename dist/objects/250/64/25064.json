        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Kip and David\". It is David's birthday and Kip is the first to greet him, playing 'Happy Birthday' on his pipes. David is given a small microscope and some boxes of prepared slides. They look at some of these and then find things in the garden to inspect under the microscope. The postman brings another parcel, which contains an irrepressible Jack-in-the-Box. Music by Nancy Tow. Narrated by Roy Dunlop."
