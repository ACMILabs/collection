        "One-third of the world's agricultural production is destroyed each year by pests and diseases. Geographical isolation has helped protect Australia so far, but with increasing frequency and speed of modern communication the risk of their accidental introduction becomes greater every year. Plant Quarantine Inspectors check cargoes and passengers' baggage, as they come into the country. Within industries such as sugar and rice, scientists work to improve commercial varieties and reduce disease."
