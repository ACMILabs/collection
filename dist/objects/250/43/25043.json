        "Large patterns of dominoes, each toppling the next, demonstrate the famous theory. Slowly they rise, to topple again. Brightly painted ping pong balls rise and fall in plastic boxes, and coloured cubes revolve in a changing spectrum of colour. The striking photography greatly enhances the imaginative qualities of Gordon Barlow's work. Music by Bobby Christian, photographed by Steve Heiser and Lutz Hopke. (Award: Atlanta)"
