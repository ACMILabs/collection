        "Re-edited and re-titled from the footage remaining of \"When the Kelly's were out\", an early Australian silent film now no longer in existence as a complete unit. Represents the Kelly gang as high-spirited youths unjustly persecuted, and reasons that \"Ned Kelly has not become a legend for nothing\". Photography by Tasman Higgins."
