        "Produced by an international team of amateur film makers aged 18 to 23, this is an experiment in the synthesis of ballet and film techniques. Elements of both dance-drama and traditional ballet are used in a psychological fantasy set against the ruins of a city, describing the impact of new people and strange feelings on youth. The \"Contrasts\" are those of white to black, youth to experience, the unreal formality of the ballet as opposed to the rough reality of the setting. Sound effects and music only."
