        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Kip and David\". David and his elfin friend Kip discover many surprises while playing in the garden. A green tree frog hidden in a plant, a shady Traveller's palm and newly grown mushrooms - ideal stools for Kip. As they search for a dry, sheltered home for Kip, they see bearded dragon and frilled lizards. After clearing a site at the foot of a tree, they draw a plan and prepare to build it. Music by Nancy Tow. Narrated by Roy Dunlop."
