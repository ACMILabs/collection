        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Kip and David\". Kip and David visit 'Lamington National Park' set high in the mountains. They see the rain forest with its giant trees, creepers, mosses and lichens, waterfalls and pools. They float leaf-boats down the small waterfalls, find a satin bower-bird's playground and inspect the strange assortment of blue objects in it. Finally, they feed the wild scrub turkeys, bower birds, wild parrots and other small birds. Music by Nancy Tow. Narrated by Roy Dunlop."
