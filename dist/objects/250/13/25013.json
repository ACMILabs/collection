        "Kensal House was built by the Gas Light and Coke Company to replace slums in Kensal Green. The aim was to show that under reasonable conditions, an adequate supply of gas fuel costs no more than an inadequate supply of less efficient fuel. Conditions in the slums are shown. Then the design of the flats is explained, and its clubs, nursery school and gardens shown. The operation of Kensal House as a community is stressed."
