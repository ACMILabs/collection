        "A human relations film which uses the sterility of a child's game and the fluidity of a folk dance to illustrate the barren life of the egocentric in a culturally fertile human community which thrives on diversity. Stresses that human beings must be able to grow as individuals, at the same time they grow as organic parts of the community."
