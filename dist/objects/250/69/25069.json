        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Kip and David\". Kip and David return to the island. The kookaburras, magpies and currawongs welcome Kip back and David feeds these wild birds. They explore a steep rocky gorge in which many Pandanus trees are growing and see giant turtles swimming. Kip and David watch the rock crabs feeding but the tide is coming in, so they leave the gorge and visit one of the ocean headlands. David promises to visit Kip whenever he can. Music by Nancy Tow. Narrated by Roy Dunlop."
