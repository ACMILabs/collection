        "A 1950s social guidance film, unique in its ability to explore adolescent behaviour without passing judgement. A teenager, unable to deal with his brother's imminent marriage, becomes increasingly drunk at the engagement party. His actions are misunderstood by everyone but his brother. The film appeals to the audience to look beneath the surface for an explanation to the teenager's behaviour, suggesting that he is frustrated and unable to express himself. Performances are by students and the faculty of the State Teachers' Collegeat Montclair, New Jersey and by neighbours genuinely interested in the problems of young people."
