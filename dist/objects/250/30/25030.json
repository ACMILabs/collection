        "Captures the feel of the 1972 Olympic boat races by interweaving the thoughts of some of the sailors with a visual and aural narration of the racing action, the pageantry of the ceremonies, and the hard work and disappointments in racing. Held at Kiel, Germany, on the North Sea, six classes were raced: Dragon, Soling, Star, Tempest, Flying Dutchman and Finn Dinghy."
