        "Alternative medicine offers us many options. Some approaches focus more on healthy body, others on healthy mind. But in all there is a common underlying theme, and that is that the individual can do a lot to keep themselves well. We don't have to prop ourselves up with pills, or overload our bodies with junk food and stress. In this series, Nevill Drury takes us through a wide range of alternative therapies and treatments now available in Australia."
