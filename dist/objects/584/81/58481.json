        "The western world's desire to change other societies to its own image has robbed our modern world of the gifts of other cultures. By exploring the values and different world perspectives that hold many tribal societies together, this ten part series aims to stimulate reflection and to look at what the modern world can learn from tribal societies as we all approach the next millennium. Written and presented by David Maybury-Lewis."
