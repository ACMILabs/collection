        "Film made by the Department of Agriculture's film unit to promote itself by showing who they are, where they are located and what they do on a daily basis. The tone of the piece is very light and it contains numerous jokes relating to the fact that it is the film unit making a film about the film unit. Also contains general information about film editing machines (Moviola) and how they operate. Brief footage of the Spring St end of Burke street circa 1977."
