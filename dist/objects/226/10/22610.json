        "The forces that cause earthquakes and volcanoes. Wherever the earth has been folded up into mountains, cracks may appear in the crust. When blocks of earth move along these cracks, or faults, earthquakes may occur. If melted rock is near a fault or weak spot in the crust, it may be forced out to produce a volcanic eruption."
