        "A distinguished film study of the tundra of Canada's sub-Arctic. It stretches from the polar sea to the southern treeline and supports, despite the permafrost, a surprising variety of life. Here you see the ungainly musk-ox, survivor of the Ice Age, and herds of caribou following the migrant trails; also birds and flowers, smaller animals, and insects. (Awards: Venice; Buenos Aires; Yorkton)"
