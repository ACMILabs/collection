        "Physiography is presented as a dynamic process: the forces which have shaped the earth as it is today are still at work changing it further. The part played by the water cycle in determining the physiography of the earth is emphasised, and the formation of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks is illustrated by models and by animated diagrams."
