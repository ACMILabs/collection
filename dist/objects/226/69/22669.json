        "The enlarged Eildon Dam, Victoria, is a vast area of water, used to provide power and irrigation. It has become a water playground for boating, swimming and fishing enthusiasts. The film shows that although the dam has been completed, the Eildon township has been revitalised by the hardboard industry established there."
