        "A survey of the Tamagawa educational project, founded in 1929, just outside Tokyo. Children may enrol in the primary school and leave nineteen years later as graduates of the university. The eductational philosophy encourages the fostering of creativity through self-motivated study and the all-round curriculum includes work on the experimental farm as well as cultural and intellectual activities."
