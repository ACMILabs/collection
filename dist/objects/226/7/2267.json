    ], 
    "description": [
        "Story revolves around the importance of choosing breeding partners that have good breeding themselves and the benefits that this will bring their offspring. It stars two cows with human characteristics (standing on two legs, wearing clothes, speaking english, etc.) being interviewed about their successful partnership together and goes on to give information on correct rearing techniques. Hand-painted animation looks suberb and the deadpan delivery of the main charcaters is very amusing.  Illustrated 'The End' and opening titles."
