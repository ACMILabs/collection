        "This film covers the route which Edward John Eyre explored in 1840 between Adelaide, South Australia, and Albany, Western Australia. Illustrates scenes along this route which skirts the Nullabor Plain and is now known as the Eyre Highway; Adelaide as it was when he left is reproduced from old drawings and contrasted with the Adelaide of today; Whyalla with its shipbuilding and iron industry; Eucla, deserted gold mining town, Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie; present-day Perth, now a big city."
