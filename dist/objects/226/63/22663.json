        "Neoclassicism, romanticism, rebellion and adventure are some of the facets of the eighteenth century shown, by this film, through paintings by Hogarth and Gainsborough, the architecture of famous English house, sculpture, figurines, and scenes of navigation instruments and ships. These are used to illustrate the lives and ideas of both aristocrats and commoners in eighteenth-century England."
