Animated diagrams show how the velocity of electro-magnetic radiation is determined, and the properties of refraction, dispersion, diffraction, interference, polarisation, and absorption of electro-magnetic radiation by the earth's ionosphere and atmosphere. The uses of different frequencies of electro-magnetic radiation including micro waves for communication and the working of gas and solid state laser."
