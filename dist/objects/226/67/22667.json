        "NARRATED IN FRENCH. NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. Uses drawings and contemporary engravings by Daumier, Gauarni, Decamps and others to depict the period of the 1848 Revolution in France. Examines the causes for discontent as the monarchy totters, the fierce street fighting that precipitated its downfall, and finally the election of Louis Napoleon and the celebration of the new freedom - and the betrayal of that freedom."
