        "The basic principles of the electric motor. Opens with an account of the properties of magnets. Compares the action of permanent magnets and electro-magnets. An electro-magnet is used to work an electric bell. An electro-magnet is then adapted so that it turns on an axle and, in this way, the development of a simple electric motor is demonstrated."
