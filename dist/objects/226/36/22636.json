        "The film illustrates the way of life on the sea shore. Many birds such as gulls, pelicans, swans and cormorants are shown and their adaptations to the tidal pattern explained. Migratory and breeding habits of other species are discussed. This poetic film of bird life is centred round two derelict barges which locate the scene and establish the continuity of the movements of the tide."
