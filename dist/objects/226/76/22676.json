        "Episode of Series \"PSSC physics\". Demonstrates the concept of stored energy. Uses the example of collisions between two dry-ice pucks. Cylindrical magnets are mounted on the pucks, producing a repelling force, and the kinetic energy of the pucks is measured. Suitable for upper secondary level."
