        "An experimental film with triple image effects done in the camera using a matte-box. The central image was filmed after the two side sections - the side sections being shot in a random way and no record kept of the various shots. Colour filters were used with the camera and not in the laboratory. The subject reminded the filmmakers of faces and figures in old icons, the triptych structure of the images also echoes the icon. An interesting blend of stillness, movement, rocks, flesh, woman, girl, water, sky, colour, light, wind, sun and foliage."
