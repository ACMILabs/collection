        "Eel is an important source of Vitamin A, and a popular food in Japan. The life cycle of the eel is illustrated, showing the migration of the baby eels from their oceanic birth places to the coast of Japan, and subsequent life in the streams or in the commercial ponds of the eel farms. The techniques of eel-raising are shown."
