        "Explains the process of editing motion picture footage, using double system synchronous sound. Shows the use of a clapstick for synchronization cues during shooting and a gang synchronizer to establish internal synchronization points. Illustrates maintenance of synchronization in cutting from one take to another and means of eliminating unwanted sounds. Summarizes the three main points in this type of editing: establishment of synchronisation of cues in shooting, re-establishment in editing, and maintenance during editing"
