        "Episode of Series \"Rowing and Sculling\". Land training with weights is an essential part of the rower's technique and is often neglected by coach and oarsman. Lifts presented in this film have been chosen by the Amateur Rowing Association because of their value as specific training for the rowing and sculling action. Rowing movements used in the boat are related to individual lifts."
