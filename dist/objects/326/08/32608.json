        "Episode of Series \"Alligator Rivers Region\". Following an environmental impact study by Mr Justice Fox, the Australian Government set up the Office of the Supervising Scientist to carry out scientific research in the Alligator River region of Kakadu National Park to establish base-line figures which would enable scientists to monitor the mining activities. This documentary deals in some detail with this research, and discusses the problems associated with mining in such an unusual and beautiful part of Kakadu National Park. Narrated by Robyn Williams."
