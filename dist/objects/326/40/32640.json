        "A comprehensive survey which concentrates on the people of Africa today in all walks of life, and with glimpses of life in the cities, towns and villages. Shows some of the economic and social changes that are taking place throughout the many nations of Africa. An animated map sequence pinpoints deserts, farmland, rivers and major population areas. A final sequence focuses on South Africa and Namibia, where the official racial policies are opposed by Africans throughout the continent. Suitable for lower and middle secondary level."
