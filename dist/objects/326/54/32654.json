        "The extraordinary paintings of Hieronymus Bosch, painted over 400 years ago, continue to haunt and disturb us to such an extent that there is constant argument about their meaning. Dr Nicholas Baum presents an unusual detective story as he tries to unravel the mysteries of the man about whom so little is known."
