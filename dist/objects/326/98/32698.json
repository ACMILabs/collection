        "A satirical film depicting an interview with an Italian film director, Aldo Altonandino who's remarks in Italian are translated into English by a deadpanned, uninvolved female interpreter. As he gets carried away by his pseudo-eloquence the translator continues in robot-like fashion. As the camera pulls back, the real director appears explaining his idea for the film."
