        "Episode of Series \"World cultures and youth\". 15 year old Lee Nakhampa is making a beautiful parasol as a 'gift of love' for her cousin, a Buddhist monk. Carefully designing and painting it, she leaves it to dry but returns to discover her employer has reluctantly given it to an important customer. Lee is upset, but recovers to quickly paint another parasol. We see her present it to her cousin during the ceremonies at the colourful Buddhist festival."
