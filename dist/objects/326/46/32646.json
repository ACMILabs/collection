        "We see through the eyes of children one village in this land of eighty million, touched by the strong tide of change. The village stands for tradition while the cities represents modernity. The wealth which has transformed the cities must now be harnessed to the betterment of rural life, to give balance and sustenance to all Nigerians. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
