        "A project was sponsored by the University of Tennessee to build a children's playground with the help of the community. In this way, building costs were low, and children involved gained more respect for the equipment, having helped to build it. Members of the community brought their own tools and gave their time, whilst local businesses donated equipment and the use of machinery."
