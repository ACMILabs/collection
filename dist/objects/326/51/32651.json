        "Chillysmith Farm was the home of Gramp, whose last years were documented by his grandsons in the photo essay 'Gramp'. In this film, 10 years in the making, Gramp and other members of his family are shown. Birth and death are shown by the whole family. This is a film for all ages that raises issues of family life, birth, death, and individual responsibility of the ageing."
