        "The laser has applications in many fields, from entertainment to scientific research. Looks at some of the ways in which lasers are being used, and possible future development with lasers. It is being used in the printing industry for etching copper plates, in the search for cheap energy by producing fusion reactions in the laboratory, as a scalpel in surgery, and for making holograms. Narrated by Paul Vaughan."
