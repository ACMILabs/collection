        "Arnold Schwarzenegger, world champion bodybuilder, attempts a comeback after a lengthy retirement. The film reveals the motivated psychology of a winner in sport. The tension and excitement backstage at the Mr Olympia contest at the Sydney Opera House provides a compelling insight to a sport that is generally regarded as little more than a freak show. Also features Tom Platz and Frank Zane."
