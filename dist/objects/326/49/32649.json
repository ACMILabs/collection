        "Dorian gets by on his looks, and lives off Frances, a single mother of three kids. He doesn't contribute much to either her emotional or financial well being. Frances is running out of patience and Dorian's looks are fading. Described as a \"sardonic Australian love story\" and made on a $50,000 budget this quirky short film won the Australian Film Institute Jury Award in 1982. Cast includes Carole Skinner, Grigor Taylor, Julie McGregor, Dennis Miller, Anna Volska, Cathy Downes, Anne Tenney, Rivka Hartman."
