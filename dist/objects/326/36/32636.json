        "On January 5th, 1975, the Tasman Bridge in Hobart, tragically collapsed, sinking a ship and her cargo and dismembering sections of the bridge in seconds. For 2 1/2 years Hobart was without a central road link across the river, whilst reconstruction work was underway. This was a test of skill of the engineers, and the restoration was a great challenge to all concerned. Work on the project is shown through the various stages until final completion."
