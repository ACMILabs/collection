        "Episode of Series \"Managing the Micro\". Looks at how microelectronics can be introduced into a produce or process, what skills are needed, and what risks are involved. Also how management can get enough of an idea to be able to talk sensibly about the technology. Illustrative material includes film of a successful engineering company and a micro-controlled greenhouse. A studio demonstration explores what would be involved in designing, developing and making a proposed new product - a micro-controlled piano tuner"
