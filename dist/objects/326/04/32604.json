        "Within the walls of the Summer Palace, there is a beautiful courtyard named Oriole Hall. This is where the Empress Dowager used to enjoy music and opera. People thought the music was so sweet that it must be the singing of orioles. Now this old courtyard has become a restaurant where tourists can enjoy special dishes prepared in the style of former imperial kitchens."
