        "Episode of Series \"The Nature of things\". This program examines the functions of the two halves of the human brain and current research being carried out by Canadian and American medical scientists. In addition to research into the nature of the split brain to find out what it controls before operating on it, we also see how different educational techniques in primitive and sophisticated societies may favour development of one hemisphere over the other. Presented and narrated by David Suzuki."
