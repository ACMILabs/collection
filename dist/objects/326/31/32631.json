        "A deceptively simple film, The Same Old Story is over almost before it has begun. A story within a story within a story, its effect is jarring, ambiguous and lingering. The film speaks of fear, which is as old as humanity and as new as today. An animated film in which reality and fantasy overlap dangerously."
