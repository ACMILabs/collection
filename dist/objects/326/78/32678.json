        "This film starts out appearing to be an art documentary about a Scottish painter Lawrence Angus Mc Coney. It uses artwork, animation and photographic effects to give a vivid sense of the artist's life. 'Still Life' is a humorous send up of art criticism but it also sets out to express what it feels like to be an artist. Narrated by Gary Bond."
