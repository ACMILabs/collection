        "The bow and arrow has been described as a \"royal instrument of sport\" and a \"lethal instrument of war\". This film presents a short history of a versatile tool and describes its functions through the ages: from the days of the great conqueror Genghis Khan who over ran China with this weapon, to the modern Olympics.
