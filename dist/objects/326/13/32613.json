        "Britain's greatest currency in the world of arts is probably her playwrights. From the great revival of British drama in the 1950s has sprung a new generation of playwrights, differing widely in ideas and approach. A study of these playwrights; the way they began to write, the way they find their subjects and the way they live their lives is made."
