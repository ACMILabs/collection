        "A young man, David McPherson, discusses his experience of being paraplegic since the age of eight. The film is shot at a tertiary college where he is a residential student and he and his fellow students talk about the way he has made sure that he can fit into everyday life on campus. Discusses the problem of sexuality of the disabled. A positive film highlighting what paraplegics are capable of achieving."
