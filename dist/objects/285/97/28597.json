        "Episode of Series \"How to Drive\". Every driver should aim to drive and control their vehicle so that skidding never occurs. A skid ocurs when any of the three forces acting upon a car in motion - acceleration, braking, steering - is increased sufficiently to overcome the grip of the tyres on the road. Rear wheel, front wheel and four-wheel skids are shown and the right corrective action for each one. Also the types of road surfaces which tend to produce skidding."
