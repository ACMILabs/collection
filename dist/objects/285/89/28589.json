        "Episode of Series \"Mechanical Drawing\". This film presents the reasons why uniformity in dimensioning practices is essential, and explains that this uniformity depends on observance of certain standards in: 1. use of symbols; 2. choice of dimensions; 3. location of dimensions. The first step in learning this common language consists in extension lines, dimension lines, arrow heads, figures, notes, finish marks etc."
