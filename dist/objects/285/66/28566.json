        "Episode number 7 of Series \"The Skills of Defensive Driving\" Although many drivers involved in single vehicle crashes attribute the cause of their accidents to mechanical failures of the car, very often it was the driver and not the car who was to blame. This film stresses that while mechanical checks of one's car are most important, it is even more vital that the driver is in good physical and mental condition before taking to the road."
