        "The theme of this film is about the pressures on Aboriginal women living in the city...what effect it has also on their men and their children. The film focuses on four women and the part they played in the movement demanding more equal opportunities for urban Aboriginals, for better conditions, the removal of discriminatory Acts, etc. Although life is difficult the women seem to survive better than the men. Their humour, intelligence and resilience in the face of life's difficulties often surprise people who see this film. The women are Leila Rankine (Music and Tribal Culture Education), Ruby Hammond (Legail Aid), Mary Williams (Aboriginal Kindergarten) and Gladys Elphick, MBE (President, Aboriginal Women's Council)."
