        "Famous documentary by Julien Bryan on the invasion of Poland by the German army in September 1939 - the attack that began World War II. It captures, with powerful images, the terror and desperation of the refugees and the immense destruction in the cities and towns. Depicts the destructive effect on the lives of the people. An important work that shows how unprepared Poland was to face the German war machine. Depicts the first week of WWII, and includes quite graphic footage."
