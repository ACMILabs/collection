        "Interesting demonstrations and experiments explain and illustrate the basic concepts of magnetism: magnets can produce a force, magnets have poles, magnets can make other magnets, and the earth is a magnet. Many of the experiments can be repeated in the classroom, while others use equipment not available in most schools."
