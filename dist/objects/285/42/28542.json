        "Simon, a clumsy and slightly backward boy, joins his young playmates in their games in the woods, but is tormented and finally abandoned by them. In this experimental film, the children were given only a rough outline of each scene and themselves improvised the details. The central theme of bullying and group cruelty pinpoints a private purgatory familiar to every child. The beauty of the woodlands where the action takes place symbolises the supposedly innocent natures of children, stressing the disillusioning contrast with their behaviour."
