        "The life cycle of the silkworm, and silkworm care on a Japanese farm. Soon after emerging from her chrysalis the female silk moth lays over 500 eggs, which hatch in a few days. The young silkworms are fed chopped mulberry leaves and after four weeks are fully grown and are moved to straw racks where they spin their cocoons. Close-ups and microcinematography show the growth processes in detail."
