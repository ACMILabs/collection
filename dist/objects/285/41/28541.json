        "The work of the silversmith is essentially that of a craftsman unassisted by modern methods of mass production. The beauty and delicacy of his hand-made creations in silver and leather make him one of the most versatile of craftsmen. This film shows the many processes involved in the creation of fine silverware, together with the tools which have been used for centuries without change."
