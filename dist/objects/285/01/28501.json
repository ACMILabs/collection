        "An experimental film: using a simple animation technique \"A SHORT VISION\" creates an imaginative and disturbing picture of atomic warfare. A \"thing\" suddenly appears in the sky, flying over countryside and cities and destroying all living things. All that finally remains is a single flame with a moth fluttering around it; and, after a moment, the flame devours the moth. Music by Matyas Seiber."
