        "Dramatises the story of how \"Silent Night\" was originally written. Beginning with a wandering group pf American carollers, the story slips back to Austria in 1818. In the little town of Aberndof, Father Mohr, the vilalge priest, was struck with the beauty of Cristmas Eve and wrote a Christmas poem. His friends, Franz Gruber, the teacher-choirmaster, composed musisc for the poem and the song spread over Austria until it became a Christmas carol, popular in every corner of the globe."
