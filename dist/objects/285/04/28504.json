        "In this film, simple and vivid collage animation brings words to life in a series of playful appenings involving all letters of the alphabet. It is really a film game in which an audience of children tries to see how many \"A\" words, \"B\" words, and so on to \"Z\", they can discover on the screen. The process of learning the alphabet and understanding the connection between letters, sounds and words becomes a pleasure."
