        "The story of television, describing the processes involved from the time the camera records the action to the time it is reproduced on the television screen. An explanation, in simple terms, of the basic principles of television. A telecast is used to demonstrate from the initial recording of the picture by the television camera to the final reproduction of the image on the screen of the television receiver. Explains how light strikes the television plate in the camera, is transformed into electrical impulses, is transmitted through the ether at 4,000,000 impulses per second and finally appears on the screen at the rate of 30 complete pictures per second, thus giving an illusion of movement."
