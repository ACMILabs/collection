        "The 11th St. Laurent long-distance cycle race; with participants from thirteen countries; and fifteen hundred miles of Quebec countryside to cover in twelve days. From a distance the cyclists are a moving colourful frieze against the picturesque landscape; closer, we see the taut faces and straining limbs of the competitors above the bright circles of their machines. (Awards: Moscow, London, Prague, New York, Cork)"
