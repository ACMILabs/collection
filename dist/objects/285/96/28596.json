        "Photographed at Vail, Jackson Hole, Taos, Chamonix, Kitzbuhel and elsewhere, this film shows skiing at its finest. It illustrates the technique, daring, inventiveness, and the free spirit necessary to push towards the outer limits of one's ability. Slow motion and natural speed show the style, control, balance and discipline required."
