        "A combination of comedy, animation and an original pop theme song are used to expose the questionable techniques of TV commercials. Aims to make viewers aware of how advertising can influence attitudes, values and expectations and helps consumers develop a healthy scepticism about advertising. Illustrations of persuasive advertising techniques include promises, giveaways, star endorsements, word games and branch loyalty. Features Billy Crystal."
