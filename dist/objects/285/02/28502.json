        "Episode of Series \"Track and Field Instruction\". The two broad principles by which maximum velocity in object propulsion is secured are analysed and then applied to the athlete so that he can \"put the shot\" the greatest possible distance. Also illustrates training and preparation techniques used to condition the athlete's body in order to get the appropriate co-ordinated muscle action. Slow motion photography is used to analyse the necessary arm, leg and body movement."
