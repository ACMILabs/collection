        "Dramatises the preparation and execution of Sir Francis Drake's raids on the Pacific coast empire of Spain in America. Illuminates the conflicting parties at Elizabeth I's court - those wishing to conciliate the mighty Philip II, of Spain, and those who sought to attack his vast empire, seize gold and gain glory. Shows how Drake's extended raid in the Pacific led to the circumnavigation of the world by his ship, the Golden Hind."
