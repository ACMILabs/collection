        "Episode of Series \"Music in Motion\". Scenes of the granitic hardness and glacial sparkle of Finland describe part of the Fifth Symphony of Sibelius. Snow-capped mountains and trees reflected in deep blue lakes, falling snow in a dense evergreen forest, sunny snow-banks of a glacier reflect the composer's changing moods from strong unrelenting harmonies to soft tremolos and pizzicato passages. (A study guide is available with this film). From the \"Music in motion\" series."
