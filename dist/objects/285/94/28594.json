        "Shows the work of the ski patrols on the snow-fields of the Australian Alps. In mountain country, clouds gather quickly, often bringing howling blizzards in which familiar landmarks soon disappear from sight. In cases of emergency, it is \"action stations\" for the ski patrols, manned by skiers who know the country well. The action of the film culminates in the rescue of an injured skier lost in a raging blizzard. Commentator: Allan Ashbolt"
