        "Episode of Series \"Man Alive\". This film discusses the problem of how to control the unruly young - whether it is best to persuade, punish or to beat. Shows a row about corporal punishment in a detention school; an argument in every home in the country; headmasters vote overwhelmingly to retain the cane; parents in difficulty struggle to find a way to discipline."
