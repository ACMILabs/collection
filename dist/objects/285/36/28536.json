        "An introduction to silk screen printing, using ordinary paints and paper. Although the film does not deal with the use of dyes and the process of printing on fabrics, it covers adequately the more elementary uses of the process, showing the cutting of the stencil (a lacquer stencil), the removal of the top layer, fitting the stencil to the screen, and drying the finished prints - in this case Christmas and greeting cards."
