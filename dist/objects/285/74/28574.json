        "Compares the nomads, a group of 500 Aborigines led by a white man, Don McLeod, in the Pilbara, Western Australia, with the Mugarinya people led by Aborigine, Peter Coffin. The former have little governmental help and find it difficult to come to terms with the disintegration of their culture, the latter run their own station and receive assistance."
