        "Abnormal shyness in children, its causes and how, through a greater understanding by parents and teachers, this problem may be dealt with. The lonely existence of a typical shy adult is portrayed, and the film then turns to a study of three children: Anna, shy but wistfully wanting association with others; Jimmy, whose excessive timidity is really a symptom of profound emotional disturbance; Robert, aloof but happily independent. Studying their conditions, a psychiatrist from the Child Guidance Clinic reveals the confidence-destroying demands of parents which predisposed the children to shyness. Together, teacher, psychiartrist and parents bring about a change in the children's attitides. (Awards: Cleveland; New York; Toronto; Boston; Manila.)"
