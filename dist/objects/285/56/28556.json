        "This film is an amusing animated cartoon made by Form I students from Moorabbin Technical College. It follows the activities of an \"automatic boot\" which takes the user wherever they may wish to go in a fantasy world. The producer's aim was to give the students an opportunity for creative work in which cooperation between students, descriptive writing, animation of the human form and self-disclipine would be required. Animation by Colin Jenkins and Andrew Mougemore. Painters - Neil Stevenson, Tony McFarland, Steven Witcraft, Dave Harmo, Emily McPherson, Trevor Williams."
