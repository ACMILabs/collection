        "Singapore is taken as an example of a city which exists by reason of its function as a port. Opening scenes introduce the harbour, Singapore River and statue of the founder, Sir Stamford Raffles. Maps illustrate Singapore's position of shipping routes and explains the reasons which lead Raffles to establish a port there. The scope and nature of port activities are illustrated. Local industries and resources, nature of the hinterland, malaria control and climate are dealt with. By means of maps and actual scenes, the nature of the different quaters of the city is examined in detail."
