        "An early Australian silent film , by the makers of \"The Reprieve\"' which appeared in the same year. A version of Adam Lindsay Gordon's poem, which appeared stanza by stanza before the illustrative sequences. The dying stockrider recalls his past life : mustering, ploughing, horsebreaking and pursuing bushrangers; and remembers his old friends and what became of them."
