        "A review of women's fashions in Britain from 1900-1960, showing the influence of historical events and social changes, and the alterations which fluctuating fashions imposed on the shape of the female body. Shows opulent Edwardian ballgowns, tubular dresses of the 1920's and elegant lines of the 1930's, the utility outfits of the war years, and some of the 1950's ready-to-wear clothing."
