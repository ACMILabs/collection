        "The method of vacuum fodder conservation, and its advantages. A stack is built on a black plastic groundsheet, inside a steel forming-ring which rises as the stack is built. A plastic dome is spread over the stack, sealed to the groundsheet and the air is then pumped out. The dome is removed and the consolidated stack covered with a plastic cover. This method of making silage adaptable to farm routine, permits conservation of difficult crops and involves minimum labour and waste of fodder."
