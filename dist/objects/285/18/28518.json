        "Sidney Nolan's interest in and pre-occupation with Australian history and legend have earned him the affectionate title \"The Songman of his tribe\". Nolan's imaginative and poetic vision is revealed in some 150 paintings. His earliest works and his series on Ned Kelly, Mrs Frazer, Bourke and Wills, the Australian outback, Eureka Stockade, Leda and the swan, and Gallipoli, give a rare insight into the mind and stature of this artist. Also shows the artist at work in his studio."
