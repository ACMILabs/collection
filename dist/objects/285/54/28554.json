        "Simplification in manufacturing and the consequent benefits to producer and consumer. How standardisation of sizes, reduction of the number of sizes and types of an article produced have resulted in smoother work flow, greater specialisation and reduced handling costs. Examples from the wood industry, where simplification has enabled well-designed furniture to be produced at very reasonable cost, while standard sizes of barrel staves and fruit and fish cases enable mills to use scrap wood and slack time knowing that the product can be readily sold as required. Stresses the relation between planned production, consumer needs and advertising. English soundtrack."
