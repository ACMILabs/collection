        "Singapore is one of the world's natural junctions, as Stamford Raffles, its founder, perceived little more than a century ago when it was only a fishing village. To-day it is a major world trading centre and one of the greatest international ports. The enterprise skill and toil of men of many races and creeds raised from a swamp this great city where over a million people live and prosper."
