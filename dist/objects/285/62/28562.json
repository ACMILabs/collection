        "A film which shows some of the attractions of Singapore. In this eastern city, great variety and contrast is packed into a small space. Its mixed population of Chinese, Indians and Malay with their varied and colorful clothing shape its customs and make its life. The shops with their exotic goods, tropical trees in the streets and the night life make Singapore an attractive city for tourists."
