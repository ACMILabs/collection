    "description": [
        "An elegant, silent meditation on different light forms as they emerge from and transform different obscure, shadowy environments. A miner's torch flickers across the walls of a cave, a candle flame flickers in a shadow dance, a bonfire blazes in the darkness, a trail of artificial lights illuminate a kitsch architectural structure. Creating a montage that takes its rhythms from the waxing and waning motions of the different light sources Austrian artist Lisl Ponger proposes a playful and poetic contemplation of light and shadow and their qualities when captured as cinematic images."
