        "Explores the history of the Afrikaners from the arrival of the Dutch in 1652 to South Africa in the 1970's with its Apartheid System. The film is useful for its historical significance. This film contains footage from the film by Barry Callaghan entitled \"South Africa/the white laager\". This film attempts to create an understanding of the historical events leading to and resulting in the Afrikaner rule of South Africa. It also examines the concept of racial superiority , and the connection between such ideology and economic profit."
