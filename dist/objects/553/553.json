    "description": [
        "\"Deep Space: Sensation & Immersion\" was an ACMI Screen Gallery Exhibition, held 26 October 2002 - 27 January 2003. See Exhibition activity record \"Deep Space\" (ID 3) for more information The international and Australian contemporary artists in this exibition present environments, or chambers, for the visitor to participate in an all encompassing aesthetic experience. The audience is invited to move within the art works, to explore their physical construction, their digital presence, their filmic pulse and their saturated expanses of colour and light. The experiences vary: some are quiet, some intangible, others humourous or uncanny. Each involves an ephemeral medium, whether it be light, video or digital imagery and each encloses the viewer in a confined space only to offer them access to another expanded sense of space altogether. This exhibition offers visitors a memorable and transformative experience of being immersed in 'deep space', the kineasthetic, visual, aural and informational totality of the art works."
