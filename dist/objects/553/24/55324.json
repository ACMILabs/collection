        "University of Victoria scientists have found that those people who accidently die in water, do so as a result of exposure rather than drowning. Hypothermia occurs when the body temperature drops to 80 degrees fahrenheit. In their research, the scientists have also found out how the body loses heat and how this can be minimised, and have designed a life jacket, which by helping to conserve body heat, can prolong life."
