        "Based on the Chinese traditional tale about a ruler, Duke Mu, who loved horses. When the position of chief groom for the royal stables must be filled, he sets the young aspirant for the job, Han Kan, the task of finding a \"superlative horse\" as a test of his ability to judge good horses. An allegory tale based on the book of the same title by Jean Merrill."
