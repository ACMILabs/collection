        "Bernd is the new security guard at the Metro underground. Just as he relaxes into the position, a stern boss dictates some impossible rules and young Bernd's day goes from bad to worse. Drawing on the aesthetic of the surveillance industry, director Bart Van den Bempt parallels surveillance type images alongside the running plot with split screens. As Bernd, infatuation by a young woman, tracks her movements using the security cameras, we the audience tour the process of security camera surveillance. The film style and structure become bound to the processes of surveillance, whilst the process of surveillance informs the film structure (specifically the narrative and the editing style)."
