        "Phoebe, Spencer, Felix and Mike have reached a point in their lives where they can no longer call Australia home. Is this due to the fact that they work at All American Videos, where 'too much is never enough'? It is in this video store that they devise a plan to rob a bank by combining several of their favourite films and create the perfect crime to escape out of their quarter acre black future."
