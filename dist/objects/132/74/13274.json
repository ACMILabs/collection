        "When their car breaks down on the way to Queensland, a family is forced to take up residence at a caravan park while the father tries to earn enough money to get the car repaired. Much of the film is seen through the eyes of their young son as he comes to realise some of the complexities of his parents' relationship. Great realist film from the director of 'Patriot Games' (1992), 'The Bone Collector' (1999) and 'Rabbit-Proof Fence' (2002). Based on the story by John Emery. Photography by Tom Cowan, editing by Anthony Buckley and production assistant, Gillian Armstrong. Original Format 16mm/black and white."
