        "A film about trust, about an accident, about falling out of love and about emerging from grief. Flux was created entirely on a desktop Macintosh using Adobe AfterEffects and Adobe Photoshop. It was then transferred to 35mm film using a Solitair Film Recorder. It is listed by Lynden Barber (film critic for The Australian newspaper) as one of '12 Film Breakthroughs' for its achievement as the first Australian film post-produced entirely on a home computer. WARNING: This film contains scenes that may disturb some viewers."
