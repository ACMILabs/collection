        "Set in the Beatlemania of the 1960s, this is a stylised account of girlhood - where perversion is innocent, family is strange and adulthood lonely. From the director of 'The Piano' (1993) and 'In the Cut' (2003). Original format 16mm/black and white. WARNING: Some scenes may cause offence to some viewers."
