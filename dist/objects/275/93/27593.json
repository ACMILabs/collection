        "Explains the theory behind the experimental adoption of programmed learning in a high school. Shows how programmed learning using TEMAC offers a creative, new approach to both learning, unlike the old lock-step method with the whole class proceeding together. After analysis of the act of learning, the material, ninth grade Algebra, is presented, psychologically arranged into segments, shows in one frame at a time, so that the first step must be taken individually before it is possible to take the second. Shows 34 8 th grade pupils, working through the course, and also how the method can be applied in language laboratories and in controlling electronic equipment."
