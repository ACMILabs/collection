        "Printmaking can be divided into four basic methods: serigraph, or silk-screen; woodcut; lithograph; and intaglio, which includes dry-point, mezzotint, engraving, etching and aquatint. In the workshops of four printmakers we see how each method progresses from sketch to finished print, including the special equipment and skills required by each method. Differences in production and the finished artwork are contrasted."
