        "Episode of Series \"Building Political Leadership\". Dr Marbury Ogle says that man has always organised groups to help him achieve what was beyond the capacity of one person. In America there are at least 300,000 formal and informal pressure groups, which try to direct, educate and motivate members, to win over the general public and to try to influence the government by lobbying. The lobbyist may act as a valuable informal consultant to a politician while his group may give minorities a chance to express their needs."
