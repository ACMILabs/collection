        "Episode of Series \"Principles of Chemical Processes\" The plant used at Baglan Bay to convert ethylene and chlorine to vinyl chloride involves three main processes. The first part examines the materials flow and plant operations in each of these processes, and how the three processes are integrated to produce a continuous process. The remainder is concerned with a theoretical analysis of the equipment and operating conditions"
