        "An open-ended film which examines life inside a women's prison. The women in the institution are still very much alive and therefore still grappling with the same human concerns as the rest of us - except that incarceration serves to heighten those problems. Individual inmates and staff members of the prison express their attitudes, concerns, doubts and hopes."
