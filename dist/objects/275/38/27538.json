        "A study of a number of different methods of stock control. A small company which has to invest heavily in machinery is compared with one which has to invest in comparatively large stocks of material - the points made are then applied to larger companies. Shows application of stock control to volatile and inflammable liquids, paperback books, and the raw materials of food canning industry."
