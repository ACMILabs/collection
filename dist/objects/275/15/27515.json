        "Animation s used to explain the operation of the dry cell in terms of electron action, including ionisation of the electrolyte, electron flow through a circuit, action at electrodes, polarization and depolarisation. Demonstrations reveal the operating characteristics of a cell and of several cells (as in a battery) in both series and parallel connexions."
