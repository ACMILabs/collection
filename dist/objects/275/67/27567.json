        "Episode of Series \"Educational Psychology\". A portrayal of a modern American school in which the curriculum concentrates on meeting the needs of the students. Here learning is done in terms of adjustment to everyday problems. There are classes in English, biology, civics, drawing, aviation, poultry raising, and other fundamentals to modern living. Each subject is translated in terms of pupil experience and pupil needs. With such enrichments of the school curriculum, the pupil appreciates the relationship between his in-school and out-of school activities; the drop out problem cases to exist for the ground on which it flourished has been removed."
