        "Too hot to sleep I took a walk during siesta through two Barcelona suburbs, Pedralbes and Les Corts. Adjacent to each other only in location. I wandered through the tree lined streets and deserted apartment blocks, 'pry to close (a tip from a local) and they'll escort you out of there'. The only signs of humanity amongst the empty sound of sprinklers were the pool cleaners, gardeners and maids, quietly maintaining an order. A contrast to the jubilant cries of children playing after school, rushing through the sun filled holes knee down on skateboards, playing soccer on a concrete field defined by its long shadows cast by the superstructures of high density public housing, their home."
