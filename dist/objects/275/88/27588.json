        "An investigation of some theories of psychoanalysis, and personality growth in relation to the work of Dr Erik Erikson, of Harvard University, a pioneer in the field of child analysis and research. Part 2 deals with the Libido theory, Ego-identity, Identity crisis, Positive and negative identity, existentialism, cross-cultural research, fixation and the value of psycho-therapy. The ensuing discussion touches upon Erikson's relationship to the theories of Freud; additions and modifications to subsequent theories; the crisis of adolescence; and the problems facing psycho-analysis today."
