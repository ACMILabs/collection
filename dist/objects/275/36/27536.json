        "Demonstrates two simple law of friction which comes into play when two solid surfaces come into contact with a fluid interposed. Examples of important machines in which such contacts occur are given with a variety of conditions ranging from complete separation of surfaces by a film of fluid to the case where no fluid at all is present. Discusses ways of reducing wear and friction, lubricants viscosity and modes o lubrication."
