        "Episode of Series \"E.F.V.A. Primary Botany\". This film considers the function of pollination and the methods by which it is brought about. The characteristics of wind- and insect-pollinated flowers are illustrated and compared and the mechanisms for avoiding self-pollination are considered. Familiar garden examples are widely used and the resources of cine- macrography and time-lapse are fully exploited."
