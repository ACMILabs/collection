        "The four basic problems of the Middle East: minorities, agriculture, industries and education are discussed. The area has been the home of many civilizations each of which has left its influence on the cultural, religious, and social life of the country so that you get a number of ethnic groups proud of their history, language and religion and resisting the domination of ruling governments. The conflict between Israel and the Arab nation is discussed and the conditions of life is Israel are shown."
