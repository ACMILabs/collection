        "Dramatizes incidents to provoke discussion on problems of human communication. Unexpressed misunderstandings between Philip Baxter, a typical executor, and his personnel apply to many situations. After each episode, problems and skills in communication are discussed. In an allegorical sequence, Mr Baxter is judged by a signalman and a jury of his mates for failing to give and receive signals. A solution to the problem of communication is offered by the signalman."
