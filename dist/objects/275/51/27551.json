        "A most intimate and detailed study of the Kingfisher, one of Britain's most brilliant birds - it has a dazzling cobalt blue back, bright orange under parts, and scarlet feet. Follows the fortunes of a pair of birds through the year. They are shown in sunshine and snow, above water and below, and around their nest hole. Narrated by Peter Scott."
