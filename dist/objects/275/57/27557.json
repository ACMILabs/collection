        "Few people, faced with the complicated machinery of the law, know how to proceed without legal counsel or defence. Yet many are unable to pay for the services of a lawyer. The Law Societies of many of the provinces, encouraged by the Canadian Bar Association, extend help in the form of free legal-aid clinics staffed by volunteer lawyers. Enacted here is a case in which a young man facing a criminal charge is defended by a legal-aid lawyer."
