        "In 1961 at Yale University one of the most famous learning experiments in the history of psychology shocked the world.The experiment was an eloquent and sophisticated piece of artifice aimed at convincing the subjects (Milgram named them Teachers) that they really were administering extreme shocks to an unwilling victim. The disturbing results shown that in the context of following orders we are capable of unquestioningly causing the suffering of others. UK conceptual Artist Rod Dickinson in his work has precisely recreated the extraordinary drama that occurred and the troubling questions that it raises about humanity."
