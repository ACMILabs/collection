        "Introduces the subject of transverse progressive waves by Illustrating a pulse being sent down a stretched rope. Shows its velocity of travel to be dependent upon the elastic and inertial factors. Employs a stretched string to show steady waves train propagation, and identifies and relates waves length and frequency. Longitudinal wave disturbance is shown by a pulse moving down a row of beads connected by light-weight strings."
