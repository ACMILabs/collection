        "A restrained dramatic presentation of the problems of personal relationships and private worries in the office. A cleaner find mute evidence of the past day's tensions as she moves around each desk. The office boy feels he is learning nothing; a clerk is extremely tense; a young mother worried about the child who must be left alone in the house; an executive is continually short-tempered and panicky; the manger has too full a timetable to do more than notice the existence of these problems."
