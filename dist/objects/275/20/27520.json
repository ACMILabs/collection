        "The progress of Britain's wool cloth industry from traditional handworking through invention of the spinning jenny, flying shuttle and powered loom to modern fully automated production. The story is traced in a blend of animation and live action. Searching for her Fairy Prince, the Princess models her way through a range of modern fashions, all styled in wool."
