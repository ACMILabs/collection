        "Every four years the political parties of the United States engage in an internal power struggle in the process of nominating candidates for the presidency. The big effort at the party convention - and in the preconvention campaigns - is to find the man who can win. This film portrays the variety of means a contestant can successfully pursue to become his party's candidate. Original footage of conventions is used to illustrate the selection process. Narrated by Robert Ryan."
