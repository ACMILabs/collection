        "Episode of Series \"Management Techniques\". One of a series of films about some of the problems of planning, and of trying to achieve control through forecasts, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized firms. Most critical production decisions are made before anything has been produced. Care must be taken to avoid vital errors in such things as shop floor layout when plans are first made."
