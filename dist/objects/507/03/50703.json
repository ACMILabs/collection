        "A collection of cinematic excerpts along with interviews with Hermes Pan, choreographer extraordinaire who created many of the most memorable musical dance moments in the era of the major Hollywood musicals. The film is a biographical study of Pan's entry into the world of dance, his arrival in Hollywood, and his work with a variety of filmmakers, actors and dancers. Ultimately, it is also a tribute to his contribution to musical film history as the documentary was completed very shortly before his death. Also featuring discussion about and footage of dance greats such as Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth, Kim Novak, Bob Fosse, Ann Miller, Carol Haney, Elizabeth Taylor, Cyd Charisse and Hermes Pan himself in rare motion picture appearances, the documentary is a personalised insight into the Hollywood musical era with reflective commentary from Pan in the presentation of its archival contents."
