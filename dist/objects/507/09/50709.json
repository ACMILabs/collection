        "This film aims to demystify the outdated perceptions on youth prostitution. Continually throughout Canada pimps scour shopping malls, streets and schoolyards scouting for new recruits. This docu-drama illustrates how young girls from all economic backgrounds are being lured into the trade. The pimps more than before have grown in sophistication and use seductive and cunning methods to gain the trust and control over their unsuspecting victims. The film illustrates how psychological techniques are used to persuade the vulnerable into a state of trust. The rest is downhill from there."
