        "This is a biographical made for television feature length film based on the book \"Bud & Lou\" by Bob Thomas which attempts to portray both the personal and professional lives of the comedic partnership of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. It follows their career from the Burlesque days, through to broadway, radio, Hollywood and eventually television, entertaining millions along the way. They were renowned for their generosity to charitable causes and were heavily involved with the War Bond drives during WWII but each had their own personal demons to deal with including Lou's problem with gambling and Bud's problems with drinking and epilepsy. Harvey Korman stars as Bud Abbott, Buddy Hackett as Lou Costello, and Arte Johnson plays their loyal agent Eddie Sherman. Cast also includes Michele Lee (as Lou's wife), Robert Reed, Donald Hotton, Harry Solin."
