    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Chris Carter's long running cult series which explores the paranormal and the paranoid, introduced us to the covert world of FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and its now famous mantra, \"The truth is out there\". It all begins when special agent Dana Scully is assigned to debunk a project known as the X-files, which are reserved for unsolved cases with a paranormal twist. The man leading these investigations is agent Fox Mulder or Spooky Mulder as he is known by his mocking co-workers. Of course the sceptical Scully ends up joining Mulder in his quest for the 'truth' as they delve into a labyrinth of secret government plots, covert organizations within organizations and insidious extraterrestrial conspiracies. \"Young at heart\" (1994): A criminal believed to have died years ago wages a vendetta against Mulder. \"E.B.E.\" (1994): Scully and Mulder's attempts to track down the government's secret transportation of an alien life form are thwarted by unknown enemies. \"Miracle man\" (1994): The agents investigate a young man who has the ability to heal and kill with the touch of his hand. \"Shapes\" (1994): The agents track a wolf-like creature believed to be part of native American folklore. \"Darkness falls\" (1994): A group of loggers working in a remote forest unearth thousands of deadly insect-like creatures.
