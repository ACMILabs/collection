        "'Bad boys of Hollywood' provides an irreverent look at the changing face of Hollywood and the men who contributed to the 'bad boy' image of Hollywood during the 20th Century. Errol Flynn is featured with behind the scenes stories of his drinking, philandering and devil may care mischief making. Sean Penn gives meaning to the phrase \"Let's party!\" and Steve McQueen provides a bunch of Hollywood producers with his version of 'piss-take' humour. Presented are many stories about these bad but lovable rogues, men who symbolised a changing society and reached iconic status for their off-screen antics. Narrated by Jeff Lupetin this video also features: Ronald Reagan, Marlon Brando, Robert Mitchum, Jack Nicholson, James Dean and John Belushi. WARNING: POOR QUALITY SOUND LEVEL"
