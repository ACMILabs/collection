        "This collection of short animated films spans 50 years of Len Lye's experimental filmmaking. All but 'Rhythm' (1957) use 'direct film' techniques dispensing with the camera to paint and scratch directly onto the film surface. Lye's abstract films influenced and led the way for experimental filmmaking and filmmakers such as Norman McLaren and Stan Brakhage amongst many others. He incorporated musical soundtracks of mostly tribal and percussive themes that reflected his interest in rhythm and movement as in 'Free radicals' (1958) and 'Particles in Space'(1979) as well as jazz and blues soundtracks (the music of Tal Farlow and Sonny Terry were also used)."
