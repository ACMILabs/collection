        "An irresponsible, neurotic child spreads a slanderous rumour about a lesbian relationship between the two headmistresses of an exclusive private girls' school. Wyler and executive producer Walter Mirisch decided to return to the play by Lillian Hellman that had been the basis of the 1936 production, 'These Three', also directed by Wyler. This time they intended to remain faithful to the play to an extent that had not been possible in the earlier film due to the restrictive Production Code. However, 'The Children's Hour' was attacked by critics for being too faithful to what they saw as the dated original (a criticism with which Hellman herself apparently concurred). What stands up today is Hepburn's understated playing and MacLaine's commitment to the role of a possessive lesbian. This was the first major Hollywood production to deal with lesbianism although the word is never actually spoken. Cast includes Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine, James Garner, Miriam Hopkins, Fay Bainter."
