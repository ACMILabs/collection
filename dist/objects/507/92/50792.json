        "Ghosts, haunted houses, poltergeists, exorcisms, the supernatural, this documentary explores it all. But what is more interesting is the focus on Hollywood and the films which have been produced, based either on pure fantasy or \"real-life\" experiences. Hosted by John Carradine, Hollywood ghost stories presents film excerpts, interviews and eye witness accounts from Hollywood producers, actors, set hands to authors, psychologists, and sceptics. William Peter Blatty, author of \"The Exorcist\" (1973) discusses strange occurrences which took place during production; Elke Sommer talks about her experiences living in a haunted house; Thelma Moss, Psychologist, compares the film \"Poltergeist\" (1982) with real-life poltergeists; Frank DeFellita, author and producer of \"The Entity\" (1981) comments on haunted houses and how \"The Entity\" was based on a true experience. Also features appearances by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Susan Strasberg and includes excerpts from many of the earlier Hollywood films such as \"Mystic circle murder\" (1939), \"I Married a witch\" (1942) and \"It's a wonderful life\" (1946)."
