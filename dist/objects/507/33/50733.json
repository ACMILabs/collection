        "Danny Ocean (Frank Sinatra) gathers together a group of ex-army buddies for an ambitious heist - the robbery of several casinos on New Year's eve. His gang include playboy Jimmy (Peter Lawler), lounge lizard Sam (Dean Martin) and garbage man Josh (Sammy Davis Jnr) among others. At the time of production these very actors made up the crew known as the Rat Pack. Led by Sinatra, the Rat Pack were infamous for their carousing, womanising, drinking, entertaining and swinging image and in this film they do not stray far from their real life personas. \"Ocean's eleven\" is not a film that treats the heist genre seriously in that it lacks any real tension of great films of that type. Rather, the film's joys are derived from its 1960s aesthetic, the machinations of the sartorial Rat Pack at play, and the musical numbers courtesy of Davis and Martin. Also stars: Angie Dickinson , Cesar Romero, Shirley MacLaine, Joey Bishop and Red Skelton."
