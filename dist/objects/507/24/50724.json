        "Iranian actor turned director, Majid Majidi, has enjoyed commercial and critical success for his humanist portrayals of contemporary Iranian society. \"Children of heaven\", nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 1999 Academy Awards, is a simple yet tender film about a young boy, Ali, who accidentally loses his sister, Zahra's, only pair of shoes immediately after having them repaired. Though Zahra is distraught, Ali convinces her not to tell their father, who is already burdened with the responsibilities of supporting a family, including a sick wife, on a meagre wage, and is prone to react violently and irrationally. They agree to keep the news hidden and to share Ali's one pair of sneakers; an arrangement that involves Zahra rushing from a half day at school at midday to give Ali the sneakers in order for him to attend school in the afternoon. Throughout the film, Ali's sustained efforts to organise his sister another pair of shoes are continually frustrated. Overall, \"Children of heaven\" is a poignant, sentimental portrait of class difference in Iran and the struggle of a poor family. It opts for simple imagery - including shots of nature and the children's faces - to establish a sense of innocence and humanity about its story. It clearly posits the children as the hope of the future - Ali is the top student in his class as well as being physically superior and mature, whilst Zahra is virtuous and innocent. And despite their impoverished circumstances, their innocence ensure these children belong to heaven. In Farsi with English subtitles."
