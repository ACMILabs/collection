        "Written and directed by David Mamet (The Winslow boy, The Spanish prisoner) \"State and Main\" is a humorous tale about the making of a big-budget Hollywood film in small town USA. Walt Price is a director in pre-production for his latest flick, \"The Old mill\" and plagued by problems. Having fled New Hampshire under a cloud, Price and his production team arrive in Waterford, Vermont, assuming that local inhabitants will be a pushover. Among Price's hurdles are: leading man Bob Barrenger, whose hobby is picking up underage girls; leading actress Claire who has decided not to reveal her breasts for this particular film; writer Joseph Turner White who's script has to be altered as the old mill has burnt down, making his title (and much of his script) redundant. Some locals take to the interlopers, but others seek to manipulate them to make a buck. Town folk include Ann, an amateur writer who assists White with his screenplay; Carla, a teenager with designs on Barrenger; and George Bailey, the mayor intent on making his town famous. \"State and Main\" is layered with numerous stories about the creation of a Hollywood film. Starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Rebecca Pidgeon, William H. Macy, Sarah Jessica Parker and Julia Stiles."
