        "A studio recording of the renowned Netherlands Dance Theatre's interpretation of Stravinsky's Les Noces (Svadebka). Choreographed by Jiri Kylian, the piece pictures the ceremony of a traditonal Russian country wedding through a fusion of ballet with some contemporary influences. The dance engages with the rapid pace and intricate rhythms of Stravinsky's score in a spirited evocation of the mystery of marriage, both its beauty and apprehension, particularly for the bride to be."
