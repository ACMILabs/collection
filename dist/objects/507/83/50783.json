        "Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is a very handsome young man and an heir to a huge family fortune. At a party he meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and for the first time in his life, he feels love. However, his jealous girlfriend causes a horrific accident which leaves Cesar mutilated, his once beautiful face now disfigured. Furthermore, the accident seems to have thrown Cesar into a nightmare world in which he is accused of murder and one from which he is unable to escape. Told in flashback by Cesar who is being held in a prison for the mentally insane, \"Open your eyes\" is by turns a horror film, a love story, and a metaphysical puzzle which plays with our notions of beauty, faith and truth. Cameron Crowe remade \"Open your eyes\" as the Hollywood film, \"Vanilla sky\". In Spanish with English subtitles."
