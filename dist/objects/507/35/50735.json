    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Chris Carter's long running cult series which explores the paranormal and the paranoid, introduced us to the covert world of FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and its now famous mantra, \"The truth is out there\". It all begins when special agent Dana Scully is assigned to debunk a project known as the X-files, which are reserved for unsolved cases with a paranormal twist. The man leading these investigations is agent Fox Mulder or Spooky Mulder as he is known by his mocking co-workers. Of course the sceptical Scully ends up joining Mulder in his quest for the 'truth' as they delve into a labyrinth of secret government plots, covert organizations within organizations and insidious extraterrestrial conspiracies. \"Shadows\" (1993): Mulder and Scully investigate the deaths of two men killed by a powerful psychokinetic force. \"Ghost in the machine\" (1993): Scully and Mulder investigate the death of a corporate executive who may have been murdered by an intelligent computer. \"Ice\" (1993): When a team of Geologists are murdered at a remote Alaskan outpost, Scully and Mulder are called in to investigate, believing that the deaths were caused by a parasitic alien life form. \"Space\" (1993): When a space shuttle mission is sabotaged, Mulder believes that it is the work of a benevolent alien spirit. \"Fallen angel\" (1993): The future of the X-files hangs in the balance when Mulder secretly infiltrates a government cover-up of a UFO crash.
