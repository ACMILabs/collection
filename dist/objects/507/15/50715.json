        "In \"Dark days\", first-time filmmaker Marc Singer has documented the lives of the tunnel-dwellers living in deserted segments of New York's subway network. Shot in stark black and white and illuminated by a single spotlight, we follow the journey of these dignified and articulate characters from the homeless drudgery of the tunnel to public housing above the ground, which offers some hope for the future. Along the way they strive to overcome drug addiction, rat infestation, and chronic destitution, not to mention tension in their relationships with fellow inhabitants; all while maintaining a strength which shatters society's myths of homelessness. The tunnel- dwellers acted not only as the subjects for this documentary, but also producers and crewmembers, fighting for their voice to be heard and their story to be told. Featuring a soundtrack by DJ Shadow, \"Dark days\" is a moving and very human portrayal of life in the bowels of the western world."
