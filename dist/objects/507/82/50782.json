        "This documentary traces musician Bob Marley's rise from the violence and poverty of the slums of Jamaica to become a cultural icon, symbol of Rastafarianism, black politics and civil rights. Initially Marley had difficulty in getting his music heard in Jamaica, but eventually his sound grew in popularity. Whilst travelling in America, Marley was influenced by images of the Afro-American uprising of the civil rights movement, causing his writing to become much more political. Upon his return to Jamaica Marley soon turned to Rastafarianism - a specifically Jamaican movement, banned under Colonial rule, that married black consciousness with spiritual awareness. Being a Rastafarian revolutionised Marley's music and politics, making him a powerful force for the black human rights cause, as well as a political ally and danger to the leaders of the country. This documentary includes interviews with Rita Marley (his widow), Lee Scratch Perry, The Wailers, lovers, producers, collaborators, friends and colleagues in the music industry, politicians and family members. Contains archival footage of Marley, film clips, interviews and live shows. Songs include: Rebel music, Judge not, Soul rebel, Corner store, Put it on, One love, Stir it up and Its alright."
