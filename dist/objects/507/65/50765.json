        "Written, directed and starring John Cameron Mitchell, and based on his award-winning Off-Broadway musical, \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" is a startling and moving musical about difference and love. Hedwig started life as a boy in East Germany but when he falls in love with an American GI, he makes the ultimate sacrifice, by cutting off his genitalia to an \"angry inch\". Unfortunately, all the GI offers Hedwig back in the USA is life in a trailer park. Hedwig uses his ample imagination to write songs but credit for them is taken by his nemesis (and one true love), Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt II). While Hedwig is forced to tour second-rate restaurants and night clubs, Tommy Gnosis has become a huge star. Hedwig won't rest till Tommy acknowledges both his love and his debt. Featuring an electrifying performance by Mitchell in the title role, and a wonderful set of songs which manage to pay homage to both punk and old theatrical musicals, \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" is a defiant celebration of independence and gender confusion. Made on a miniscule budget, the film boasts inventive art direction and design. Mitchell's perseverance and courage has paid off. The film has won numerous international film awards including a special prize at the Berlin Film Festival 2001 and the Audience Award and the Best Director Award at the Sundance Film Festival, 2001."
