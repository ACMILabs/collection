    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Chris Carter's long running cult series which explores the paranormal and the paranoid, introduced us to the covert world of FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and its now famous mantra, \"The truth is out there\". It all begins when special agent Dana Scully is assigned to debunk a project known as the X-files, which are reserved for unsolved cases with a paranormal twist. The man leading these investigations is agent Fox Mulder or Spooky Mulder as he is known by his mocking co-workers. Of course the sceptical Scully ends up joining Mulder in his quest for the 'truth' as they delve into a labyrinth of secret government plots, covert organizations within organizations and insidious extraterrestrial conspiracies. \"Eve\" (1993): Scully and Mulder investigate the disappearance of two girls whose fathers are murdered in identical fashion. \"Fire\" (1993): When a man with pyrokinetic powers starts murdering members of the British aristocracy, Scully and Mulder join forces with an inspector from Scotland yard to track down the killer. \"Beyond the sea\" (1994): Scully begins to believe that a killer (Brad Dourif) on death row has psychic powers and holds the key to apprehending a vicious murderer. \"Gender bender\" (1994): A religious sect member with the capability of changing gender becomes the prime suspect in a murder investigation. \"Lazarus\" (1994): A dangerous criminal infiltrates the mind of an FBI agent who also happens to be Scully's ex-boyfriend.
