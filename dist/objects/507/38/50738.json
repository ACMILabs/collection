        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Chris Carter's long running cult series which explores the paranormal and the paranoid, introduced us to the covert world of FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and its now famous mantra, \"The truth is out there\". It all begins when special agent Dana Scully is assigned to debunk a project known as the X-files, which are reserved for unsolved cases with a paranormal twist. The man leading these investigations is agent Fox Mulder or Spooky Mulder as he is known by his mocking co-workers. Of course, the sceptical Scully ends up joining Mulder in his quest for the 'truth' as they delve into a labyrinth of secret government plots, covert organizations within organizations and insidious extraterrestrial conspiracies. \"Tooms\" (1994): Freak of nature Eugene Tooms, whom Mulder helped incarcerate, is released on parole. \"Born again\" (1994): An eight year old girl is the prime suspect in a series of gruesome, seemingly unrelated murders. \"Roland\" (1994): A mentally challenged janitor comes under suspicion when a scientist at a aeronautics lab dies under mysterious circumstances. \"The Erlenmeyer flask\" (1994): In the final episode for season one, Mulder's secret source, 'Deep throat', tips him off on a plot involving the cloning of extraterrestrial viruses.
