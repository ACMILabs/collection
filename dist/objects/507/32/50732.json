        "Produced and directed by the late Ted Demme, Blow hurtles through three heady decades in the life of notorious drug dealer George Jung (Johnny Depp). From Jung's early days selling marijuana on California beaches, through to multi-million dollar cocaine deals with gun-toting Columbians, Demme takes full advantage of the changing music, clothes and hairstyles of the 60's, 70's and 80's. The fast pace, black humour and violence of the drug world is tempered by the gentler story of Jung's failed relationships with his father (Ray Liotta) and his daughter. Cast includes Penelope Cruz, Rachael Griffiths, Paul Reubens, Jordi Molla and Franka Potente."
