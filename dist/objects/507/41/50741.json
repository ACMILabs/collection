        "An animated feast of music and visuals. Featuring a soundtrack of classical music, including selections by Bach, Tchaikovsky and Moussorgsky, the film weds animated narratives to the famous musical pieces. \"Fantasia\" includes one of Disney's most loved sequences, \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". At its best the film's animation remains magical and visually breath-taking."
