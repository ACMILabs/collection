        "Based on true events and the novel by Max Catto, \"A Hill in Korea\" is a portrayal of a small group of British soldiers in action during the Korean War. Their combined enemy is communism and the Chinese soldiers who have landed in North Korea to support the North Korean Army. Whilst performing a routine sweep of a small communist-held village, the British patrol unwittingly find themselves trapped and surrounded by an army of Chinese soldiers. It becomes a life and death battle as they attempt to escape, but inevitably they are forced to the top of a small hill where the last stand is made in a deserted Buddhist Temple. Starring George Baker, Stanley Baker, Harry Andrews and featuring - briefly - a very young Michael Caine making his film debut and Robert Shaw in a supporting role in only his second film. Cast also includes Michael Medwin, Ronald Lewis, Stephen Boyd, Victor Maddern, Harry Landis."
