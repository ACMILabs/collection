        "A selection of short films and excerpts from the forties that apply visual effects to live action footage of animals so they appear to be talking and singing. While some segments are mildly amusing, the ones that feature monkeys performing humiliating tricks are less so. \"Who's who in animal land\" and \"And their families\" won Academy Awards for Best Short Feature."
