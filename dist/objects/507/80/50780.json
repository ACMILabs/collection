        "Destry rides again is an old style Hollywood western with comic elements, starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart. The film is set in Bottleneck, a lawless frontier town, where the sheriff is helpless to stop continuous reckless violence. It is quickly established that Bottleneck is ruled by the crooked and unscrupulous Kent (Brian Donleavy). Frenchy (Dietrich) is Kent's girlfriend, a wild and lusty bar room singer, who aids Kent's schemes. Into Bottleneck a new deputy sheriff arrives - the unassuming, mild-mannered and non-gun-carrying Tom Destry (Stewart). Destry lives in the shadow of his father's reputation, a famed sharp shooter and lawman. Destry's non-violent reconciliatory manner is mocked at length by most of the town folk. Destry has to prove himself to the residents of Bottleneck, who distrust his style. Frenchy and Tom strike up a friendship that hints of potential romance. Dietrich has several singing numbers, including \"See what the boys in the back room will have\". \"Destry rides again\" also features a catfight between Frenchy and a disgruntled wife, lasting two minutes and involving punching, hair pulling, scratching, and clothes ripping. Stewart and Dietrich have a wonderful onscreen rapport which makes \"Destry rides again\" a delight to watch."
