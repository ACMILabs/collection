        "Kurosawa: A documentary on the acclaimed director by Adam Low explores the genius of Kurosawa's filmmaking in the post-war environment of Japan. The documentary affirms the volatile socio-political environment in Japan at the time affecting Kurosawa's work and why Kurosawa came to such notable recognition for his films in Japan and throughout the world. The synergy of Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune is explored as well as his relationship with long time associate Teruyo Nogami. The documentary features extended clips from Kurosawa's films including: \"Sanshiro sugata\", \"The Most beautiful\", \"The Men who tread on the tiger's tail\", \"No regrets for our youth\", \"Drunken angel\", \"Rashomon\", \"Ikiru\", \"Seven samurai\", \"Throne of blood\", \"Yojimbo\", \"Red beard\", \"Dodes'ka-den\", \"Dersu uzala\", \"Kagemusha\", \"Ran\", \"Dreams\", \"Madadayo\". With interviews by: James Coburn, Clint Eastwood, Machiko Kyo, Isuzu Yamada, Tatsuya Nakadai, Kon Ichikawa, Tadao Sato and Donald Richie."
