        "This illuminating documentary explores the career of New Zealand artist and filmmaker Len Lye, drawing on recently discovered footage of the artist discussing his pioneering 'direct film' technique and working on his large kinetic steel sculptures (beautifully shot by Leon Narby). New Zealand sculptor Evan Webb, who has dedicated his career to preserving the original intention and legacy of Len Lye, is interviewed about the process of realising some of Len Lye large scale projects posthumously. It is Lye's lifetime study of movement that drives the content of the documentary. His purists explorations from his films to sculpture and his search for a sense of harmonics - 'the natural frequency of materials' is captured here. The film includes footage of his films \"Colour box\" (1935) and sculptures 'Wind Wand', 'Round Head', 'Fountain', 'Blade' and 'Trilogy: Flip & Two Twisters'."
