        "The history of skateboarding in Australia is traced in this documentary from the period in the mid 1960's when surfers used skating as a pastime between waves. A revival in the mid 1970's through improved board and wheel technology and the influence of American skaters saw the formation of skateboard teams who perfected freestyle techniques. It was also during this time that some emerging gangs ventured into the vertical style. Later on, ramp competitions and extreme sports extravaganza occurred. Featuring Australia's best skateboarders in interview, the history of Australian skateboarding is told through early home movie film footage and video, along with a couple of news report extracts. Also features footage from the classic skateboard short - \"Skaterdater\"."
