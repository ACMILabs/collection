        "Assembled here is an amazing and rare collection of commercials and important tv messages made between the 40s to the mid 80s starring some of Hollywood's greatest actors and actresses. The varying quality of some of the advertisements is due to the rarity of the original film sources and includes commercials that capture great historical moments, for example: Humphrey Bogart promoting Red Cross during during filming on \"Casablanca\". John Wayne represents Crosby Shoes in an ad that used the feet of five hanged men to display the shoes. After 72 takes he declared, \"noboby's perfect\". James Dean appears in a community announcement warning of the dangers of fast driving. He prophetically quips upon exiting about the potential of his own death, ironically two weeks before he was killed in a car crash. John Lennon sells 'peace' in an amazing 'bed-in' manoeuvre not to be forgotten. This collection includes stars (amongst many others) as: Anne Margaret, Buster Keaton, Laurel & Hardy, Groucho Marx, Ronald Reagan, Betty Grable, Elvis Presley, Jack Benny, Richard Burton, Red Skelton, Bob Hope, Dick Van Dyke, Jane Wyman, Marilyn Monroe, the Three Stooges."
