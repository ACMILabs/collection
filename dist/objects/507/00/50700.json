        "Two men in love, Barney (Joel Edgerton) and Dimi (Damian Walshe-Howling) head up to Sydney from Melbourne on a road trip. Whilst on the way, the boys make a stop at Bonegilla, a migrant camp used in the 1950's where Dimi's parents had first met and lived. They continue onto Sydney, where Barney's father, an aged-hippie struggles with the day-to-day practicalities of \"living\" with a terminal illness. As both Barney and Dimi's love for each other intensifies, they revisit past memories as they address new experiences that test a maturing relationship. Issues of race, drugs, sexuality and family are brought to the surface with an affecting warmth that endears us to the characters. Story and screenplay written by Christos Tsiolkas."
