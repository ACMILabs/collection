        "The soundtrack for the Coen brother's film 'O brother, where art thou' was to generate such interest for American bluegrass - also known as 'mountain music' to the initiated - that a concert of the musicians and this documentary were organised in Nashville at the Ryman Auditorium on May 24th 2000. T Bone Burnett was approached by the Coen brothers to source the musicians for the soundtrack. He gathered an electic mix of the traditional, authentic and contemporary alternative country and bluegrass music that serve to inform the breadth of this music tradition. Featuring as MC to the night is the now deceased John Hartford whose spirit and legendary status for his knowledge and musicianship of bluegrass music is captured in this documentary. The performers (amongst others) include: Fairfield Four, Alison Krauss & Union Station featuring Dan Tyminski, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, The Cox Family, The Whites, Chris Thomas King, Colin Linden, Emmylou Harris and the soul of the show in the voice of Ralph Stanley. The documentary also includes backstage preparations and rehearsals. Directed by D A Pennebaker, Chris Hegedus and Nick Doob."
