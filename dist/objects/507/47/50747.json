        "1971--New Zealand soldiers are heading off to Vietnam amidst hordes of peace protesters and the heady excitement of a solar eclipse. In a column of soldiers stopped to board a military truck, Geoff catches sight of Bunnie, a beautiful hippy whose glorious, intimate smile is the lasting vision he takes with him to war. Destiny brings the pair together a second time, when Geoff returns from Vietnam a few months later. Each has been badly hurt in different ways, but in spite of their personal damage, they fall instantly and passionately in love. They start a life together and Bunnie gives birth to a baby girl. Their lives should be joyously complete, but one day, Geoff and the baby mysteriously disappear, leaving Bunnie devastated. Years later, in the 1990s, Bunnie accepts help from Cassandra, a young woman who claims to be a clairvoyant, to find out what has become of her child. Cassandra brings the couple back together again to solve the mystery of what really happened. Their memories are startlingly different, but pieced together, the truth emerges, bringing escalating consequences. Cast includes Danielle Cormack, Kevin Smith, Amber Sainsbury and Joel Tobeck."
