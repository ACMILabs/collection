        "Known best for his realist depictions of contemporary working class English lives, \"Topsy-turvy\" finds Mike Leigh exploring the nineteenth century world of the London stage. The successful operatic team of Gilbert and Sullivan find that they have had their first flop after two decades of successful collaboration. Sullivan, the team's composer (played by Allan Corduner), blames the stale storylines of Gilbert (Jim Broadbent). It is not until Gilbert visits an exhibition of Japanese culture that he finds inspiration again. This leads him to the creation of the story of \"The Mikado\", one of the duo's most successful productions. Though \"Topsy-turvy\" offers a fascinating biography of Gilbert and Sullivan - one that does not shy away from examining Sullivan's obsession with brothels and intoxication, or Gilbert's childlike relationship with his wife - it also offers an intriguing glimpse into the everyday lives of actors, technicians and stagehands of a previous century. The cinematography and art direction in this film are of a consistently high standard, bringing the claustrophobic, garish world of nineteenth century London vividly to life. The film won Academy Awards for make-up and for costume design. It is a musical and visual feast."
