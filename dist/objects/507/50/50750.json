        "Presented here is a collection of over seventy Public Information Films that were made between 1959-1975. All the favourite animated characters are here: Charley the ginger moggy whose safety-conscious nature is a perfect companion for the kids, Jo and Petunia the environmentally unfriendly picnickers and Tufty the animated puppet squirrel who gets mum to help him across the road. This collection of colourful and varied animations were a big part of the 70's culture (especially) and helped disseminate a range of community, health and safety messages. This large collection helps encapsulate the values of its day and helps to illustrate the changing values within our society."
