        "This series from the American Film Institute (AFI) salutes some of the biggest stars that helped shape the face of Hollywood as we know it today. Bette Davis acted in over eighty films during her film career. Her superior and uncompromising representation of characters are as vivid and challenging to view today as they were when made. Her portrayal of women as a powerful force is recognised here as adding significantly to the portrayal of women in film. To celebrate the life and work of Bette Davis, actress Jane Fonda presents with the AFI a salute to Davis's career with footage from over forty of her films and introductions from some of Davis's celebrated colleagues: Peter Faulk, Olivier d'Havilland, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Henry Fonda, Lee Grant, Paul Henry, Liza Minelli, Robert Wagner, George Stevens Jr., Natalie Wood, Cicely Tyson and William Wyler."
