        "A group of young people enjoy the summer of 1979 in the belief that they will never grow up and join the adult world. Action centres on a Melbourne household of punks, hippies, students and radicals who represent the counter culture and the punk generation living on sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and television. Cast includes Michael Hutchence of INXS, Saskia Post, Nique Needles, Chris Haywood, Gary Foley, Joe Camilleri, Noah Taylor."
