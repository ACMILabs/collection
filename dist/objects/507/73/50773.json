    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Season one of 'The X-Files' concluded with the government shutting down the X-files project leaving agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) relieved of their special duties. At the commencement of season two Scully and Mulder have been deliberately kept apart by unknown government forces and are back doing rank and file FBI investigations. Mulder has lost hope in ever finding 'the truth' behind his sister's alien abduction, while Scully has become despondent with her extra-ordinary FBI teaching duties. Of course that doesn't last and the two find themselves together again investigating unexplained phenomenas and government cover-ups of extraterrestrial existence. \"Colony\" (1995): Scully and Mulder hunt for a man murdering doctors at abortion clinics across the United States and who also appears to be able to alter his shape. \"End game\" (1995): Mulder attempts to catch an alien bounty hunter who may hold the key to his sister's disappearance. \"Fearful symmetry\" (1995): Scully and Mulder investigate reports that an invisible force is randomly killing people, which seems to be connected to escaped animals from a zoo in Idaho. \"Dod calm\" (1995): Scully and Mulder become stranded on a US navy destroyer where the aging process is greatly accelerated. \"Humbug\" (1995): Scully and Mulder investigate a series of identical attacks that occured over a period of 28 years. Their investigation leads them to a Florida town inhabited by side-show performers. Note: year is US airdate."
