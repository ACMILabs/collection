        "This series from the American Film Institute (AFI) salutes some of the biggest stars that shaped the face of Hollywood. Jimmy (James) Stewart whose career spanned over 45 years having acted in over 80 films is honoured here with an AFI Lifetime Achievement Award. Jimmy became an American icon and came to symbolise the greatest of American family values. Especially noted in this program is Jimmy's unique ability of bringing his characters to life. As an audience we lose the sense of the actor acting and are transported by the real feeling given to his characters. Excerpts from some of his best known films are shown 'It's a wonderful life', 'Rear window', 'Mr Smith goes to Washington', 'Harvey' and much more. Princess Grace of Monaco (Grace Kelly) gives a rare Hollywood appearance amongst others of his colleagues including: Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Charlton Heston, Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Gene Kelly, Dustin Hoffman and Alfred Hitchcock."
