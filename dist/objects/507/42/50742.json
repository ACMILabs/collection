        "Fassbinder's final film is a stylised attempt to bring Jean Genet's novel \"Querelle de Brest\" to the screen. Filmed in rich reds and oranges, \"Querelle\" is set in a hallucinatory world. The sailor Querelle is adored and loved by his Lieutenant, by the brothel-owner Lucienne and by her husband, Nono, but it isn't until Querelle kills a man that he himself becomes ready to love. He chooses for his lover the murderer Gilles: a love which leads to a complex game of sexual betrayal and, ironically, both to tragedy and redemption. \"Querelle\" is like watching love unfold in the middle of a wet dream. Stars Brad Davis, Jeanne Moreau, Franco Nero and Laurent Malet. Screenplay, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Burkhard Driest. Cinematography, Xaver Schwarzenberger and Josef Vavra. Music, Peer Raben. Editing, Juliane Lorenz and Frantz Walsch."
