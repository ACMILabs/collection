        "The magic of the moving image has long captured the imagination of movie goers around the world, from the days of the silent film to the technological special effects extravaganzas of today's action films. In this documentary, join in on a tram tour ride through the front and back lots of the famous Universal Studios which were officially opened in 1915 by film producer Carl Laemmle. See the sound stages, design studios, props warehouse in the front lot and experience the \"special effects\" as the tour takes an adventurous turn across a collapsing bridge, taking you head on into a flash flood, an encounter with Jaws as you pass through Amity Island and finally through the parting of the Red Sea to reach the back lot where all exterior filming takes place. It is here in the back lot you will find the street sets where many of the old b&w westerns were made, Little Europe where films such as \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" were produced, and some of the famous \"houses\" from television programs including \"Leave it to Beaver\", \"The Munsters\", \"Marcus Welby\" and the classic film \"Psycho\". Also includes sets and re-enactments from \"King Kong\", \"Battlestar Gallactica\", \"Conan\" and \"Jaws\", action shots of stunt performers, and excerpts from some classic films."
