        "Emerald City is an hilarious romp which tells the tale of two couples working in the film industry and their desperate search to keep in tune with modern day pressures, without sacrificing modern day pleasures. Written by David Williamson, based on his play by the same name, the film stars John Hargreaves, Robyn Nevin and Nicole Kidman."
