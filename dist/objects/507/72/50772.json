    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Season one of 'The X-Files' concluded with the government shutting down the X-files project leaving agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) relieved of their special duties. At the commencement of season two Scully and Mulder have been deliberately kept apart by unknown government forces and are back doing rank and file FBI investigations. Mulder has lost hope in ever finding 'the truth' behind his sister's alien abduction, while Scully has become despondent with her extra-ordinary FBI teaching duties. Of course that doesn't last and the two find themselves together again investigating unexplained phenomenas and government cover-ups of extraterrestrial existence. \"Excelsius dei\" (1994): Mulder believes that a series of violent attacks at a retirement home are being caused by benevolent spirits. \"Aubrey\" (1995): A pregnant woman begins to have visions of serial killings that span half a century. \"Irresistible\" (1995): Scully looses her nerve when her and Mulder search for a death fetishist who collects pieces of the dead. \"Die hand die verletzt\" (1995): Scully and Mulder investigate a murder in a small town inhabited by devil worshipers. \"Fresh bones\" (1995): Mulder begins to suspect that the death of two marines in a Haitian refugee camp was caused by voodoo. Note: year is US airdate."
