        "In the tradition of hilarious British comedy, \"Black books\" offers its social insights via a campaign of acerbic one-liners and surreal plot devices. Bernard Black (Dylan Moran) is an Irish expatriate, London bookstore proprietor, and devoted alcoholic. From his introduction in Episode One, ushering customers out of his shop with broom and megaphone, we know these are the antics of the arch-misanthrope of recent television. Joining Bernard is his drinking partner Fran (Tamsin Greig) and Manny (Bill Bailey), a hairy if naive newcomer to the absurd business practices of Black Books. These first six episodes are a fine solution to the stodgy formula of popular US comedy."
