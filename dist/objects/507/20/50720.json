        "Mike Hodges' slow-burning \"Croupier\" is the tale of one man's addiction to watching people lose; and whose detached observation of the sleaze and depression in the world of gambling becomes his only means of self-fulfillment. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is a former croupier and struggling writer lured back to casino work by his estranged father. Therein he encounters without any real surprise the business of letting people lose, and soon his relationships with those close to him take on a similar sense of self-interest and subtle cruelty. Interwoven with the robberies, intrigue and exoticism is a commentary on the alienation bred by gambling and the lifestyle it entails. Cast also includes Gina McKee, Kate Hardie and Paul Reynolds."
