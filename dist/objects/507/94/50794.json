        "Since its early days, Hollywood was seen to be responsible for the phenomenal growth of two major industries: motion pictures and the Hollywood pin-up. Narrated by former pin-up girl and star of Howard Hughes' `The Outlaw' (1943), Jane Russell, this documentary traces the history of the pin-up, from the first studio glamour portraits to more risque and scandalous photos, staged publicity stills, and the familiar \"cheesecake\" and \"beefcake\" shots. The pin-up played a vital role in the marketing of motion pictures, a function which became more important after World War II, for reasons both of morale and propaganda. Many pin-ups gained their start in the film industry from modelling, which led to lengthy sessions in the studio portrait galleries, and sometimes, much-coveted bit parts in films. This documentary examines a wealth of archival footage in its efforts to demystify the concept of the pin-up, including segments from a charming newsreel called \"Gilding the Lily\", which explains how the average woman can be transformed into a star with the correct hair and make-up. Features brief interviews with other former pin-ups, including Mamie van Doren, Tab Hunter, Dorothy Lamour and Buster Crabbe. Other stars mentioned include Theda Bara, Rita Hayworth, Mae West, Esther Williams, Lana Turner, Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, Jayne Mansfield, Betty Grable, Ava Gardner, Greta Garbo, Anita Ekberg, Ursula Andress, Jane Fonda, Piper Laurie, Joan Collins, Alan Ladd, Cary Grant, John Payne, Errol Flynn and Johnny Weissmuller."
