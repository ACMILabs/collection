        "An informative documentary tracing the poetry that has been inspired by war and conflict from the Dark Ages through until World War I. The program focuses mainly on British poetry but is inclusive of a few works from other countries. Poetry readings are layed over dramatised re-creations of battle sequences and still photographs and comments and interpretation from academics direct the analytical features of the documentary. A performative narration also seams the themes of the program together, all combined to create a brief insight into the development of the art of war poetry over time."
