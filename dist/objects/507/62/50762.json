        "Hollywood larger than life; Hollywood the dream factory; Hollywood the forgotten. From the fabulous to the flops to the freakish, this documentary narrated by Mickey Rooney focuses on Hollywood of the 1930s. It includes footage from the likes of Buster Keaton, Clark Gable, John Wayne, to the lesser-known faces of the chorus line and the many forgotten wannabes of the studio system. Focusing primarily on song and dance, this documentary has some wonderful sequences by Busby Berkeley, the always-impressive Mae West, and John Wayne as a singing quick-draw. As Mickey Rooney says, this is the Hollywood that \"once was and is no more hurray for Hollywood\"."
