        "Young Milo is a sensitive boy who like most other children just wants to be accepted at school. Above all, he yearns for the freedom and independence enjoyed by his comic book hero, Captain Cosmo, and resents his mother's constant care and attention especially the plain, generic lunchbox she gives him instead of a Captain Cosmo one that all his other classmates own. What really holds Milo back is his poor eyesight: the world is fuzzy and this makes things difficult. He is rejected by the soccer team because he cannot score properly and ridiculed in class because he constantly misreads the numbers on the cards which his teacher puts before him. However, a trip to the optometrist and a pair of glasses improves things. But not totally. Though Milo can now read the numbers correctly in class, he still encounters trouble at soccer and bullying from his classmates. When things are at rock bottom however, Milo learns what is important and has his first experience of accepting life for what it is. Brian Duchscherer's puppet animation is a joy to watch and brings to vivid life recognisable characters and important themes."
