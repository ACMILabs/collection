        "A Bug's Life is a perfect example of how technology can be used to tell a good story. The computer generated animation from this Pixar film is amazing, but what makes it watchable are the gorgeous characters and enthralling story. When Flik endangers the future of the ant colony, Princess Atta sends him away to find help. A gang of grasshoppers- led by the menacing Hopper, will return by the end of the summer to accept the colony's offering, which will take the colony the whole summer to collect. Flik runs into a group of circus performing insects who he mistakenly thinks are warriors. Will the colourful troupe and Flik be able to save the colony from Hopper's wrath? Includes the voices of Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Phyllis Diller, Denis Leary, Madeline Kahn and Roddy McDowall. The film also includes the Pixar animated short, \"The Game\", which won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Animated Short."
