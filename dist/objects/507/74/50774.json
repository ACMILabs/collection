        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Season one of 'The X-Files' concluded with the government shutting down the X-files project leaving agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) relieved of their special duties. At the commencement of season two Scully and Mulder have been deliberately kept apart by unknown government forces and are back doing rank and file FBI investigations. Mulder has lost hope in ever finding 'the truth' behind his sister's alien abduction, while Scully has become despondent with her extra-ordinary FBI teaching duties. Of course that doesn't last and the two find themselves together again investigating unexplained phenomenas and government cover-ups of extraterrestrial existence. \"The Calusari\" (1995): Scully and Mulder investigate the mysterious death of a two year old boy and the subsequent deaths that plague his family. Mulder begins to suspect that the killings are being caused by black magic. \"F. Emasculata\" (1995): Scully investigates the spread of a deadly disease in a men's prison, while Mulder hunts for two escaped convicts who might have also contracted the highly infectious contagion. \"Soft light\" (1995): Scully and Mulder search for a scientist who is killing people with his shadow. \"Our town\" (1995): The agents become suspicious of the owner of a small meat processing plant when residents of the small town begin to disappear. \"Anasazi\" (1995): A computer hacker called 'The Thinker' gives Mulder a computer disc containing top secret US Defence Department files on extraterrestrial life. Note: year is US airdate."
