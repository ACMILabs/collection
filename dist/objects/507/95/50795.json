        "This documentary examines the machinations and power of the Hollywood studio publicity departments of the 1930s and 40s, a time of the studios' heyday, when the public had an unbridled fascination for the stars of the silver screen. On screen and off, fans were sold the notion of the dream, where glamour, money, fame and beauty were in endless supply. Movie newsreels, gossip columnists and press agents played a major role in presenting actors such as Errol Flynn, Clarke Gable and Vivien Leigh as eternally glamorous and gay, spending their lives at parties and opening night galas. Actors, celebrities and child stars were also used as a propaganda tool, sending messages that supported various causes, including war bonds, bills of government and political parties. Public appearances were as important as the films that the stars made, and actors were expected to tour on junkets around the country. Footage in the documentary includes clips from iconic Hollywood films, famous screen tests, bloopers and scenes from spectacular musical productions of the 1930s. Features footage of: Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Bing Crosby, James Cagney, Shirley Temple, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Ronald Reagan, Rita Hayworth, Tyrone Power and The Marx Brothers."
