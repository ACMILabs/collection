    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Season one of 'The X-Files' concluded with the government shutting down the X-files project leaving agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) relieved of their special duties. At the commencement of season two Scully and Mulder have been deliberately kept apart by unknown government forces and are back doing rank and file FBI investigations. Mulder has lost hope in ever finding 'the truth' behind his sister's alien abduction, while Scully has become despondent with her extra-ordinary FBI teaching duties. Of course that doesn't last and the two find themselves together again investigating unexplained phenomenas and government cover-ups of extraterrestrial existence. \"Ascension\" (1994): Mulder attempts to rescue Scully who has been kidnapped by a deranged man who believes he was abducted by aliens. \"3\" (1994): With Scully still missing, Mulder investigates a new x-files case involving modern-day vampires. \"One breath\" (1994): When Scully's comatose body is discovered at a local hospital, Mulder begins to suspect that the government had something to do with her disappearance. \"Firewalker\" (1994): A deadly parasitic lifeform is unearthed by a team of scientists researching a volcano. \"Red museum\" (1994): A strange religious cult in a remote Wisconsin community become the main suspects when local teenagers are drugged and abducted. Note: year is US airdate."
