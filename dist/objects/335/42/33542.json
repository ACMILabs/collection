        "It was the first time a boy had kissed me. I felt as though I was reeling, soaring drowning-all at once, I gave myself completely to his lips! So thinks the teenage heroine of this in-depth look at True Romance Comix. The stage is set for Joan's undoing. Useful for exploring popular culture, sexism and melodrama. Winner, Diploma of Merit, Melbourne Film Festival, 1984."
