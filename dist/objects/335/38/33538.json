        "A comprehensive film examining the past present and future of the newspaper business. Issues covered include the influence of big businesses on journalism, the crisis of the survival of small-town newspapers, and how a newspaper's editorial policies are being dictated by economic consideration. NB: The information in this film is very relevant to Australian media ownership in the 90's."
