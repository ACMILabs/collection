Illustrations of the female biological functions are interspersed with informal, live-action discussions at an all-girls' slumber party, on a jogging track and during other typical teenage activities. Besides the female anatomy, they discuss menstruation, reproduction and the girls' hopes and fears. Narrated by Marlo Thomas and photographed by Don Lenzer."
