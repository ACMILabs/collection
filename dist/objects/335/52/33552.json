        "This film explores those elements in our society which contribute to the ideology that supports rape. It attempts to expand our society's narrow and sexist concept of rape and establishes the connections between violence and \"normal\" patterns of male-female behaviour. Includes the opinions of convicted rapists, rape crisis centre workers, and others associated with the problem."
