        "Episode of Series \"Media Probes\". This film considers various aspects of design. Fashion designer Bill Blass shows how clothes make a statement about the people wearing them and a graphic designer and two production assistants point out the tricks of the trade. The final segment shows how a national motel chain set out to change its corporate logo and then rejected the new image. Hosted by Bill Blass, photographed by Ed Lynch and written by Tony Kahn and Brad Kesden."
