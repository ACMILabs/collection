        "Susan Linn and her two hand puppets, Cat-a-Lion and Audrey, discuss an experience of sexual abuse that happened to Audrey's young friend Elizabeth. They differentiate sexual abuse from normal relationships, emphasize that some secrets must be told, suggest who children might talk to, and point out that it was not the child's fault."
