        "A delightful documentary look at the life of a 70-year-old African American women who earns a small income from a job as a night-time toilet attendant at a wealthy hotel in an area frequented by the \"beautiful people\". The film contrasts her life here on the richer side of town with her more mundane existence in ahousing estate for senior citizens and, as well, provides an account of her life from childhood through the use of stills and her own colorful commentary. The film touches on many issues: the Depression era in America, poverty, race relations, city and rural life, old age, loneliness, popular music and family life. Featuring Joan Williams."
