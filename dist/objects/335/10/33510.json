        "In 1910 Robert Noonan, whose pen-name was Robert Tressell, finished his book \"The Ragged Trousered Philanthropist\" and wrote in the title page that it was \"the story of 12 months in hell told by one of the damned\". This fully dramatised film is based on the fragments of information known about his life, his writing and the political events of the 9 years he spent in England."
