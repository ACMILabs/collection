        "Episode of Series \"People at Work\". This open-ended drama is designed to trigger discussion on the subject of equal opportunities for women in the workplace and on the role of unions in securing those opportunities and working to eliminate discriminatory labour practices. Though set within a hospital and focussing on one of several staff women who are denied access to a pharmacy training program despite suitable qualifications, the underlying premises, conflicts and responses have implications that reach far beyond the hospital walls. Written by Gynne Basen, Clayton Bailey, Caroline Leaf; photographed by Wolf Koenig; edited by Judith Merritt; sound by John Martin, Bernie Bordeleau"
