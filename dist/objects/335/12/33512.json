        "The power of big companies like BHP deeply affects our economy and environment and our way of life. The film describes the effects of highly developed capitalist industry - environmental pollution, disregard for workers conditions and the exploitation of migrant workers. The film shows conditions which helped to earn the Port Kembla steelworks the title of 'Bloodhouse'."
