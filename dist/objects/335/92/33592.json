        "It was Tesla, not Edison, who invented the method of transmitting electricity which makes the 20th century work. In the 1890s Tesla also demonstrated the wireless two years before Marconi. Now a growing number of Tesla enthusiasts claim that his later research was 80 years ahead of its time."
