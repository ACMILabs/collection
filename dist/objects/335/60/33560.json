        "Episode of Series \"New Versions of Comedy Classics\" This film is a new print of two old comedy films. 'Hot Water', made in 1924, is about Harold taking a live turkey on a trolley ride and then taking his in-laws for an equally hysterical ride in his new car. Also stars Jobyna Ralston, Josephine Crowell, Charles A. Stevenson and Mickey McBan. Written by Tommy Gray and John Grey. The second film, called 'Safety Last', was made in 1923 and is about Harold going to the big city to make his fortune and includes the scene \"Harold Lloyd on the clock\". Also stars Mildred Davis and Bill Strothers. Written by Jean C. Havez and Sam Taylor."
