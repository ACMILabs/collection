        "Primary teaching film surveying the wheat industry in Australia. Shows size and location of wheat areas, the beginnings of Governor Phillip's 8-acre plot in 1788, the work of William Farrar in breeding new strains suited to Australian conditions from 1889 onwards, and the cycle of work which continues year after year on a modern mechanised farm. Discusses climate and soil requirements of wheat and explains why Australia's wheat belt is situated between the 10-20 inches rainfall areas."
