        "A young girl reacting unhappily to her parents' recent divorce alienates herself from her girlfriends when she continually fails to attend ballet practice for a school performance. In the meantime, she forms a friendship with an old man who is the caretaker of the local conservatory, and, through him, comes to understand that problems must be confronted rather than avoided if a solution is to be found. Sadly, her friendship with the old man comes to an end with his death. This film raises issues for discussion such as responsibilities towards others, family situations, human relationships, old age and death. Cast includes Roy Witham and Saba Sluyter."
