        "Discusses Chris Argyris' theory that worker apathy is not due to laziness but rather a healthy reaction to an unhealthy environment created by common management policies. The typical organisation confines most of its employees to roles that provide little opportunity for responsibility, self reliance or independence. Explains how executive interpersonal relations can be improved."
