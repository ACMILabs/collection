        "This is both a realistic adventure of rock-climbing and a metaphorical ascent in which limits are tested and personal values are explored. As the two climbers express their thoughts in the narration, we watch their breathtaking progress up a sheer rock face in Yosemite Valley. We learn a few rudiments of rock-climbing and about the climbers feelings and motivations."
