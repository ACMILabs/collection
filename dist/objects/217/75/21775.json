        "A film for dairy farmers, pointing out that simple precautions (such as ensuring that milk cans waiting for delivery to the factory are shaded), should be carried out by dairy farmers in their own interests. For if milk consumption does not reach the public in the best possible condition, the Government will be obliged to legislate in such a way that farmers will be forced to carry out these same precautions."
