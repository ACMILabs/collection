        "The first in a series dealing with environmental pollution. this film juxtaposes scenes of congestion, pollution, and decay which are the results of uncontrolled growth, inadequate planning and insufficient concern in a sprawling metropolitan city. Exposes the social, economic and moral values that have permitted the megalopolis to arise. No spoken commentary."
