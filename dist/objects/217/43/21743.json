        "One hundred years ago, Geelong was aboriginal country. Today, from a town which was built on wool and wheat, it has grown to be one of the biggest regional cities in Australia. Besides serving as the natural port for the produce from the rich hinterland farms, it has developed many secondary industries which make it the most industrialised city per head in Australia. Fine modern buildings, famous schools, and beautiful beaches show it as an attractive and happy city. Nestled around Corio Bay, it is prosperous and expanding."
