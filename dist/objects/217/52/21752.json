        "Episode of Series \"Man builds - man destroys\". Examines two aspects of environmental city planning. Although Disney-World, Florida, is not a real city, the Disney planners have come up with some surprising technological solutions to urban problems. The film also shows how the citizens of Toronto have shown that it is possible to change the pattern of urban growth and make a city liveable again."
