        "In a survey of some of the ways Australian children are discovering their own kind of theatre, this film focuses on a touring children's theatre company, the Pageant Theatre in Education, which tours Australian schools. School children are invited by the actors to participate in the production of each play and their responses influence the shape of the play. Children of different age groups are observed creating fantasy worlds on the one hand and recreating political and social issues on the other. Made with the assistance of the Australian Film & Television School. Narrated by Robert Bruning."
