        "A modern sculptor in steel. This film is a plea for a sensible approach to modern art. It opens with Clement Meadmore welding a sculpture in his backyard in Sydney, followed by a survey of his works. Meadmore, who is also a leading designer in the field of fabrics and textiles, works with austere and means creating sculptures of purity of form and clarity of expression. Filmed, written and edited by Bruce Beresford. Narrated by John Bell."
