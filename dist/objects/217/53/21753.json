        "An experiment, from NFB's animation workshop, in creating continuous metamorphoses on the screen, employing charcoal drawings on a white board in a process of erasing, adding, photographing. In this film there is the impression of a succession of creatures moving across the screen, then disappearing into a hole. Eventually the hole changes to a bridge on which stands the youth who began the parade. Animation by Ryan Larkin. (Award: San Francisco)"
