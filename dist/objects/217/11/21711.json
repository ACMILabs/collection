        "A child asks to be let off the school bus - and dies in the snow. Neither students nor teachers know him - his favourite teacher, who barely remembers him - goes to see his parents. In an attempt to write an obituary the teacher reads through the child's school reports. The people around him changed him into a nobody. Designed for teachers to motivate a concern for the needs of every child."
