        "Episode of Series \"Instructional Techniques\". Primarily designed for the instruction of the services, this film puts forward principles that are equally applicable to teaching in the civilian field. The instructor must plan their lessons in advance, whether in the classroom or at the workbench. The lesson should have a proper introduction, be developed logically, and flow naturally and interestingly to its concluding summary. The value of class activity, teaching aids, planned questions and proper note-taking are all dealt with in this film. The film falls into two parts: classroom instruction and practical instruction."
