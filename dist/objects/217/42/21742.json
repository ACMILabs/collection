        "Forthright, critical analysis of the problems of North American cities by Jane Jacobs, authority and author of books and articles on the subject. A former New Yorker, she chose to live in Toronto because \"it is a city that still has options...it hasn't made so many mistakes that it's bound to go downhill.\" Her remarks, and what this film shows, will interest all civic and community groups - in fact, all urban dwellers. Photography by Jacques Fogel, Albert Kish, Cameron Gaul, Raymond Dumas."
