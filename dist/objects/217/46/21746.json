        "Illustrates good city planning, showing how Fresno, California, has revitalised its city centre by a plan implemented from 1964, diverting traffic from the city core, turning the main street into a long pedestrian mall. Contrasts the success of the plan with the inner city congestion and suburban disorganisation of many cities."
