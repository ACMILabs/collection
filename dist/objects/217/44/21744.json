        "A nostalgic recollection of the period when the Yukon gold fever was at its height. The commentary, written and spoken by Dawson-born Pierre Berton, begins with childhood recollections of the writer. This feeling of retrospect is further deepened by the introduction of many vintage photographs which give the film a documentary quality as it reviews the history of the gold rush. We see relics of the old Dawson as it was when all the gold of the rich river beds flowed through its stores, taverns and dance halls."
