        "This film depicts impressions of the lights of Christmas as they transform a winter's night. Captures the illusive magic of a northern Christmas when fresh snow lies softly on pine trees and roof tops and multi-coloured lights glow on surfaces of purest white. The myriad lights of a city, the wonder on children's faces, lyrical music, dramatic colour effects with trick photography - all combine to create the nostalgic mood of Christmas. (Award: Columbus)"
