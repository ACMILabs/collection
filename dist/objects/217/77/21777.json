        "Opening with views of the city of Melbourne in the early morning, we see the crowds of workers arriving by train and tram. During the day the streets are crowded with people who dispose of rubbish without thought, necessitating an army of cleaners to keep the city clean. Day and night the cleaning goes on, in the early morning the main body of cleaners take over making the city ready for the day to come."
