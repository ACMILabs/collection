        "A certain vacant allotment in Manhattan, New York, was regarded by a group of children as their own particular stamping-ground. Came the day when the building of the United Nations Organisation headquarters began on that allotment. The children, deprived of their playground, set out to find just what sort of an organisation United Nations Organisation was, and what sort of work it does."
