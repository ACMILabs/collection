        "This film is a variation of another film of the same title (307748). It contains the same message, but different images, of the function of water in everyday life. Fish, game, livestock, and human beings must have clean water - polluted water brings death. Public health is endangered, recreational facilities are limited, the productivity of streams and lakes decreased, and property values fall disastrously when water is polluted or there is danger of pollution. \"Clean Waters\" gives a very interesting account of two American sewage treatment methods which prevent pollution of water."
