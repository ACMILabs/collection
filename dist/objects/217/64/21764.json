        "Story of the establishment of an experimental training class for mentally handicapped children. Purposes of the class are to determine if such children will progress more satisfactorily in elementary school if given special training at an early age; whether certain undesirable attitudes and reactions may be prevented by early enrolment in such a program; and to establish desirable behaviour patterns at an early age in order to allow the child a more nearly normal happy life."
