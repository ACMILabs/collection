        "Surveys the spiraling problems faced by overcrowded cities in the US and some of the measures taken to solve them. Looks at the evolution of major cities, then examines such present ills as slums, traffic congestion, pollution and over-crowding. Among the solutions pictured are urban renewal projects, rehabilitation, electric transport, traffic regulatory techniques, pollution control devices and the so-called \"new towns\" such as Reston in Virginia. Narrated by Jim Jensen."
