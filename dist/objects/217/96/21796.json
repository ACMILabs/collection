        "Primitive peoples used the materials available in their immediate environment from which to make clothing for themselves. This film traces the development of the textile arts through hand-processes of various nationalities to modern mass-production methods of an industrialised economy. The effect of climate and environment on the materials and modes of dress, and the effects of modern mass-production, coupled with the development of transport and communication methods, are studied. The clothing from industrialised countries is shown to be becoming increasingly widespread throughout the world."
