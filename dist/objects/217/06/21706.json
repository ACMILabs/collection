        "The life cycle of the cicada, or, as it is commonly known, the seven-year locust. In spring, the pupa emerges. Time-lapse photography shows us the transition from pupa to winged insect, including the shedding of the pupal shell. The winged insect lays eggs, from which young insects hatch and drop to the ground to begin their underground larval stage of development. In the spring, they will emerge in the pupal stage, and the life cycle will commence again. Narration by J.A. Hyslop."
