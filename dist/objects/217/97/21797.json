        "In spite of a high annual rainfall, the state of Ohio, USA has faced severe droughts. This film illustrates the part played by water in the daily lives of the inhabitants, also its use in industry and agriculture, then probes for reasons behind the apparent wastage of water resources. Draws particular attention to wastage of both soil and water resulting from soil erosion. Includes close-up shots of rain drops striking unprotected soil, showing the extent and nature of the damage caused."
