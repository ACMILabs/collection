        "Made in 1965 showing the provision of housing for Melbourne's growing population, 50,000 of whom live in 1,000 acres of inner suburban slums. Following demolition, large block of flats provide the amenities and home comforts for low income families at low rentals where children can play happily in well planned playgrounds. The historic footage of the demolition of inner city dwellings to accommodate high rise housing commission flats and the intentions behind the move are interesting to view in retrospect."
