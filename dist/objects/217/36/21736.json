        "A study of London's transport system during World War II. Between 5.30am and 10.00am each morning London's underground and above-ground transport fleet carried nearly five million workers to city offices, shops, factories, and dockyards; many of these people lived in the most distant residential outer suburbs of London, and were brought in to the city every day from distances of up to 30 miles or more away. \"City bound\" shows us the daily migration by train, tram, bus, and tube."
