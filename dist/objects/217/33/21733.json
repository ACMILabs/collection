        "A close look at the manifold tasks of the elected shire and town councillors in Germany. We see them at meetings, seeking progress and prosperity for their citizens. By encouraging and helping establish new local industries on a community basis, there is resultant increase in population, housing, hospitals, and amenities. Such progress is soundly based and assured."
