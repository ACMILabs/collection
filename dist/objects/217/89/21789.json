        "Episode of Series \"Botany\". The film provides a clear explanation of every plant's need for light and then shows the adaptations which are developed by climbing plants to fulfil this need. Time-lapse techniques are used to illustrate the twining of stems and the growth of different kinds of tendrils. Designed for class-room use."
