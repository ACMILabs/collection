        "While dealing specifically with Manchester, England, this film is also intended to give a general picture of local government in England. A summary of Manchester's growth through the centuries is given, stressing the rapid growth during the industrial revolution. Manchester's past achievements and future plans are shown in some detail. Sequences showing Manchester at play are cut to the music of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\". The concluding sequences show citizens going about their work, while the commentary stresses that the city is its people."
