        "Episode of Series \"21st Century\". A group of college students get together in a \"circle of love\", ie an \"encounter group\" to improve interpersonal relationships. Comprises highlights from several sessions in which six students, who have never met before, react to taped instructions from a behavioural research institute. Participants learn to express their real feelings about themselves and their fellow students, and learn to overcome anxieties and shyness in the presence of others. Reporter: Walter Cronkite"
