        "Presents the more common types of clouds, and explains in detail the processes of evaporation and condensation. An animated sequence demonstrates how the sun, air and water working together cause water vapour to rise and how subsequent condensation causes clouds to form. Traces the complete water cycle. Shows the importance of clouds to humans, particularly in farming, fishing and aviation."
