        "Alarming levels of pollution parallel with urban and industrial growth are being recorded in the metropolitan areas of the United States. Land, air, water and the human ear are victims of this pollution. This film contrasts scenes of rural beauty accompanied by readings from Walt Whitman with the rising accumulations of refuse and decay that threaten the nation's health."
