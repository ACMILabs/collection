    "description": [
        "The time lapse photography in History of a Day offers an exhilarating view of a 'day' unfolding before our eyes in just four minutes. The five screens of the installation surround the viewer with multiple sunrises, sunsets and lightning storms - a global dance of energy and light not available to us from our usual fixed and single perspective.  History of a Day shows us the Earth as a spinning ball of elements, driven by the laws of gravity and physics, producing, in the words of the artists, 'a cosmic special effects theatre in continuous production, simultaneously all over the earth.'  Cinematographer Simon Carroll has been photographing time-lapse sequences for twenty years, and has amassed a large archive of material from which History of a Day was constructed. His work has been used in many films, including The Matrix  (1999). Composer Martin Friedel has written music for film, theatre, opera and the concert hall, using both traditional and new media forms. He is currently a Creative Fellow at the State Library of Victoria.  (FT 30.03.05)"
