        "Since the first Apollo moon landing in the 1960s, NASA has compiled an enormous photographic record of its lunar saga. San Francisco photographer Michael Light gained access to the original negatives, presenting his collection of photography in major American and European museums including San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. As a reprise to his photographic exhibition 'Full Moon', Light has created 'Drift', an epic seven-minute loop of composite still imagery taken during NASA's moon missions."
