        "Through life experiences such as divorce, bereavement or never meeting the right soulmate we may find ourselves fifty plus and living on our own.  For some in this situation a new partner is not what they crave, just the supportive friendship of those who understand.  Based on a  series of interviews conducted with members of a Catholic Women's solo group, this 36 min amateur documentary is a first time effort for the filmmaker and although the production values are at times questionable - the heart and soul of the women interviewed  shine through making this a warm, often funny and inspirational account of life for a growing number of people in our community."
