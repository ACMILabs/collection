    "description": [
        "\"World without end\" was an exhibition held in ACMI Screen Gallery Exhibition, 14 April 2005 - 17 July 2005. See the Exhibition activity record for more information.  Our experience of the world is shaped by the subtle and dramatic forces of nature, the energies and rhythms of cities, and the elastic time of global travel and instant communication networks.  This exhibition reveals how we perceive the world through an endless series of flows and flux: cycles of night and day, constantly changing weather patterns, crossings through natural and urban environments, currents of memory, emotion and reflection.  Descend into the Screen Gallery, a unique exhibition space tunnelling the length of Federation Square, to experience the world through a range of alternate lenses: everyday occurrences and familiar places seem strangely new and newly strange."
