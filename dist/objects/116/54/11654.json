        "This CD-ROM was created with funding by the Commonwealth Government through the Australia council - its arts and funding advisory body, and by the City of Port Philip Cultural Development Fund. The work is an interactive exhibition of objects that evoke stories or memories.  Young people, old people, people from diverse backgrounds, artists, entertainers, the famous, the infamous and the not yet discovered - all were asked to contribute an object of personal significance and a story to accompany it. The CD-ROM has a linked website (www.experimenta.org/gallery/memorypacks/description.html)."
