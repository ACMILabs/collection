        "The plot of this Raymond Chandleresque comedy-drama crime caper from the Coen Brothers pivots around a case of mistaken identity. Unemployed and laid-back, 70s refugee Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski likes hanging out with his friends and bowling. His life takes an alternate route when two thugs break into his home and soil his rug in the belief that they are accosting Jeff Lebowski, the Pasadena millionaire. The Dude looks up his wealthy namesake and manages to get a replacement for his soiled rug, but he also manages to embroil himself in a story of extortion, double-cross, deception, embezzlement, sex and dope. Cast includes Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Ben Gazzara and John Turturro."
