        "Shows how timber-getting, grazing of goats, wind and water have all contributed to the problem of soil erosion in Cyprus. Explains how the British Government is tackling the problem; building dams, developing irrigation methods, stamping out malarial mosquitoes, teaching contour ploughing and terracing, planting new forests. The film mentions the difficulties of over-crowded towns and increasing population."
