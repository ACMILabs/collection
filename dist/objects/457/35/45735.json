        "Buying a puppy takes a lot of time and consideration. Dr Harry Cooper tries to assist this process by providing the viewer with a broad overview of over twenty breeds and cross breeds, and examining the merits of how to select the right breed of dog to suit you. Factors taken into consideration include health, lifestyle and budget. Once a breed has been selected, Dr Harry goes through ensuring you choose a healthy pup, settling the pup in, training, socialisation, feeding, general health and grooming. Dr Harry Cooper has been a practicing veterinary surgeon for over thirty years and has practiced in Sydney, Tasmania and England. Over this time he has bred a wide variety of dogs including Bulldogs, Whippets, Cavalier King Charles, Dobermans, Border Collies and Mini Foxies."
