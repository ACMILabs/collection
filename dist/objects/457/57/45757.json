        "Episode of Series \"RMIT Collection\". Enter the world of the insects to study a curious form of predatory behaviour. Mantis is a short computer animation utilizing sophisticated 3D techniques to create an immersive entomological environment in which we follow the misadventure of a praying mantis. During the animation the roles of \"predator\" and \"victim\" are switched to demonstrate how some animals must kill for survival while humans can kill for blatantly inconsequential reasons. Glenn Tracy is a graduate of the Advanced Diploma of Arts in Electronic Design & Interactive Media, Creative Media Department RMIT, Melbourne, Australia."
