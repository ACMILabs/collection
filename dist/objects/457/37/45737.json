        "Join Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald, Daisy, Pluto and their friends as they gather together and recount stories of Christmas past. Minnie and Mickey remember the year they both sacrificed something that was important to them for the good of others. Goofy and Max retell the time when things were not going as planned, until Santa makes a surprise visit. While Donald's nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie remember the time when they discovered what the true meaning of Christmas was. The three individual stories culminate in a finale of Christmas songs performed by Disney's biggest and most popular stars."
