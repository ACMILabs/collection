        "A man lies dying in hospital. He is suffering from mesothelioma. His daughter, a trained nurse and filmmaker, searches in the past, present and future to find answers to the unanswered questions about his death. Her search uncovers the legal and moral issues raised by the link between exposure to asbestos and cancer and the ongoing fight for compensation for sufferers of asbestos related disease and government action to raise public awareness of the dangers of asbestos. Narrated by Jacqy Phillips. Produced with assistance from the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of NSW."
