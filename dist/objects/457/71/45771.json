        "This documentary takes an informal look at how the best skiers work and live. The Canadian Ski Team is on a tight schedule down in Chile and Argentina. Two and a half tons of equipment, speeds of up to 140 km/h, gruelling work-outs, and a dramatic theft are all par for the course. And what a course. Downhill racing is definitely not for the timid. Commentary by John Lang."
