        "The sometimes cruel but often beautiful landscape of Alice Springs is looked at from a different perspective in this confronting documentary. Focussing on four school children who have been rejected from the mainstream educational system, this film looks at the Detour Project, which is an alternative schooling initiative set up for Aboriginal children who have not benefitted form the education offered in the mainstream system. It offers a curriculum both in Arrente and English, it preserves the traditional language and culture of the people of Alice Springs and recognises the importance of culture, belonging and a sense of place. It is a journey of hope, simply told but with a savage twist."
