        "An adult reflects on a time in his youth when he used to wait for his father at the Regatta Hotel in Queensland during the sixties. It was a time when the muffled mutterings at the bar concerned issues such as women, pictures, and what it meant to be part of the \"lucky country\". It was a men's club, one legally and morally off limits to women, until 2 of them enter the bar, and, after being evicted handcuff themselves to the bar as a form of protest. Based on a true event and narrated by Daniel Rowan. Cast includes Dave Robinson, Damien Donowan, Stephen Collins, Liesel Badorrek and Kyrra Mickelborough."
