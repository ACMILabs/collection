        "They'll do anything, anytime, anywhere - and they've got the bike to prove it. Here are three episodes of classic high-brow comedy starring Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. KITTEN KONG: When the Goodies turn to matters veterinary, Graeme invents a new super pet food. Promotes rapid growth, he claims - right up to the ceiling? SCATTY SAFARI: Television personalities are proving to be a less than popular attraction at the Goodies' safari park, so they get a pair of Rolf Harrises to breed. But the Rolf Harrises escape and breed far too well, reaching plague proportions. Guest stars Tony Blackburn, Sheila Steafel and David Willmott. SCOUTRAGEOUS: Tim's secret vice is being a boy scout - until scouting is made illegal, thanks to the Masked Scouts intent on collecting every single merit badge up to and including the World Domination Badge."
