        "The building of the new Queen Elizabeth II Grandstand at Ascot in record time, and an account of the work which was involved. Ten months was the scheduled time allowed for the builders to replace the old Grand Tier - ten months of close co-operation between client, architect, engineer and construction team. Great use of archival footage giving a sense of history and interesting juxtaposition between the models of the new Ascot and its actual construction."
