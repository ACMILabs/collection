        "Five Afro-American children of varying ages known as the Cabin Kids find they haven't enough money to get into the circus. They decide to follow a dog under the side canvas but unfortunately are spotted by the police. However, Toto the Clown comes to their rescue only on the proviso that if the Cabin Kids entertain him, he will entertain them. The Kids sing in fine unison - and the clowns put on an impromptu act in return. Story by Al jarrett. Photography by George Webber."
