After a devastating accident, Judith and her horse are killed, while Grace and her horse, Pilgrim, are seriously injured, the frightening incident leaving them both traumatised. Desperate to help, Grace's mother puts her busy life on hold and travels west with Grace and Pilgrim to see a horse trainer with a special gift. Once there she discovers that his extraordinary gift with horses also touches the lives of those around him.
