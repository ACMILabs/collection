        "Eighteen thousand new officers are commissioned annually into the R.A.F. Those who come from the Cranwell Royal Air Force College set an especially high standard. Cadets are trained as pilots and navigators and for the specialist branches - Technical, Secretarial, Equipment, and the R.A.F. Regiment. Great emphasis is placed on leaderhship in all branches, and on the high quality instruction. Cadets commissioned from Cromwell have every chance of getting to the top."
