        "An analysis of the cause of famine in India and the social problem posed by inefficient methods of agriculture and over population. The story of one man who, driven off his own land by circumstances, goes to the town in search of work. He is equally unsuccessful there, and returns to starve in his own village. The problems of usury, religion and caste are brought out."
