        "Past, present and the world of cinema merge in this unique and visually innovate thriller. Quebec, 1952, and the church is abuzz as master director Alfred Hitchcock (played by Ron Burrage) is in town to film \"I Confess\". An equally gripping story is going on in the background - the elements echoing that of the plot, as 16 year old church worker, Rachel (Suzanne Clement), is with child to an unknown father, only a young priest knows the truth. Quebec, 1989 and Pierre (Lothaire Bluteau) returns home to attend the funeral of his father. During his stay Pierre vows to solve the mystery of the parentage of his half brother, Marc (Patrick Goyette)- Rachel's son, a discontented rent boy and father of a young child. Pierre's mission is not an easy one, as the secrets of the past and heredity cloud the situation and find resonance in the future. Like the plot of Hitchcock's film, only one man holds the key to past and present that was disclosed to him in the confines of the confessional. In French with English subtitles."
