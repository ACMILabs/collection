        "Vincent Parry's been framed! Wrongly convicted of murdering his wife, Parry (Bogart) busts out of San Quentin and heads for San Francisco, determined to clear himself. Once there, he takes shelter with Irene Jansen (Bacall), a young woman who believes his story and wants to help. Undergoing extensive plastic surgery, Parry drastically changes his appearance, but not his mission. Hidden by his new face, he evades blackmailer's double-crossers and the cops in a final, desperate effort to find the real killer... before the killer finds him."
