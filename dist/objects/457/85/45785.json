        "This is an understated thriller which remains close to Woodward and Bernstein's account of the uncovering of the Watergate trail of corruption right to the President's door. Together with Klute (1971) and The Parallax View (1974) it forms what has been called Pakula's 'paranoia trilogy': film noir for the seventies. This film updates the investigative drama in pseudo-documentary style which had been a significant phase of film noir in the forties. The labyrinth in 1973 is the communication network which has to be commanded and manipulated for the investigator-reporters to uncover the enigmas facing them, the voice of Deep Throat in the darkness of subterranean carparks notwithstanding. Cast includes Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam and Jason Robards. Based on the book by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward."
