        "The modern methods of teaching used in Malaya's schools for the blind are doing much to lessen the handicaps of blindness. Young children grow in confidence as they learn new skills such as basket making and reading braille. Older students are seen using braille typewriters and operating the special telephone switchboard made by the Malayan Telecommunications Department."
