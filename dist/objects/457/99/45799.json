        "An impression of life in a coastal community of New England, USA. In this region where the soil is poor and stony and the growing season short, the people turn to various occupations to supplement their income. The Kellors who live in Camden, Maine, are a typical New England family. They earn what they can from their farm and dairy herd, but find it necessary to add to their income by working in the factories and mills, by fishing, and by accepting tourists into their home as paying guests."
