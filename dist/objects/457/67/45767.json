        "Going to hospital is often a frightening experience, and in the case of children - a traumatic one too. 'Hospital heroes' attempts to demystify this process as it follows three brave children who are going to hospital. Brooke is going into hospital to have a grommet put in her ear; Nicholas takes a trip in an ambulance after suffering an asthma attack; and Anthony has fallen off a bike and injured his head and leg and is carried away in a helicopter. The children are visited by \"Agro\" and a companion. A resource workbook (prepared by Christine Black) accompanies the video and provides guidance on curriculum ideas related to language, art, science, maths and social studies. Suitable for all primary levels as well as lower secondary level students in relation to mathematics."
