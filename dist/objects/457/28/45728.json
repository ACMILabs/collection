        "A high-energy action adventure based on legend rather than historical finds facts Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) desiring to retire from law enforcement. With brothers Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton), he arrives in Tombstone, Arizona intending to build his fortune. He discovers long-time friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) is there and that the town is run by a group of brutal outlaws called the Cowboys. Earp, frustrated with his laudanum-addicted wife, begins a romance with the travelling stage actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney). Meanwhile, the Cowboys terrorise the citizens of Tombstone unchecked. The stage is set for the ultimate Wild West showdown - a gunfight at the OK Corral."
