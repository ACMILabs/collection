        "They'll do anything, anytime, anywhere - and they've got the bike to prove it. Here are three episodes of classic high-brow comedy starring Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. THE GOODIES AND THE BEANSTALK: Cricklewood, 1973: poverty stricken, the Goodies sell their tandem for a tin of beans - which, when planted, grows into a giant beanstalk leading up Mt Everest to the giant's castle where golden eggs are laid. But before the Goodies can become rich, they must battle with the Giant. Note: this is the 43 minute Christmas version. Guest stars Michael Aspel. THE END: The office is entombed under a pillar of concrete in line with Graeme's new city development plan. Isolated, the Goodies explore their relationships with each other, politics, religion and eye-spy. THE BUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. TEA ROOMS: The Goodies go west (well, Cornwall) to mine for gold, but strike cream instead. Graeme monopolises the cream business by sneaking off on the other two, but Tim and Bill also find strawberry jam and scones. The stakes are set for a poker game where winner takes all, and culminates in the Bunfight at the O.K. Tea Rooms."
