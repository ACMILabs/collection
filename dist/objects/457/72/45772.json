        "On the Blood Indian Reserve, near Cardston, Alberta, a hopeful new development in Indian enterprise. Once rulers of the western plains, the Bloods live on a 1 300-square-kilometer reserve. Many have lacked gainful employment and now pin their hopes on a pre-fab factory they have built. Will the production line and work and wages fit into their cultural pattern of life? The film shows how it is working and what the Indians themselves say about their venture. Narrated by Wallace Manyfingers Jr."
