        "This is the tale of Ruby, the pig. Ruby is lead to look for affirmation in the city around her after she witnesses the accidental death of a stranger. The film displays the directors' use of pencil and paint on photocopies, which give a textured look, suggestive of a lithograph or a flickering newsreel. Winner of the Palme d'or - Best Short Film 1999 Cannes International Film Festival."
