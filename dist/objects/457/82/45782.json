        "Three ambitious workaholics are set loose in a network TV newsroom where their professional and personal lives become hopelessly cross wired. Writer-director James L. Brooks is a filmmaker who is able to brilliantly combine comedy and drama with rich characters and unforgettable dialogue. His satire on the media can also be seen on 'The Simpsons' for which he is Executive Producer. He paints a savage, knowing, hilarious look at the television news industry and also what can happen to your personal life when your job consumes you. The performances are simply phenomenal. William Hurt gives depth to a dimbulb anchor, but Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks walk away with the movie. Cast includes Jack Nicholson (unbilled) and Joan Cusack. Music by Bill Conti."
