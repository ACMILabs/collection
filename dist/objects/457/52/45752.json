        "Madeline O'Connor is the perfect student and one destined to be a nun (according to her mother and the Sisters around her at school). Madeline has other ideas however and dreams of being a ballerina. She does everything in her power to misbehave and ward off any potential angels that might be tempted to come to her during the night - thus signalling she has been chosen by god. This is an uplifting comedy about ambition and fate."
