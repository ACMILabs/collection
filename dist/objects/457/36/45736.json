        "Buying a kitten takes a lot of time and consideration. Dr Harry Cooper tries to assist this process by providing the viewer with a broad overview of some of the most popular breeds of felines and examines the merits of how to select the right breed of cat to suit you. Factors taken into consideration include health, lifestyle and budget. Once a breed has been selected, Dr Harry goes through ensuring you choose a healthy kitten, settling them in, training, socialisation, feeding, general health and grooming. Dr Harry Cooper has been a practicing veterinary surgeon for over thirty years and has practiced in Sydney, Tasmania and England. Over this time he and his family have owned and bred a wide variety of cats including Siamese, Burmese, Chinchilla, Devon Rex and Abyssinian - they have all been black."
