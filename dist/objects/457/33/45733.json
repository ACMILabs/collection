        "Director Wayne Wang and screenwriter Paul Auster team up again for the follow up movie from \"Smoke\". This film once again centres on the Brooklyn corner Cigar Store and manager Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel), although most of the other characters are different. Plotlines follow Auggie's frustrated wife, Dot (Roseanne), and her attempts to seduce her husband. Also included are appearances by Jim Jarmusch, who shows up as a man about to smoke his last cigarette, and Lily Tomlin as a man with chest hair, obsessed with acquiring a Belgian waffle. Cast also includes Madonna, Michael J. Fox, Lou Reed (as himself) and Mira Sorvino."
