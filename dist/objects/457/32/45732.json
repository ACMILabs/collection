        "Dublin forms the backdrop of this evocative film about friendship, punk music, secrets, sexuality, and Dublin in the late 70's and early 80's. Punks Reena (Annie Ryan) and Jessop (Brian O'Byrne) meet on the day the Pope comes to Dublin. They form an instant alliance both physically and musically, and together with bassist Joe (Barry Comerford) and drummer Petie (John Cronin), begin 3 years of work to gain recognition for their band; The Dead Patriots. Tensions rise personally, with repercussions professionally as one feeds off the other. The situation reaches a head when Jessop discovers a secret and makes his feelings known at the band's final farewell gig. 10 years pass and the members re-unite for a final confrontation and re-unification. Cast also includes Anthony Brophy, Brendan Coyle and Donal O'Kelly."
