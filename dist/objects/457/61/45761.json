        "The purpose of this documentary is to draw attention to the fact that sometimes, people are not what they seem to be. Far too often we tend to pass judgement on face value and often if we dig a little deeper, we will be very surprised at our findings. At first glance Wlad's appearance pertains to all the stereotypical constructs of a vagabond or street drunk. As the camera moves in for a closer look the extraordinary world of Wlad the artist is revealed to us. The man was a POW in Poland and was forced to paint propaganda portraits of Stalin in order to save his own life while members of his family were carted off to concentration camps and killed."
