        "This experimental puppet animation has an uneasy feel reminiscent of videos made in the 90\u2019s by Tool guitarist Adam Jones. A small wooden figure tries to stand unassisted on trembling limbs as nameless shadows flicker just out of sight.  \"Fell\" was an outstanding contribution to the 2000 Diegesis Program. It is a surreal and beautiful work."
