        "A woman who lives in a retirement home keeps returning back to the place where she moved out from to tend to the roses, and catch up with her next door neighbour. The flowers are the old woman's only continuum between past and present, as she struggles to find a way to reclaim what was once hers in the garden that she nurtured when she was independent and self sufficient. Cast includes Martin Vaughn, Lois Ramsey, Lindy Sardelic and Liz Burch."
