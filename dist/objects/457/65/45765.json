        "The fate of Australia's most prominent Aboriginal boxer, Lionel Rose, is charted here in dramatic detail and enacted by Paul Williams. Roses' career culminated in 1968 when the then unknown 19 year old became world bantamweight champion. His success made him a household name and national hero with people from all walks of life. It was not a path paved in gold however, as battles with alcohol would mar his ultimately triumphant life. Cast also includes Telly Savalas, Tsurutaro, Kris McQuade, Tony Barry, Vicki Blanche and Steve Jacobs."
