        "Stanley Banks is a secure middle-class lawyer whose daughter, Kay, announces her wedding plans to Bickley Dunstan. From that point on, everything in Stanley's life is turned upside down. His wife, Ellie, wants Kay to have the kind of formal wedding that she and Stanley never had. In between meeting his soon-to-be in-laws, his man-to-man talk with the groom, hosting the engagement party, financing the increasingly lavish wedding, and wondering if Kay and Buckley will resolve their differences before arriving at the altar, Stanley barely has time to deal with his own considerable anxieties about his advancing age and how his \"little girl\" became a woman. Cast includes Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, Elizabeth Taylor and Don Taylor."
