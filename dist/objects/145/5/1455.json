        "A Soviet cosmonaut is hurtling through space in a malfunctioning space craft and as he faces his death he remembers his childhood on the Russian steppes where he first became aware of the beauty and miracle of flight. Through the eyes of one individual this delightful Australian short encapsulates the massive movement of modern Russian history from feudal peasantry to technological advancement."
