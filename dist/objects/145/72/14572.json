        "Vedrana is proud to be Yugoslavian, and proud to have been born in Sarajeva. To background images of Sarajeva, Vedrana reminisces about her childhood and growing up in the days of Tito - of her absolute belief in Yugoslavia where nationality did not matter. She asks \"How could 1992 happen to Sarajeva, the most tolerant city in the world?\""
