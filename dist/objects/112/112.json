        "In this single-channel videotape, a sequence of personal, light-filled images alternates with single words and short phrases in a stark white font against black background. The imagery consists of stills, pans, tracking shots, and long pulls-to-focus of everyday subjects photographed in and around the artist's summer home in Upstate New York over the course of several summers. The text, an excerpt from `The Conversation' by poet Allen Grossman, is an eloquent but dark meditation on loss and the passage of time. The tape is about appearance and interiority, surface and undercurrent, and the coexistence of the dark in the light, apprehension and beauty in common experience."
