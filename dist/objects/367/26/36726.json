        "Episode of Series \"Learn with Sooty\". Learn with Sooty videos have been developed to make learning fun. Hand puppets Sooty, Sweep and Soo, guided by Matthew Corbett, introduce the basic skills that children really need to understand. \"Have fun with Numbers\" explains the importance of knowing how to count, with many examples and exercises which show this to be true. The videos encourage participation and provide a solid base which parents can develop, by further discussing the areas that Sooty and his friends cover in the program. Most importantly, the videos will help young children learn at their own individual pace in a way that is both meaningful and enjoyable."
