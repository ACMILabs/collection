        "Based on the recently completed, controversial studies of Australian biblical scholar, Dr Barbara Thiering, which explodes miracles and other elements of the New Testament. Did the virgin birth really happen? And did Jesus actually create the miracles...turning water to wine and feeding the 5,000 with two fishes and five loaves? \"The Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls\" challenges the Gospels and the events they describe - until now believed by billions of Christians as sacrosanct. Jesus Christ is presented as a spiritual and political revolutionary whose mission was to transform Judaism. Shot in Israel, the Middle East and Europe, against a background of conflict in the region, the program is a compelling story of controversial issues both timely and universal. Every person who's ever heard of Jesus will want to see it... every Christian should."
