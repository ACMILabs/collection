        "A restless wife, Giovanna, meets Gino, a rough and handsome vagabond. Their passionate affair leads to the murder of Giovanna's boorish husband. Can a strong and sensual affair survive the guilt? Adapted from James M. Cain's classic novel \"The Postman always rings twice\", Ossessione is a dark and provocative drama of sexual tension. It heralded a new era of Italian cinema, establishing Luchino Visconti as a leading and controversial exponent of Neorealism. In Italian with English subtitles."
