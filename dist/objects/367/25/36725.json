        "Specially conceived and created for children and designed by expert British animators and educationalists, \"Animated Alphabet\" is an unprecedented learning experience and A-Z has NEVER been such fun. Using the voices of children to name the words and engaging special sound effects to vitalise the images, these bright and brilliant moving animations energise the alphabet as letters literally leap into life. The unique combination of colour, sound and movement will encourage any child and stimulate all imagination's."
