        "Labour of love is a sharp edged study of the relationship between two women and its effect on their lives. The film focuses on the friendship of two very different women. Olga is a lecturer in German literature, separated from her husband and living with her teenage son and a talented, but unsuccessful, musician whom she loves and supports. She meets Ruth, a shy, depressive woman, married to Franz, and becomes interested in her. As their friendship develops the men in their lives feel increasingly threatened and unintentionally increase pressure on both the women. Stars Angela Winkler and Hanna Schygulla."
