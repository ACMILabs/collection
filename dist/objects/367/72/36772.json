        "Episode of Series \"Dr. Seuss Beginner Book Video\". Three of Dr. Seuss's books are brought to life through animation. A perfect choice for the starting to read set, \"Hop on pop\" combines rollicking, rhyming verse with colourful, humorous action - adding up to a great way to introduce new words. \"Marvin K Mooney will you please go now!\" Kids will howl at all the incredibly outrageous ways in which an unwanted Marvin is asked to leave. \"Oh say can you say?\" Terrible tongue twisters, fun to try and twice as much fun to see."
