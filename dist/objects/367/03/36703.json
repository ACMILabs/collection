The Scarlet Woman, whore of heaven, smokes a big, fat joint; Astarte of the moon brings the wings of snow; Pan bestows the grapes of Bacchus; Hecate offers the sacred mushroom. The vintage of Hecate is poured. Pan's cup is poisoned by Lord Shiva. The orgy ensues - a magic masquerade at which Pan is the prize, Lady Kali blesses the rites of the children of light as Lord Shiva invokes the godhead."
