        "John Steinbeck's classic is brought to life with an outstanding cast and a fine script. It is a tender, moving story about the conflict between a nine year old boy, his father and the family's hired hand. A small red pony becomes the focal point of the complex human relationships at the ranch and is the catalyst for the boy's growth into manhood. Starring Myrna Loy and Robert Mitchum."
