        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". There's no city on earth like New York. Start with the Statue of Liberty, welcoming beacon to millions of immigrants; continue on to Wall Street, seat of the stock exchange and quiet Trinity Church. Jostle through the garment district, gawk at the world's tallest skyscrapers, and have a guided tour of NBC. Go inside the Metropolitan Museum to see the works of Van Gogh, Gauguin and Warhol, then continue on to the Guggenheim, Lincoln Centre, and Radio City Music Hall. Proceed to Broadway and Sardi's Restaurant, with its walls of celebrity caricatures. Ride through Central Park in a horse-drawn carriage, then visit the United Nations. Enjoy the atmosphere of Chinatown, Greenwich Village, Little Italy, and Soho."
