        "Life, love and death on Foula, a remote Shetland Island. Rare for its time, a vigorous location drama in the Flaherty tradition, sometimes naive, usually exhilarating. The original film made in 1937 with additional material filmed in colour in 1978. Stars Niall MacGinnis, Belle Chrystal, John Laurie and Finlay Currie."
