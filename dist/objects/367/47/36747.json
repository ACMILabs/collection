        "From Italy's most controversial director comes a challenging and sometimes harrowing vision of cultural and economic strife. A poor Southern family travels to Milan in the thriving industrial North, where they are beset by violent misfortune. Blending the styles of harsh neo-realism with the grandiose operatic strokes of tragic melodrama, this story is an uncompromising portrait of the rigours of modern life, and a milestone in Italian political cinema. Cast includes Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale. In Italian with English subtitles."
