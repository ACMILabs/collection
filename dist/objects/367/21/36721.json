        "Alana, a lively 13 year old from the year 3000, finds herself stranded in a strange and primitive world when a time-travel experiment goes terribly wrong. She is kidnapped by Silverthorn, a fugitive war-lord from the dangerous and violent times of the year 2500 and they crash land in a rubbish dump in Sydney in the year 1990. Alana crawls from the battered time capsule, leaving Silverthorn unconscious, and escapes with her personal wrist computer P.J. as her only companion. Cold, hungry and frightened, she is discovered by Jenny, a rebellious purple-haired girl her own age and Petey, Jenny's science fiction obsessed younger brother."
