        "This film is designed for use in training supervisors and junior managers in human relations problems. The film tells the story of two workers starting with a new firm. Both are looking forward to the work and believe that they now have the opportunity they have been looking for to make successful careers for themselves. The first part shows how frustration and disillusionment can arise through lack of care and thought on the part of the supervisor. It then shows how these bad impressions could have been avoided by proper handling of the situation."
