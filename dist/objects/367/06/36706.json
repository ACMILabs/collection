        "An account of the nesting habits of the Mallee Fowl. These birds are members of the family Megapodirdae - the mound builders. They do not brood their eggs but lay them on a bed of organic matter in a mound of earth, leaving them to be incubated by heat from fermenting vegetable matter and the natural heat of the sun. The male bird carefully adjusts the mound so that the varying amounts of heat from the two sources maintain the temperature at 92 degrees fahrenheit."
