        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Discover why New Zealanders call it \"God's own country\". The awe-inspiring scenery of the North and South Islands with subtropical beaches, mountain glaciers, steaming geysers and rich farmlands, make this country a natural wonderland. Meet New Zealand's original inhabitants, the Maoris, who arrived by canoe from Polynesia more than 1,000 years ago. Fly over the snow-capped peaks of Mount Cook and ferry across the beautiful and remote Mallborough Sounds. Enjoy the breathtaking scenery along Milford Track and visit Auckland, the largest city and a boat owner's paradise."
