        "An ironic narrator comperes Ophuls' circular tale of love and seduction set in the nostalgic Vienna of 1900. \"La Ronde\" was booed at its premiere, but went on to become one of the greatest successes of post-war European cinema. Bans and protests againsts its 'immorality' only boosted its fame: in London it played for eighteen months at one cinema. With a superb cast, lavish production values and bravura camerawork, \"La Ronde\" confirms Ophuls' reputation as one of the cinema's major artists. Stars a veritable who's who of European cinema including Anton Walbrook, Simone Signoret, Serge Reggiani, Simone Simon, Daniel Gelin, Danielle Darrieux, Fernand Gravey, Odette Joyeux, Jean-Louis Barrault, Isa Miranda and Gerard Philipe."
