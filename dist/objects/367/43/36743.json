        "A condemned killer awaits his execution. A funny tragedy, a happy- go-lucky horror show, a gay little wake for the dead who have died in the name of justice - the kind of justice that demands a life for a life. Like Brendan Behan's play, the picture ignores the rational arguments against capital punishment. It simply takes the audience inside an Irish prison and bolts the gate, and then with a world of Irish charm and humour shows everybody how it feels to live in a cell - and die on a rope."
