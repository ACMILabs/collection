        "Szabo's \"Mephisto\" is a remarkably cinematic study of the alluring theatricality of emergent Nazism, the totalitarian delight in dressing up, in spotlights a spectacle in marches and uniform! Based on a 1936 novel by Klaus Mann, the film is the account of a basically decent, though self-centred man's seduction by the rulers of Nazi Germany. Stars Klaus-Maria Brandauer. Winner of an Academy Award for best foreign film."
