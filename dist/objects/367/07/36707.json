        "Episode of Series \"The World about us\". A comprehensive treatment of saltwater and freshwater crocodiles. A 'non-specialist' film, it is nevertheless scientifically accurate, and takes a balanced view of this little understood and seldom loved reptile, which is now in danger of extinction. Narrated by Hugh Falkus. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
