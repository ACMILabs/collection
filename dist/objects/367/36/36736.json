        "Dziga Vertov was the founder of the Soviet documentary. He headed a group of experimental documentarists who took the name Kinoki, or Kino- Eyes. As a militant theorist he proclaimed the supremacy of what would now be called Cinema-Verite. His films and his theoretical writings have had an enormous and lasting influence on world cinema. \"The sixth part of the World\" is Vertov's lyrical cinema poem to the vast expanses of the Soviet Union, grand, complicated, exotic and hugely popular."
