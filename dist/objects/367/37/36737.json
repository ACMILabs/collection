        "Introduced in English. Eisenstein's \"Bezhin Meadow\" was to be a drama set against the background of collectivisation of agriculture and based on the true story of Pavlick Morosov, a little boy who organised his fellow pioneers to guard the harvest so effectively that his own Kulak family, planning sabotage, felt him an enemy of his class and killed him. The result can only be a shadow; but this 1966 half hour reconstruction has a force which makes one regret bitterly what must have been Eisenstein's finest film. From a story by Ivan Turgenev."
