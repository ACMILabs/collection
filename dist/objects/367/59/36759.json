        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Jetfoils and junks, sampans and ferries skim across the harbour as you begin your visit to Hong Kong. Push through the crowded streets of this bustling financial centre and enjoy the folk theatre performances going on all around. Shop in the street markets and elegant department stores. Enjoy a change of pace in the outer islands, dotted with quiet fishing villages, serene monasteries and isolated beaches. Visit Macau, the oldest European settlement in Asia."
