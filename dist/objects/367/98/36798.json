        "A compassionate love story tracing the relationship between a burnt-out country and western star and a young widow he meets in a Texas motel. His past is littered with the spoils of fame and scarred by alcoholism, two broken marriages and a painful descent from stardom so that he lacks confidence in relationships and has a low opinion of himself and others. The widow and her young son help him to rebuild his life and to appreciate the healing power of affection. Stars Robert Duvall and Tess Harper."
