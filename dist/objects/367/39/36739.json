        "Asya Klyashina is a cook in a small Russian village, lame and unmarried. During harvest time she works at a field camp where she renews acquaintance with Sasha, a driver returned from the city, who announces that he loves her but has no thought of marriage. Mothers look after their children amid the harvest; the men reminisce about the Patriotic War (\"fighting for the Motherland, for Stalin\") and about the prison camps after the war. But complications to her life start when Asya discovers she is pregnant by another youth, Stephan."
