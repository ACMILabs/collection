        "Italy is a country steeped deep in the cultural riches of an ancient land juxtaposed with the cosmopolitan chic of the new. Her cities, equally important in their contribution to Italy's cultural tapestry, have played host to many world events, and 1990 is no exception when twelve of them host soccer's premier competition, the World Cup. Features : Rome, Naples, Bari, Genoa, Florence and Verona. Presented by Les Murray."
