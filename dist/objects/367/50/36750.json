        "Armand de la Vennes prides himself as the Don Juan of his cavalry regiment. To prove his reputation he accepts a bet that he can win any woman in the town chosen by his fellows, in the month before the regiment leaves for summer manoeuvres. Marie-Louise (Michele Morgan), beautiful divorcee and new arrival in town, is selected as his target. What starts out as a lighthearted wager turns into serious drama as Armand tries vainly to overturn his reputation and prove himself to be loving, faithful and honest. Stars Brigitte Bardot and Gerard Philipe."
