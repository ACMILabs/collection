        "Noddy is a little wooden fellow who runs away from his father, a woodcarver and goes to Toyland, a play city for children inhabited by a population of wooden and woolly characters. Noddy finds a home there and lots of adventures which he steadfastly encounters and manages to overcome with the help of several good friends like Big Ears and Tessie Bear. Narrated by Richard Briers, Enid Blyton's popular stories are brought to life by puppets."
