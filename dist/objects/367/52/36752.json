        "This film is a fascinating portrait of Jack Kerouac, the author of \"On the road\" and reluctant King of the Beat Generation. Includes interviews with family members and cronies including Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Edie Kerouac Parker. This film is a candid and moving biography of one of America's most influential authors. It is a terrifying and exhilarating film about a troubled genius whose influence is still being felt all over the world."
