        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Japan begins to unfold as you enter a Zen temple, then witness an ancient ritual in a Shinto shrine. In the resort of Ibusuki, you will marvel at guests buried to the neck in steaming volcanic sand. Admire the great Buddha of Kamakura and the splendid architecture of 400 year old Himeji Castle. Then plunge into the frantic pace of Tokyo during the Sanja Matsuri Festival."
