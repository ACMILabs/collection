        "Derek Jarman shot the main sequences for this, his first lengthy film in the early '70s. Described as 'very personal' with a dream- like repetitive quality, the film expresses a mythology and dabbles with ideas relating to magic alchemy and ritual, allowing dream-images to drift and collide at random."
