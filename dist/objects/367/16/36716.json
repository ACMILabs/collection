        "In these five episodes of Play School, John Hamblin and Noni Hazelhurst have lots of fun with all kinds of hats. They make hats, they wear hats and they tell stories and sing about the people who wear them. Songs include \"Do you put your hat on your head?\", \"Three little fishes\", \"Wiggerly Woo\", \"Hey diddle diddle\" and others. Some of the delightful stories are Mrs. Honey's Hat, Jonathan Just and the Quangle Wangle's Hat. In all, two and a half hours of wonderful entertainment for children."
