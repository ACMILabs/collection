        "The last decade has seen the emergence of an exciting and unique cuisine in Australia, arising from the multi-cultural nature of our society and the abundance of fresh, natural ingredients. This program is a gourmet's tour of some of the best restaurants in the forefront of this development. It profiles the style of these famous restaurants, their chefs and details how to prepare some of their favourite dishes. Divided into three sections: Dining in Sydney and Dining with wine. Restaurants include Cleopatra's, The Cellar, Berowra Waters, Taylors, Bangkok, The Barn, Cotswold House and Craigmoor."
