        "A youth named Alec and a fabled Arabian steed survived a shipwreck and became inseparable friends in The Black Stallion, the first of Walter Farley's 16-book series to be made into a highly successful film. In the sequel The Black Stallion returns, the horse is reclaimed by its rightful owner, beginning an odyssey to North Africa and a culture alien to Alec. Through his persistence, Alec gains new insights into courage, perseverance and honour. This action-filled adventure tale joins the initial film as a timeless classic. Stars Kelly Reno and Ferdy Mayne"
