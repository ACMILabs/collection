        "The story is so slight as to be almost plotless; the young peasants of a Ukranian village want to buy a tractor to bring the future a little faster to their village but the kulaks of the community fear this strengthened unity and one of them kills the young village chairman. Yet this summary scarcely hints of all the qualities and passages that have made \"Earth\" one of the acknowledged classics of the Soviet and world cinema. The unique beauty of \"Earth\", Dovzhenko's best and last silent film, brought him international fame."
