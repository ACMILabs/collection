        "Alana, the girl from Year 3000, resigns herself to the fact that she'll be trapped forever in this barbaric past, where the air is hard to breathe and the technology is extremely primitive. Then she discovers that Silverthorn is alive and that he has got the time machine. A deep and lasting friendship develops between the two girls, as they race against time to recover the time capsule, which has been programmed to return automatically to Alana's home in just thirty days."
