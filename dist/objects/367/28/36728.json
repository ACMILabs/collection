        "It all began with Johnny Naples, a South American dwarf, and an ordinary box of Maltesers left in the incompetent hands of London's most unsuccessful private detective, Tim Diamond of Tim Diamond Inc. Before the day is out the dwarf is dead and our hapless investigator and the box of Maltesers are wanted by the police, and just about every major gangster in Europe is breathing down his neck. Hopelessly out of his depth, Tim has one secret weapon; his 13 year old brother Nick. As the mystery unfolds, Tim and Nick find themselves on the trail of a fortune in uncut diamonds."
