        "The Colour of Pomegranates is a stream of religious poetic and local iconography of astonishing beauty, based on the work of Armenian poet Sayat Nova. \"Legend of the Suram fortress\" is set in Georgia and was Paradjanov's first film after eleven years enforced confinement. It is based on a Georgian legend and continues the tension of Paradjanov's earlier works concerning free will and predestination. Dedicated to Georgian warriors, it is a bold metaphor for Georgia's independence from \"Mother Russia\"."
