        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Begin this tour of the Hawaiian islands on Oahu with snorkelling at Hanauma Bay where the fish are so tame they eat out of your hand. Journey to Hawaii, the big island, and walk along a black sand beach at Kaimu. Be enchanted by Kanai, the garden island, legendary home of the goddess Pele. Glide down the Wailua River to the fern grotto and hear the \"Hawaiian Wedding Song\" sung by native Hawaiians."
