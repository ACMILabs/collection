        "Johnson, a courageous pink elephant, leads his friends on a daring adventure into the darkness under Michael's bed. They stumble upon Alfred, a gruff hot water bottle lurking in the shadows. McDuff, the cheeky concertina, squeals in surprise as Diesel the dump truck and Squeaky the battered robot head for safety. Michael's cluttered bedroom is the setting for the captivating series of adventures and misadventures which draw together this irrepressible band of toys."
