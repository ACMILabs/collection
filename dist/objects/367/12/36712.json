        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Alcheringa (A)\". An Aboriginal man and his wife undertake a pilgrimage to the sacred place of the Rainbow Serpent, the controller of rain, water and life on earth. They are shown walking to the coast through an uninhabited land, clambering down cliffs to the ocean. The man carries spears and always walks ahead. Their way of life in tribal times is clearly shown in this brief sequence, as the man carries two spears and walks ahead of his wife."
