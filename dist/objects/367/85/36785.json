        "Brazil, tropical land of the future, home of macumba and emeralds, welcomes you with open arms. Meet the warm people of Bahia and dance with them in an umbanda ceremony. Feel the rhythm of Rio de Janeiro, where sunworshipping Cariocas play on Copacabana Beach, showgirls prepare for Carnival, and everyone sambas to the sultry music. Take a break in the cooling mist of Iguazu Falls before heading north to Manaus, gateway to the Amazon. Tour the opera house, then float up the largest river in the world. Experience the pulsating beat of Sao Paulo, commercial centre of South America. Complete your journey in Brasilia, the ultramodern capital."
