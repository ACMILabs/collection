        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Your safari begins in Nairobi National Park, where a curious ostrich greets your van. Witness an animal traffic jam as you enter Mara Game Reserve, established by the Masai tribe. View herds of colourful zebra and sleek gazelles, then watch in awe as a roaring lion guards his scampering cubs. Visit a coffee plantation and see beans being milled. Cross the Equator into Samburu-Isiolo Game Reserve, take a side trip to Lamu Island, then admire the pink flamingoes at Lake Nakuru."
