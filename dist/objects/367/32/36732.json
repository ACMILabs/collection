        "Sergei Eisenstein's patriotic masterpiece of the exploits of 13th Century Russian hero Prince Alexander Nevsky was his first sound film and featured a special musical score by composer Sergey Prokovief. The Prince, as chosen leader of the people of Novgorod, vanquished the Teutonic Knights on the ice of Lake Peipus. The characters, boldly drawn and unencumbered with psychological details, are monumental figures. All are conceived as they are imagined today and as they survive in folklore. The impressive cast includes Nikolai Cherkassov as Nevsky."
