        "Scouts is a celebration of the potential of youth that documents the triumphs and tragedies of the Scout ideal. Historic newsreels, rare archival film and scenes from Baden-Powell's own home movies bring alive the era of Baden-Powell and the origins of Scouting. \"Scouts\" is a unique program that will captivate any audience, whether or not they have taken the Scout oath."
