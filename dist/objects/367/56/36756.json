        "The Holy innocents is a poignant rural drama zeroing in on the abysmal class differences still existing in some sections of modern Spain, especially in the holdings of the rural aristocracy. The story concerns an impoverished family working on the estate of an aristocratic family in the province of Extramaduna in the 1960s. Each of the members of the poor family is spotlighted for a part of the film."
