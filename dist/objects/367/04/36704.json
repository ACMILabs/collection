        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Anger Magick Lantern Cycle\". Invocation of my demon brother (1969, 11 min) A conjuration of pagan forces comes off the screen in a surge of spiritual and mystical power. The shadowing forth of Lord Lucifer, as the powers gather at a midnight mass. Lucifer Rising (1970-80, 28 min) - A film about the love generation- the birthday party of the Aquarian age showing actual ceremonies to make Lucifer rise. Lucifer is the light god, not the devil- the rebel angel behind what's happening in the world today. His message is that the key of joy is disobedience. Isis wakes. Osiris answers. Lilith climbs to the place of Sacrifice. The Magus activates the circle and Lucifer, bringer of light, breaks through."
