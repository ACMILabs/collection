        "A young boy is saved from a devastating shipwreck by a beautiful black stallion. Together they survive on an isolated island, an experience that creates a lasting bond between them. After their rescue, they return to America where they meet Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney) an irascible ex-jockey and horse trainer. Dailey is quick to realise the racing potential of the stallion and teaches the boy to be a jockey. Based on the novel by Walter Farley the film stars Kelly Reno, Mickey Reno and Teri Garr."
