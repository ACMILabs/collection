        "Watch the Bible come to life in this video tour of the Holy Land. Begin your visit at the Red Sea, following the path of Moses and the Israelites through the desert of Sinai. Continue into the Negev, past the ancient walls of Hebron, to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. Walk through the crowded streets of Nazareth and along the shores of the Sea of Galilee. Visit Masada, the mountaintop fortress, then take the ancient road through Sumeria. Pass Jericho and the Red Sea before entering Jerusalem, Israel's capital and holy city to three faiths."
