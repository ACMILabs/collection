        "Episode of Series \"Social Psychology\". Shows how a social psychological experiment is designed, conducted and analysed. The experiment is a test to see if non-verbal behaviour gives clues as to whether a person is being deceptive - the hypothesis being that the face will not give clues to deception, but the hands and feet will. One of a series of a third level course from the Faculty of Social Science Open University. The purpose is to provide insight into social behaviour and experience. The essential focus is on theories, findings, and methods of social psychology."
