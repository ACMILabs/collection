        "Episode of Series \"The State of the Nation Bounds of Freedom\". A television company proposes to make a documentary about economic exploitation and police brutality in a foreign country. It has already made two such programs - is it fair to make a third? And should the reporter sent to investigate be known to have strong personal opinions on the subject? Narrated by Jeremy Isaacs."
