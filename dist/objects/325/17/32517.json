        "Although Judith Ashe has not been accused of any crime, she is in jail. She has not been tried and refuses to testify before a federal grand jury. She is in jail until she talks. The film reveals the legal process that put her there, and the increasing test of her convictions, not only in the grand jury room, but in her relationships with friends, family and her lawyer. Cast: Pamela Reed."
