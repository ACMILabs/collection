        "An inspiring documentation of the work of music teacher Arlene Symons in bringing together a chorus of children from the 1979-1980 class of the Friends School in Brooklyn, New York and the senior chorus from the Council Centre for Senior Citizens, Brooklyn. Three months of separate rehearsals took place, and a pen pal program set up between the two groups. A week before the concert, the groups came together."
