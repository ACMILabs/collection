        "The versatility of wool is applied to artistic tapestries and home decor furnishings. Used by highly creative craftspeople, wool is knotted, twisted or woven, bunched and crunched, looped or drooped - to assemble many exciting textured designs. The film is centred on the creative applications of this exciting raw material. After a short voice-over introduction, the sound track is a series of inspired tone poems composed by the noted jazz musician Don Burrows and performed by his Quintet. The film includes exhibits by Judith Barnes, Robert Bell, Fay Bottrell, Arthur Boyd, John Coburn, Deanna Conti, John Olsen and others."
