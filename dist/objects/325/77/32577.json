        "This film sensitively explores the extreme problems of social adjustment experienced by people newly released from prison. After several years of confinement within an ordered monochrome prison life, the outside world is a noisy busy place. Housing, money, wives, defactos, children, a job - all have to be sorted out within a short time if the ex-prisoner is not going to fall back on old ways, old friends, and the same situations which led to prison in the first place. Cast includes Chris Haywood, Richard Moir, Jennifer Scott-Roberts, Geraldine Smedley and Ellen Freeman."
