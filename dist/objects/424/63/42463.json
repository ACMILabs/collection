        "Lee Marvin stars as both Tim Strawn (a noseless gunslinger) and Kid Shelleen, the woozy, boozy has-been who goes up against Strawn at high noon. Jane Fonda, at the height of her sex-kitten period, stars as Cat Ballou, the schoolmarm-turned outlaw who teams with Kid to protect her father's ranch from a greedy railroad tycoon. One of the biggest box office hits of 1965, \"Cat Ballou\" was declared an instant classic with its sly blend of Western parody and rapid-fire action. Directed by Elliot Silverstein."
