        "Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth dance up a storm in this classic musical romance set in Buenos Aires. Maria (Hayworth) is the coolly elegant, eldest daughter of hotel magnate Edward Acuna, the most opinionated man in South America. Having inherited her father's misanthropy, Maria has created havoc for her two sisters who can't wed until she marries a man of Acuna's choice. Along comes Robert Davies (Astaire), a carefree American dancer, down on his luck in Argentina. Unfortunately for Davies, Acuna can't stand him, especially when he's dancing around the hotel and chasing after his lovely daughter."
