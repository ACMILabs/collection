        "For forty years in one city a word appears written on the street. It could have been any word in any city of the world, but this word was 'Eternity'. Always the same, written in chalk in elegant copperplate script, appearing like frost overnight on the streets of Sydney. In 1956 the writer was discovered after twenty years of secrecy. He would continue to write this word until his death in 1967. Director Lawrence Johnston's internationally award-winning documentary is an orchestration of beautiful black and white cinematography combined with haunting music. Biographical reconstruction succeeds in including the audience amongst those whose lives have been touched by Arthur Stace's lonely and mysterious mission."
