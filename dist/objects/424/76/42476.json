        "The American Civil War raged for nearly four years and cost over 642,000 men their lives. In a single battle, during three days of brutal combat in the town of gettysburg, nearly 50,000 soldiers were killed - more than during all the years of the Vietnam War. Though it recounts one of the bloodiest chapters in history, this film is about more than just statistics - it is the story of ordinary men caught in an extraordinary battle to fight for their beliefs and freedom. An all star cast headed by Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, Jeff Daniels and Sam Elliot bring these remarkable characters to life in a thrilling epic that captures powerful emotions and showcases some of the most awesome action sequences ever filmed!"
