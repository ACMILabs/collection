        "This zany romantic comedy, nominated for six Academy Awards stars Cary Grant as Leopold Dilg, a prison escapee who hides out in the home of schoolteacher Nora, played by Jean Arthur. Leopold enlists the help of Nora to try and convince her summer tenant, Supreme Court candidate Michael Lightcap (Ronald Colman), that Dilig was falsely imprisoned on the charge of arson. As the charming and persuasive fugitive and conservative lawyer share living arrangements they also find themselves sharing a growing affection for the beautiful schoolteacher."
