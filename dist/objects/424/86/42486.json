        "From the past, when distinctions between childhood and adulthood were not as finely drawn as they are today, this film traces the development of the adolescent and shows some of the real problems of this age. It notes that it was the defense of the young, the protection afforded by reformers and educators, that created the generation gap so evident today in Western society. What adolescents gained and lost from changing attitudes towards them is clearly illustrated in the film. (Awards: New York; La Plata; Tehran)"
