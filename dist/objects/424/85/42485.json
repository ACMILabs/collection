        "Warning- there is an image drop out 30 seconds into tape, preceding the title. The church organ is in need of repair with only two days to go until Christmas. If the organ is not fixed the choir will have to sing unassisted, and the music wouldn't sound right. The organ player makes the journey with his children to buy the part but are unable to return with it when they must abandon their car in an avalanche. As the priest reflects on the silent night in the absence of an organ, words come to him that will be familiar to everyone. An entertaining story on how one of the world most famous carols may have evolved. Featuring the beautiful voices of the Oberndorf Boys' Choir."
