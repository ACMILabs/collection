        "The talents behind this special effects bonanza are onto something special - lovely laser-keen wit that comes at warp speed, with modesty and effortless cool. With a new alien critter roughly every 10 minutes - only the sheer presence of the main actors Tommy Lee Jones and Wil Smith keeps them from being upstaged. They are the best kept secret in the universe, their mission is to monitor extra-terrestrial activity on earth. They are our best, last and only line of defence. They work in secret, they exist in shadow - they are the Men in Black! Based on the comic by Lowell Cunningham."
