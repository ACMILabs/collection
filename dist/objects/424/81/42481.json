        "Molly is a dog with a special gift- she can sing. This results in fortune and misfortune as it attracts love to the good but noticeable attention to bad fortune hunters. Travelling with her owner (Reg Lye) from the outback to the city brings its fair share of adventures. A modern Australian fairy tale that will delight viewers. Starring Melissa Jaffer, Reg Lye, Garry McDonald, Claudia Carvan and Members of the Flying Fruit Fly Circus."
