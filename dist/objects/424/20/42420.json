        "Intelligence tests have traditionally concentrated in the narrow fields of language, mathematics and logic skill. This video provides snapshots of how teachers are using psychologist Howard Gardner's model to improve their taching and recognise and assess particular strengths of each of their pupils. Gardner's model suggests there are seven intelligences: Linguistic, Logical-mathematical, Visual-spatial, Musical, Bodily-Kinaesthetic, Interpersonal and Intrapersonal."
