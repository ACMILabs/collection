        "Three episodes from \"Seinfeld\" screened during 1991. The tape includes a bonus 100th episode with excerpts from throughout the season. \"The Heart attack\"; Always the hypochondriac, George thinks he's suffering a heart attack, only to discover he has tonsilitis. He tries everything to avoid the operation, including consulting a holistic healer. \"The Deal\"; A channel surfing night on the couch leads to Jerry and Elaine rekindling their relationship- only they have to set a few ground rules first. Jerry is troubled when he has to find an 'appropriate' present because of their new relationship. \"The Library\"; Jerry is contacted regarding an overdue library book dating back to 1971. There's a flashback to Jerry and George in highschool, who have different accounts of the day in question. Produced by Larry Charles, directed by Joshua White. \"100th episode\". Introduced by Jerry Seinfeld and featuring excerpts from the series funniest moments. Produced by Peter Mehlman and Susan Mamann Greenberg, directed by Andy Ackerman."
