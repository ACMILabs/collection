        "Paul Mazurky's modern day reworking of Shakespeare's \"Tempest\" is an extraordinary comedy about a consumate dissatisfied man (John Cassavetes), no longer able to tolerate the compromises he has made in his stormy marriage. Cast includes Susan Sarandon, Gena Rowlands, Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia and the spectacular vistas of the Greek Isles."
