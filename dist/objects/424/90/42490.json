        "A Story of hate, murder and revenge, this is Fritz Lang's classic Western starring the great Marlene Dietrich in a typically sexy role. Vern Haskell (Arthur Kennedy) and his fiancee Beth (Gloria Henry) are to be married in 8 days time. One afternoon when Beth is minding her father's store, two strangers ride into town. One of the men enters the store and tells her to open the safe, but it soon becomes obvious that he wants more than the money. From across the street a boy hears a gun shot ring out, and then sees a man make his escape. Vern is called and pushes through the crowd to find Beth dead. The stage is set for one of the great revenge western. In pursuit of Beth's assaillant, Vern finds his way to Chuk-a-luck ranch, a safe haven for runaway outlaws run with an iron fist by Altar Keane (Marlene Dietrich) and her boyfriend Frenchy Fairmont (Mel Ferrer). Adpated to the screen by Daniel Taradash and Silvia Richards from her novel \"Gunsight Whitman\"."
