        "Based on Richard Frankland's experiences as a field officer during the Royal Commission into Aboriginal custody, this film follows the journey of Shane as he drives from Swan Hill to Melbourne after a day in the field. During the night, his experiences play on his mind and imagination. He will be haunted by what he has seen."
