        "Episode of Series 'Touch the Sun'. Johnno, an energetic and sensitive 10 year old, resides in a small coastal fishing town. His father's inability to come to terms with Johnno's deafness exacerbates their already troubled relationship. To curb Johnno's rebelliousness, his father proposes to send him to a \"special school\". On learning of this plan Johnno flees to a nearby island to live like Robinson Crusoe. An Italian fisherman, who has earlier befriended Johnno, finds him on the island and endeavours to persuade him to return and face his problems. Cast includes: Damien Walters - Captain Johnno Rebecca Sykes - Julie Michelle Fawdon - Kathleen Joe Petruzzi - Tony Written by Rob George, music by Stephen Matters. Rated G."
