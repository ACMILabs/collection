        "The story is simple - a mysterious stranger (Terence Stamp) arrives at a bourgeois household in Milan and successively seduces the son (Andres Jose Cruz), the mother (Silvana Magnano), the daughter (Anne Wiazemsky) and the father (Massimo Girotti), not forgetting the maid (Laura Betti). As a result of his attentions, the father hands over his factory to the workers, the son abandons his vocation as a painter, the mother gives herself over to random sexual encounters and the daughter sinks into catatonia while the maid becomes a saint. Pasolini uses his schematic plot to prove a point (the bourgeois family is held together by sexual repression) and to explore family dynamics, the intersection of class and sex, and the nature of different sexualities. He also delves into the 'trouble' caused by homosexuality. In Italian with English subtitles."
