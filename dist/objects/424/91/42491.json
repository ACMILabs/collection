        "La Scorta is the rivetting story of a judge and the four carbinieri officers assigned to protect him and their attempts to fight corruption in Sicily. The film opens with the violent death of a judge and his escort. Judge Michele de Francesco (Carlo Cecchi) volunteers as his replacement and soon discovers that corruption has infiltrated all levels of the community. Soon he finds that the only people he can trust are the four men assigned as his bodyguards, Angelo Mandelosi (Claudio Amendola), Andrea Corsale (Enrico Lo Verso), Fabio Muzzi (Ricky Memphis) and Raffaele Frasca (Tony Sperandeo). The five men risk their lives and the safety of their families in order to fight corruption in the Sicilian town. Ricky Tognazzi directs a seat-gripping thriller which comments on corruption in modern Italian society. With a musical score by Ennio Morricone. In Italian with English subtitles."
