        "Whynnie Foster, a shy 10 year old living with her grandmother, dreams of being free. She is drawn to the family owned forest to the tune of what her grandmother calls fairy music, created by the elves who live there. Whynnie discovers the magic spring or fountain of youth that has immortilsed the Tuck family who live in the forest and befriend her. They must tell her the secret of the water to ensure she will keep their secret. Throughout the saga a myserious stranger follows Whynnie and attempts to extort her family into selling their land in exchange for Whynnie when she is 'kidnapped' by the Tucks. The experience forces Whynnie to examine whether she wants to drink from the magic water and live forever. Based on the novel of the same name by Natalie Babbitt, this video stars Fred A Keller, James McGuire and Paul Flessa. A thought provoking video for older children."
