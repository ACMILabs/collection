        "A round-up of what goes on in the toe-touching parlors of a large city. Here you see modern man brought to bay by his own poundage, resolved to erase by exercise what rich food, idleness and age have put on. In yoga headstand schools and flesh-shrinking lofts, high resolves to beat the bulge reach strange and sometimes amusing ends. (A revised version of the original film of the same title.)"
