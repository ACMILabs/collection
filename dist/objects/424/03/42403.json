        "June 24th is celebrated in Montreal with parade and fanfare in memory of St. Jean Baptiste, the patron saint of Quebec. Now more of an historical than a religeous pageant, the \"grande parade\" consists of a series of tableaux on floats representing events from French Canada's colourful past. Using candid camera techniques, the film captures the reactions and behaviour of people participating in a public festivity dear to their hearts. Contains some spoken French language."
