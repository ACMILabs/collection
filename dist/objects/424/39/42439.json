        "Geriard Corbiau's \"Farinelli\" is a lavish drama which tells the story of Carlo Broschi or Farinelli, a castrato who was a European celebrity during the 18th century. Carlo (Stafano Dionisi) is inseparable from his brother Riccardo (Enrio Lo Verso), a mediocre composer whose career depends solely on his brother's enormous fame. Together the Broschi brothers conquer the courts of Europe, until they are embroilled in an artistic battle with Handel(Jeroen Crabbe) in England. Farinelli's voice was created by digitally combining the voices of counter tenor Derek Lee Ragin and soprano Ewa Mallas-Godlewska. Voted Best Foreign Language Film at 1995 Golden Globe Awards. Mostly in French with english subtitles."
