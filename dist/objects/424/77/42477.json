        "Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) is not happy. His ex-wife has stolen his novel, reaping the financial rewards and giving Larry a serious case of writer's block. To complicate matters Owen (Danny De Vito), a student in Larry's creative writing class wants to participate in a murder-swap; Larry's wife for Owen's mother. This eventuates after Larry recommends Owen sees Hitchcock's 'Strangers on a train' to assist in his writing. Owen misinterprets his intentions, taking the film literally. It seems like a simple task but killing Momma isn't that easy! Written by Stu Silver."
