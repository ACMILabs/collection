        "A group of youths in a motorcycle gang ride into a small Californian town and begin to terrorize the locals. Johnny, the leader of the gang, falls in love with a woman in town but any hope for their relationship is ruined by both the aggression of his fellow bikers, and the prejudices and closed- mindedness of the town's people. \"The wild one\" was one of the first Hollywood movies to represent the emerging sub-cultures of alienated and dissatisfied Western youth who were the immediate predecessors to the generation in the sixties who were to create the upheaval of the \"counter- culture\". Initially banned in Australia on its release, \"The wild one\" is also notable for Marlon Brando's electrifying performance as Johnny and its (then) innovative use of a rock and roll music score."
