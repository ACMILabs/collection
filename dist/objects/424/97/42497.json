        "Nuclear power is the subject of this film that opens with a tour of the Bruce Nuclear Power Plant located on Lake Huron near Port Elgin. Questions regarding safety, cost and decision-making powers are raised by various people in the area. In view of Ontario Hydro's plans to complete by 1983 the construction of several plants at a projected cost of $22 million, this film examines a timely and controversial issue. Interviewer: Howard Hutton. Narrator: Christine Johnston."
