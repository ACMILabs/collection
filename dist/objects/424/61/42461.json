        "Based on the novel by Paul Wellman, this is a loose reworking of Shakepeare's Othello into a western setting. Jubal Troop (Glenn Ford), a drifter given a job by his friend, a rancher Shep Horgan (Borgnine), makes an enemy of the range rider (Steiger) when Shep's restless wife, Mae, is attracted to the newcomer. Driven by jealousy, Pinky sets out to frame Jubal and plants in Shep's mind the suspicion that Jubal is carrying on with Mae. Wanting to hurt both Shep who she doesn't love, and Jubal who has spurned her, Mae untruthfully confirms Pinky's story. Shep goes gunning for Jubalm and the heat of the Wild West is matched by the passions at Horgan's ranch, as anger turns to treachery...and murder."
