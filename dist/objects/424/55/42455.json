        "The film deals with the intellectual development of infants; Piaget's six stages of sensory-motor activities. According to Piaget, all babies follow the same developmental sequence of activities although not necessarily at the same time. Illustrates the six stages with appropriate commentary using babies from the age of three weeks, to children who can comprehend and are beginning to use speech."
