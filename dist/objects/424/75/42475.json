        "Othello: an intoxicating mix of love, sexual passion and the deadly power of jealousy. Riddled with jealousy and twisted with racial hatred, Iago (Kenneth Branagh) schemes and plots his way to torturing the love of Othello (Laurence Fishburne) and Desdemona (Irene Jacob). In a visually stunning and superbly acted masterpiece, Othello tells the most passionate tale of love and betrayal of all time."
