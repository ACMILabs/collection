        "A trip to the bank to secure a loan backing a major housing project by mayor Frank Skeffington (Spencer Tracy), leads to a complicated and corrupted political campaign. The mayor is met by opposition from two of the towns key figures; Amos Force (John Carradine), publisher of the local paper, and Norman Cass Sr. (Basil Rathbone), one of the cities leading bankers. As a measure of protest they nominate the banker's incompetent son as acting fire commissioner. In an effort to conceal his son's ineptness the mayor is granted the loan, but in a cruel twist Norman Cass Sr. financially supports the opposition in the upcoming mayoral election and Skeffington has everything working against his re-election. Also starring Jeffrey Hunter, Diane Foster, Pat O'Brien and James Gleason and based on the novel by Edwin O'Connor."
