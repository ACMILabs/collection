        "Outlaw Luther Sledge (James Garner) sets out with his bandit gang to steal a half million dollar consignment of gold bullion which is shipped each week through a small western town. His scheme involves stealing the gold from within a local prison where it is held overnight. This daring escapade leads to a sequence of betrayals and a violent trail of vengeance across the Mexican border. This is a dramatic and fast-moving western which casts James Garner in the unusual role of villain, the supporting cast includes Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins and John Marley."
