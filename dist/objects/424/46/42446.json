        "Adapted from Philip Barry's play and a remake of a film made in 1930, George Cukor's \"Holiday\" is a wonderful comedy which subtly examines the lives of an unhappy wealth family and a carefree young man who enters their plush world. When Johnny Case (Cary Grant) returns from a skiing holiday to visit his fiance Julie Seton (Doris Nolan) he is shocked to discover she is very very rich. Soon Julie's father is mapping out their lives, but Julie's non-conformist sister Linda (Katherine Hepburn) and alcholic brother Ned (Lew Ayres) think that Johnny's fresh enthusiasm for life could be the antidote for their father's tiranic rule. Hepburn and Grant give fantastic performances and Cukor's direction ensures that this is a sparkling romantic comedy."
