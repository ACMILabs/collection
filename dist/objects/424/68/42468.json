        "The shocking discovery of a human skull in the Texas desert starts Sheriff Sam Deeds on the trail to solve a forty-year-old mystery. Deed's investigation implicates many in the town, both alive and dead... but most surprisingly of all, his own father, who was a legendary lawman and prominent figure in the town's history. A typically acute, intricate and intelligent film from the most ambitious of US film directors it takes the broad canvas of a Texan border town community to explore how the past constantly impinges on the present, however much we try to fence it off."
