        "Uptight tax consultant Charlie (Jeff Daniels) is picked up by eccentric, free-thinker Lulu (Melanie Griffith). Although he's not entirely certain how he's going to explain his sudden disappearance to his wife and his boss, he accompanies her on an impulsive journey to the farthest reaches of New Jersey. Lulu introduces Charlie as her husband to her friends and relatives attending a high school reunion. The couple is held hostage by holdup man Ray (Ray Liotta) who happens to be Lulu's ex. When Ray makes it clear that he wants Lulu back, that's when the real trouble begins. Cameos by John Sayles, John Waters and Charles Napier. Includes music scores by David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, John Cale."
