        "Children will love this adaptation of the famous Grimm fairy tale featuring life like marionettes (called Kinemins), authentic scenery and a musical soundtrack by Engelbert Humperdinck. Two children explore the forest in search of strawberries but are caught by the wicked witch who has a nasty habit of turning children into gingerbread. The original play was written by Adelaide Witty and adapted for the screen by Padraic Colum. Warning; The image drops out after the copyright warning but reappears before the video begins."
