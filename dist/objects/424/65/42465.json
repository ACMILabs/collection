        "Dora Carrington (Emma Thompson) devotes her life to writer Lytton Strachey (Jonathan Pryce) a tall, thin, bearded bachelor and member of London's famed Bloomsbury artistic set. Even though their desire for each other was strong, their relationship was purely based on friendship, a bond that lives until the very end. This is one of the most unusual love stories you will ever see."
