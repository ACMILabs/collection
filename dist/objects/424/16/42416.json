Aided by the King's nephew his plan works, polluting the island as a result. Resistance to Trumphorn comes in the form of the young islander, Otto, and his dog Spot, who lead the islanders in a defence of Nevawuz. An instructive and entertaining video for children on the issue of pollution and industrialization. The video also includes \"The True story of Ned Kelly\" and \"Ned Kelly's dastardly dilemma\". All three tales are written and produced by Paul Williams."
