        "Star Wars is undoubtedly one of the most popular films ever made. Two characters from the film, C-3P0 and R2-D2 lead the viewer on a fascinating behind the scenes look at how the movie was made. Secrets of the special effects are revealed, and the knowledge won't detract from future viewing of the film. Included in this documentary are excerpts from \"Star Wars\" featuring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness. Written by Richard Schickel and narrated by William Conrad."
