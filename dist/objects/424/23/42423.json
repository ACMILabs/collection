        "Concern is increasing that boys are not coping with traditional schooling, and growing up in general. Alarm is centred around poor literacy and behaviour, health and welfare problems, and a tendency towards alienation and aggression in boys and young men. the program looks at the problems of differences in academic achievement between boys and girls, decline of interest in reading amongst boys, effects of unemployment and changing male roles, differing problems fro boys growing up in the country and the city. Also illustrated are some examples of how some schools are dealing with these issues. Study guide included."
