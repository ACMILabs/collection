        "Follow Dick Smith as he travels solo around the world in his Bell Jetranger across some of the most inhospitable and lonely places in the world; the Arctic Circle; the deserts of Africa; the jungles of South East Asia. He also flies over some the world most famous landmarks; the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Parthenon, Pyramids, Mount Everest, Taj Mahal and Australia's own, Sydney Opera House. No other production details available. Warning; there are tracking problems at the start of the video and the image drops out during the end credits."
