        "Based on the book \"Dove\" by Robin Lee Graham and Derek Gill this film depicts the true story of Graham's five year solo voyage around the world. The photography is breathtaking, as we follow Graham (Joseph Bottoms) as he sails to Fiji, Australia, Mozambique, South Africa and Los Angeles, covering a distance of 30,000 miles. Graham has no human contact during his trip, just the companionship of his cats. However, when he stops at Fiji he falls in love with Patti Ratteree (Deborah Raffin), and his departure from her is more painful due to his isolation. An inspirational film about courage and ambition that can be enjoyed by the whole family."
