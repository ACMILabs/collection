        "Anthony Mann's classic western tells the story of Will Lockhart (James Stewart) and his search for revenge for the death of his youngest brother. He leaves Laramie in search of the men who sold automatic rifles to the Apache tribe which killed his brother. He arrives in Coronado and is soon embroilled in a bitter battle with the Waggoman family who own most of the land and cattle in the township. Full of great characters and twists in plot, \"The Man From Laramie\" is an enthralling film with characters who defy simplistic moralistic platitutes."
