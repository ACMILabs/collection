        "This third version of the classic Hollywood story of success and failure, exhilaration and despair, takes place against the high pressure background of big-time rock and roll. Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson play the two lovers whose paths intersect but cannot parallel. For him, it's too late to start over. For her it's too early to slow down."
