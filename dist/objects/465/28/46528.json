        "The heart of England lies in the Cotswold country. The changes in the seasons bring to this area are seen first in early spring, with the harrowing of the rich fields, the first buds on the trees, the blossoming orchards. Later comes the Three Counties Show at Hereford, cricket at Cheltenham on the village green, and finally the harvest and the traditional fairs."
