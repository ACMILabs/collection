        "Passed down from generation to generation, traditional cooking has always been at the centre of Jewish life. In this video we are introduced to the simple delights of Eastern European Jewish cuisine by cooking teacher Penny Harris. Penny will demonstrate the preparation of a dozen dishes and share some of the cultural background of the recipes, which include: chopped liver ; Russian herring salad ; pickled cucumbers ; gefilte fish ; fried fish ; chicken soup ; potato latkes ; Tsimmes ; Klops ; Cholent ; veal brisket and cheese blintzes."
