        "On the screen in close-up, and often in slow motion - the furious action of the world famous Calgary stampede - a spectacle to pin every viewer to their seat. Sun-fishing broncos, dare-devil cowboys, thundering chuckwagons - they are all here in this film of the annual extravaganza of the west. From the series: The Sport Parade."
