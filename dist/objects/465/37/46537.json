        "A critical and box-office success, this powerful film won the Best Director's Prize at Cannes in 1995 and sent shockwaves throughout the French media on its release. An angry indictment of life on a Parisian housing estate, 'La Haine' is packed with sharp street-humour, intense action and propelled by brutally brilliant camera work. The film follows one crucial day in the lives of three ethnically diverse teenagers. With violent showdowns between the police and young people a regular occurrence in the Paris ghettos, the film even attracted the attention of the French Prime Minister who organised a special screening of it for his cabinet. In French with English subtitles. Cast includes Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaoui and Francois Levantal."
