        "Much of the old-world charm of Quebec city can be accredited to the open, horse-drawn carriages in which visitors may explore the city - and to the drivers of these ancient vehicles. In this film we get to know Onesime Lamothe, veteran trooper of Quebec's historic avenues and ever-ready fountain of knowledge."
