        "In the first of four episodes, 'The Tears of innocence', Port Niranda is in the middle of a drought when days before the annual flower show, Derek the rainmaker arrives. In 'The Ice cream man cometh', Linda is sacked from Mr. Gribble's ice cream parlor, so she finds work with Paulo the master ice cream maker. In 'If the walls could talk', Bronson feels left out because no-one ever tells him anything, thinking he is too young. If only the walls could talk he sighs, and then they begin to - the challenge is to make them be quiet again. In 'The Big rock', Gribbles gets his hands on the Viking Book of Love and reads the final poem, accidentally unleashing a curse which turns Faye into a frog."
