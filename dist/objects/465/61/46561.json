        "Created over 13 centuries ago, The Book of Kells, one of the great glories of Irish Art, ranks among the chief treasures of the Western World. This video tracks the turbulent history of the Irish masterpiece since its conception to its final resting place in the great library of Trinity College in Dublin. Through the imaginative use of high definition film, the secrets and intricacies of this great gospel of Colum Cille, declared by 12th century traveller Giraldus Cambrensis as the work not of men but of angels, are revealed in glorious colour detail."
