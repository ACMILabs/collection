        "Craic is Irish slang for a laugh or a good time, which is what this comedy about two Irishmen on the run in Australia is all about. Fergus (Jimeoin) and his best friend Wesley (Alan McKee) are living in Belfast when they incur the wrath of violent IRA leader, Colin (Robert Morgan). Since Ireland no longer seems like a safe place to stay, they head for Sydney, where they manage to find work despite not having the necessary work permits. Fergus gets a chance to appear on TVs \"The Dating Game\" and wins a vacation to Queensland. However immigration authorities become aware of the friends' illegal status and Wesley tracks down Fergus, just in time to meet up with Colin who has come to Australia as part of the witness protection program. Thus a mad chase ensues as Fergus and Wesley head for the outback with immigration agents, secret service men and IRA renegades hot on their trail."
