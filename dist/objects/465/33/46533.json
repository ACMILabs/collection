        "Sci-fi horror filmmaker David Cronenberg's diabolical invader is a television show that seduces and controls its viewers. Featuring Deborah Harry as a kinky hostess, James Woods as a cable programmer looking for the ultimate in viewing thrills, this is a pulsating science fiction nightmare about a world where video can insidiously control and alter human life."
