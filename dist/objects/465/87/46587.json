        "Imogene Coca is delightful as Miss Klutz, a pupil in the dance troupe of a Russian artiste named Kobelev. Miss Klutz is so clumsy - no matter how hard she tries to be a good dancer, her performances are always a disaster When a rival calls upon Kobelev to lend her ballet troupe a dancer, Miss Klutz gets the job...and the laughs that go with it. Cast also includes Eugene Sigaloff, Irene Moore, George Lessey, Alexander Asro, Alyce Chappelle, Buddy Page."
