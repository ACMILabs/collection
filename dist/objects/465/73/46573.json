        "On 8 June 1974 George Mallory and Andrew Irvine left their tent high on the slopes of Mount Everest and climbed into history. They were seen at 12.50pm, just 240 metres from the summit. Within minutes Mallory and Irvine had disappeared and were never seen again. For the next 75 years what had happened to them remained a mystery in the history of mountaineering. This documentary follows the BBC sponsored expedition in March 1999 to the North Face of Everest, in search of Mallory and Irvine, and explores the answers to the questions - could these two pioneering climbers have reached the summit, 29 years before Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay? When and how did they perish?"
