        "Part of the Pattern of Britain series. The Down lands region in Southern England, stretching from Dover to the Cotswolds, has been a famous sheep-raising area for centuries. The film illustrates the changes taking place in village life and in farming methods in the region; sheep raising is giving way to dairy and wheat farming, poultry raising and more diversified farming. With these changes the way of life in the villages is changing, bringing an end to the isolation of the past."
