        "Episode of Series \"Engineering Drawing\". The aim of this film is to help the beginning student to get started on the right track in their thinking about engineering drawing. It tackles this objective partly through an emotional appeal based on the combined stimulation of emotion, sight and sounds, and partly on the development of the simple theme \"modern production requires that many people work together on a single project\". To do this they need a language, a means of communication, so that their work can be co-ordinated. This language is engineering drawing."
