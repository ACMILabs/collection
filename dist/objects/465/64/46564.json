        "Using footage from Hollywood in the 50's and 60's and educational material from the era, known personalities reflect on what it was like to be a living, breathing, sexual being in the 1950's or 60's. People such as Allan Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Sandra Bernhard, Francis Fisher, Frederic Lahey, John Oates and Zoe Tamerlaine discuss issues such as; dating, masturbation, petting, falling in love, menstruation, things you did to look cool, cruising, parties, dances, teen pregnancy, STD, and all the other concerns surrounding being a teenager. Set to a soundtrack of music from the decades in question, this snappy and entertaining documentary presents the viewer with a slice of 50's and 60's nostalgia."
