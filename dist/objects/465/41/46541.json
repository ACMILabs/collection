        "This film is a poetic evocation of the history and character of a nation, and the quality of its life today. The visual panorama of British landscape, industrial strength, and social achievement is accompanied by spoken words, based on the thoughts of Britons. It takes the form of a film journey which seeks to convey an understanding of the ways in which people have adapted to the changed imposed by recent development."
