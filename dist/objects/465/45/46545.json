        "Documentary film showing the effect of colonisation on the Eskimo socio-culture. Since the first arrival of the Europeans, the selling potential of Alaskan resources was quickly realised. This caused devastating damage to ecological aspects vital to Eskimo survival. In addition tho this, the film shows how colonial influence has caused ruptures in Eskimo tradition and religion."
