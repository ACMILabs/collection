        "This romantic thriller simply exudes confidence from the word go. Max, the romantic protagonist, is planning a marriage, investigating a murder, chasing after a lost love and getting bizarrely hooked up with a mystery girl. Fusing atmospheric street scenes, a beautiful Parisian apartment, and chic cafes with unpredictable plot twists and pungent symbolism, Max is nonchalantly entwined in the passion driven fates of three beautiful women. In French with English subtitles."
