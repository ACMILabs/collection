        "An outline of Canadian radio activity. Commentator John Fisher briefly reviews the history of radio in this country and of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's present three-network set-up. The variety of radio fare for Canadians is indicated by snatches of favorite programs; Trio Lyrique; Mart Kenney; the Toronto Symphony; the Happy Gang; forums; religious programs; drama; and old-time music. The variety of people involved in the business of broadcasting is described, and concluding sequences deal with the CBC International Service."
