        "A training video with accompanying trainer's manual that provides techniques to aid people in the workplace in developing a positive and bias-free approach to negotiation. The program takes participants through the steps necessary for a thorough approach to negotiation, a process that considers both parties in arriving at a result of mutual benefit. It stresses the need to consider the environment in which negotiations take place, and to ensure that all elements of prejudice are put aside."
