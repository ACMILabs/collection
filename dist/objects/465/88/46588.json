        "A portrait of Canada in many moods, costumes, and poses, on the eve of its one hundredth birthday. These are still pictures, hundreds of them, from the northernmost igloo to the southernmost meadow - pictures of people, places, activities, all with the style, the flair to fit the celebration. The music of the Oscar Peterson Trio is featured in the film."
