        "It's 1965 in England: the BBC TV serial 'Doctor Who' is presently on every home TV. A 6 part Dalek adventure has just finished - Dalekmania is at it's height. Milton Subotsky and Max J. Rosenberg competing against 'Hammer Horror', decide to cash in on the Dalekmania - they release their first Dalek movie : \"Dr. Who and the Daleks\". No one had ever seen Daleks in colour, so in the wide-screen film, Daleks of all colours dominated the screen. Peter Cushing played the Doctor, unlike the TV serial. Although the film was separate from the BBC production - it was highly successful. So successful they made another movie : \"Dalek - Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.\", a year later whilst Daleks were still on people's minds. In this short film we see snippets and trailers from these two movies; hear interesting stories from the actors involved; and those wonderful toys and memorabilia that have become extremely collectable."
