        "James Burke goes to the top of the Blackpool Tower and turns upside down to discover how the ears talk to the eyes and how we know which way is down. Looks at the sense of balance and other ways we perceive which way is up. The use of vision and retinal cells to detect movement and distance is studied in detail. Suitable for upper secondary level."
