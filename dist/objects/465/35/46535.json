        "Based on Harold Brighouse's 1915 play, this working-class comedy is set in nineteenth century Salford. Henry Hobson (Charles Laughton) is a drunken Lancashire bootmaker who tyrannises his staff and his three daughters. After refusing to allow his daughters to marry because of the expense involved, he is bought to heel by the eldest (Brenda de Banzie) who rebels against her father's rule to marry his assistant (John Mills). Together with her new husband she sets up a rival boot shop. Lean's film won the BFI 'best film' award in 1954. With Prunella Scales."
