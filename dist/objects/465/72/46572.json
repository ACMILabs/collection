        "Peter Davison, as the fifth Dr. Who, and his two female companions Tegan and Nyssa are mourning the loss of their other companion, Adric. The Doctor decides to travel in time to 1851 on planet earth to visit the Great Exhibition in London - to take their minds off things. However, as any keen fan would know, where the Doctor wants to go is not necessarily where the Tardis will take him. Instead they land in the 1980s at Heathrow airport. His arrival coincides with a missing Concorde aircraft and the doctor is drawn into the investigation by his friends at U.N.I.T. - his solution is to fly another Concorde on the exact same flight plan to find out what happened. With the Tardis aboard the aircraft they land on what appears to be Heathrow - but isn't. An evil being is controlling the disappearances and using his captives - but why? And what for?"
