        "This video traces the extraordinary life of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother using archival film and photographs. There is an interview with Princess Margaret, reminiscences from the Queen, recreations of her childhood, her wedding, the unforeseen Coronation and her tours around the world. Following the death of the King and the Coronation of a new Queen, she has continued to play a full part in the Elizabethan age, pursuing her duties with energy and warmth, and smiling her way into the hearts of people everywhere."
