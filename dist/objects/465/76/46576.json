        "This film is more than just a comedy - it was a labour of love for James Cagney and his brother, producer, William Cagney. Set in a waterfront saloon in San Francisco, the film has a warm and engaging atmosphere about it. It is entirely 'laid back\" - indeed Cagney remains seated for most of the picture. Joe (Cagney) is a philosophical souse who encourages all those around him to indulge in their wildest dreams. Joe's pal Tom (Wayne Morris), a born patsy, runs errands for Joe, the only person who has ever shown him kindness. Kitty (Jeanne Cagney), a streetwalker, willingly allows Joe to sponge drinks off her in exchange for a few kind words. Harry (Paul Draper), an enthusiastic but hopelessly untalented dancer-comedian, is hired by bartender Nick (William Bendix) at Joe's urging. And Kit Carson (James Barton), an addled old man who lives in a dream world, is prodded by Joe into weaving his unlikely reminisces of the Wild West. Based on the whimsical play by William Saroyan."
