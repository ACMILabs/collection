        "Episode of Series \"The Researchers\". Although petrol saving electric vehicles are making something of a comeback, they suffer from one major drawback, namely the poor performance of conventional lead acid batteries. Researchers at CSIRO's Division of Mineral Chemistry are working to improve the performance of lead acid batteries made with nickel zinc or lithium plates."
