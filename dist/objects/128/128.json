    "description": [
        "Video 50 is an extraordinary video sketchbook, a highly original, visually dramatic and frequently humorous collection of one hundred abbreviated 'episodes' produced for television. Unfolding as a series of thirty-second vignettes, this enigmatic essay in style is characterized by a deadpan theatricality, symbolist imagery, surrealist juxtapositions and repetition of key visual motifs. Indelible images, precisely composed -- a man teetering above a waterfall, a floating chair, a winking eye, a parrot against the New York skyline -- are accompanied by an 'architectural' sound score that includes spoken 'phonetic patterns' rather than words. Fusing his surprising visual logic and rhythms with unexpected temporal manipulations, Wilson creates a work of startling wit and poetry."
