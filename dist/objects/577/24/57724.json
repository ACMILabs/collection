        "A five part series designed for use in agencies teaching advanced physics. This series traces the development of atomic energy from when John Dalton forwarded his atomic energy theory in 1808. Through reconstruction and interviews, the scientists Dalton, Faraday, Rutherford, Cockcroft, Frisch and Einstein are introduced. Each part of the series is usable independently."
