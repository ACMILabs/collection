        "Ren's faithful friend is always accused of being stupid so these three tales will do much to allay the rumours. \"Stimpy's big day\": Stimpy can't resist the challenge to write a Gritty Kitty Litter Jingle to win 47 million dollars and a trip to Hollywood. \"The Big shot\": Stimpy has his own show and lots of money, but can this take the place of a loyal but jealous friend. \"Robin Hoek\": A Ren and Stimpy remake of a classic tale featuring Robin, the lovely Maid Moron and Friar Chuck."
