        "Shot in black and white, on a low budget and using a predominantly non-professional cast, Rose Troche's first feature offers an inside view of lesbian life in the '90's. Max is looking for love, Ely suffers from a long distance relationship and their scheming friends are determined to match them. Navigated by a wistful narration, the film tracks the inter-linked cast of characters from cafes and bookshops to dinner parties, dates and sex. Starring Guinevere Turner, V. S. Brodie, T. Wendy McMillan, Migdalia Melendez and Anastasia Sharp. Screenplay by Rose Troche and Guinevere Turner."
