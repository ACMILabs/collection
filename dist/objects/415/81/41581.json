        "Every year in Paris, the top designers and supermodels stage the world's hottest fashion show. It is called \"Pret-a-Porter\" and it means \"Ready to Wear\". Only this time, there has been a murder and everyone is a suspect. Once again Altman gathers a remarkable ensemble cast of stars and celebrities to weave an elaborate interlocking web of stories and events. High fashion is subjected to the critical glare and ironic wit typical of Altman's films, in this tangled tale of sex and sin, designed to seduce and dressed to kill. Cast includes: Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Kim Basinger, Anouk Aimee, Rupert Everett, Lili Taylor, Forest Whitaker, Richard E. Grant, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bacall, Lyle Lovett, Tracey Ullman, Sally Kellerman, Teri Garr, Danny Aiello, Harry Belafonte, Cher, and an array of famous designers and models appearing as themselves."
