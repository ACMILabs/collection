        "The first episode of the award winning series written by Lynda La Plante. In the early hours of a winter morning the body of a brutally murdered young woman is discovered in a small bedsit. DCI Shefford is put in charge of the investigation, however the situation quickly changes when he suffers a massive heart attack and is replaced by the ambitious Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren). DCI Tennison soon discovers the difficulties of heading a homicide enquiry. Not only do her male colleagues resent the fact that she is a woman and do all they can to obstruct her, but the case itself is particularly difficult when it comes to charging the suspect George Marlow (John Bowe). Although Tennison and her team are convinced of the killer, they are unable to prove it until a second body is found and what started as a single murder develops into an investigation stretching back over ten years and implicating police officials. Cast includes Tom Bell, Zoe Wanamaker, John Benfield, Brian Pringle, Tom Wilkinson and a brief appearance by Ralph Fiennes."
