        "This courtroom drama based on the Scott Turow novel of the same name contains murder, sex and intrigue. It stars Harrison Ford as the prosecutor, Rusty Sabich, who is asked to investigate the murder of a colleague. He is reluctant to do so because he has had a previous affair with her. What follows is a twisted tale of suspense and surprise. Supporting cast includes Brian Dennehy, Raul Julia, Bonnie Bedelia, Paul Winfield and Greta Scacchi. Music by John Williams."
