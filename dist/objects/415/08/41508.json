        "Episode of Series \"Lonely planet: the experience\". Independent traveller Mark Crowdy, avoiding the more popular tourist resorts, travels to the lesser known eastern islands of Flores, Komodo, Amban and Banda. His ultimate aim was \"to find people and places who hadn't been jaded by tourism.\" The Lonely Planet travel series opens up new possibilities in travelling for the intrepid explorer, while armchair travellers can sit back in comfort and enjoy rare and beautiful locations."
