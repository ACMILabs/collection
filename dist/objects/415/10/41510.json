        "A look at big league baseball from the inside, from the experience of Ferguson Jenkins, one of the few Canadian players to make the major leagues and winner of the Cy Young Award in 1971 as the National League's best pitcher. Filmed over the last two seasons Fergie played for the Chicago Cubs before being traded to the Texas Rangers, this story captures the frustrations, the satisfactions and much of the humorous side of this sport. Photographed by David De Volpi, edited by Marrin Canell, written and narrated by Donald Brittain. (Award: Oberhausen)"
