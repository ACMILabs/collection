        "This sequel to VFL on film Vol. 1 is another fascinating compilation of documentary and newsreel footage of the premier Australian Rules Competition between the period from post World War II to the advent of the national competition and includes footage of all twelve League teams. It comprises: 1. The Post-War Powers: Essendon's golden era; success for the Blues and the Cats. 2. Magpie triumphs. 3. The Demon dynasty: the resurgence of Melbourne in the 1950's and the one that got away. 4. The New Heroes: the stars of the '50's, '60's and '70's; the Brownlow Medal; victories for the Big V. 5. The Drought Breakers: breakthroughs for the \"new\" VFL teams and for a foundation member. 6. The Dedicated Fans: rituals in the outer from Victoria Park to Glenferrie Oval. 7. The Television Game: how technology transformed the suburban game. 8. The Big League: the end of the local competition era and its film coverage. Includes rare footage not previously released on video and a detailed commentary by Craig Willis."
