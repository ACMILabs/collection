        "The dawn of the 20th Century was the dawn of the air age. Aviation, originally a novelty, became an integral part of modern life, its foundations laid by early pioneers. This program celebrates the magnificent men of flight's first decades with historic archival footage of their triumphs and tragedies. Profiles the military development of the aeroplane during both World Wars, the peacetime Golden era of civilian aviation progress with the North Atlantic Crossing, Charles Lindbergh's solo flight, the Schneider Trophy competition, the shrinking world with the development of rotary wings, rocket power and early forms of jet propulsion, and the crash of the Hindenburg passenger airship."
