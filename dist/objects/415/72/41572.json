The continuing story of the life of Jesus Christ from: Zerah asks the Romans to put a special watch on the tonb of Jesus; Mary Magdalene and the women go to the tomb and find it is empty; the fearful Apostles gather in the cenacle; Mary Magdalene announces to them that she has seen the risen Christ; Peter rallies the disciples; Jesus returns to his diciples, comforts them and sends them out to the whole world."
