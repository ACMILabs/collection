        "Rock Hudson and Doris Day are the perfect suburban couple and except for Rock's paranoic hypochondriac tendencies, are extremely happy. That is until one day when Rock believes his death is imminent and enlists the help of buddy Tony Randall to make sure that Doris will be looked after once he is gone. Rock attempts to matchmake Doris with an old college flame (Clint Walker). This is considered to be one of the best Day-Hudson comedies. Watch for Paul Lynde as the cemetary plot salesman."
