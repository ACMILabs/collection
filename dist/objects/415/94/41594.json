        "This vivid animation re-creates scenes of women at work in the meadows, markets and castles of yesteryear. It lifts women's lives out of the anonymity of the Middle Ages and shows that then, as now, women of all classes performed a variety of tasks and played a dynamic role in society. The film was inspired by actual medieval illuminations, the painted pictures and ornate letters and designs used to decorate handwritten books of the period. It reflects the vibrant colour and naive style of perspective typical of such medieval art. The music, also inspired by the era, is performed on authentic period instruments."
