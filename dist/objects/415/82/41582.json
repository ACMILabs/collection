        "Episode of Series \"Eyewitness\". Dinosaur pieces together the facts behind these real life monsters. The viewer is put in the paleontologists boots, experiencing the process of discovery from start to finish - the excitement of digging, reconstruction, and finally the realisation of what dinosaurs might actually have looked like. Using computer graphics, this dynamic production combines scientific fact, history and anecdote to explore the puzzling questions surrounding these fascinating creatures. Were they cold or hot blooded? How did they behave and hunt? Why did they suddenly vanish after dominating the landscape for more than 100 million years?"
