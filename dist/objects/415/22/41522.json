        "David Bowie, plays The Stranger. Armed with a British passport, he arrives in New York but is in fact an alien from a dying planet, having studied earth habits from monitoring television. This hairless, sexless creature is eventually caught and handed over to a team of scientists and doctors for research. Nicolas Roeg's technical brilliance is apparent in this weirdly voyeuristic science fiction fantasy which is at times emeshed in its convoluted plot. Co-starring Buck Henry as a patent lawyer who befriends The Stranger and reaps success from the acquaintance and Rip Torn as Professor Nathan Brycce, determined to discover the truth."
