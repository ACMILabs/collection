        "The program is divided into four parts, each examining an aspect of the Vikings. \"Life of the Vikings\" looks at the settlement of Vikings, their way of life, diet and their housing. \"Ship building and seafaring\" looks at the Vikings' skills in navigation and shipbuilding which led them to explore far beyond their native lands. \"Voyages of discovery and warfare\" provides details of the explorations of Eric the Red and Lief Erikkson. The last segment called \"Trading\" focuses on the objects which Vikings traded; particularly their jewellry and beautifully decorated implements."
