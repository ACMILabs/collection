        "Shipwreck on the Reef, Shipwreck on the Reef, this was the cry the local shipowners and salvage operators in Key West during the 1840's awaited. Their business thrived on the cargo of wrecked ships but are all the wrecks caused by nature or man made? Why is it that King Cutler (Raymond Massey) always seemed to be the first on the scene? These and other questions are asked by local ship owner Loxi Claiborne (Paulette Goddard) and others. Meanwhile Loxi's suitor Captain Jack Stuart (John Wayne) is suspected by the jealous lawyer Steve Tolliver (Ray Milland). Who will win in the romance stakes? The star studded cast includes Robert Preston, Susan Heywood, Charles Bickford, Walter Hampden and Janet Beecher. This Cecil B. DeMille production of piracy, hot-blooded love and huge clipper ships gliding in the mist won an Academy Award for its Special Effects and was based on a Saturday Evening Post story by Thelma Strabel."
