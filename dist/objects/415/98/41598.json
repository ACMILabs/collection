        "Records the story of \"Ka-wayawayama\" or \"Aeroplane Dance\" of the Yanuwa people of the Borroloola area in the Northern Territory. The dance was created after an American \"Liberator\" bomber crashed in the area in 1942, after a mission in the South-west Pacific. Re-creates the plight of the flight crew in their trek across inhospitable terrain across the Gulf of Carpentaria and the search for the lost crew."
