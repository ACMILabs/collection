        "Picture the scenario of 5 men who have never met before entering and robbing a bank. Who is the mastermind behind this daring plan? Did he do it for the 2 million dollars or just for the thrill of the heist and the adrenaline rush of not getting caught. Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) is a Boston tycoon with money to burn and so bored with everyday life that he plans a bank robbery. Does he get away with it or will he get caught by insurance investigator Vickey Anderson (Faye Dunaway)? A glossy cat and mouse caper directed by Norman Jewison whose use of the split screen image leaps from the boardroom to the boudoir, the polo field to a glider cockpit. The Oscar winning song \"Windmills of your mind\" sets the perfect tone for the swirls of romance and intrigue. The famed chess game seduction scene is a must see. Co-starring Paul Burke and Jack Weston."
