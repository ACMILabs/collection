        "Hamish is a poet. He lives on a farm in the Australian Bush where he writes about the rural experience. His ambition is to become a Beat poet and travel to New York where he can read his poetry in a real jazz club. The experience is not what he anticpates. This film has been nominated and won several awards in Film Festivals world-wide including Venice and the AFI Awards."
