        "When a harsh winter threatens the majestic Scottish Highlands, Robert Roy McGregor (Liam Neeson) is forced to borrow money from the not so noble Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt) to provide for his clan. But when Montrose's evil henchmen (brilliantly portrayed by Tim Roth and Brian Cox) conspire to take the wealth for themselves, they thrust Rob into the most challenging battle of his life, one that escalates into a bloody and gripping climax. Breathtaking landscapes, steamy romance and non-stop action combine to make this a thrilling and powerful adventure."
