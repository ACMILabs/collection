        "During the 1930's, one of the favourite subjects of 'poverty row' exploitation low budget \"Warning!\" films was the evils of \"the devil's weed\" - marijuana. Pure campy melodrama and completely hilarious by current standards, these films were considered tight drama under the guise of warning the audience of how one puff of pot can destroy young lives and lead clean-cut teenagers down the road of insanity and death. The plot of \"Reefer Madness\" is no different, with a young man's life becoming a nightmare with Miles' frenzied piano solo a highlight of the film. Originally titled \"The Burning Question\" and then \"Tell Your Children.\" Starring Dorothy Short, Kenneth Craig, Lillian Miles, Dave O'Brien, Thelma White and Carleton Young."
