        "A struggling writer gets the opportunity of his life to stage his latest play on Broadway. There is one catch however: he must cast the untalented mistress of a notorious gangster in the lead role. Overwhelmed by the chance of success, he overlooks critical factors looming in the wings, including a player who can't act, a leading lady wanting to steal the spotlight, a leading man who is a compulsive eater and the gangster's bodygaurd who wants to rewrite the play. Set in the 1920's, Woody Allen's film is enhanced by an excellent atmospheric soundtrack. The cast includes John Cusack, Mary-Louise Parker, Jennifer Tilly, Tracey Ullman, and Academy Award winner Dianne Wiest."
