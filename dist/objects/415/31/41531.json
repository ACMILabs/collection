        "Young Vancouver hockey players, the University of British Columbia Thunderbirds, undertake to show their skills to the new teams of China. It is a journey that takes them far into that vast country and to an understanding of East and West. Hockey in China still has far to go, but this film leaves no doubt that the Chinese players and fans are alive to the challenge. A film of fresh insight and discovery for all audiences, whether hockey-minded or not."
