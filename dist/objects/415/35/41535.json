        "Usually when there is a crime, there is a motive. Usually when there is a line up, there is only one real suspect. However, this is not the usual crime and when five criminals are in the same lineup, there is a force operating behind the scenes pulling the strings to get them all together. \"The Usual suspects\" has an intriguing and twisted plot with exceptional performances from the entire cast which includes Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, Chazz Palminteri and Kevin Spacey."
