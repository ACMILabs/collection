        "Emilio Estevez returns in another heartwarming comedy about the Mighty Ducks; an ice-hockey team full of misfit teenagers with the desire to be the best they can be. The team win an opportunity to represent their country in the Junior Goodwill Games to be held in Los Angeles. Two challenges await them - the fierce competition in the form of the team from Iceland and resisting the Hollywood glitz and glamour which threatens to tear them apart. Only team spirit will help them overcome these obstacles."
