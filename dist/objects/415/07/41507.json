        "The world was shocked when Jamaica entered the Winter Olympics with a bobsled team. Although they don't win gold, the four Jamaicans become heroes for their courage and determination to compete with the world's best. John Candy plays the ex-Olympian, once accused of cheating, who acts as their coach. Based on a true story \"Cool Runnings\" repeats the ageless Disney film message about following your dreams."
