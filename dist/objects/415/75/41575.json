        "Based on the legend that the world as we know it is really made up of three worlds: the world of humans; the world of man-Beasts and the world of Monster Demons. Chojin is the superfiend whose destiny it is to unite the three worlds into the Land of Eternity every 3,000 years; a world filled with violence and chaos. Humanity must pit all its forces and wits to prevent this legend from becoming a reality. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ANIMATED FILM HAS AN 'R' RATING FOR PERSONS OVER THE AGE OF 18 DUE TO THE EXPLICIT VIOLENT AND SEXUAL NATURE OF ITS CONTENT."
