        "The young God Siegfried, the subject of famed Teutonic legend achieves immortality by bathing in the blood of a slain dragon; one of the hallmark scenes in the history of silent film. An evocative film typical of Lang's genius which deals with the theme of the extra-personal forces which shape the destiny of humans in a way they cannot always predict or control. \"Siegfried\" was a nationalistic triumph for Lang and an international success. A classic not to be missed."
