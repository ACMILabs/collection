        "Episode of Series \"Timeline\". A dramatic recreation of the social upheaval experienced in the Middle Ages due to the spread of the Black Death. Modelled on a news broadcast, the program looks at the causes and impact of the Plague, and \"interviews\" key historical figures of the time. At its most virulent, the disease decimated both city and rural populations and created severe labour shortages."
