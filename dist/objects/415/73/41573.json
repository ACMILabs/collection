        "Episode of Series \"Archaeology\". John Rhys-Davis narrates five episodes from this interesting series which looks at The Holy Land. \"The Forbidden Goddess\" profiles the relationship between Yahweh and the Canaanite goddess Asherah. \"Lot's Cave\" shows archaeologists studying a cave near the Dead Sea. \"Killer Quakes of the Bible\" queries whether the Red Sea was parted by an earthquake? \"The Last Days of the Philistines\" reveals that Goliath and Delilah were atypical Philistines, while in \"Secrets of the Red City\", archaeologists are reviving the so-called \"dead city\" of Petra."
