        "This is the successful sequel to \"The Robe\" and the evil Roman Emperor, Caligula is searching for the robe Christ wore in the belief that this will give him eternal life. Demetrius, a Greek slave is sentenced to train as a gladiator and falls under the spell of the beautifully sensuous Messalina and renounces his Christian beliefs. Full of action as gladiators fight wild beasts and each other, this film is an entertaining example of the toga movie. Starring Victor Mature, Susan Hayward, Jay Robinson, Michael Rennie, Debra Paget, Anne Bancroft and Richard Egan."
