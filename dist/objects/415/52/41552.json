        "Episode of Series \"Brickwork\". One of a series of 8 parts; the complete series gives a basic training in building construction with reference to brickwork. The film starts by describing classes of bricks; commons, facings, engineering, purpose-made, insulating and fire bricks, and deals with a number of varieties of individual types, their sizes and weights. The gauging of mortar is demonstrated. Hand and machine mixing and the pan mill are dealt with. The method of describing the thickness of walls in terms of brick lengths is explained."
