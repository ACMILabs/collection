        "Based on the play by Alan Bennett, \"The Madness of King George\" stars Nigel Hawthorne as the ailing King and Helen Mirren as his wife Queen Charlotte. King George the Third, after he lost the American colonies in the War of Independence, succumbed to intermittent bouts of madness where his usual ordered and calm persona underwent a violent and obscene transformation. The Prince of Wales becomes a willing pawn in the plot to commit the King, and establish the Regency. This is a finely acted and sumptuous production of Bennett's play. Ian Holm plays the Doctor called in to cure the King's madness using methods which from a modern vantage were brutal and inhumane."
