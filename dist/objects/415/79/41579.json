        "The first of Anne Rice's \"Vampire Chronicles\" was brought to the screen by Neil Jordan. Despite initial public misgivings, Tom Cruise is convincingly seductive and evil as the Vampire Lestat. Brad Pitt plays Louis, the narrator of the strange history of his journey into immortality as a vampire. These two are ably supported by an all star cast including Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas, Kirsten Dunst and Stephen Rea. Jordan's film is visually striking and sensual; so much so that the viewer is often torn between a world full of blood and horror and the allurement of immortality and the supernatural."
