        "The fate of a Beijing family under Mao Tse Tung's regime from the early 1950's to the Cultural Revolution is the focus of this film by talented filmaker Tian Zhuangzhuang. Seen from the perspective of Tietou who grows from child to adolescence as he observes his mother's three marriages. Although epic in proportion, the intimacy of domestic life is a poignant contrast to the political dramas occuring. The film was banned in China but a print was smuggled out of the country allowing the rest of the world an opportunity to experience this inspirational human drama."
