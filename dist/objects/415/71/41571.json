        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Jesus of Nazareth\". The continuing story of the life of Jesus Christ from: Pilate allows the crowds to choose between Jesus and Barrabas, the crowd chooses Barrabas; Jesus leaves the Praetorium carrying the cross; He is led through the streets of Jerusalem; Jesus sees Nicodemus and is met by the pious woman; on Calvary Jesus is nailed and hung on a cross between two thieves; The Centurion allows Mary and the women to stand at the foot of the cross; Jesus talks to his mother and John; Jesus dies on the cross and is taken down."
