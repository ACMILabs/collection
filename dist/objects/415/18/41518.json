        "A long-time married couple played by Judy Davis and Sydney Pollack astound their friends (Woody Allen and Mia Farrow), by announcing their separation. The film gained notoriety not so much for itself, but because it was the last film that Allen and Farrow made before their own much publicised breakup. Allen uses handheld camera techniques which gives the film a documentary type feel. Judy Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance and Woody Allen for the screenplay. Co-starring Juliette Lewis, Liam Neeson, Blythe Danner, Nora Ephron and Lysette Anthony."
