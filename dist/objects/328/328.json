        "The images in \"Orka\" - which means \"life force\" - were shot by Steina in the wilds of her native Iceland in 1996. A \"tracer\" device records the micro-movements of nature over time, such as the paths of birds and waves. Steina's digitally altered images of nature have a stark and often startling beauty."
