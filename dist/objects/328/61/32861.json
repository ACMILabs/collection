        "Episode number 26 of Series \"The Australian eye V\". The four large panels that make up \"Waterfall polyptych\" can be seen as a climax to the many years that Fred Williams has spent in developing his own austere and highly personal language of painterly forms with which to interpret the Australian landscape. The artist describes the importance to him of recording first impressions in front of the subject and the four preliminary panels are studied in relation to the final work. Suitable for middle and upper secondary level."
