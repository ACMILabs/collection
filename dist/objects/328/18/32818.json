        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Wetlands of Victoria\". Cullens Lake is near Kerang in Victoria and provides an ideal habitat for many different varieties of water birds. It also provides a drought relief area for water birds that are forced to leave their usual habitat of inland rivers. This film looks at the lake and the birds that use it. Examines the threat to the lake by plans of the State Rivers and Water Commission of Victoria to turn it into a salinity basin. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
