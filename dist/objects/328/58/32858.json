        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Australian eye V\". Strong and rhythmic, rich in detail, this painting comes from Lloyd Rees' middle period and gives a feeling of intimacy and involvement with its subject. The artist refers to it in the film as \"basically a draughtsman's picture\" and gives his personal comments on its composition. The film reveals the range of Lloyd Rees' work and his architectural strength and ends with his Turneresque late landscapes, while the sound-track is enhanced by his comments on the problems of plein-air painting and thoughts on the importance of drawing."
