        "From the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968 to the loading of the first tankers at Valdez in 1977, this is the story of one of the most difficult and costly construction projects ever attempted. Almost 800 miles of big pipe was laid across three major mountain ranges and Arctic perma-frost, to reach an ice free port in south east Alaska. (Award: Golden Eagle, USA)"
