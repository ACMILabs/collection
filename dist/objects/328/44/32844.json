        "Episode of Series \"Lessons in Living II\". Concerns the story of a young boy faced with the dilema of moving away from the place he has grown up in. Incorporates the analogy of the young boy brought up by wolves in the Jungle Book story. Interesting combination of live scenes between the boy and his uncle, indispersed with the animated sequences."
