        "Adapted from chapter 4 from the book \"A Bear called Paddington\" written by Michael Bond. Judy and Mrs Brown take Paddington to fashionable Barkridges' department store to buy a pair of pyjamas. Although the store is having a big sale, Pyjama Week has been a disaster. After finding a pair of colourful pyjamas, Paddington enters what he believes to be a dressing room but which actually turns out to be the shop window. Fortunately his antics in the window make Pyjama Week a success and the grateful store manager makes Paddington a gift of anything he would like from the store. Narrated by Michael Hordern. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
