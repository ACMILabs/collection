        "A film of free-hand line animation, where the movement as much as the designs reflects the artist's thoughts on the life of humans and their universe. What evolves is a stream of ideas about the elemental situation of humankind, poised midway between the primary dust and the measureless universe yet unplumbed. A film without words; titles in French, music by Maurice Blackburn. (Award: San Francisco.)"
