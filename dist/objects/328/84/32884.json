        "This animated film is based on an old Persian parable. The inhabitants of a village learn to overcome their fear of the unknown. The benefit of their new-found knowledge is demonstrated. The black-and-white images are reminiscent of German wood-cuts. No dialogue. Music by Normand Roger performed by Gropus 7. (Awards: Athens, USA; Espinho; Murcia.)"
