        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Australian eye V\". Roland Wakelin was a leading figure in the fight to gain recognition in Australia for modernism. \"Down the hills\" is a powerful composition, introducing a Post-impressionist approach to form and using the Impressionists technique of juxtaposing strokes of pure colour. Wakelin speaks of his ideas in the film."
