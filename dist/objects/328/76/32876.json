        "Episode of Series \"Narritjin Maymuru (A)\". The film shows Narritjin and Banapana and their families at work in their ANU studio and later an exhibition of their work. In 1978 Narritjin Maymuru and his son Banapana were awarded fellowships as Visiting Artists to the Faculty of Arts at the Australian National University in Canberra. This program shows Narritjin and Banapana and their families at work in their A.N.U. studio. With anthropologist Howard Morphy, Narritjin conducts a seminar session for anthropology students. He explains his technique of bark painting and discusses some of the meanings behind the paintings. At the end of their stay in Canberra, Narritjin and Banapana hold an exhibition of their Manggalili art."
