        "Episode of Series \"Lessons in Living II\". This \"moral tale\" discusses the concept of greed and how things should be distributed equally. Two children fight over the proceeds of a product they made and need their uncle to teach them how to fairly share the profit. The uncle uses an excerpt from a Disney cartoon (Lucifer the cat and Cinderella story) in order to convey his message across. Cast includes Philip Abbott, Ruth Lind and Dylan Paiz."
