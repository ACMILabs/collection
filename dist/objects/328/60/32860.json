        "Episode number 27 of Series \"The Australian eye\". This painting represents the quintessence of Sali Herman's art. He has enshrined in it the feeling of a time and place where once he lived and worked. The artist talks of his delight in recording the changing face of old Sydney such as Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo, and we see many of his finest works together with pages from his old sketch-books. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
