        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Australian eye V\". The film is intended as a background to the whole \"Australian eye\" collection. Ten artists, with a variety of styles, are shown working on their paintings and talking about their problems. Students seeing the film should quickly realise that all true artists have to evolve their own methods of realising ideas and that there is no magic formula for achieving good paintings. Artists includes Sally Robinson, Col Jorden, Terrence O'Donnell, Rod Milgate, Suzanne Archer, Peter Powditch, John Firth-Smith, Kevin Conner, Ann Thompson and Alan Oldfield."
