        "This excellent film was one of the first significant films of the revived Australian film industry to focus on working-class characters. It has a raw, painful and moving story, based on real love letters uncovered in a flat in Newcastle by director Stephen Wallace, and the first impressive screen performance from a young Bryan Brown. Cast also includes Kris McQuade, Gia Carides, Joy Hruby, Kevin Leslie, Ashe Venn. Photography by Tom Cowan, assistant photography by Martha Ansara."
