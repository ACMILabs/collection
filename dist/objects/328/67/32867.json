        "A farmer is found strangled in bed and his wife is accused of the murder. As the sheriff, prosecuting attorney and a neighbour search the farm for clues, their women, hardly leaving the kitchen, uncover the most crucial details about this shattered family...even the motive for the murder. Unknown to the men, they act as the accused woman's sole jury - a true jury of her peers. Based on a short story written in 1917 by Susan Glaspell."
