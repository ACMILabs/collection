        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Life on Earth\". David Attenborough examines the evolution of the primates. As well as looking at the better known members of the ape family - monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees - it also looks at some of the lesser known cousins. This episode contains the memorable scene where David Attenborough meets a group of young mountain gorillas in Zaire."
