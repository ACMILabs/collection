        "Episode of Series \"W5\". This film argues the case that there is no need for cancer sufferers to die in pain. The triumvirate of drugs cocaine, heroin and marijuana alone or a mixture combination may be recommended to ease pain. The illicit use of these drugs has detracted the possibilities of their potential to be put to good use. One man alone in the USA has medical and legal prescriptions for 10 marijuana cigarettes per day to prevent blindness."
