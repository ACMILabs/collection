        "For some bush pilots, flying is like playing solo violin at Carnegie Hall. For others, it's like driving a taxi. This film shows how bush pilots are slowly being replaced. In northern towns built by bulldozers and jet aircraft, the emphasis is not on adapting to the north, but on remaking it in the image of the south. This is a thought provoking film about northern development."
