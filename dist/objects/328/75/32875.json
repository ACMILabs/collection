        "Episode of Series \"Narritjin Maymuru (A)\". In this program, Narritjin Maymuru talks about his land at Djarrakpi, one of the most important sacred sites of his Manggalili clan. The film is set into two contrasting contexts. At an exhibition of his paintings at the Australian National University in Canberra, Narritjin explains the meaning behind a bark painting of Djarrakpi; then on the wind-swept sand dunes of Djarrakpi itself he explains the significance of some of the actual features of the landscape. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
