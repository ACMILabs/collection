        "Under the guise of a pretty fairy tale, this animated film makes a strong political statement. Paper cut-outs enact a drama in which a dictator, suffering from a visual defect which affects his perception of things, imposes his delusions on his unfortunate subjects. The humour is black and despite an absence of dialogue the message is clear. (Awards: Berlin, Cracow, Zagreb, Gijon, Barcelona, New York)"
