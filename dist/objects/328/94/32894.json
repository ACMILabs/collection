        "Victoria Martin is a thirteen-year-old, who is confused by teenagehood and adults. After a fall she finds herself back in 1944 when her mother was young. When she returns to modern times she realises that grown-ups were once teenagers and had their problems too. Based on Francine Pascal's \"Hangin' out with Cici\". Suitable for secondary level."
