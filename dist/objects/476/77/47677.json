        "A nuclear submarine has mysteriously sunk. The crew of a civilian oil rig crew is recruited to conduct a dangerous search-and-rescue effort. One diver (Ed Harris) soon finds himself on a spectacular odyssey 25,000 feet below the ocean's surface where he comes face-to-face with a mysterious force that has the power to change the world or destroy it. This digitally re-mastered version of the original film features 28 minutes of additional footage, as well as the one hour documentary \"Under pressure: Making the Abyss\", a featurette and the original theatrical trailer."
