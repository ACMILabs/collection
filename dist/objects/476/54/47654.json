        "The initial fears of leaving mum and dad behind quickly disappear as dress ups, photographs of grandma as a young girl, games, special food and stories appear that only a grandma can provide as the generation gap between a young girl and an older woman is bridged. A lyrical look, without words, at the shared experiences of a young girl visiting with her grandmother."
