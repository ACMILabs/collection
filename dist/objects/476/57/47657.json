        "Major Dan Kirby (John Wayne) heads a marine fighter squadron in the South Pacific in 1942. The men in the squadron resent his leadership due to the fact that they expected one of their own to be promoted - and so a clash of personalities ensues. When the squadron is sent to Guadalcanal to give support to ground troops, Kirby is further hindered by a dangerous shortage of planes and pilots. Real-life footage and staged action combine to make this one of the most unforgettable war films of the 1950s."
