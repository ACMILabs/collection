        "Chaplin plays dual roles in what was his first dialogue film: a burlesque of Hitler alias Adenoid Hynkel, and a Jewish barber who returns an amnesiac many years after an accident in World War I, unaware of the rise of Nazism. The parody of Hitler draws not only on Chaplin's genius for mime but also on his vocal resources. His most experimental work, the film was politically audacious for the times receiving a mixed reception in an America in the grip of isolationism but an enthusiastic one in blitzed London. Cast includes Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie and Reginald Gardiner."
