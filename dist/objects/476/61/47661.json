        "When panicked photographer Brian has trouble with a disagreeable Great Dane, he calls Dr Abby Barnes (Janeane Garofalo) a radio veterinarian whose daily program helps people with their problem pets. The pair develop an instant connection over the telephone and the eager Brian invites Abby out, asking for a description of herself so he can find her in a crowd. Lacking in self-confidence, Abby describes her neigbour, best friend and model, Noelle (Uma Thurman). When Abby stands him up, Ben comes to the studio looking for answers, and happens to see Noelle. Abby explains the situation to Noelle, who agrees to take her place, while Abby assumes the character of Donna. While Abby develops a relationship with Brian over the telephone and the radio, Noelle is the woman he believes he is talking to. Things become more complicated when Noelle falls for Brian, and Brian starts to wonder why his new girlfriend seems to have two different personalities."
