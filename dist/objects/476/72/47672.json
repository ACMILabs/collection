        "This remake of the Steve McQueen movie of the same name stars Pierce Brosnan as thrill-seeking billionaire Thomas Crown. Bored with his life, he decides to stage a daring robbery and steal a priceless painting in broad daylight from one of the most secure museums in the world. Rene Russo stars as his nemesis - insurance investigator Catherine Manning, a woman who is every bit as intelligent, cunning and hungry for adventure as he is - and she will need to be is she is to outwit this master thief. Certain clues point to Crown, so Danning introduces herself into Crown's social circle. Police detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) warns Danning that Crown can easily draw people in with his effortless charm, and getting to close him will not be good for her investigation. She is amused by McCann's suggestion -- until she finds herself falling for Crown."
