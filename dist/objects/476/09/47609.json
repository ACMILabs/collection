        "Brian Porter, surrealist, paints his dreams. The film is an incursion into his very private life, which consists of painting, and waiting to paint. Beautifully shot, with a sound track that shifts from the strident sounds of a synthesizer to the warmer cadences of a guitar, the film moves unhurriedly through changing moods and ethereal visions."
