        "This was, in effect, the swansong of the Tramp in what is basically a 'silent' film which makes pointed use of synchronised speech at carefully selected moments. In a series of set pieces, in turn cynical and ironic, sentimental and nostalgic, Charlie unsuccessfully assumes a variety of occupations from assembly line worker to singing waiter. In between he becomes one of the unemployed, a willing prisoner and the companion of a working class girl. The film begins as social satire but Chaplin's factory is too stylised to give the humor much bite. The film is ultimately more about homelessness than modernity. Chaplin's political and philosophical naivete is disarming. His comic genius as a performer is timeless. Cast also includes Paulette Goddard and Chester Conklin."
