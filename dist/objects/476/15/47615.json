        "This film about the industries that draw their wealth from the raw material supplied by Canada's forests shows how this wealth is being preserved by a long-term conservation program. Filmed in the rain forests of the British Columbia coast, it shows how giant conifers are felled, transported by water routes to sawmills, and cut into lumber or reduced to Canada's greatest single export, newsprint. Realization of the need for conservation has led to an extensive program of aerial stocktaking and a system of planned cutting and reforestation."
