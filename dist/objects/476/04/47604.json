        "A collection of four short films from the SBS program, \"Eat Carpet\", in which things aren't always as they seem. \"Goth to be Greek\", directed by Andrew Georgiou and Tim Slade, is the story of a goth who finally finds a woman who wears black and hangs out in cemeteries. \"Bad news\", directed by Sofya Gollan, tells the tale of a profoundly deaf couple who react in an unexpected way after hearing some news from their apologetic doctor. \"Skater, homie, skeggy, wog\", directed by Andrew Dowell and Brendan Dowell, focuses on some of the myths and misconceptions that teens from rival suburbs have regarding each other's dress and way of living. \"How black is black?\", directed by Jade Woods (aged 13), looks at the identity crises suffered by fair-skinned Koories."
