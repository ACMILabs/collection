        "John Hodges (Monty Woolley) is a printer for the Acme Printing Company, who in turn are owned through various sub-siduaries by Consolidated Motors. This is where our problem begins... Consolidated Motors has a Personnel Policy stating \"All workers over 65 have to retire\", and our John Hodges does not want to be forcibly retired and wants his job back. He wishes to fight for the principle of dignity - both in life and at work. \"There is more to life than mere success\" he attests, but how does he go about this courageous though some may say futile enterprise? He dyes his hair black and pays a visit to the offices of Mr McKinley, manager at Acme Printing, where he meets Marilyn Monroe as the company secretary in one of her first and funniest roles. Posing as President of Consolidated Motors in order to get the policy overturned, he finds himself feted and listened to as a elder statesman of the Business World. Cast also includes Thelma Ritter, David Wayne, Jean Peters, Constance Bennett and many others who give stirling performances, also includes a very young Russ Tamblyn."
