        "Neil Labute's (\"In the company of men\", \"Nurse Betty\") second feature is a caustic, bleak study of sexual dysfunction and alienation amongst six casually connected friends and lovers. Labute's brittle screenplay wanders between one relationship horror show to another as these hapless 'friends and neighbours' try to connect with each other through a series of empty sexual encounters and misguided affairs. Terri (Catherine Keener) can't stand the fact that her husband Jerri (Ben Stiller) makes a lot of noise when they make love. Terri starts an affair with Cheri (Nastassja Kinski), a sensitive art gallery curator who's neediness and insecurity requires constant validation. Jerri on the other hand finds himself infatuated with Mary (Amy Brenneman), his best friends wife. Mary's husband Barry (Aaron Eckhart) claims the best sex he has ever had is with himself and is frustrated by his wife's lack of sex drive. All the while Barry and Jerri's predatory and narcissistic single friend Cary (Jason Patric) dishes out his own brand of misogynous rough justice with the countless women he sleeps with."
