        "As massive alien spaceships settle over major cities throughout the globe, all of the Earth's citizens gaze in wonder at the seemingly benign visitors - until the aliens begin blasting destructive beams and destroying cities in their wake. Now the world's only hope rests on the shoulders of a handful of determined survivors uniting for one last strike against the invaders - to save mankind and reclaim their independence. This is an extended version of the original film and includes an alternate ending, two documentaries: \"Creating Reality\" and \"The Making of ID4\" and the original theatrical trailer."
