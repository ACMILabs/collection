        "Set during the Vietnam war and focusing on the lives of three life-long friends, this film has been described as an 'Eastern Deer Hunter'. In 1967 the three young men, fugitives from the Hong Kong police, set up a black-market operation in war-torn Saigon. Almost immediately after their arrival they run into trouble and forced to flee Saigon when they are captured by the Vietcong and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp. Thrown together in extreme conditions, they turn on each other as lust, betrayal and greed threaten to shatter their closeness. Made in the year following the Tiannamen Square Massacre, the film focuses on the strain that relationships undergo in times of strife, and the brutality of the war in Vietnam. Named by Woo as his personal favorite, it features his trademark combination of ballistic gun action and pathos around the theme of homosocial bonding. Cast includes Tony Leung, Jacky Cheung and Simon Yam. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
