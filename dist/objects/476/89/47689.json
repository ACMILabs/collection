        "A classic Hollywood war film, combining a gift for storytelling with bravura and blockbuster entertainment. Set in a high security German P.O.W. camp, the Allied prisoners are determined to do more than wait out the war and plan one of the most daring escapes. Steve McQueen slams his motorbike into top gear and hurtles us into an adventure. Joining McQueen, are stars the calibre of James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson and James Coburn. Based on the novel by Paul Brickhill."
