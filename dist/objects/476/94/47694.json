        "A multi-layered documentary about the parallels between the mass production of weapons, and the creation and dissemination of mass media images of war and violence. At the same time it is an autobiography of Canadian director and producer Colin Low (who narrates and directs the film) who, over the course of fifty years has worked on over two hundred films. Over this period Low has also massed a large collection of etchings and woodcuts of war. Through these haunting artworks, the fine details of which he has captured through special filming techniques, Low meditates on his growing awareness of war and the perversion of art into propaganda that supports the production of ever more effective weapons of mass destruction."
