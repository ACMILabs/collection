        "An undercover policeman from Mainland China (Jet Li) is assigned the dangerous task of infiltrating a criminal organisation in Hong Kong. Years of undercover work and keeping his occupation concealed from his disease-stricken wife and young son have shattered his family life. When a female Hong Kong detective finds out about his double identity, she endeavors to bring his son to Hong Kong, but in doing so blows the policeman's cover, leaving him fighting for both his own and his son's lives. While Jet Li was already famous for his roles in historical martial arts films such as the 'Once Upon a Time' and 'Fong Sai Yuk' series, this was his first part in a contemporary action film. This film established his reputation in this genre and further enhanced his working relationship with action director master Corey Yuen-Kwai. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
