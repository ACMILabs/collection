        "With its barrage of special effects, its new heroes and warrior myths, the American dream is not what it used to be. Aided by new trade strategies, Hollywood is tightening its stranglehold on the world's screens, leaving no room for indigenous cultures. Disturbed by this one-sided war of images, the director consults filmmakers and other experts on both sides of the Atlantic. Agnieszka Holland, Arthur Penn, Alain Tanner, Bertrand Tavernier, Milos Forman and Denys Arcand ponder the fate of cinema in the era of globalization. Can auteur cinema with its personal vision, its expression of the collective identity, withstand the onslaught of American movies and their single-minded focus on entertainment? Includes interviews with Denys Arcand, Anne-Marie Bidaud, Luciana Castellina, Milos Forman, Claude Fournier, Agnieszka Holland, Marin Karmitz, Todd McCarthy, Jonathan Nossiter, Arthur Penn, Leslie Quinton, Roland Smith, Jean-Charles Tacchella, Alain Tanner, Bertrand Tavernier, Daniel Toscan du Plantier, Margarethe Von Trotta, Andrzej Wajda and Irwin Winkler. In English and French with English subtitles."
