        "When serviceman Jim Scott (William Lundigan) returns home after 2 1/2 years in the Army he finds his wife, Connie (June Haver), has bought a run down apartment block and assumed the role of landlady at 337 Grammercy Place. Eager to resume his writing, he soon learns that the landlord is always home, and with a suspected Casanova swindler as a tenant, and a jealous wife following the arrival of Jim's beautiful Army buddy WAC Bobby (Marilyn Monroe), it will take something exceptional to get his writing off the ground and save the decrepit building from being condemned. Cast also includes Frank Fay, Leatrice Joy and Jack Parr. Based on the novel by Scott Corbett. Includes the original theatrical trailer."
