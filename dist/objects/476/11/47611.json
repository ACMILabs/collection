        "How much Aboriginal are you?, we are asked by a group of indigenous Australian children. \"How black is black\" questions the issue of blackness and how much Aboriginality is assumed to be an issue of skin colour. Through a series of stills and colourful action sequences, thirteen year old director Jade Woods presents a film about identity, friendship and race. Soundtrack provided by the Sisters Underground."
