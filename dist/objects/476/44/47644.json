        "The National Gallery of Canada serves the Canadian public in many ways. This film tours the galleries in Ottawa where the national collection of old masters, as well as modern works, are on display. It shows how the Gallery helps foster art appreciation. Behind the scenes we see another phase of the work of art--the cleaning, preservation and storing of art treasures."
