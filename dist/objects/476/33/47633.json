        "'The Chinese Ghost Story' series integrates ideas and images from Western horror films (using techniques and technologies developed in the Cinefex Workshop), with those from a classical Chinese story by Pu Song-Ling. In this part the Tree Devil from the first two parts wakes after a hundred-year sleep. Buddhism has gained its following in the Jiang hu ('vagrant world'), a turbulent society 'without rules'. A high priest and student monk are the custodians of a Sacred Golden Buddha which is transmogrified in the haunted Orchid Temple. The monks also go through changes as they encounter alluring demonesses and put the Tree Devil to the sword. Cast includes Tony Leung, Jacky Cheung and Wang Hsu Hsien. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
