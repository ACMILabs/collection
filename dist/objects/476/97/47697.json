        "Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Ellen Ripley, a big surprise to most fans considering she died at the end of 'Alien 3'. In this next instalment of the series a group of scientists succeed in resurrecting Ripley by cloning her. Their main motivation being the Queen Alien which lies dormant within her DNA. Science runs amok however when the alien terror is unwittingly unleased on the scientists spacecraft. The newly revived Ripley (who is a different creature in many respects from her past incarnation), must join forces with a group of smugglers and a mysterious young mechanic named Call (Winona Ryder) to combat the vicious aliens. The strength of the alien saga has always been the constantly evolving character of Ripley and the fresh perspective different creative talents have bought to the series. (Ridley Scott directed the first one, James Cameron the 2nd and David Fincher the 3rd). In this 4th instalment, director Jean-Piere Jeunet ('City of lost children', 'Delicatessen') populates the film with surreal, womb like imagery, plenty of visceral thrills and a magnificent action sequence set underwater. Cast also includes Ron Perlman, Dan Hedaya, Brad Dourif, Michael Wincott and J.E. Freeman."
