        "Jean-Marc Clement (Yves Montand), bachelor, billionaire and womaniser, finds himself entrenched in the world of Broadway musicals when he is cast to play himself on Broadway. Discovering the news that he is to be satirised on stage, an outraged Clement heads to the theatre expecting a confrontation, but instead finds himself captivated by Amanda (Marilyn Monroe), one of the performers in the play, and despite his inability to sing, dance or act, accepts the offer of a role. Coached by some of the best in the business - Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly and Milton Berle, Clement sets out to make his mark on the stage as well as win the heart of the girl he loves without disclosing his true identity. Cast also includes Tony Randall (reprising his straight man role) as Clements PR agent. Includes the original theatrical trailer. Marilyn Monroe sings \"My heart belongs to daddy\"."
