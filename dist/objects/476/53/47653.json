        "The story has its origins in a Chinese short story by Pu Song-ling which was also the basis of Li Hanxiang's 1958 film, 'The Enchanted Shadow'. The internationally successful trio of 'Chinese Ghost Story' films integrates ideas and images from Western movies and John Carpenter films with the classical Chinese story. Here, the plot takes up where part 1 leaves off, with Leslie Cheung as a wandering scholar turning his back on the gates of hell, only to find himself fending off attacks from a decomposing giant. He is drawn into guerilla action to free an unjustly imprisoned official and finds himself torn between the love of the official's two daughters. The film is a mixture of high style, low comedy, steamy romantic interludes, spectacular special effects and rapid-fire editing. Cast also includes Wang Zu Zian (Wang Tsu-hsien) and Wu Ma (Wo Ma). In Cantonese with English subtitles."
