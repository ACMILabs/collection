        "Considered one of Elvis Presley's most dramatic roles, \"Flaming Star\" is a story about Pacer Burton's (Presley) struggle as a young man torn between two cultures. Set some years after the Civil War, the small community that Pacer lives in finds itself under siege from the Kiowa tribe. After several settlers are killed the community turns on Pacer and his family and Pacer is forced to choose between the community he grew up in and his Native American roots. His choice leads to tragedy for both sides. \"Flaming Star\" enables Presley to showcase his acting ability without the usual musical intermissions. Cast also includes Dolores Del Rio, John McIntire and Barbara Eden. Features the original theatrical trailer."
