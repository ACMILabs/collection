        "Nicknamed by film critic Dave Kehr - \"Henry Hathaway's hypnotic contemplation of two American monuments, Niagara Falls and Marilyn Monroe\", 'Niagara' is a classic tale of adultery with an added Freudian touch. While on a belated honeymoon at Niagara Falls, Polly and Ray Cutler (Jean Peters and Casey Adams) make the acquaintance of Rose (Marilyn Monroe) and her much older husband George Loomis (Joseph Cotten), and through their neighboring cottages the Cutlers become aware that all is not well with the Loomises. Rose is constantly flaunting her sexuality and flirting with strangers, thus causing her husband to erupt in uncontrollable accesses of rage. In the shadow lurks Rose's lover Patrick (Richard Allan), waiting for an opportunity to kill George and make it look like a jealousy-induced suicide. Although often associated with exotic locales, Hathaway made the most of the claustrophobic motel setting and gave Marilyn Monroe a chance to explore her dramatic talents. The film was shot in Technicolor, but has roots in the great Film Noir tradition, while The Falls provide more than a spectacular backdrop for a conventional romantic honeymoon and provide a visual metaphor for the destructive effect of sexual passion. The film was scripted and produced by Billy Wilder's regular collaborator Charles Brackett. Cast also includes Jean Peters and Don Wilson. Includes the original theatrical trailer."
