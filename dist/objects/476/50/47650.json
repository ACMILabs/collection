        "In order to win favour with the villagers, local official Tiger Lei proposes a kung-fu championship with his beautiful daughter, Ting Ting's hand in marriage as the prize. His wife, a champion martial arts practitioner will provide the competition, and the footage of the fight sequences played out on scaffolding is truly amazing. Unbeknownst to her father, Ting Ting has fallen in love with Fong Sai Yuk (Jet Li), who defended her honour, won her heart, and earned the wrath of those he defeated in protecting her. Sai Yuk enters the contest, unaware he is duelling to win the girl he loves, and throws the fight when he mistakenly identifies a family servant as the intended bride. Sai Yuk's mother, mortified at her son's defeat, skilled in martial arts and willing to challenge the mores of society enters the competition disguised as Sai Yuk's brother, wins the contest, as well as the adoration of the woman she defeated. The film culminates in an all out action sequence where identities are revealed, loyalties challenged and amazing skills are displayed. Cast also includes Josephine Siao, Michele Reis and Hu Hui Chang. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
