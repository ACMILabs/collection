        "A two-year archaeological dig at several sites along the shores of the Tracadie River in New Brunswick unearths artifacts that support an old man's memories of the days when Indians would camp every summer by the river and weave baskets and that point to the presence of Micmac indians over thousands of years. Archaeologists Micmac explain the nature and function of the ceramic pieces and stone implements. This film jolts its audience into the realization that history is all around us, and not something that exists only in distant lands. Voice and Narration: David Keenlyside, Judy Keenlyside"
