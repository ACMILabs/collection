        "Chaplin once again revived the character of the Little Tramp for this, his last 'silent' film (save for a musical score and an occasional sound effect), released three years after the beginning of the talkie era. After falling in love with a blind flower girl who, through a series of coincidences comes to believes that he is a millionaire, the Tramp attempts to raise money for an operation to restore her vision. A melodrama that combines pathos with slapstick and comedy, 'City Lights' is widely regarded as Chaplin's greatest film."
