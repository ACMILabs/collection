        "A tenacious cop pursues a jewel thief with 72 hours to live who decides to pull off one last heist. In what has become a generic convention of the Hong Kong action film, the two develop a sense of empathy and mutual respect as they engage in a series of mind games that become increasingly complicated as the narrative moves towards a final showdown. With its sparse dialogue and moody, cool cinematography, the film is markedly restrained compared to To's earlier work. Cast includes Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
