        "In 1985, nerdy teenager Ted Stroehmann's luck is about to change when the desirable Mary Jenson chooses him as her prom date. On the actual night, Ted gets his penis caught in his zipper, thus ending a promising evening. 13 years later Ted is still suffering his crush, and decides to track down Mary using the services of a sleazy private investigator, Pat Healy. Ted soon discovers that Pat has not only lied to him about Mary's life, but has also fallen for her. They both soon discover that virtually every man who sets eyes on Mary finds himself totally enamoured, and once everything and everyone are out in the open, Mary must decide who will win her hand. Cast includes: Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Lee Evans and Chris Elliott."
