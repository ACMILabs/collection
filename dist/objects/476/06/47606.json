        "The story of a washed-up music hall clown who regains confidence while helping a suicidal ballerina. This was Chaplin's most personal film in turn nostalgic, melancholic and contemplative as he reflects on old age and the nature of art and comedy. There are only moments of humour (notably in tandem with Buster Keaton). Comedy is a tool for Chaplin's larger enterprise of soul-searching and summing up. Cast also includes Claire Bloom and Nigel Bruce."
