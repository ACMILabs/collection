        "Infamous for it's restaurant scene that provokes the, \"I'll have what she's having\" line, this romantic comedy written by Nora Ephron follows the slowly developing relationship between Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan). Harry and Sally meet in the 1970's when they share a car trip courtesy of a mutual friend. They never run out of things to say, and Harry sticks by his proclamation that men cannot be friends with attractive women. Over the course of the next 10 years, both of them fall in and out of love, grow closer as friends, and contemplate a romantic future together when they cross the boundary between friends and lovers in a moment of emotional weakness. This film provided played a pivotal role in the renaissance of modern romantic comedy, led by Nora Ephron who went on to be involved in films such as \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"You've got mail\", both of which featured Meg Ryan in the romantic lead. Cast also includes Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby."
