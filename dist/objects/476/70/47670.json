        "Steve (Nick Giannopoulos) is an unemployed Greek man who becomes an unwitting scape goat for various political interest groups when he gets branded a dole cheat on a tabloid style current affairs program. His cause gets taken up by the Minister of employment Raelene Beagle- Thorpe (Geraldine Turner), who turns Steve into the poster boy for her campaign, while a romance blossoms between Steve and the Ministers Anglo aid, Celia (Lucy Bell). Anyone who is familiar with Nick Giannopoulos's phenomenally successful stage show 'Wogs out of work', will find more of the same ground covered in 'The Wog boy' as the film broadly lampoons various Australian stereotypes about first and second generation migrants being a bunch of dole cheating, bludgers. Whether star Giannopoulos, director Aleksi Vellis and co-writer Chris Anastassiades achieve their aim of defusing these racist representations by mocking them will entirely depend on whether you think the old fashioned racial jokes on parade here are actually funny. Cast includes Vince Colosimo, Abi Tucker, Derryn Hinch, John Barresi, Hung Le. Special edition includes behind-the-scenes featurette."
