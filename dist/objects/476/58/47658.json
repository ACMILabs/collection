        "An intriguing web of desire, deceit and death are expertly woven together in this effervescent satire by the unrepentantly twisted director Pedro Almodovar. The madness begins with motormouth make-up artist Kika (Veronique Forque) being summoned to the home of ex-pat American writer Nicholas (Peter Coyote) to make over the corpse of his step-son, Ramon (Alex Casanovas). During her ministrations, Ramon awakens from a cataleptic trance, and the pair fall in love. Complicating their bizarre relationship further are Kika's sporadic involvement with Nicholas, the lustful adoration of her maid, Juana (Rossy de Palma), and Ramon's demented ex-girlfriend, Andrea Scarface (Victoria Abril), the host of the voyeuristic reality television show, `Today's Worst'. Committed to turning private lives inside out for a scoop, Andrea zips around Madrid on a motorcycle with a camera strapped to her crash helmet. Things truly take a turn for the outrageous when Juana's psychotic ex-porn star brother, Pablo, appears on the scene after breaking out of jail, with Andrea hot on his heels. An explicit but entertaining film filled with fabulous imagery and dazzling costumes from famous fashion designers Jean Paul Gaultier and Gianni Versace. Veronique Forque won a Goya Award for Best Lead Actress for her portrayal of Kika. In Spanish with English subtitles."
