        "An old man sits in a rowboat on an endless gravel ocean remembering episodes from his youth and middle age. The three vignettes presented in this film using model animation come to represent the old man's search for spiritual meaning and purpose in his life. The tightrope becomes a metaphor for his precarious passage from boyhood to adulthood, while the door and ladder sequence comes to represent the man's desire for meaning through material wealth. The final rowboat episode thus becomes the pinnacle of the man's quest - a final search for fulfilment that will take him beyond life."
