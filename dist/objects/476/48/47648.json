        "While Jackie Chan had long been a mega-star in his native Hong Kong for his goofy physical humour and stunt-filled action style, this was the film that made him a household name in the West. A police officer (Chan) is assigned to protect a key witness (Brigitte Lin) in the prosecution of a major drug dealer. On the day of the trial she mysteriously disappears and the drug dealer is set free. The police officer is demoted, but the dealer wants him dead and frames him for the murder of a fellow police officer, forcing him to take the law into his own hands. Full of spectacular stunts and no-holds-barred action sequences, 'Police Story' spawned numerous sequels and opened the way for the wider exposure of Hong Kong action cinema to an international audience. Cast also includes Maggie Cheung. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
