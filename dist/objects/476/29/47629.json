        "My best friend's wedding (103 mins) stars Julia Roberts as the lovelorn food critic Julianne, who discovers she wants to spend the rest of her life with her best friend the day he pops the question to someone else. She has four days to break up the wedding and help her best friend discover that she's the one. With an outstanding supporting cast including Cameron Diaz and Rupert Everett, this film takes the cake as the romantic comedy of the year. In \"Steel Magnolias\" (112 mins), six strong Southern belles enjoy a friendship that spans the boundaries of age and status. Despite their differences they share each other's strength, hope and loyalty to survive the cycles of life, birth, and death to emerge stronger, closer and still laughing. An ensemble cast including Julia Roberts, Sally Field, Olympia Dukakis, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine and Darryl Hannah make this heartrending story, based on the stage play of the same name by Robert Harling, a bittersweet sentimental journey through the lives of this group of truly remarkable women."
