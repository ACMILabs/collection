        "One of the biggest box office hits of all time, this movie delivers the ultimate encounter when aliens launch an invasion against the human race. The spectacle begins when massive spaceships appear. Wonder turns to terror as the ships blast destructive beams of fire down on cities all over the planet. Now the world's only hope lies with determined survivors, uniting for one last strike against the invaders - before it's the end of mankind. Cast includes Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Mary McDonnell."
