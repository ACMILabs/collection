        "Elvis Presley plays troubled and angry local boy Glenn Talbot in this 1960's adaptation of J.R. Salamanca's novel \"Wild in the Country\". The movie opens with Glenn and his brother brawling and the fight lands Glenn in front of the probation board yet again. The board gives him a second chance on the condition he is given into the custody of his Uncle and attends sessions with local psychologist Irene Spencer (Hope Lange). Glenn battles against his temper and old wild ways with the help of Irene who encourages him to pursue his writing and helps him get into college. The pair, high on Glenn's success and sheltering from a storm in a motel, declare their love, but contain their desire for one another. Fearful of her feelings towards Glenn, Irene spurns his love by agreeing to marry another; Glenn, enraged by the news goes on a drunken spree and looks to be reverting back to his wicked ways. Cast also includes Tuesday Weld, Millie Perkins, John Ireland and Rafer Johnson."
