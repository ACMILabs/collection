        "Love Me Tender is most noteable for being Elvis Presley's cinematic debut and the launching pad for one of his most recognisable hits Love Me Tender. The story of the Reno brothers starts at the end of the Civil War. Presley is Clint Reno a young farmer trying to keep the family farm running after the family are told that the oldest brother, Vance Reno has been killed in battle. Believing his brother is dead, Clint and Vance's sweetheart Kathy marry. However, Vance returns with the intention of marrying Kathy. Clint receives reassurance from Vance that he bears no resentment towards the pair. However, the trios relationships with one another are soon tested when Vance is arrested and taken away for trial. This one event leads the trio to a climatic encounter that ends tragicly for all. While in the majority of the film Presley gets to display his acting ability the story is broken up with Presley singing and dancing."
