        "One of the most effective political thrillers ever filmed, \"Z\" is an account of an opposition MP (Yves Montand) of an unidentified Mediterranean country who is murdered before a national election. Jean-Louis Trintignant plays a magistrate whose investigation leads him to uncovering a secret organisation led by the military who are planning a coup-d'etat. Based on the situation in Greece which led to the military junta of 1966, Greek director Costas Gavras (who was in exile from the Greek Colonels) filmed this tense and exciting thriller in France and Algiers. On its release \"Z\" became an instant cause-celebre as its combination of melodrama, action and suspense elements made it incredibly effective anti-fascist propaganda. Whereas a film such as \"Battle of Algiers\" relied on approximation of realism to achieve its political goals, \"Z\" uses visceral and emotional manipulation to create a rollercoaster ride of a movie which aims to simulate the crisis of a democratic state falling to fascism. The film brought wide attention to the suffering of the Greek people under the junta as well as pointing out the cynical involvement of the CIA in supporting the undemocratic Colonels. With Irene Papas. The thrilling musical score by exiled composer Mikis Theodorakis was taken up by liberation movements throughout the world. Based on the book by Vassilis Vassilikos which was itself a roman-a-clef about the assassination of politician and journalist Lambrakis."
