        "This farcical comedy based loosely on the historic 1910 London to Paris air race features the greatest aviators from around the world. They all come together when a stuffy, but very rich, newspaper publisher decides to sponsor an airplane race across the English Channel. The often hilarious escapades between the American, British, French, German, Italian and Japanese teams results in some of the most daring and hilarious in-flight acrobatics ever filmed."
