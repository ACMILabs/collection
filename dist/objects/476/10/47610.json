        "Rosanna Santamaria arrived in Canada in 1969. A single parent supporting three children, she had to adapt to a new marital status, a new country, and a new language. Although she faced added difficulties as an immigrant, her problems are common to many women. She is now working to help others like herself make the transition to a new life."
