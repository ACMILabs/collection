        "When the town of Newstead held a summit in 2008, the idea of a community garden grew out of it. With the help of a grant and the support of locals and volunteers, the land surrounding the All Saints Anglican Church has become a thriving biodynamic garden.  It is a great place for the community to come together, dig and get to know one another."
