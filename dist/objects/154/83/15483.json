    "description": [
        "One of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. Phu and Phuong\u2019s shed is a serious mechanical jewel box. The exterior, a classic corrugated shed, gives no real impression of what can be found inside. The shed houses both of the brother\u2019s prized possessions \u2013 their  cars. The boys weekends and most evenings are spent in the shed polishing and cleaning the beloved, gleaming machinery, listening to music and generally just being with the cars. Phu\u2019s low and sleek Nissan Turbo has everything that can open and shut \u2013 all digital of course, with every \u2018after market\u2019 improvement possible. Electric blue LEDs glow, exotic dials flicker, buttons and knobs are there for the pressing and tweaking: it\u2019s a bit like having a low-flying spaceship in a suburban shed. For Phu and Phuong, the shed has been there for most of their lives. As kids they watched their father looking after his cars in the shed, which created their own interest in shed activities. Surrounded by their father\u2019s ornate topiary, the shed dominates their small backyard. It was built to cram in four cars, which makes the morning departures something of a family joke. The brothers enjoy taking their cars out for a cruise on Sunday but the best part is then returning for hours in the shed to polish and love it some more. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
