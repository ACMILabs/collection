        "In October 2010, renowned American artist Bill Viola travelled to Melbourne to install two exhibitions of his work : 'The Raft' at ACMI and 'Fire Woman and Tristan\u2019s Ascension' at St Carthage\u2019s Catholic Church in Parkville. Presented by ACMI along with Melbourne International Arts Festival and Kaldor Public Art Projects, these two exhibitions gave Melbourne audiences a unique chance to experience the work of one of the world\u2019s more influential and important artists.  Viola has been instrumental in the establishment of video as a vital form of contemporary art. For over 40 years he has created videotapes, architectural video installations, sound environments, electronic music performances, flat panel video pieces and works for television broadcast. His video installations \u2013 total environments that envelop the viewer in image and sound \u2013 employ state-of-the-art technologies and are distinguished by their precision and direct simplicity.  In this film Bill Viola is in conversation with Rachel Kohn, Producer and Presenter of 'The Spirit of things' and 'The Ark' on Radio National."
