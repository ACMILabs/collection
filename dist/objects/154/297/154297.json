    "description": [
        "Established over 90 years ago, the Lorne Theatre came about when a travelling picture show man ran out of funds and some local business men purchased his equipment and started running movies in the local hall.  It then moved to its present site in 1937, where for such a small permanent population, the theatre has not changed much in all those years. Tony Hill, Manager of the Lorne Theatre, talks about the difficulties in offering a diverse range of cinema in the climate of DVDs and downloadable movies, and operating in a town prone to blackouts. He is proud the theatre is attended by a local group of cinephiles who sit in the same seat every session, and thinks himself very lucky to have his job."
