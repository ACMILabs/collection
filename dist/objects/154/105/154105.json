        "Growing up in a mission, Frances Gallagher had disjointed access to her own culture and found it hard to navigate the world outside. By looking into her past, and through her years of community work, Frances sends a strong message of the importance of empowerment and self-determination. Essentially, a community is much stronger when they can manage their own affairs, their way and according to their culture and beliefs."
