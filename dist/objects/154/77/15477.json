    "description": [
        "12 x 2 minute minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. When Ramy, an Egyptian born inventor and engineer, needed someone to help him build a prototype paper making machine, he was put in touch with John, a \u2018jack of all trades\u2019 with a large farm shed in which all things were possible. And so their relationship was born. It gets stronger each day with a combination of true friendship and utmost professional admiration. The large shed, surrounded by beautiful native bushland in the Adelaide Hills, has many different projects underway: from old steam engines, dismembered motor bikes to pneumatically controlled guillotines and prototype lathes. We witness this teamwork, as Ramy and his older counterpart design, test and just generally find things to perfect in their shed, never losing their energy to find a solution. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
