        "One of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. Bruno has built a wooden oven in his shed. He fires the oven up early in the day, to bake the dough that he, his wife Guissepina, and his son Sam, have mixed up in a big wooden trough. By 9am the neighborhood smells of fresh bread as the beautiful rounded loaves are slid out of the oven on a long handled bread board before being eaten dipped in homemade olive oil and accompanied by other delicious flavors from the garden and of course, homemade wine. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
