    "description": [
        "One of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. Mariano is a senior member of the rapidly growing South Australian Sudanese community, many of whom have arrived in Australia to seek refuge from their country that has been torn apart by civil war. Mariano lives with his family in public housing with a medium sized backyard. When Mariano pulls up the roller door of his shed, it is full \u2013 absolutely full of second-hand clothes, household utensils, furniture and appliances. Mariano collects and stores these items, which have been donated by the public, in his shed and distributes them to families who have recently arrived in Australia.  As Mariano says: \u201cI don\u2019t make things in my shed. Or maybe I do\u2026 I am making a community!\u201d. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
