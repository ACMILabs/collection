        "Beate and Marta immigrated to Australia with their families, changing their lives for ever. Leaving behind their native Latvia both women struggled with acceptance, a new language, new customs and a foreign environment. This film showcases the strength, humour and humanity needed to survive and to flourish in a new land. Inga, her mother Beate and their friend Marta reflect on their lives and traditions, old and new."
