        "When he went to the cinemas, the newsreels would beckon David Higgins to 'Join the Navy and see the world!'. And join the Navy he did, serving in the Mediterranean during World War II. He guides us through the bowels of the ship and the claustrophobic conditions therein. David also reflects on the life-shifting experience of war, how it changed his perspective on things and how little he knew at the time when he signed up."
