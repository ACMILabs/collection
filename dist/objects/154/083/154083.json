        "Des Surkitt pays tribute to the 27 fallen soldiers in one of the worst accidents in the Australian Army's history. In Kapooka, an explosion during a training exercise, took the lives of all but one of the young soldiers. This event had a profound effect on Des, more so as he had just completed the training program the week before. Despite his good fortune, Des honours these lost men and reflects on why they have been forgotten by their own country."
