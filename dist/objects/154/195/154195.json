    "description": [
        "The 1924 Melbourne Cup was won by 'Backwood', trained by Richard Bradfield. 'Backwood' was to be one of four Cup winners from the Bradfield stables, and was only the second international horse to win the Cup (following the victory of 'Comedy King' in 1910). Following a very artistic opening title, we are whisked to Flemington, where a large crowd mills before us. The age and fragility of this film is evident in some damage to this section, but clears for the arrival of the State Governor, the Earl of Stradbroke. The race is run to a tight finish, and the footage wraps up trackside as the mighty steeds are led back to 'scale'."
