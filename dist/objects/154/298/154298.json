        "Local residents and theatre workers talk about the positive impact the Portland Star has made on their lives and reminisce about \"rolling Jaffas down the aisle\". Even though the theatre has seen changes over the years, in 2008 offering live music as a means to keep going, the proprietor expresses his passion for the cinema, even when it sometimes runs at a loss, and why he will continue to serve the community with great movies and live events."
