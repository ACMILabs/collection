        "Jane Curtis reflects on how she spent her childhood sitting in the loungeroom of her grandparents home. As her family spoke in a language she didn't understand, Curtis was transfixed by the painting that hung on her grandparent's wall. Only as an adult would she discover the mysteries that painting held. Created as part of an ACMI Digital Storytelling Program in the Digital Studio or outreach program."
