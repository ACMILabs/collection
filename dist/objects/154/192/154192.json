        "As with the previous year's Cup, 1897's race was filmed under the auspices of the Lumiere brothers and was the first Australian film to feature a camera pan shot (although we had a long way to go before we perfected it!).  The winning horse, 'Gaulus', edged out his brother 'The Grafter' to earn them a place in history as the only siblings to quinella the Melbourne Cup. In a happy sequel, 'The Grafter' went on to win the Cup the following year. 100 years after 'Gaulus' win, the commemorative whip that had been presented to his jockey was found in the attic of a Melbourne home and sold at auction."
