        "An experimental feminist film that challenged the way the image of women had been produced by and for men. Made collaboratively by Margot Nash and Robin Laurie, who also appear in it, the film is a humorous and erotically-charged pastiche of personal fragments of conversation, political statements, powerful images and improvised performance, all edited together to confront conventional ideas about women and their sexuality.
