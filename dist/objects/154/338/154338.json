    "description": [
        "This documentary is part of a promotional series called 'See Australia First', made in the 1920s. The 'Visit Victoria' episodes, of which this was a part, would have encouraged tourism throughout the state and showcased the scenery of the areas. In this film, it is the Murray River that features, with the paddle-steamer presented as a natural inhabitant of the river. Other scenes detail the fertile crop fields that nestle around the river\u2019s path, river transport by barge, various homesteads, townships and settlements on the edges of the Murray, and the connecting rail transport of the area. Intertitles identify the main points of interest along the journey down the Murray River as well as provide some background to specific areas or objects which are featured."
