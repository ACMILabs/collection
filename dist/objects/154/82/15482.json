    "description": [
        "One of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. Dimitri lives in a suburban house in Adelaide. As we meet Dimitri we discover his intense love of Greek musical instruments. He is one of a few in Australia who makes bouzoukis, ouds and baglamas. We hear how Dimitri first got interested in his craft and how he made a special journey from Australia to Poland to learn from a master craftsman. Dimitri works in his brand new purpose built shed in the backyard, as he likes the flexibility of working all hours. We watch how Dimitri builds musical instruments and also welcomes and attracts his friends and colleagues to the shed to share in the unique sound of those instruments he loves and makes. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
