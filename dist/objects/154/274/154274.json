        "Glenn Roy, also known as 'Kinga', has lived in Maldon for 40 years and is considered a local treasure. Once named the King of Maldon, he takes care of all the elderly in the town doing all sorts of odd jobs for them. He has an obsession for collecting Victor lawnmowers which keeps him busy, as does his dogs and the various bands he performs in. His motto is to be happy and to make sure the town is happy, even if that means putting on a tutu and fishnets for the town's Mardi Gras Easter parade."
