    "description": [
        "1915 saw Mrs Edith Widdis become the first female owner of a Melbourne Cup winner, when 'Patrobas' galloped to victory under jockey Bobbie Lewis. Other facts and figures: It was Lewis' 19th ride as a jockey in the Cup, and 'Patrobas' became the first horse to win the trifecta of the VRC Derby, Caulfied Guineas and the Melbourne Cup. Highlights in this footage, produced by Australasian Films, include some great shots capturing the hustle and bustle of the flat and grandstands; shots of the 'Birdcage and Saddling Paddock'; and great use of a wide angle to capture the whole race from start to finish, a technique that is still used today."
