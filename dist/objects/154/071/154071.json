        "Despite being born on Friday the 13th, Gordon White was always considered to be lucky. With luck on his side, he joined the Australian Navy and spent most of his time on the HMAS Sydney, a battleship that had survived 80-90 bombing raids with no loss of life. When he was posted on another ship, Gordon soon realised that downside to being lucky - witnessing the suffering of others."
