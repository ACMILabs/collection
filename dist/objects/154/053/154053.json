        "Twelve digital stories from the Lebanese community in Australia."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "In this program, twelve Australians of Lebanese heritage tell their stories. They share with us tales about travel and exile, about war and loss, about attachment to family and homeland, about memory, identity, and the ways in which the places we live affect us.  Participants include: Zeina Zogheib, Raymond Nashar, Denise Mack, Mike Helal, Firas Massouh, Stephen Pascoe, Mounir Kiwan, Sam Haddad, Nadine Samaha, Carla Pascoe, Dania Dabliz and Rita el-Khoury.  These digital stories from the Lebanese community in Australia were created as part of the 'Stories from the Lebanese Community' Digital Storytelling workshop at ACMI."
