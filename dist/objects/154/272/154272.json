        "Dynamic 18 year old Shani Aziz is a hip hop dancer living in the small town of Maldon where she runs the local fish and chip shop with her mother.  She started hip hop dancing with her brother as something fun to do but it has become her passion leading her to start a not-for-profit group to empower young people. She is an inspirational teacher offering the youth of the small Victorian town an outlet for fun and self expression."
