        "May is a Yorta Yorta woman who grew up on Cummera Gunja mission. She warmly reflects on her days there, swimming and listening the the elders tell their stories. Moved away from her community, she experienced racism and prejudice but from those experiences learnt to overcome the boundries that others set up for her. She has since committed to a lifetime of learning and teaching and linking children and family back to their communities."
