        "More and more people are moving to Port Fairy to be part of a strong, creative and social community. We meet Katie Wise who came to Port Fairy for a visit, and has been there for 10 years now, managing the school canteen and teaching the kids the benefit of healthy food. For Helen and Ben Fennessy, Port Fairy is a place that gives them great solitude to be able to do what they like creatively.  Judy and Victor Gillatt explored the town while on holiday in 1973, and the more they explored, the more they liked."
