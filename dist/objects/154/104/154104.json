        "As a tribute to her mother, the Indigenous activist Eleanor Harding, Deborah Deacon tells of her life and various struggles. Wanting a better life for her family was the main motivation in Eleanor moving from her home in Queensland to Melbourne. She eventually found a community in Fitzroy who supported her when she needed it at the start. Eleanor never forgot this, and devoted her life to helping out the community in various ways throughout her life. Her mother, as well as the elders of her community, have instilled in Deborah a strong sense of both individual and community empowerment."
