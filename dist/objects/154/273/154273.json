        "Eric and Debra Watson came to Maldon for a long weekend, walked around and fell in love with the town.  They saw a church for sale and three days later purchased it and moved from Melbourne. The town felt like home from their first visit and while they feel close enough to the city, their kids have the chance of growing up in a safe country environment where they can walk everywhere and just be kids."
