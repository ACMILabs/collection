        "Take a front-seat tour of three regional Victorian cinemas, the Capitol in Warrnambool, the Lorne Theatre and the Portland Star. Your tour guides are the cinema staff, old and new, and the locals who frequent these historic cinemas and keep them alive. Despite highlighting the struggle to function commercially in the light of increased access through DVDs and downloadable films, the stories told, both colourful and romantic hint that the local cinema still has a place in people's lives and how difficult it can be to replace the simple joy of the shared cinematic experience."
