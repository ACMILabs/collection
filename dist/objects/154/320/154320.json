        "Ada Peterson's brother received a call twelve years ago from a person they didn't know. It was their sister, Rhonda, who was taken as a child, a member of what is now known as the stolen generation. After getting over the initial shock and apprehension, getting to know Rhonda and her story has taken Ada's life in a different direction, bringing her closer to celebrating who she is."
