    "description": [
        "A collection of short documentaries about some of the State\u2019s most iconic theatres and movie houses in regional Victoria. Some of the cinemas date back to the early 1800s and are kept in operation by their passionate local communities. These old theatres hold a great deal of cultural significance for the towns, along with fond memories of the past for many long-standing members of the community. The documentaries detail the origins of the historic theatres and the challenges they face in the modern age of DVD\u2019s and online streaming."
