        "One of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. Mick\u2019s obsession with trains began when he was a young boy growing up in Prague.  He began constructing his model train world for his grandchildren many years ago. However, when they grew up and lost interest, Mick\u2019s interest continued to grow. Mick\u2019s shed contains another world. In it are miniature houses, people, trees and animals, all set around a train line with a \u201cSwiss\u201d alpine backdrop complete with snow capped mountains. Mick spends his time in his shed perfecting his miniature world and making continuous repairs, additions and alterations. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
