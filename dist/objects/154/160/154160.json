        "Fresh out of university, Bill Nicholson's first professional job involved him identifying human remains located in the vault of the Melbourne Museum. Some of those remains were traced back to Truganina Explosives Reserve in Altona. This animation tells the story of how these remains, discovered in Melbourne's west, were returned to their traditional resting place. Please note : This animation is based on a story told by Aboriginal Bill Nicholson Jr, visually interpreted by a white artist."
