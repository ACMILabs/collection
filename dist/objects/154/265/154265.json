        "Maurie Gervasoni's grandfather settled in Newstead during the Victorian gold rush in the 1860's and quickly designed and built a family estate.  A love of music and dancing made the Yandoit houses a destination  for vibrant country living. The stone house and former stables presently sit as a relic, but Maurie hopes that one day the place will be restored to its former glory."
