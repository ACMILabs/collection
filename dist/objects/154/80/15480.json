    "description": [
        "Oe of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. Attilio, a retired fitter and turner, is part of a powerful Italian tradition of high quality artisanship. He still works at home, doing small, specialised jobs. His basic galvanised iron shed is lined with tools of the trade - boxes and shelves filled with mostly metallic bits and pieces that get pieced together with absolute passion and craft. Attilio is also an entertainer - a funny guy and the life of the party. He has produced many CDs of his songs and is regularly booked for events by the South Australian Italian community. Attilio\u2019s taverna is an open-sided room with a big table and a gas stove at one end - complete with an espresso machine for making short blacks (sometimes with a dash of the grappa!). In his taverna Attilio spends time with his brother Joe and his friends, enjoying Italian food and the fruits of his other labour \u2013 wine making. So Attilio\u2019s backyard has two sheds \u2013 one for sharing friendship and entertainment, the other for the serious work. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
