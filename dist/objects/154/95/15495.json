        "An intimate portrait of 84-year-old Roger Hogan, aka Australian Country music legend 'Dusty Rankin'. Born and raised in Birchip, Dusty appeared on Australia's Amateur Hour in 1946 and maintained an active career through to 1961 when he returned to working the farm full-time. He was one of the most popular country artists of the time, with many of his songs becoming popular standards. Here Roger remembers his rich life of touring but ultimately brings it all back home."
