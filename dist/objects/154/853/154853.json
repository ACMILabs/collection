    "description": [
        "Turner's Syndrome affects one in every 2000-2500 females. A genetic disorder due to the absence of an X chromosome, it usually leads to growth difficulties, infertility and, in some cases, learning difficulties, particularly with mathematics and spatial relationships. These twelve stories are by those who have lived with Turner's Syndrome, either by being diagnosed with it or caring for a child with the disorder. The inspiring stories are about living with Turner's Syndrome and not letting it prevent them from living a normal life."
