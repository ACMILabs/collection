        "1910 saw the arrival of foreign-bred horses in the Melbourne Cup winners' circle, with 'Comedy King' of the UK taking out top honours. Opening with (some slightly out of focus) shots of the Melbourne Cup trophy in its glass case, the clip goes on to pay homage to the fashion of the day. This footage also captures the arrival of Governor Sir Thomas Carmichael, in a horse-drawn carriage accompanied by a mounted police escort and other assorted dignitaries. Then onto the race!"
