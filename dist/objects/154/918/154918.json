        "Knowing your passion in life and then making a living out of it is every ones dream. Three generations of the Niklaus family are living the dream as bee farmers in Beechworth. Keith, his son, Andrej, and his grandson, Thomas, want for no other life than to wake up in the morning, check on the bees and cultivate honey. In times of draught or floods they have to travel long distances to find the right place for their bees to pollinate, making bee farming a diverse and rewarding lifestyle."
