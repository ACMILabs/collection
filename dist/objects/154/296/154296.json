    "description": [
        "The Capitol Theatre plays a vital part in the social life of Warrnambool.  Built in 1929 and opened in 1930, in 2008 the cinema has been converted into three separate cinemas, run by General Manager, Greg Gent. Taking us on a tour of the historic cinema, Gent discusses the challenges of running a cinema in the DVD age. Stan and Norma Stevens have been associated with the cinema for over 50 years where Stan first worked as an usher and the cinema was the setting for their first date. Noel Hallam worked at the theatre for 34 years and Ivan Berndt has been the projectionist for 37 years. Each has their own stories to tell on how the theatre has been an integral part of their lives and how it continues to be."
