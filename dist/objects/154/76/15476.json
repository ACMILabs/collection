    "description": [
        "One of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. Khai is an established and well-respected contemporary furniture designer of Malaysian descent.  Since he started out his 30-year relationship with furniture, first as an antique dealer, collector and restorer, then as a designer, Khai has discovered many styles of influence. Khai\u2019s latest pieces have a distinctly Danish form. At the back of his retail shop, Khai\u2019s basic galvanised iron shed/workshop is very simple and orderly \u2013 a reflection of his design sense. Lined with tools of the trade (chisels, hammers, sanding equipment etc) the shed also houses many projects in various stages of completion. Amongst the sounds of timber being sanded, hammered and polished we hear Khai recount his earlier years. He talks of how he started out and how, even as he travels the world collecting pieces, the place he longs to be is with his tools in the shed, wearing his apron. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
