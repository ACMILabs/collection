        "Essie Warmuth introduces us to the various social, political and community groups that thrive in Port Fairy. There's the bike group that rides every morning, rain, hail or shine. Next we go indoors to visit a book club that has entertained and engaged a group of women for over 30 years. These women have shared books, births, weddings and funerals over the years. Finally, a community action group, in collaboration with the local IGA, devoted to stamping out the use of plastic bags in Port Fairy. These groups illustrate the diverse interests of this small town as well as creating a strong sense of community for the locals."
