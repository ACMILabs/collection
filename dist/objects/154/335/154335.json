        "The Murray River is shown from a high vantage point, and the river banks are shown from a boat moving along the river. Highlights include: irrigated orchards; paddle-steamers and riverside buildings at Mannum; flocks of birds; sedimentary rock cliffs; a station homestead on the river bank; paddle-steamers berthed at the river bank; fishermen catching Murray cod; dairy farmers with loads of cream cans waiting for a riverboat; tall river gums and cattle grazing on fertile river flats."
