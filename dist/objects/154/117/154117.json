        "The Yambuk Slide is a local icon, a place where generations have come to enjoy the freedom and fun that a slide in the middle of a sand dune can deliver. Originally built in 1982, when the slide was likely to be removed it caused much upset with the locals, one threatening to chain himself to the slide.  The new slide does not have the speed of the old one, but it still keeps kids entertained and parents happy."
