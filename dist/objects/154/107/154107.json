        "Kevin Onus-King learnt that 'you only get what you want when you fight for it' and he learnt this in more ways than one over the years. He takes us back through the history of Indigenous activists in Fitzroy and how this area was a hot bed of political activity as he was growing up. He later became strongly involved in the fight for better conditions and has taken that fight across Australia."
