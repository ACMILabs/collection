        "A Castlemaine icon, the Theatre Royal is one of the oldest theatres in the country dating back to 1858. The owner in 2010, the projectionist, a burlesque performer and a local regular patron talk about their cinematic experiences, the history of the building, its architectural delights and how it is a major social centre for the town. Changing with the times, this is not only a single screen cinema, it offers music nights, community events, artist markets and even boasts a theatre ghost."
