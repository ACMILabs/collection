    "description": [
        "The Rex Theatre, in Charlton, was built in 1938 and opened with the film 'Mary, Queen of Scots'. David Pollard, who worked as a projectionist at the theatre since 1980, takes us on a tour of this historic theatre. He is the Chairperson of the Charlton Community Theatre and has been working towards getting The Rex into community ownership, as there is not a large population base for the theatre to be commercially viable. The community has offered voluntary labour and raised over $80,000 and with the help of fundraising from the federal government, it is hoped the theatre will eventually be completely in the hands of the community."
