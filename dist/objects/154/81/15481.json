    "description": [
        "One of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. Set in the lush Riverland in South Australia, we meet a Sikh man, Saroop, and his Bosnian friend, Omer. Saroop owns 400 acres of fruit growing land on the River Murray. He\u2019s been there for 25 years after coming out from the Punjab. Saroop has several sheds with large tractors and spraying machinery as well as one open-sided shed where he and Omer work on repairing things and on long term experiments - such as the budcutting machine they have worked on for several years. They call this shed \u201cOmer\u2019s Lab\u201d. Saroop and Omer work hard at reusing lots of existing scrap to construct new things and replace parts on others. They are extremely inventive and are proud they have saved hundreds of dollars by making things more mechanical and efficient. This interstitial explores the close friendship between two different cultural backgrounds. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
