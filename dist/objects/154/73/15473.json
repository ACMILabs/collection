    "description": [
        "One of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. In the scenic Adelaide Hills, Silvio, a well-known sculptor, spends all of his time working in his shed. He tells us how he and his family came to grow up in Australia after his father was a Hungarian pilot for the Germans in the war. Silvio began carving when he was five years old, carving bark off pine trees, soap, and bits of wood. He now creates life-sized beautifully ornate carved animals\u2026pelicans, lizards and frogs from wood, stone and bronze. We see Silvio working with true commitment and passion in his enormous shed, as he works on creating the animals that he loves. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
