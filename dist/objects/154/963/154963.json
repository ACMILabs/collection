    "description": [
        "This film captures the installation of the large projection screen and associated audio visual equipment needed to showcase Bill Viola\u2019s works, 'Fire Woman' & 'Tristan\u2019s Ascension'. The exhibition took place at St Carthage\u2019s Catholic Church in Parkville and the film features a short introduction by John Kaldor and interviews with Bill Viola and Father Michael Elligate.  Bill Viola has been instrumental in the establishment of video as a vital form of contemporary art. For over 40 years he has created videotapes, architectural video installations, sound environments, electronic music performances, flat panel video pieces and works for television broadcast. His video installations, total environments that envelop the viewer in image and sound, employ state-of-the-art technologies and are distinguished by their precision and direct simplicity."
