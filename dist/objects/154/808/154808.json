        "In 2005, the Australian Federal Government introduced new laws to address to potential and perceived threat of terrorism. Dubbed the 'anti-terrorism' or sedition law, the outcome of the reforms would enable someone to be detained on suspicion of a terrorist act for up to seven days, with significantly less rights than afforded a suspect of any other criminal act. The laws have given Joyce Evans pause for consideration about whether these measures were really going to make Australia safe in the long run, or leave Australia open to despotic rule in the future."
