        "Marius Sestier filmed the running of the 1896 Melbourne Cup using a Lumiere Cinematographe camera. It went on to be screened not only in Australia, but also in London, St Petersburg and Paris. It was believed to be Australia's earliest surviving film until the discovery of Le Patineur Grotesque (1896), which Sestier shot only a few days prior to the Melbourne Cup. The footage features the Governor of Victoria, Earl Thomas Brassey, arriving at the track. Throughout the film you can see Walter Barnett, the producer of the film, encouraging action and movement by directing the crowd to wave their hats. Although this film is recorded as actuality footage, this manipulation of the action not only indicates the general unfamiliarity people had with moving image but also puts a personal perspective into Sestier's story."
