        "Seven Indigenous youth tell their own stories about who they are and where they come from. They proudly describe the places and people that inspire them and connect them to their heritage. In doing so, they provide an examination of what it is to grow up Indigenous in Australia in the 1990s, how to engage with your spirituality and identity today."
