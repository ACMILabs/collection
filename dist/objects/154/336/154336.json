        "Made at a time when reservoirs, pumping plants, weirs, and channels were still being constructed to harness the Murray River\u2019s water supply for irrigation and agriculture, this documentary is both a record of construction and also evidence of how irrigation has transformed the lands surrounding the Murray. Harnessing the Murray\u2019s water flow allowed thousands of acres of formerly useless land to be reclaimed for cultivation."
