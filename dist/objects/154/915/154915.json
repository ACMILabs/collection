        "When the only service station in town was under threat of closure, seven local people got together and decided to do something positive about it. They formed the Yackandandah Community Development Company Pty Ltd - YCDCo.  To build a new fuel outlet, a share offer was launched to the community and over $400,000 was raised.  Now almost every one in Yackandandah is a shareholder and receives a dividend each year. But the most valuable dividends are not monetary.  YCDco contributes funds to  the local newspaper, is integral to the Yack Folk Festival and has funded many local schools, sports and community groups."
