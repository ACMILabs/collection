        "There's never been any explosions at the Truganina Explosives Reserve in Altona, but accidents, well that's another story. As a child, Alan Dyall's father worked at the reserve in Melbourne's west. One of his many jobs involved 'laying out in the lighters', a lighter being a boat that carried explosives from Williamstown to the steamship. If the steamship hadn't yet arrived, it was his job to sleep on board until it did. This is a childhood of tales lovingly recalled and the amazing story of his father's near fatal accident."
