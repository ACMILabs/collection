        "Highlights from the earliest years of the Melbourne Cup, captured on film."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Australia's race that stops the nation is now over 150 years old.  To celebrate this milestone the National Film and Sound Archive has compiled this series of highlights from the earliest years of the Melbourne Cup captured on film. From Marius Sestier's Cinematographe footage of the 1896 race (which is among the oldest surviving Australian films), through to a comparatively slick production for the 1945 Cup, these film gems tell not only the story of the Melbourne Cup during this period, but also that of Australia's first steps into the world of the moving image."
