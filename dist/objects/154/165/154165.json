        "Truganina Explosives Reserve in Altona is an environmental wonderland, containing rare flora and fauna. Much of the original landscape has remained untouched for over 100 years. This takes us back to a time when it was formally landscaped, and representative of the early Edwardian planting of the late 1880s. Please enjoy a serene journey through the reserve, celebrating this unique ecosystem."
