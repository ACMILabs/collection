    "description": [
        "On October 6th 2010, Father Michael Elligate of St Carthage\u2019s Catholic Church in Parkville introduced John Kaldor and Bill Viola, formally launching the exhibition. Presented by ACMI along with Melbourne International Arts Festival and Kaldor Public Art Projects, the exhibition gave Melbourne audiences a unique chance to experience the work of one of the world\u2019s more influential and important artists.  John Kaldor speaks of his admiration for Bill Viola\u2019s work, and his contemporary use of the moving image, Bill in turn talks about his work, processes and inspirations.  Bill Viola has been instrumental in the establishment of video as a vital form of contemporary art. For over 40 years he has created videotapes, architectural video installations, sound environments, electronic music performances, flat panel video pieces and works for television broadcast. His video installations - total environments that envelop the viewer in image and sound - employ state-of-the-art technologies and are distinguished by their precision and direct simplicity."
