        "The Birchip Leisure Centre is the social hub of Birchip township and surrounds. In addition to providing clubrooms for the local football, hockey, netball, golf and tennis clubs, the leisure centre also plays host to social events and functions. What is key to the centre is the fact that it is community built and funded - everyone in the local area collaborated to raise money and build the facilities. Here the manager, Bobby Liston, gives a personal view of this important place."
