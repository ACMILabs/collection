    "description": [
        "As a child, Howard Edwards was shunted from orphanage to orphanage. Made a ward of the state in 1956, he was abused and beaten wherever he was sent. His incarceration didn't end there and for much of his adult life Howard was a target for police and he was often locked up at the slightest provocation. A large part of Howard's journey towards healing involved reconnecting with his family, his work in the community and on the board of the Aboriginal Health Care Service."
