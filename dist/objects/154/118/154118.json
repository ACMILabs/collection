        "Geoff Clarke takes us on a tour of the Deen Maar property and explains why the island and the land is such a significant location for the local Indigenous people and is of importance to the Yambuk area. He discusses the challenge of incorporating modern industry on such a sensitive site, installing wind turbines on the land, which generates an economic return for the community while achieving a compromise in protecting the cultural significance of the site."
