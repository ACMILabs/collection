    "description": [
        "One of 12 minidocos about blokes and their sheds in South Australia. Des lives and works on his farming property in the historical German region of The Barossa Valley in South Australia. He has a hint of a German accent \u2013 all the more surprising since he is the third generation of his family born in Australia. There are many sheds on the property housing equipment that belonged to his father and grandfather before him. In a beautifully well-preserved hay thatched shed, a vast collection can be viewed as an almost historical \u201cmuseum\u201d to early farming technology. Des knows where everything is  - although some of it has probably not been used for 20 or 30 years. But the equipment is still in working condition and we witness Des using a combination of that equipment as part of his working day. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
