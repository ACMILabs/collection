        "Woollen blankets as the most hygienic hospital bed covering and the procedures for sterilising them. Tests demonstrate how woollen blankets without counterpane are least likely to harbour and transfer bacteria. How blankets may be sterilised by boiling in a slightly acid detergent solution without losing shape, size or texture. The laundry procedures involved. Largely photographed in the Central Linen Service of the Royal Melbourne Hospital."
