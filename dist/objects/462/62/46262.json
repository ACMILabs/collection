        "A film of adventure, armed combat and political intrigue, 'The Man from Maisinicu' depicts the life of a man who tries to bring the calming effects of sound farm management into the midst of the fray. The film is set in the Escambray Mountains in early 1964, then the scene of intense conflict between peasant farmers of the region and the counterrevolutionary bands spreading terror amongst the local population while trying to re-establish contact with the CIA. Amidst a backdrop of political intrigue and espionage, Alberto Delgado y Delgado was sent to manage the Maisinicu Co-operative Farm. When his body was found in a clearing in the nearby woods, an investigation was launched and the resulting story of his last 14 months forms the basis of the film, told in flashback. Cast includes Sergio Corrieri, Reinaldo Miravalles, Raul Romanes. In Spanish with English subtitles."
