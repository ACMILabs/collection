        "Just ten days shy of his retirement, psychotherapist Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando) is brought in by the authorities to help 'talk down' a suicidal man (Johnny Depp), devastated by the loss of his lover. Clothed in a cape and mask the heart broken man believes he is the legendary seducer of women, Don Juan De Marco. The doctor takes him on as a patient and through their therapy sessions Don Juan recounts his many romantic adventures and conquests. At first sceptical of the mans sanity, Dr. Mickler is gradually seduced by Don Juan's outlandish tales of love, leading him to question the fictional nature of his stories and the man's real identity. It's not long before Mickler is applying Don Juan's instructional lessons on his wife (Faye Dunaway). Jeremy Leven's unashamed paean to romance is given unexpected depth and poignancy from the exceptional cast, starting with the ever charismatic Johnny Depp and the inspired coupling of Marlon Brando and Faye Dunaway. Their intimate husband and wife banter is one of the films highlights. Cast also includes Geraldine Pailhas, Bob Dishy, Rachel Ticotin, Talisa Soto and Selena Perez."
