        "The true story of a Turkish couples's flight, with their young son, from the abject poverty and hardship of their mountain village in Turkey to the land of unimagined riches - Switzerland. Selling everything they have in the world to pay for their illegal passage, and leaving the rest of their children with relatives, the three unworldly travellers begin their journey. After initially being refused entry at the border, they and other refugees like them fall prey to a group of smugglers, who direct them to access Switzerland via an illegal and dangerous mountain pass. Despite murderous weather they are sent on their way, alone, their guides unwilling to brave the perils of the journey. Acted, photographed and edited with impeccable restraint, this is a haunting, dignified and inspiring film. Cast includes: Necmettin Cobanoglu, Nur Surer and Emin Sivas. In German and Turkish with English subtitles. Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Film 1990 and Golden Leopard Award, Locarno Film Festival."
