        "Shows the quail's dependence upon man's use of the land, and the role of food, cover, weather, predation, and all other ecological factors have on the survival of the Bobwhite quail. Begins with the spring nesting season and follows the birds through summer, autumn, winter and back to spring. Beautifully photographed and great close-up shots of the quail as well as various other insects."
