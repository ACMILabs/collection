        "Ordet = (The Word) is film that explores the polarities of faith and the journey from hypocrisy to true faith. In a remote village in Denmark, two families feud as a result of opposing religious faiths and their religious intolerance. Old Borgen's family is further tested when his son, Johannes is driven mad by reading Kierkegarde and believes he is the risen Christ. Dreyer simply explores the notion of faith by illustrating the inadequacies of doctrines when pitted against people with profound needs. True faith is explored when the family turn in desperation to each other as Inger, the wife of Borgen's older son Mikkel and light of the family unexpectedly dies. Dreyer reduces the sound in the film in a way that creates a meditative atmosphere heightening its religious theme. In Danish with English subtitles."
