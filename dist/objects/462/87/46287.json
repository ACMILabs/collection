        "Traffic problems in transport in Germany. Planning for modern transport arteria: phased traffic lights; traffic counter cylinder placed under the road surface to measure traffic density and automatically adjusts traffic light to govern traffic flow. Frankfurt has radar system to regulate traffic lights - the first in Germany. Use of television to watch flow and allows police to intervene in heavily congested areas - mobile radar checks to control traffic - construction of autobahn widening of existing roads."
