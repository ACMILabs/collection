        "Melancholy tale about a father who falls into alcoholism after his daughter is killed in a drink-driving accident. Estranged from his wife and fuelled by vengeance, Freddy awaits the release of the killer from jail, giving him three days to live. Stellar performances from Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Houston underpin this searing morality drama that tackles grief, guilt, and redemption. Also stars Robin Wright Penn and Piper Laurie."
