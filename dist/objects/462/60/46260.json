        "The first all-Serbian talkie feature rescued from oblivion by Makavejev was made in 1942 during the Nazi Occupation, a naive melodrama in which a strong man (played by the filmmaker, a real life strong man-cum-Houdini type) rescues the heroine from a lecher and a wicked stepmother. It was banned by the Occupation government for attracting local audiences away from more sophisticated German fare, then denounced after the war for being German-inspired. Makavejev colour tinted the footage to highlight its folk charm. Through a dialectical approach to montage he provides an ironic commentary on the themes of innocence and time by intercutting the fictional footage, interviews with members of the original production and wartime newsreels. In Serbo-Croatian with English subtitles. Cast includes Ivanka Vukasovic, Dragoljub Gojkovic Beli and Miodrag Petrovic Sarlo. Note: Original film directed by Dragolyub Aleksic."
