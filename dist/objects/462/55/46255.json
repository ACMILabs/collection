        "This film juxtaposes Old Order Mennonites and New Order Mennonites. Their differing beliefs are reflected in their methods of farming. One has not changed in four hundred years; the other is up-to-date and mechanized. The film asks whether a compromise will eventually have to be reached between the two."
