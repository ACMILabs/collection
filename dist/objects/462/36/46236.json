        "Episode of Series \"Customer Relations in Practice\". A basic training course for all staff who deal face to face with customers in any service industry. Shows how there is a danger of misunderstanding whenever two people begin a \"sales conversation\". The problem is that the assistant does not know what the customer really needs and the customer does not know all the ways the assistant can meet these needs. Demonstrates with clarity and with humour that it is the assistant's job to resolve both sets of uncertainty. Stars John Cleese. Narrated by Philip Bond."
