        "Makavejev's second feature tells the story of a love affair between Izabela, a liberated young woman from the Hungarian minority in Yugoslavia, and the more conventional Ahmed, who is a member of the Moslem community. Gradually their cultural differences become a source of conflict. Rather than telling their story through a linear narrative, Makavejev introduces apparently extraneous documentary elements, building up a complex and richly allusive collage of a society undergoing a process of rapid and bewildering social change. The film provides an insight into the internal tensions which contributed to the eventual break-up of the former Yugoslavia. In Serbo-Croatian language with English subtitles."
