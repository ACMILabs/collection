        "Set in twelfth-century Japan against a rich social and political background, this is an epic tale of power struggles, family drama, and human frailty. Mizoguchi lavished everything - sumptuous colour, elaborate sets and costumes - on this gripping drama, making his penultimate film - only one of two films he made in colour - a masterpiece. In Japanese with English subtitles."
