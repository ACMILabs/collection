        "The Ku Klux Klan brutally tar and feather three trade union supporters. Sharecroppers demanding a living wage are hunted down and killed by the local sheriff's deputies. This film vividly re-enacts these and other actual events, and blends them with documentary footage and narration and songs by Paul Robeson into a call for a social revolution. Hurwitz lost possession of the film during the McCarthy trials. Attempts were even made by the US Government to have the original negatives destroyed - but the film survived, returning to circulation in 1974."
