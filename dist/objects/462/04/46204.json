        "Episode of Series \"Problems in Supervision\". It is vitally necessary for the placement-specialist for blind workers to check up on the tyupes of jobs available, and the safety factors of each particular job. When a blind worker is placed in a job, the placement-specialist must see that the job foreman understands the important things to remember when supervising the work of a blind worker, or when explaining a process to them."
