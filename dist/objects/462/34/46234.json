        "India as a land of young, exciting ideas on democracy, outgrowing its ancient patterns of caste and custom. How programs in agriculture, industry and education are geared to raise the nation's standard of living. The reasons for the present views of Indian people, their changing attitudes and their hopes for the future. The US Ambassador to India, Mr Chester Bowles, is seen talking to the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Nehru, and discussing the village development program with a young government worker; the economic race between democratic India and Communist China; the legacy of Ghandi; and concludes with three men active in Indian government and public affairs giving their views on India's problems and reaffirming their faith in democratic methods for their solution."
