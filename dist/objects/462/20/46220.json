        "Teenager Jamie Gangel (Glenn Berry) shares a council flat in South London with his extroverted but warm hearted bar tender mother, Sandra (Linda Henry). Jamie is a quiet and introverted student, victimised by his school mates for being a homosexual, and frustrated by his mother in yet another relationship. On either side of them live Jamie's abused school mate Ste (Scott Neal), and the delinquent, Mother Cass afficionado, Leah (Tameka Empson). When Ste runs to the Gangel's after another bout of abuse he finds himself sharing a room with Jamie, and soon begins to question his sexual identity when Jamie reveals that he is queer. In the small confines of the council flats the close knit neighbourhood find out as much about themselves as the new relationship that's going on separated by the thin fibro walls."
