        "The Potato Seed Certification Scheme operated by the Tasmanian Department of Agriculture. Plants grown at the Tewksbury Potato Station are continuously tested for infection, and healthy seed is supplied to seed growers whose farms are inspected regularly. The certified seed which they produce carries a tag on the bag which guarantees its freedom from infection. This scheme is responsible for a rise from 2.1/2 to 4 tons per acre in Tasmania's average yield of potatoes to the acre."
