        "Dissatisfied with his position in society, John Trimble heeds the dim image of Evil in his mind and embezzles some money; fakes his death and travels the world under an assumed name, becoming an opium addict in Hong Kong. His wife remarries a man who becomes the state governor. He returns home to see his dying mother and is arrested for his own murder under his assumed identity. Knowing that a public revelation of the truth would ruin his wife's happiness, he listens to the whispering chorus of his conscience and allows himself to be executed. Cast includes Raymond Hatton, Kathlyn Williams, Elliott Dexter."
