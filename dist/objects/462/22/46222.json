        "In his first full length feature film, Elmo learns the value of sharing and friendship, with a little help from the Sesame Street gang. When his best friend - a blue blanket, is blown into Grouchland, Elmo sees no choice but to go down and rescue it himself. Arriving in Grouchland, he finds his blanket has been stolen by the evil Huxley (Mandy Patinkin). He sets out on a mission to rescue his blanket, while Big Bird, Oscar and the rest of the Sesame Street gang try to rescue their little red friend."
