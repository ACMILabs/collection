        "The Australian crawl stroke is demonstrated and compared with other styles used in free style swimming. A series of re-enactments, using champions of the past and present, (Beaurepaire and Charlton) show the developments of the style from its first known use in Australia by Wickham. The film also demonstrates variations on the crawl stroke."
