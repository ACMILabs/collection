        "This is a survey of the career of writer-director Preston Sturges tracing the highs and lows of his life illuminated with clips from his films and extracts from interviews with Eddie Bracken, Betty Hutton, Joel McCrea, Paul Schrader, Andrew Sarris and others. Sturges is acknowledged as Hollywood's first ironist whose satires of American mores skillfully outwitted the Hays code. Clips featured are from \"The Great McGinty (1940)\", \"Sullivan's travels (1941), \"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek\" (1944), \"Hail the conquering hero\" (1944), \"The Beautiful blond from bashful bend\" (1949), plus many more. Narrated by Fritz Weaver."
