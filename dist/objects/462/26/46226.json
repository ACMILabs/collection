        "This film version of John Irving's novel \"The World According to Garp\" brilliantly captures the quirky spirit of the original story. T.S. Garp is the illegitimate child of unorthodox feminist Jenny Fields. Every effort made by Jenny to broaden Garp's outlook on life crams more fears and phobias into his psyche. Aspiring to become a novelist, Garp succeeds in this goal at the same time that his mother achieves fame through the publishing of her first feminist manifesto. Though successful and happily married to his college sweetheart, Garp remains envious of his fearless mother. Cast includes: Robin Williams, Mary Beth Hurt, Glenn Close and John Lithgow."
