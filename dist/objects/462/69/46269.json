        "A light romantic comedy based on Elinor Glyn's widely read novella, which provided a popular showcase for Clara Bow's talent. As a salesgirl with Glyn's magnetic 'It' quality, she attracts the eligible store owner. Without straying far from the straight and narrow, Bow's upwardly-mobile working class flapper manages to combine an unselfconscious sensuality, wit and charm with a hint of wildness. Cast includes Clara Bow, Antonio Moreno, William Austin, Gary Cooper and Elinor Glyn."
