        "A young woman from a farm near Roen in France marries her local physician. A glimpse of high society living is experienced by Emma when they are invited to a ball. She cherishes this evening, remembering it as the best time of her life. The memory fades quickly however, and reality doesn't match her high expectations of living. Growing tired of her inattentive husband and her burdensome child, she tries to push her drab life aside, looking elsewhere for love, excitement and a risque liaison. Secretly she carries out her double life, her debt increasing to keep her high living alive. She gives her all, but in return she's not given enough. Cast includes Isabelle Huppert, Jean-Francois Balmer, Christophe Malavoy and Jean Yanne. In French with English subtitles. Based on the well known novel by Gustave Flaubert."
