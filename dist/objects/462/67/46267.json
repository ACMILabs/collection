        "'Schoolboy, Sailor, Saint' is a compilation of three short films (Saint, Particularly now, In spring and Sailor) from Belguim film maker Bavo Defurne, which explore gay desire, while paying homage to artists such as Jean Genet, Herbert List and Pierre and Gilles. Shot on b/w super-8 and using little sound, 'Saint' (1996) is both an indirect tribute to Genet's homoerotic classic, \"Un Chant d'Amore\", and a meditation on the violent death of Saint Sebastian. 'Particularly now, in Spring' (1995) is an idealised vision of youth which recounts a seventeen year old boy's optimistic musings about his future, and the friendships he has forged with the boys at his sports club. The films visual style is influenced by pre-war German art, and by gay Jewish photographer Herbert List. The final film, 'Sailor' (1997) is a simply told tale of a boy's yearning and unrequited love for a sailor, whose adventures at sea are imagined by the wistful boy. Shot on video, 'Sailor's' vibrant colours and highly stylised backdrops recall the luscious, camp archetypes of gay artists Pierre and Gilles. Cast includes: (Saint) Olaf Nollen, Alex van Stratum (Particularly now, in spring) Olaf Nollen (Sailor) Joram Schurmans, Tom de With."
