        "Episode of Series \"Time watch\". Between the sixteenth and nineteenth century, 12,000 million Africans were sold as slave labour. The sheer number of people made it the biggest example of forced migration. Accompanying a tour of African Americans tracing their painful past, this documentary postulates that the Trans-Atlantic slave trade was only made possible by the existence of a prolific slave trade already in Africa. This resulted in the formation of mutually beneficial partnerships between Europeans and Africans. Europe and America would benefit in the long term from the arrangement, but West Africa would be left with little, only a guilt which is often not acknowledged. Narrated by Josette Simon."
