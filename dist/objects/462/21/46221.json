        "This World War II comedy drama finds a quartet of American soldiers attempting to steal 16 million dollars in gold bullion from the Nazis. A captured German officer reveals the location of the precious metal, and Kelly recruits Big Joe, Crapgame and tank operator Oddball for the heist. Battlefield violence combines with humour and drama as the four break through enemy lines and go for the gold. General Colt is the livid commander who soon realises the men have broken through a seemingly impenetrable line of defending Nazis. Cast includes: Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Carroll O'Connor and Donald Sutherland."
