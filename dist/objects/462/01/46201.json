        "Russ Yuristy, the funky sculptor from Silton, Saskatchewan, has just finished a wooden buffalo commissioned by the city councillors of Swift Current. This film is about Yuristy's three-ton buffalo, its 240-kilometer trip from studio to park, and the comments of the bystanders who react to the buffalo's unusual looks. This light-hearted film shows one of the Prairies' most unusual artists."
