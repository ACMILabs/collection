        "Set in the outskirts of Paris, \"Clubbed to death\" offers a fresh perspective of the rave culture by setting it's story amongst the Arab and African immigrant community that populate these poorer suburbs and vibrant dance scene. Elodie Bouchez ('Dream life of angels'(1998), 'Wild reeds' (1994)) plays Lola, a 20 year-old club kid who falls asleep on the bus home one night and wakes to find herself in the middle of a popular night spot where local Arab and African teenagers go to party. On this eventful evening Lola pops an E and meets and falls in love with a boxer called Emir (Roschdy Zem). Like Alice in wonderland finding herself on the other side of the rabbit hole, the drugged out Lola must overcome various obstacles and opponents before she can be with her man. Her biggest hurdle's are Emir's vampy girlfriend and club podium dancer Saida (Beatrice Dalle), whose love for him borders on the obsessive, and Emir's own struggle with heroin addiction. Director Yolande Zauberman chooses to treat this twilight world in a naturalistic, unflashy way through the use of hand held camera but heightens the visuals and narrative through the impressive electronic soundtrack which includes dance artists such as Massive Attack, Daft Punk and the Chemical Brothers. In French with English subtitles. Cast also includes Richard Courchet, Gerald Thomassin and Julie Bataille."
