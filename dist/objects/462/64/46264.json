        "Frank Lloyd Wright tells the story of one of the most intriguing figures of this time, a man whose extraordinary life and revolutionary designs offer insights into both the history of architecture and the broader sweep of history from the 1860s to the 1950s. There have been few artistic geniuses as inspirational as Frank Lloyd Wright. His often flamboyant buildings, and always flamboyant personality, have an immediate appeal, startling us with the imaginative possibilities of architecture as a liberating force that can transform lives, are as fresh and relevant today as ever. The documentary presents the many complex sides of Wright's work, life and the times in which he lived. It is the first major film biography film to take full advantage of the newly opened Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation archives. Narrated by Edward Herrmann. Further information and educational resources are available from the PBS (TV) web site, http://www.pbs.org/flw/ (Accessed June 2000)."
