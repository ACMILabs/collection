        "The nature of the Si-Ro-Set process and how it is carried out commercially. Dr. A.J. Farnsworth of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Organization explains the effect of the process on the wool molecule and how the desirable qualities of wool remain unaltered. The process consists of spraying a solution on garments before steam pressing and baking. The equipment needed, precautions during operation, and the variety of pure woollen goods which may be permanently creased or pleated. Commentary by James Dibble."
