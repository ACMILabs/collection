        "Oliver Stone's breakthrough as a director, and based on his first-hand experience, \"Platoon\" is a brutally realistic look at a young soldier's tour of duty in Vietnam. Chris Taylor is a college student who quits school to volunteer for the Army. After a few weeks at war however, he begins to see the naivete of his views of the war. He quickly discovers that he must do battle with not only the Viet Cong, but also the gnawing fear, physical exhaustion and the intense anger growing within him. Cast includes: Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, Forest Whitaker and John McGinley."
