        "The final episode in this series studies twins to look at issues such as the predisposition to phobias, mental illness, crime, and intelligence. Are these areas related to genetics or environment? Follows twin women in America who undergo plastic surgery so they can remain looking the same despite their different rates of aging, briefly looks at the most infamous of criminal twins, the Krays, and speaks to an incarcerated youth who says that his twin brother committed the crime. Presented by Robert Winston."
