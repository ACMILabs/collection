        "Robert Duvall wrote, directed and stars in this tale of a deeply troubled Southern Pentecostal preacher, Sonny, which explores issues of spirituality and faith. Sonny is a gifted preacher much loved by his community, but after he loses control and commits a crime of passion, he is forced to flee from the law. Settling in the small town of Bay Boutte, he adopts a new identity and sets out on a new mission - to find the road to redemption. Cast includes: Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, Miranda Richardson, Todd Allen and Billy Bob Thornton."
