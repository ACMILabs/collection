        "An account of the Si-Ro-Set Process for setting durable creases and pleats in wool fabrics. The commercial application of the Si-Ro-Set solution with hand spray guns and semi-automatic spray units is demonstrated, also the steam pressing of treated garments in a large clothing factory. The film was released in 1958 when the then new process was released to the clothing trade."
