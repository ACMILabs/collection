        "Hitchcock's first film for British International pictures is a foray into virtuoso camera moves, odd angles, ingenious narrative devices and several expressionistic point-of-view sequences. The end result is a love triangle story given the unique Hitchcock treatment. Up and coming boxer, 'One Round' Jack Sander suspects his wife, Nelly's attentions are drifting to those of another - rival champion, Bob Corby. Whereas Sander is young and self assured, Corby is sophisticated and socially aware - attributes that appeal to the young wife, who leaves her husband for him. The film culminates in a showdown between Round One and Corby, the watchful eyes of Nelly on those she has loved and must choose between. The film's title has several applications - the marriage band, the boxing ring and the secret bracelet from a tryst. The film has been praised for it's ability to capture social detail, as well as using expressionist visual devices to convey a character's state of mind (Geoff Andrew). Note: The film has been digitally mastered and features a new music score composed by Neil Brand. Cast includes Carl Brisson, Lilian Hall Davis, Ian Hunter, Forrester Harvey and Gordon Harker."
