        "An inventive and funny documentary that looks at various types of collections. Reg collects spark plugs and Margot collects frogs. Even more interesting are the collectors. There is a thriving sub-culture of 'object hunters' out there, attending swap meets and fetes in search of that ' gem '. Some say it's all in the chase while others prefer the find!"
