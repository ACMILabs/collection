        "Another of John Whitney's important investigations into technology and the moving image, this particularly geometric animated abstraction uses industrial computers to render Whitney's light musical forms onto the screen. Computer generated forms evolve, merge and subdivide on a black background, each motion and movement as carefully orchestrated and synthesised as the accompanying music."
