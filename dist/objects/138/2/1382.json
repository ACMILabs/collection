    "description": [
        "Haunted by the dogs of his childhood, Dennis Tupicoff tries to explain his feelings about dogs to his 4 year old daughter. Dennis and his brothers grew up in Darra, then an industrial suburb of Brisbane where every household seemed to have a dog. Some were friends who shared their lives and explorations while others were \"hounds from hell\" prowling though the neighbourhood. The Darra Dogs is a memorial to the mortal terrors of childhood, the sadness of death and loss and, of course, to the dogs themselves."
