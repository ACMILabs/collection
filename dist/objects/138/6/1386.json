        "An early example of computer generated animation; several hundred dots move about the screen according to a set of instructions in a graphics program which were input into a IBM digital computer and coloured by an optical printer. 'Action sequences, proceeding from order to disorder and back to ordered patterning, suggest a parallel to harmonic phenomena of the musical scale ... The effect is to subtly generate and resolve tension - which is similar to the primary emotional power of music composition' (John Whitney)."
