        "A busy intersection in a large city. Everyone is going about their own business - waiting to cross the road, minding their children...A jay-walker is run over by a courier van. How fast can the city heal itself? 'Code blue' is a tightly directed and beautifully paced film which has screened at over 20 festivals throughout the world. The film's blue tones help to create a tense and emotive ten minute journey through a fast city."
