        "In this documentary film exploring his working processes, John Whitney explains some of the techniques and philosophies involved in programming and animating his computer-made abstract films. He attempts to define his new art of 'motion graphics' by comparison with music and language. As well as an intriguing investigation into his work, this film is a visual feast of his remarkable dynamic abstractions."
