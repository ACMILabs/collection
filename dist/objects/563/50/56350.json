        "Looks at the work of the Pigbel Foundation in counteracting and preventing the spread of the pigbel disease which affects the intestines of New Guinea villagers. Shows how the poor diet of the people, inadequate hygiene and the sudden intake of pigmeat during festivals combine to trigger off the disastrous proliferation of the pigbel organism, particularly in young children. Suitable for Upper Secondary level students. No other credits available."
