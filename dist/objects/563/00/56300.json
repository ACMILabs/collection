        "Edwardian England, a boarded-up mansion and rumours of ghosts provide some of the necessary ingredients for this compelling suspense film based on two short stories - \"Nobody's House\" by A.M. Burrage and \"The Middle Toe of the Right Foot\" by Ambrose Bierce. A man who is seeking vindication of the man suspected of killing his bride shuts himself in the wedding room and confronts the ghosts of the bride."
