        "Illustrates behind the scenes story of how Kilgore College in Texas creates the nationally known drill team, The Rangerettes, which smiles its way through the half-time interval at college football games. Useful as a study of group dynamics, mass hysteria and the 1960s - 70s stereotyped view of the female image. Suitable for upper secondary level."
