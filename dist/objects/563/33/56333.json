        "Using a combination of animation and documentary techniques, filmmaker Caroline Leaf has created an easygoing mood in this informal portrait of the acclaimed singer-songwriters from Quebec. Highlights of the film include excerpts from their dibut concert at Carnegie Hall; a look at the songwriting/recording process, McGarrigle style; and conversations with the sisters, their supporters, and their critics."
