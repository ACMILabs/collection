        "An animated interpretation of Christmas Day in the trenches in 1914 when both sides declared a truce until 4.30 pm. They shared food and songs and played soccer together and repeated the truce again on December 26th. The film raises the issue of killing and war and how the soldiers did not want to kill each other, but that they were acting under orders of their respective Armies. Based on an extract from the diary of Captain Hulse who was later killed in action on March 25th 1915. Suitable for secondary school level."
