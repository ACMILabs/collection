        "The 1983 Singapore International Kite Festival provided a venue for kite enthusiasts from all over the world. This film features some of the entries, including traditional eastern kites and more innovative designs such as the world's largest kite which required a huge army truck as an anchor. Also takes a brief historical look at the kite and people's fascination with it."
