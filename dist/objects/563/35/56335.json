        "Everyone ponders how he or she will face the knowledge of certain and imminent death. This animated film shows the reactions of one individual whose doctor has just told him that he has only a short time to live. In a terse and sometimes humorous dialogue with his doctor, Nesbitt Spoon runs the gamut of emotions commonly experienced by people trying to deal with this devastating situation."
