        "A study of Oscar, thirteen, who lives at 13000 feet on the Peruvian altipiano. He is an active member of his community and is shown tending the village sheep, planting seedlings, spinning wool and harvesting the family's potatoes. Shows the poverty and barren nature of the land and the lack of variety in the diet of the peasant farmer."
