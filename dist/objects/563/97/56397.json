Jackson, who started working at a photographic studio at the age of fifteen, was also involved in recording the daily camp life during the Civil War. He worked his way to California on a wagon train, arriving in Los Angeles when it was a town of 5,000 people, where he eventually setup his own photographic studio. Includes a demonstration of wet plate photographic process. Narrated by Burgess Meredith and Lowell Thomas. Writen by Kay Eldridge. original music by MAry Martin."
