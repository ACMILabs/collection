        "Follows the members of Circus Oz on a six week country tour. Performances and rehearsals are juxtaposed with interviews and scenes of the back-breaking effort that goes into keeping the show on the road. Reveals the performers as being dedicated to their skills, and commited to a philosophy which precludes any hierarchical structure or discrimination on the grounds of sex or ability. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
