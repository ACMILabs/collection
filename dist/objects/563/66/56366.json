        "On a tour of the US and at home in his Moscow appartment, Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko struggles with the responsibilities traditionally contigent on his country's writers; custodians of the public conscience and witnesses to the naked tragedy of life in a hostile physical environement and under a succession of autocratic regimes. Yevtushenko is both the gentle melancholy writer and the powerful and charismatic poet-performer; the film captures this duality in his impassioned readings of the poems 'Babi Yar', 'Prologue' and 'Bratski Station'. A hauntingly beautiful portrait of this fine Russian poet."
