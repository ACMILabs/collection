        "This program deals with the importance of forest preservation in all parts of the world as they are the life support systems for tree dwelling animals. By saving the trees we are also savings the various species which inhabit them. Groups of monkeys, apes and primative lemurs at the Royal Melbourne Zoo are intimately observed feeding, caring for their young, grooming and communicating with each other. These primates are contrasted with Australia's tree dwelling animals - the koala, lace monitor, the grey- headed fruit bat and the green tree frog. Photographed by Frank Few and Rob McCubbin, edited by Robert Martin, script by Maree Teychenne, narrated by Desley Blanch, sound editing by David Hughes."
