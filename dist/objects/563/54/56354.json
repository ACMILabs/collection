        "Combines archival film, stills and live footage to present a compelling portrait of Mike Swistun, a seventy-eight year old Canadian farmer of Ukrainian origin, who at one time was billed the 'strongest man in the world' by Ringling Brothers' Barnum and Bailey Circus. Touches on aspects of social change; people's attitudes to popular entertainment; the changing role of circuses; and the position of old men in modern society. Narrated ny Jack Palance."
