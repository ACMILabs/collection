        "Looks at the price Brazil is paying for its attempt to turn itself into one of the world's great powers, by focusing on the city of Sao Paulo, where after fifteen yuears of the 'economic miracle', more than half the population lives below the poverty line. Families are so poor that 600,000 children have been abandoned. Presented by Jonathan Dimbleby."
