        "Several years after his release from Spandau prison, where he completed his twenty-year sentence for war crimes, Albert Speer is interviewed by Canadian reporter Patrick Watson. The interview reveals Speer's assessment of his life, and chronicles the rise and fall of the Nazi regime, shedding light on the behaviour of a great many Germans who fell under Hitler's spell. Valuable documentary footage, including some of Speer's home movies."
