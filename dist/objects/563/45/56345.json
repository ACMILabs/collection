        "Episode of Series \"Western Civilization\". Nationalism is a major force in modern history, and national unity has often been forged in war. This film traces the step-by-step creation of modern Germany and suggests its implications for the rest of the world. In 1815 there were thirty-nine separate German-speaking states in a confederation under Austrian leadership. By 1871 a united German nation was born, led by the northern state of Prussia and the man who was to be its first Chancellor - Otto Von Bismarck. Relaxing with two American friends, the architect of the new Germany recollects the steps which led up to unification, which is told in a series of flashbacks. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
