        "Uses historic photographs, early documentary footage and the poet's own recollections to explore the life of Ezra Pound. Born in Idaho, he spent his boyhood in Philadelphia, before moving to England. Other aspects of his life covered in this film are his asociation in Paris in the 1920s with other expatriates, such as Joyce, Stein and Hemingway, and his love affair with Rapallo and Venice. Some of the moods evoked by Pound's poetry are highlighted. Suitable for secondary level."
