        "This film uses stock shots, photographs, and rare archival film footage to document the liberation of Amsterdam by Canadian troops in May, 1945, and the events preceding it. Some of the worst battles, such as the Battle of the Scheldt and the crossing of the Leopold Canal, are shown. The film is narrated by Alex Colville, internationally known painter, who was an official war artist at the time. The film captures the horror of a people at war and testifies to the strong friendship that developed between Holland and Canada."
