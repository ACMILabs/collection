        "Clarence, a black 12-year-old from a migrant family, goes to school for the first time in New York City. Although bright he cannot read and reacts furiously to taunts from other students. At school he meets Angel, a hyperactive wildly imaginative Puerto Rican boy, who misbehaves because he finishes his work so fast he gets restless while the other students work. Clarence and Angel become friends and Angel takes on the responsibility of teaching Clarence to read."
