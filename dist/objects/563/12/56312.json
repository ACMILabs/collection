        "Episode of Series \"The American Short Story\". An adaptation of a James Thurber story featuring Brad Davis, Carol Kane and Howard da Silva. The first man to fly solo and non-stop around the world is an illiterate and incorrigible lout. Attempts by newsmen and high government officials to present him as a hero fail dismally. Teleplay by Jeff Wanshel. Suitable for secondary years 7-12."
