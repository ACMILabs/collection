        "Episode of Series \"Challenge for change/Societe nouvelle Jim Fill, director of legislation and community affairs of the United Auto Workers in Canada, and Dave Patterson, president of local 6500 of the United Steelworkers of America in Sudbury, Ontario, describe briefly how workers are trying to get more control over conditions in their places of work. Patterson says that the worker used to have only two rights: the right to disease and the right to death. However, progress is slowly being made. In two provinces the worker now has the legal right to refuse a job which the worker considers hazardous."
