        "A dramatised documentary account of the failed CIA-sponsored assault at the Bay of Pigs in April, 1961. The operation subsequently created serious embarrassment for the U.S. government and led to wide-ranging political repercussions. Employing interviews with participants in the original events, re-enactments of the fighting and actual documentary footage of the assault, the film reconstructs the entire event, from the first air raid strikes to the retaking of Playa Giron by the revolutionary troops. Dramatised and documentary sequences are seamlessly blended to provide a dramatically compelling war narrative. Made with the participation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces."
