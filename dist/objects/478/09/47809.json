        "Richard Gere is Ike Graham, a big-city newspaper columnist who causes an uproar with an unflattering and wildly erroneous story about small-town girl Maggie Carpenter. Julia Roberts is Maggie, whose reputation for leaving prospective husbands at the altar has made her a local legend. Gere is assigned by his editor (Hector Elizondo) to write a follow-up story on Maggie, and he tracks her down to her home town in Maryland where she is spending time with her family and preparing to give marriage another try. While Ike plans to prove he was right about Maggie, and Maggie plans to even the score with Ike, nothing prepares them for the sparks that fly when they meet! Cast also includes Joan Cusack, Rita Wilson, Paul Dooley, Christopher Meloni."
