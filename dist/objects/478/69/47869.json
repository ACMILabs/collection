        "This film shows the drama of the wheat harvest played out on millions of western Canadian acres. In late summer great combine harvesters surge into the golden fields, and so begins the flow of a river of grain--from combine to truck, to prairie elevator, to grain cars, to marshalling yards and, finally, to Great Lakes terminal elevators and freighters. Grading and inspection at each stage of transit ensures top-quality export wheat; scientists strive to produce still hardier varieties. The film ends with a sequence on breadmaking in a large bakery."
