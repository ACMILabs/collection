        "Motoring authority Neville Hay takes a fascinating journey through the archives of Mercedes Benz and Auto Union from 1900 to the late 1960s. We also take a look at Porsche and BMW as he sheds light on the innovative design, construction and magnificent drivers (such as Fangio, Moss, Caracciola, Lang and Nuvolari) which brought these manufacturers extraordinary success in Grand Prix and sports car racing during those years."
