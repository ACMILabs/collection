        "Blake Heron stars as Marty Preston, an average kid who lives in an average American small town with his Mum and his mailman Dad (Michael Moriarty). One day Marty finds an injured beagle that's run away from its abusive owner. Kindly neighbour Doc Wallace (Rod Steiger) tends to the dog's wounds, but Marty's father explains that they must return the dog to its rightful owner. Marty knows that Shiloh belongs to someone else, but he is determined to save the dog from more neglect. Against the wishes of his father, Marty risks everything to make the dog his own. This is a story of determination and strength, based on the children's book of the same name by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor."
