        "Although directed by John Reiss,`Better Living Through Circuitry' is a collaborative documentary exploring the evolution of the `Rave' counter-culture with particular focus on the American scene. It explores the technological and musical evolutions with artists, Kraftwerk,Genesis p. Orridge, Carl Cox, the Crystal Method and also more contemporary experimentalists like Scanner. The D>I>Y sampling techniques have recreated the means and understanding of musical perception. Very much a postmodern exploration,yet the psychedelic focus still somewhat reminiscent of the` hippie' revolution of the late 60's. BLTC explores how raves and warehouse parties ascribe to letting go of inhibitions,social mores and prejudices of mainstream society. They exist as a communally creative release allowing individualism and the celebration of altered states. The film draws parallels with ancient tribal and ritualistic gatherings. Using flash photic light and patterned low wave pulse frequencies,the trance state generates a metabolic connection in the Beta Brain State. More than anything, `Better Living Through Circuitry' is an announcement to the world that tribal rituals and spirituality are alive and well in an age of technological dominance."
