        "The first two episodes of the groundbreaking television series about Xena, a female warrior struggling to come to terms with her evil past, and Gabrielle, her faithful sidekick. Together the two women roam across ancient Greece, battling warlords and righting wrongs. Filmed on location in New Zealand, the series was created as a spinoff from the popular fantasy-action series 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys'. Highly postmodern in tone, the series mixes martial-arts-inspired action sequences with 'camp' humour, contemporary cultural references, and a wild disregard for historical accuracy. As a physically strong, independent woman, the character of Xena has been adopted as a feminist icon of popular culture. The implication within the subtext of the show that Xena and Gabrielle might be more than 'just good friends' has led many viewers to read the couple as lesbian lovers. In episode one, 'Sins of the past', Xena journeys homeward, determined to make amends for her past sins, but her efforts to begin a new life are challenged by the vengeful warlord, Draco. In episode two, 'Chariots of war', Xena is wounded after saving a young boy. Rescued by the boy's father, she is taken into town to recuperate but many of the townsfolk are unhappy about her presence there."
