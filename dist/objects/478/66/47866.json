        "Smokers say it's relaxing, but tobacco harvesters call it \"the back-breaking leaf.\" Here is a graphic picture of the tobacco harvest in southwestern Ontario, presented from points of view of the transient field workers who move in for a brief bonanza when the leaves are ripe, and of the farmers who depend solely on this crop. A 1959 black and white production. Camera by: Terence Macartney-Filgate, Music by: Eldon Rathburn, Commentary by: Stanley Jackson. (Awards: Cannes; New York; Antwerp.)"
