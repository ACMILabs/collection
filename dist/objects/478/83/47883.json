        "The Cree and Chippewa Indians of northern Manitoba lead a nomadic life as they roam the northern stretches of forest and tundra in search of the caribou that is their main source of food. The camera follows a group of Indian hunters with their dog teams as they move with the herds and at the same time trap the smaller animals of the forest and streams. Their focal point is the Hudson's Bay Company trading post, where they bring their furs to exchange for the few essentials of their hardy existence. We also see their camp life, and examples of their colorful handicrafts. (Award: Dusseldorf)"
