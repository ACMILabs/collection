        "Marty Preston (Zachary Browne) is a well-meaning 12-year-old who adopts Shiloh, a beagle who was treated cruelly by his first master, a bitter alcoholic named Judd (Scott Wilson). However, when Judd is hurt in a car accident, Marty realises Judd may have lost one of the only friends he ever had, even if he did mistreat Shiloh. With help from his parents Marty tries to get Judd back on his feet both physically and emotionally, and learns a lot of hard lessons about growing up in the process."
