        "Nine years after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, a small town in the Pacific Northwest still struggles with the troubling legacy of U.S. policies against Asian-Americans. In December 1950, just off the shores of San Piedro Island in Washington, a Japanese-American man Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune) stands accused of murder after his close friend Carl Heine (Eric Thal) is found drowned in icy waters. As the trial gets under way, with Alvin Hooks (James Rebhorn) prosecuting Kazuo and Nels Gudmundsson (Max Von Sydow) defending him, reporter Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke) covers the proceedings for the local newspaper. The trial strikes a deep emotional chord with Ishmael when he finds his ex-lover is linked to the case. As he investigates the killing he uncovers some startling clues that lead him to a shocking discovery. Based on the novel of the same name by David Guterson."
