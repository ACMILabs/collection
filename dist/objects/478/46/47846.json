        "Kirk Jones makes his directorial debut with a charming story about the small Irish village of Tullymore (Tulaigh More) where one of the 52 inhabitants wins the lottery jackpot of nearly seven million pounds. When no-one claims it the town goes on a search to find out why. What they find is old Ned Devine dead, a smile on his face, clutching the winning ticket. In Ireland the lottery winnings must be claimed by the purchaser - so local schemer Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) hatches a scheme to impersonate the recently departed Ned. What ensues is a community coming together in the hopes of getting the money to split it 51 ways, what they learn is the importance of friendship and the true value of money."
