        "This four part series describes the powerful climate systems that batter Australia and how they affect it's weather, wildlife and people. Using state-of-the-art cinematography, computer graphics and satellite images, each program traces the development of one climactic force and explains how Australia's plants and animals cope with these long-term weather events. Forces examined include: 'La Nina' (combination of torrential rainfall, cyclones and massive floods); 'Southern Exposure' (sudden storms from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean); 'El Nino' (droughts and bushfires from heat and lack of water) and 'Monsoon' (rainstorms and accompanying sea conditions). Also included in this video is a short program called 'Stormchasers' which looks at the making of the other four programs."
