        "Sponsored by the Helms Athletic Foundation, this film gives a history of the Olympic Games, from the first Olympiad of the modern era at Athens in 1896 until the 11th Olympiad in Berlin in 1936. Presents and reiterates the notion that winning is less important than competing well but then, however, goes on to recount a list of victorious athletes from past Olympics. Narrated by Bill Henry."
