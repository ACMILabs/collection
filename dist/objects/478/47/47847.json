        "Episode of Series \"Safetycare\". Despite rapid and continued advances in mechanisation methods, it will always remain impossible to eliminate physical involvement within the working environment. Material handling occurs in one way or another in every department of every business on every working day, so it is not surprising that accidents resulting from incorrect handling techniques comprise nearly 30% of occupational injuries, with the most common injury being back pain. This video and trainer's manual highlights the construction of the spine and its limitations and clearly illustrates how and why injuries will occur if we do not respect the limitations and use correct lifting and carrying techniques."
