        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Colour of war\". Volume 2 of 'Colour of War' a three-part series that combines previously unseen colour footage of World War II with the recollections of those involved to present an intimate account of war. This volume focuses on the period when the war reached a new, global intensity, beginning with the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and ending in the Summer of 1944 with US Marines fighting bloody battles with the Japanese in the Pacific. Recollections from servicemen and female munition workers are intercut with material that ranges from the factories and shipyards of America, to the threatening seas of the Atlantic Ocean; from the Warsaw Ghetto, to the bombed out ruins of Hamburg; from the steppes of Russia to the skies over Germany. This is a challenging programme with shocking colour footage of combat and the deaths of innocent civilians that conveys the terror and fear that were ever present. Narrated by John Thaw. Also available on DVD [318999]."
