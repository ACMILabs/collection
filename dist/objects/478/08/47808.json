Highlights include: Neck-to-knee and bikini fashions; women's and men's surf-lifesaving carnivals; bathing beauty competitions; Beach activities; Sydney to Hobart yacht race (1958); Iron man races, water skiing, skin diving and surf boat marathons. The footage is taken from original newsreel prints, so the quality may vary depending upon the quality of the original."
