        "Documentary on Western Canada's prairies and plains where extensive agriculture began in 1890. Wheat was grown in large quantities and became the most important development in the region. Eventually mechanical harvesters were introduced and cities began to grow up overnight. However disaster struck when for eight years there was no rain and by 1932, instead of wheat fields, there was only desert. Overnight dams were built and land reclaimed."
