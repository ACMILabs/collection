A combination of video footage, photographs and animation are used to present an authentic picture of each planet. 'The outer planets' investigates Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and some of their moons including Io, Titan, Miranda and Triton. Pluto, the most outer planet is also visited. See also 'The Inner planets.'"
