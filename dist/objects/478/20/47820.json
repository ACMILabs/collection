        "On May 10, 2000 in Olympia, Greece, the Olympic Flame burst into life for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. This video follows the path of the torch from Greece to Guam, where it began a two week journey through 13 Pacific Island countries of Oceania. Then, onto its 100 day, 27,000 km tour of Australia, beginning with the arrival at Connellan Airport at Yulara, Northern Territory on 8 June, 2000. The relay concluded with the lighting of the cauldron at the Sydney Olympic Games Opening Ceremony, 15 September 2000. The purpose of the torch relay was to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games to as many Australians as possible and as a commemorative tribute, the names of each of the 11,000 Torchbearers and 2,500 escort runners are listed at the end of the video."
