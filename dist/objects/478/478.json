        "Jackie Farkas uses the extraordinary and harrowing oral testimony of an elderly Hungarian woman as the basis for a poetic and abstract investigation into how cinema can 'illustrate' such profoundly horrendous experiences. The use of found footage, elusive images of beauty and horror and sequences from 'The Wizard of Oz' to elucidate the narrator's memories creates an extraordinary representation of the holocaust experience, of survival, of home and memory, and of how we can comprehend the incomprehensible."
