        "An evening of quiet domestic bliss near the old fireside with Mrs Laurel (Anita Garvin) seated at a bridge table playing solitaire as her husband (Stan Laurel) tries to read a newspaper. However, Stan decides he needs a break from this domestic bliss and it falls to his dear friend Ollie (Oliver Hardy) to provide the excuse for his escape. They steal a bottle of booze from Laurel's wife and head off for a wild old time at the Rainbow Club only to be later thwarted by one very angry wife in the form of Mrs Laurel. A Laurel and Hardy classic even if the plot is somewhat thin."
