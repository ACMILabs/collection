        "An analysis of the emotional disturbance of a boy whose hostility finds expression in terms of stealing. Through the help of a child guidance clinic, this hostility is traced back to the source in the home life of the child where a good and well-intentioned mother has been taking out her hostility toward her mother and her husband in an over-protective attitude toward the child. The film then develops as it describes the process in which the child is helped by guidance personnel in his way to recovery. Cinematography by Peter Glushanok."
