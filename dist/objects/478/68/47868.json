        "Staged in old Quebec City, this film is about a rebel against the time-clock, whose hobby was snaring birds but whose dream was to escape the bonds of domesticity. A kindly satire of the dreamer in every man, the film is also a memorable portrait of Quebec, the \"Grande Dame\" of Canadian cities. With English subtitles. Cast includes Maurice Beaupre, Rene Constantineau, Camille Fournier, Roger Lebel, Annette Leclerc. Written by Roger Lemelin. Photography by Grant McLean. Edited by Douglas Tunstell. Music by Maurice Blackburn. Sound by Joseph Champagne."
