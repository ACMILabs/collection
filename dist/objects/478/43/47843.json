        "Maggie has flunked law school and is working for uptight Frances, who runs a gay bookshop in Vancouver. Kim is a van-dwelling artist. When they meet it is love at first sight. To avoid confrontation with her mother, Maggie makes up a success story and tells her that she's living in a beautiful apartment ( she is - it's just that she's housesitting for a woman who runs Safer Sex With Latex workshops). Just at their relationship is blossoming Maggie learns that her mother and brother (who have no idea about her sexuality) are planning to come and stay with her. This confronting movie is about the problems young lesbians experience coming out and facing their parents (and society) and realizing that in the long run being a lesbian is not the worst problem one can have."
