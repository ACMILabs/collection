        "Smith Ohrig, played by Robert Ryan, is a hedonistic, charming playboy (loosely based on Howard Hughes). Impulsively marrying ambitious, idealistic wanna-be model Leonora Eames (Barbara Bel Geddes), Ohrig keeps her a virtual prisoner in his palatial mansion, tormenting her with twisted mind games while he continues his premarital playboy activities. Coming to the realization that wealth and creature comforts are no substitute for stability, Leonora takes a job in the offices of society doctor Larry Quinada (James Mason). When Leonora finds comfort in the arms of the doctor, Ohrig becomes intent on destroying her. This is a classic film noir story of a young girl's dream turning to nightmare."
