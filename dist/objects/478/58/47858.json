        "Research into the middle years of schooling has identified primary to secondary transition as a key period of risk in a young person's education. A poor transition experience can manifest in a number of ways including truancy, behavioural and social problems, and disengagement from school. This video education kit builds on established practices for developing resiliency in young people. A range of specific strategies related to organisation, problem solving, conflict resolution and managing friendships are described and students are given the opportunity to practice these skills using a variety of scenarios. The video package is divided into four modules- 1. Secondary school: finding your way 2. problem solving 3. friends and pressure 4.conflict resolution. Comprehensive support material with suggested activities is also provided. Educational advisor, Marian Orr."
