        "Revisit many lovingly restored examples of the great British racing cars (such as Aston Martin, Jaguar, BRM, Lotus, Cooper, Connaught and Vanwall) of the 50's and 60's in action again at the world's leading historic racing car festival at Silverstone, UK. The great names of the past including Moss, Brabham, Salvadori, Brooks and Innes Ireland are reunited with the cars in which they earned their reputations and many international victories. Present day action footage of the cars and drivers is combined with rare archival footage from the original era as each car is expertly profiled. Automobile authority Neville Hay adds many anecdotes from his experience and knowledge of motor racing history."
