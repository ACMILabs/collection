        "Based on the novel of the same name by Kylie Tennant this made for television mini-series is set in Australia during the Great Depression. It focuses on the friendship between two 'battlers', Dancy, an orphan who has spent most of her life on the streets and Snow, a taciturn man on the rebound from a failed marriage. Forced to travel the country in search of work, like many working-class Australians of the time, and surviving mainly on dole book rations, their lives are full of hardship and deprivation, but the comradeship they develop on the road also brings them many moments of comfort and happiness. Cast includes Audine Lieth, Marcus Graham, Anne Phelan, Gary Sweet and Jacqueline McKenzie."
