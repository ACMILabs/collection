        "Challenger: An Industrial Romance follows the development of Canadair's super-executive jet. A totally new type of aircraft, it is faster, cheaper to fly, and more comfortable than any other business jet. Would it make it off the drawing board and into the air? The film captures the spirit of the Canadian air transport industry and its attempt to compete with the American leaders in the industry. (Awards: San Francisco; Elmhurst; Toronto; Columbus; Budapest; New York)"
