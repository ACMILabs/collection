        "It is through music, rather than through battles or political events, that Canada's Celtic heritage is explored. Folk-singer John Allan Cameron and fiddler Winston \"Scotty\" Fitzgerald, well-known Cape Breton musicians, are the on-camera guides and performers in this film about the roots of Celtic music. Against the backdrop of the rugged Scottish Highlands, the misty mountains of Ireland, and at Canadian folk festivals, an impressive array of familiar tunes is performed."
