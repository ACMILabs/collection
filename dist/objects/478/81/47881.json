        "At daybreak, while the rest of Ottawa sleeps, a small army of workers is astir, setting in order the houses of government for the business of the day. This film presents a whimsical sketch of a charwoman who knows every nook and cranny of the stately House of Commons and who dreams wistfully of the brighter future her young daughter may have as a result of her labors with mop and pail."
