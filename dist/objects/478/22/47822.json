        "This is a probing, insightful and frank look at Prince William Windsor, son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana, the young man who will be the future King of England. At 18, moving into manhood and being plunged into the tumultuous environment of a scandal-ridden and emotionally scarred British monarchy, is he ready for the challenges and responsibilities that lie before him? This video reveals a side to 'Wills' (as his mother affectionately called him) that has rarely been seen before."
