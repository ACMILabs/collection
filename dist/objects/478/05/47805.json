        "When husband and wife Nestor (Jimmy Smits) and Isabel (Greta Scacchi) are reunited after Nestor is freed from jail for serving a 10 year term as a political prisoner they both find it hard to existence as husband and wife, living in Miami's Little Havana. The community are eager for Nestor to resume his role as spokesperson for atrocities perpetrated by the Cuban government. His wife, Isabel (Greta Scacchi), does not want their lives or their families in Cuba sacrificed to the greater cause of freedom of expression. Isabel has also found love in the arms of the American fisherman who saved her and her daughter when they nearly drowned fleeing Cuba, and like her husband, she too must make a choice between her priorities as a lover, and as a wife and mother. Cast also includes Vincent D'Onofrio."
