        "Ruth Cracknell and Gary McDonald are brilliant as Maggie and Arthur. Maggie appears to be losing her memory, but still knows how to enjoy life. Arthur yearns to be free from the responsibility of caring for his mother, but he's stuck, and Maggie makes the most of it. This tape includes three episodes: The Picnic ; The Last Will and The Cruise."
