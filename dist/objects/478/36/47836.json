        "If you must brand, brand as lightly and as small as possible - this Wool Board film shows the woolgrower the financial loss caused, and the damage done to Australian-grown wool by the practice of branding sheep, stressing that the extra costs involved in removing brands before the wool is manufactured into cloth are inevitably passed back to growers and to the public. Narrated by Keith Eden."
