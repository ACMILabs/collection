        "Looks at the history of China and the beginning of modern life there in the 20th Century, by focusing on the war with Japan. Japanese troops had taken control of Manchuria in 1931 before a full scale war broke out in 1937 which eventually lead to the capture of Beijing and Shanghai. This remarkable documentary covers these events through historial and geographic explanations, including maps and voice overs by actors impersonating Japanese generals. Publicises the role that Chinese Communists played in fighting against the Japanese. Includes footage of Communist leaders such as Zhou Enlai, who became China's premier after the communists gaioned power in 1949. Commentary by Fredric March, written by Dudley Nichols."
