        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Colour of war\". Volume 3 of this three-part series that combines previously unseen colour footage of World War II with the recollections of those involved to convey an intimate account of the experience of war, begins with footage of the preparations for the Normandy Landings. The experiences of British, American and Canadian soldiers, who made the historic crossing of the Channel, and who fought through The Battle of the Hedgerows to liberate Northern France, are heard through their letters and diaries. The fears and emotions expressed by American, French and Japanese soldiers and Japanese and German civilians are accompanied by footage of the fall of Berlin, the Battle of Okinawa, Kamikaze attacks and the devastation of the Atom bomb. This volume concludes with footage of the release of POWs, refugees and displaced people and reflects on the legacy of a war which cost 50 million lives. Narrated by John Thaw. Also available on DVD [318999]."
