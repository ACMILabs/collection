        "From the makers of \"The Human body\" series, this ground-breaking series shows how pioneers at the cutting edge of medicine are shaping our physical future by utilising the body's extraordinary capacity for self-repair and reinvention. \"Trauma\" explores what happens to the human body after exposure to trauma, such as a car crash. \"Spare parts\" investigates the ways of tricking the body into accepting foreign organs, such as cochlear implants. \"Self-repair\" explores research into growing \"spare\" organs to replace human body parts that wear out. \"Killers into cures\" looks at the very real threat of too little exposure to infection, thus allowing allergies and auto-immune diseases the most dangerous threats to health. \"The Alien within\" explores how cancer lives inside the body like a parasite, grows its own support system and eventually overwhelms its host. \"The Baby builders\" looks at the enormous advances in reproductive technology and genetics, which have allowed science to hold immense influence over the evolution of the human race."
