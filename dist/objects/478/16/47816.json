        "In the summer of 1960-61 a team of cricketers from the West Indies visited Australia. The came as underdogs, and although Australia won the series of Tests, they left the country as one of the most loved sporting teams ever to visit Australia. This video is an informative mixture of archival footage, humourous anecdotes and poignant reflections by surviving players from the Test series, one that has become the benchmark against which all great Test series are judged and compared. Narrated by Michael Habib."
