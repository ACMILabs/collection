        "From the beginnings of racing the Italians have been passionately involved with designing, building and racing motor cars in their national racing colour of brilliant red. Famous car makes such as Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Lancia and Ferrari all illustrate the appeal of these exotic machines, from the era before cars were covered in commercial sponsorship. Rare archival footage from the start of the century until the mid-70's complements modern day footage, and automobile authority Neville Hay provides commentary and anecdotes from his vast experience in motor racing."
