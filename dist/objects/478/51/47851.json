        "Explains by animation the nature of a single atom and its nucleus, the way in which atoms differ from one another, and the significance of the terms radioactive and stable. Describes the experiments which led to nuclear fission, the separation of mass uranium for the first atomic bomb, and the mass production of the artificial element plutonium. Explains the functioning of an atomic pile and the peace-time uses of atomic energy in agriculture, industry, transportation and medicine."
