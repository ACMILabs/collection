        "A commissioned Public Imaging project by Melbourne cinematographer, Ben Speth. His extraordinary, meditative work manifests as a mysterious visual documentation of volume, light and time in deserted urban spaces. A sense of expectancy emerges through his still, ghostly and enigmatic images of spaces of waiting or anticipation - hospital emergency rooms, bus shelters, classrooms, dental waiting rooms, car parks."
