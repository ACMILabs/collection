        "'This is a History of New York' chronicles the seven ages of mankind from Prehistory to the Space Age. In the Age of Hunters and Gatherers, stray dogs patrol the streets while the homeless forage for food. Later in the Medieval Period, crazed street preachers pace frantically before ominous gothic architecture. The richness of Cohen's vision is found in this haunting imagery and the perception that the thriving city of New York is really the accumulation of humanity's failures, as well as triumphs."
