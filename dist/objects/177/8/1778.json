        "A young woman sits herself in front of a video camera to document her struggles as a single mother. By the time she has finished dealing with her bills, her children's demands, her best friend's questions and trying to arrange her son's birthday, we understand only too well how difficult life can be. A very funny and very affectionate look at working class urban life."
