        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Why we fight\". An intriguing story which explores China's 4000 year historical culture, it's vast and rich lands, and its most abundant asset - human manpower. Japan's total commitment to conquer, rule and utilise China's resources, in order to control Asia, begins with a rebel ring which masks Japan's Royalty. The psychological mesmerising of the masses, and Japan's invasion of the world's longest surviving civilisation, culminates in the terrifying aspects which may have altered the world history forever. Recalls Chinese development of the compass, printing, astronomy, gunpowder and porcelain."
