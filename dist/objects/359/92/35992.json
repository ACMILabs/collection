        "Episode of Series \"Filmstruck Series\". Oh! The problems of censorship! John Baxter shows, from the days of seemingly innocuous material such as the Keystone Cops to the present, that there have been recurrent problems with Censorship boards. This program, part of a ten part documentary, Filmstruck, considers the impact of cinema on the social and personal life of the viewing audience."
