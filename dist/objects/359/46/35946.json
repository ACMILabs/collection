        "It has been ten years since Charles has had contact with the Marchmain family. During this time he has become a successful painter, and also a husband...although his marriage soon lost its charms. It is not until he is returning by ship from New York that Charles meets Julia Marchmain, and they quickly become lovers. Charles' last exhibition in London is a glittering success, but he is more concerned with returning to Brideshead, and Julia, and does not care that his wife has guessed of his affair. Rated: PG"
