        "As Messrs Pickwick, Topman, Snodgrass and Winkle embark on their uproarious and accident-prone adventures around England, they can't possibly imagine the mishap and merriment that awaits them. Tricked and compromised by the slippery Mr Jingle, caught in the passionate embrace of true love - as well as the snare of a misguided breach of promise lawsuit, they career through the country from coaching inn to stagecoach, leaving behind an extraordinary trail of hilarity and disaster. Rated: G"
