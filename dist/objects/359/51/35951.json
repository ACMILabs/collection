        "As the war comes to a close, the British attempt to bring order to an India in transition. But hopes of a peaceful solution are crushed by forces of anger, frustration and violence. India's conflicts, buried and ignored during the war with Japan, now burst forth with renewed and unexpected brutality. Death, despair and suicide soon become part of the daily life of all those who remain in the turbulent nation. Rated: M"
