        "Based on the Noddy stories by Enid Blyton. Noddy feels he is starting an \"extra special\" day and then finds he is suspected of theft of cakes and tarts because his cap bell was heard at the scene. The townspeople shun him as further thefts occur, but in the end, with the help of Big Ears and Little Ears, Noddy captures the real thief and presents him to Mr Plodd the Policeman. Narrated by Richard Briers."
