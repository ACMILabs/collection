        "Christmas Island is home to one of the greatest but least known spectacles in the animal kingdom: the annual breeding rites of the Red Land Crabs. Every year, just before Christmas, an incredible 132 million of them emerge from the jungle, surging across roads and the railway tracks. Inhabitants find crabs in their kitchens, their wardrobes, in fact just about everywhere. It is a perilous journey for the crabs which must be repeated in reverse a month later, as once the business of breeding is over, they trek back to the forest where they remain unnoticed for the rest of the year."
