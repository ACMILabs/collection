        "Episode of Series \"Miss Marple Series\". In this sinister tale, set in the 1940's, Miss Marple sets about unravelling the mysterious murder of city financier, Rex Fortesque. When the cause of death is identified as poisoning, suspicion falls on the occupants of the family home, Yew Tree Lodge. But the police are perplexed as the only clue to the murder is a handful of rye in the dead man's pocket. However, when another murder shortens the life of suspects, the connection with the nursery rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\" is all too clear to Miss Marple."
