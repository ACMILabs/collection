        "Episode of Series \"Miss Marple Series\". This Agatha Christie story is set in the deceptively sleepy English village of St Mary Mead during the late 1940s. One morning Colonel and Mrs Bantry awake to discover the corpse of an unknown platinum blonde on the hearthrug in their library. Mrs Bantry turns to her neighbour, Jane Marple, who comes at once to investigate, with the constabulary close on her heels. The police follow their official lines of inquiry, but Miss Marple has her own idea. Her instincts warn her that another disaster is close at hand, and when she is proved right she sets out to trap the ruthless double murderer."
