        "The story centres around two devoted sisters, Elinor, whose dignity and restraint represents \"sense\" and Marianne, excitable and impetuous, who represents \"sensibility\". Forced by tragic circumstances to set about the delicate task of finding suitable husbands the two sisters suffer a series of disappointments and wonder if they will ever find true love and happiness. A dramatic adaptation of the novel by Jane Austen."
