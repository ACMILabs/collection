        "In the chaotic and amusing adventures of Samuel Pickwick and his companions, conviviality and romance abound as a festive and snowy Christmas is spent with Mr Wardle at Dingley Dell. But Pickwick is also in deep trouble over his alleged breach of promise to Mrs Bardell. Outrageous misunderstandings and legal shenanigans result in Pickwick being committed to prison, where the horror of what he sees arouses his inherent goodness and tender humility. This is a colourful BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens first and much loved bestseller."
