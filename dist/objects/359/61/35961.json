        "In Melbourne's densely populated Western suburbs huge chemical, petroleum and manufacturing plants have been built very close to residential areas. Apart from the visual pollution they cause, these plants emit toxic wastes. The level of emissions is loosely regulated and poorly monitored. This video examines the danger posed by these plants, and shows how grass-roots community action can be successful in making both government and industry accountable for the well-being of residents and the environment."
