        "Niree Creed presents this portrait of Garden Island, 6 km. south of Perth and the effect the construction of HMAS Stirling, a naval base, has had on the island and on the town of Rockingham. The construction of the base caused some controversy as squatters, who had lived there for many years, were removed in the process. This film, produced by Defence Public Relations emphasises the benefits the base has brought to the local community."
