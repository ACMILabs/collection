        "Between November 29, 1987 and June 5, 1988 the world was to witness one of the great sailing feats of the modern age. During that time 34 year old Kay Cottee became the first woman in the history of this planet to sail solo, non-stop and unassisted around the globe. Her voyage covered more than 23,000 nautical miles across the world's most savage oceans. She was alone at sea for 189 days facing seas more than 30 metres high and winds blowing at more than 80 knots. Rated: G"
