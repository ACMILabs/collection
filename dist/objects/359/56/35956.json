        "Unjustly accused of theft and cast out from a small 19th century religious community in the Midlands, the young Silas Marner seeks solace and solitude in hard work and a new environment. But when he is robbed of his entire savings by the wayward son of the local squire, it seems he has lost everything for a second time, until a young child mysteriously finds her way into his cottage one winter's night, and Silas Marner's life is changed forever. A dramatic adaptation of George Eliot's novel which stars Ben Kingsley and Jenny Agutter."
