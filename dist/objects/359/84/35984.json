        "Episode of Series \"Design Classic Series\". The Barcelona Chair was designed by the great German architect and designer Mies van de Rohe for the German pavilion at the Great Barcelona Exhibition of 1929. Using chrome and leather, he refined the design to the simplest elements of pure form, creating a cult object for those who can afford it."
