        "The Magic Roundabout is about Mr. Rusty's magic garden. He's 100 years old and moves very fast because there's always something to do. Then there's Mr. Zebedee, the magic Jack-in-the-Box. He brings Florence and the other children to the garden to meet Dougal, the lovable but temperamental Scottie dog, Dylan the laid-back rabbit, Ermintrude the delightful felt hatted cow, and Brian the happy-go-lucky snail."
