        "This BBC production of Jane Austen's classic novel has been highly acclaimed for the strength of characterisation and beauty of the locations. In this second part of the story Elizabeth Bennet, the wilful heroine, learns rather painfully that people and events are not always what they appear to be. It is in this harsh lesson that she overcomes her prejudice against the wealthy, handsome and proud Mr Darcy - the best of all possible catches in a society obsessed with marriage contracts."
