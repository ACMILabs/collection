        "Episode of Series \"The Breakthrough series\". In Loving Memory - we meet Mary who develops cancer in primary school, and see the effects that the illness and treatment have on her life. Mary examines her relationship with family and friends and the value she puts on life. In \"Alice\" we meet an Aboriginal teenager who is subjected to racism, both at school and in the community. The effects of prejudice are seen as we eavesdrop on her thoughts and watch her achieve her ambitions despite the attacks on her self confidence."
