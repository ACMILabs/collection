        "Set in 16th century Japan, an ageing ruler, Lord Hidetora attempts to peacefully divide his hard-won Kingdom among his three sons. Then ruthless ambition, evil plots woven by scheming advisers, and Hidetora's own past savagery combine to spawn a whirlwind of chaos. It drives the old man insane, shatters his Kingdom and destroys his family. A visually extraordinary weaving of plot strands from \"King Lear\" with a Japanese folk legend. \"Ran\" translates as \"Chaos\"."
