        "Three episodes, starring Rowan Atkinson as the Black Adder. \"The Foretelling\" - from out of the swirling mists of the dark ages comes a lone horseman cursed from youth by a deformed haircut and sporting a particularly evil pair of tights. \"The Archbishop\" - the landscape is littered with the dead Archbishops of Canterbury. Edmund's cunning plan is to get his deadliest rival appointed to the vacancy, but before long Archbishop Edmund the Reluctant finds life a tricky thing to hold on to. \"Born to be King\" - treachery, murder and Morris-dancing break out in all their full horror when an orange faced stranger arrives at court."
