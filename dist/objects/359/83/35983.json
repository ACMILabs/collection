        "Episode of Series \"Design Classic Series\". Created by a blind Swedish designer Dalen in the 1920s, the Aga Cooker has been a symbol of English country life for the last 60 years. Sir Roy Strong, Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, enthuses about the virtues of the Aga, as does advertising mogul, David Ogilvy, who began his career by selling the \"Rolls Royce\" of the kitchen, which cooks like a dream and costs like hell!"
