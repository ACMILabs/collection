        "One of the greatest works of English literature is vividly brought to life in this fine production of Jane Austen's most popular novel. Fay Weldon's dramatisation and Cyril Coke's direction capture the wit and lightness of touch of the original work. The eternally fascinating Elizabeth Bennet and the proud aristocrat, Mr Darcy, are the central characters in a drama which revolves around a stormy clash of personalities."
