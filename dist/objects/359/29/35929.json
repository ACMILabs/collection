        "This is the true story of Rarg, a land so perfect that the sun never rose until it was absolutely sure everyone was awake. Everybody in Rarg was happy, until, one day, they discovered they were just a dream in the mind of a man called Edwin Barnes. To save the land of Rarg, they must stop Edwin Barnes waking up. Written by Tony Collingwood. Cast includes Nigel Hawthorne as the storyteller."
