        "Police State is the story of corruption in the Queensland police force and body politic, realised through drama re-enactments, twenty years of news and documentary footage, and a compelling narrative. In the final years of the Bjelke-Petersen administration, Queensland has become as close to a police state as anything since the convict era. \"Police State\" puts into perspective the headlines which have dominated the Australian media for the past two years. Rated: PG"
