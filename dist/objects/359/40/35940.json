        "Chaos reigns as one of the guests, with complete disregard for Basil's blood pressure, dies in his bed. Doubtless it was the kippers, (which should have been thrown out weeks ago), that did it to him. Demented and panic stricken, Basil attempts to conceal both the body and the fishy breakfast. This compilation tape also includes \"Waldorf salad\" and \"A touch of class\"."
