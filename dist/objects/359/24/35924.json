        "Cordell Barker's animated film is based on a century old folk song. Poor old Mr Johnson becomes increasingly manic as he tries and tries again to rid himself of a little yellow cat. His desperate attempts to find solitude become an obsession, with tragic consequences. Winner of the Special Jury Prize for Humor and Music at the 1988 World Festival of Animation in Zagreb. Fourteen awards, including Chicago; Shanghai; Quebec; Genie, Toronto; Oscar nomination."
