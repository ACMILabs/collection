        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". Australian boxing hero, Les Darcy, was a legend in his lifetime. In a short but glorious career, Darcy fought fifty fights and won forty-six, and was the Australian Heavyweight Champion in 1916 - he was never knocked out. After fleeing to America to avoid Army enlistment, he became ill and died at the age of 21."
