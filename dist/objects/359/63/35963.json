        "This lavish production of F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"Tender is the Night\" is set against the sumptuous background of the playgrounds of Europe during the 1920s. Dick Diver, a brilliant young American psychiatrist, falls in love with Nicole Warren, a beautiful but schizophrenic American heiress. They make a stylish, glamorous couple and in the carnival atmosphere of the 1920s enjoy a lavish lifestyle on the French Riviera, in Paris and in Switzerland. This brings them a fascinating circle of friends, but rivalries and conflicting passions within the group strain their relationship and take a heavy toll on Nicole's fragile health. For Dick, the intertwining of lives with Nicole ends in tragedy. Screenplay by Dennis Potter."
