        "Julia's husband reluctantly agrees to a divorce in order that she can marry Charles. Lord Marchmain returns to Brideshead to die, and is horrified at his eldest son's choice of wife, whom he describes as vulgar and unsuitable as mistress of Brideshead Castle. Finally, Julia's Catholic beliefs weigh heavily upon her and she declares she cannot marry Charles. It is not until many years later that Charles learns that Lord Marchmain left Brideshead to Julia...and as his memory dissolves, Charles Ryder returns to 1943, to Brideshead Castle, which is now a bleak military encampment. Rated: PG"
