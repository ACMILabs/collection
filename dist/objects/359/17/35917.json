        "Jeff regains his license after losing it for drink-driving. He is determined to keep it this time and has to find ways of sticking to the zero limit. Eventually he is able to meet the challenge of going to a party and enjoying himself without alcohol. He can keep to his decision: \"When I drink I don't drive and when I drive I don't drink\"."
