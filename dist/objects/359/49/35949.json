        "Mrs Maylie and her adopted daughter, Rose, take pity on Oliver and nurse him back to health. Fagin and Monks plot to seize Oliver once again but Nancy reveals that Rose is the young sister of Oliver's mother. The wicked Monks is packed off abroad with his half of the family legacy. Oliver is adopted by Mr Brownlow, and they settle down to live in the same neighbourhood as the Maylies."
