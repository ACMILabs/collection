        "This is Jane Austen's classic story of Catherine Marland, a young girl whose head is stuffed full of romantic and melodramatic notions about the world. Through her adventures, she comes to learn that marriage in the society of her day is determined less by true love and more by mundane matters such as wealth and social status. The high point of the story comes when Catherine visits Northanger Abbey, the ancestral Gothic home of Henry Tilney - the young man she hopes to marry and believes loves her - and finds terrifying evidence that points to a dark secret involving the Tilney family. Rated: G"
