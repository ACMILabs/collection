        "A girl dies in childbirth in a country workhouse. Bumble, the parish beadle, christens the baby Oliver Twist. Oliver spends his childhood in the workhouse and eventually runs away to London where he mixes with a gang of young thieves. He is arrested on his first thieving expedition. Oliver is soon snatched back again by the evil Fagin, who attempts to force him into a life of crime with a criminal called Monks. On an abortive housebreaking attempt, Oliver is shot and left for dead."
