        "The basic theories of symbolism are discussed as an introduction. Edgar Allen Poe's chilling story, \"The Tell Tale Heart\", helps us to uncover symbols and their meanings, enhancing our enjoyment and understanding of fiction. Also briefly discusses symbolism in Van Gogh's work. Uses animation to accompany Poe's story."
