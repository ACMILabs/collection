        "Initiating a new trend in films produced by Documentary Films of India, \"Symphony of Life\" is a blend of music and image without spoken commentary. Through the visuals, the film brings into focus the most immediate and significant theme of our time - the struggle and the triumph of man over the destructive forces of nature and our hopes and aspirations for a better tomorrow. Musical score by V. Shirali, recorded by P. K. Vishwanath. Images by T. A. Abraham edited by N. D. Keluskar."
