        "This program describes in some detail money supply and the institutions which are concerned in it; it also examinesa the various constraints which make the control of the money supply a difficult matter. The program was made in early 1972, before the monetary system had adapted itself completely to the new arrangements introduced by the Bank of England in late 1971."
