        "French cinemagazine items:  The cultural heritage - monuments, famous buildings, yet there are other things too. Common objects, sometimes hidden, sometimes buried, oral evidence...a museum of the past that is never complete, that must be discovered, counted, restored, protected, in order to be passed on. The discovery of a neolithic village near Toulouse; the protection and restoration of stained glass windows of the Middle Ages; methods developed to conserve films of which the oldest have only been in existence 100 years. The Research Laboratory of the Louvre museum places its facilities at the disposal of everyone. Suitable for senior students."
