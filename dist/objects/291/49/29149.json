        "This animated visual imagery consists of semi-abstract figures in constant motion. The arrangements and movements of the figures in constant motion. The arrangements and movements of the figures displaying symmetries and, by implication, defining symmetry elements, developed in controlled progression from simple to more complex symmetries. Throughout, the figures obey strict mathematical principles."
