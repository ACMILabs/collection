        "French cinemagazine items:  1. In 1931 Professor Roger Gautheret experimented with the culture of isolated vegetable cells. Today 200 researchers utilise this technique which could lead on to the production of specific substances in industry. 2. A device which allows the reception of a TV channel from an ordinary telephone box and answers from a co-ordinator. 3. Techniques which today permit us to program the reproduction cycle of ewes in a herd and also nearly double the productivity of the herd. 4. Elastic tissues of arteries and veins develop in parallel, the analysis of an ordinary skin sample allows us to evaluate the state of the arteries and their degree of arteriasclerosis and artheriasclerasis. 5. The knowledge of the state of snow crystals and the conditions leading to the beginning of avalanches opens the way to their prevention...by preventive release and the setting up of avalanche disposal points. Suitable for senior students. Guide included."
