        "French cinemagazine items:  Pollution - All human activity is polluting, that is it modifies the balance of certain natural cycles; Measurements used at Lake Leman and the Rhone Valley trace pollution by mercury and other metals; Checking the behaviour of fish allows follow-up of hot water waste from power stations; Two examples of global solutions - a co-operative farm 'rethinks' the complete production process as a function of natural cycles and an anti-pollution fight at the heart of the matter in an oil refinery; Automatic sorting of household refuse and a treatment system to transform refuse into a solid fuel comparable to coal; A purifying plant for waste domestic water, industrial water residue and domestic refuse. Suitable for senior students."
