        "The quiet countryside is always close at hand in Sweden, irrespective of whether a person lives in a big town or in a small village. Thanks to a special law opening up private land to the general public, you can go almost anywhere without hindrance. Arne Sucksdorff, photographer and film director, tells of the fantastic adventures of a small fox cub in the Swedish Wood in early summer."
