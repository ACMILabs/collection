        "Episode of Series \"Visions of War\". Investigates the life of Reinhard Gehlen, known as the 'spymaster of the western world'. As Hitler's Chief of Intelligence on the Russian Front he secreted himself and his files on the Soviets away, whilst he waited to bargain for his freedom with the Americans. His bargain was accepted and he and his files formed the basis of the CIA when it was set up in 1947. The story is traced from Gehlen's joining the Nazi Party during the early 1930's to his retirement on a CIA pension in the late 60's."
