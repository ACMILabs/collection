        "An impression of Sydney, against a background of light jazz and informal commentary. The Harbour, the city landmarks, the children, the relics of convict days; the rapid development of office blocks and hotels in the metropolis; sketches of Sydney's people and their ways; Sydney telephones, Sydney traffic and the extreme quiet of a Sydney Sunday; weekend sports, the beaches and the night life of Kings Cross. Narrated by Michael Charlton. Music by Tony Hermann."
