        "Sykes Williams is a blind, semi-retired musician, a great favourite in the small bar where he plays piano to supplement his social security benefits. He is seen on his daily excursions into his neighbourhood, and at the bar, as he eloquently expresses his opinions on a wide range of concerns. A portrait of an involved, vital human being as well as an exploration of the problems of the blind and ageing."
