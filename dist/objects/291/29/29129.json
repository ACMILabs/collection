        "Shows the English swallowtail butterfly in its British habitat, the extensive areas of reed beds round the Norfolk Broads in East Anglia, together with other wild life in the district. The conflict with human activities, either by drainage of the fens to provide more agricultural land, or holiday pursuits such as sailing on the Broads, is shown as well as the steps taken to ensure the future conservation of this beautiful insect. Commentary and entomology by Victor Bascombe."
