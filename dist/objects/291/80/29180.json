        "Shows amusingly how bad dictation destroys stenographers' morale and wastes valuable office hours. Burlesques the common faults of people who dictate letters, such as:  The scatterbrain who isn't prepared, the speed demon, the dreamer, Mr Mumblemush and Simon Legree. Concludes with a demonstration of the correct method to dictate a letter using a dictagraph machine."
