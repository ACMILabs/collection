        "Beaches are part of the Australian way of life. Every year masses flock to the long white beaches to enjoy the sun and the surf; the thrill of riding a wave can be experienced by all on rubber floats, fibre glass malibous, or body surfing. Life saving clubs originating in Sydney and numbering some 230, play an important role in patrolling the beaches and carrying out rescue. Competitive Surf Carnivals provide exciting entertainment."
