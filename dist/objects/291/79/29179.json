        "Initially, the film seeks to make us aware of the constant danger of being contaminated by poisoned air when we are breathing. Secondly, it seeks to make us realise that the problem of chemical fallout is being neglected and getting worse. Part 2 deals with the efforts of an American community to cope with the problem of air pollution."
