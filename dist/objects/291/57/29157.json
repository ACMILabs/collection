        "Synchronised swimming is dancing adapted to water - alone, with a partner, or in teams. Various arm and leg strokes are shown, both on the front and back; sculling in various ways is demonstrated, and rolling and rotating movements are seen. A team of four put this knowledge into practice with a demonstration to music."
