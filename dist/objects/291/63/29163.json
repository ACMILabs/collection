        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study\" Shows the synthesis of 2-butanone, a ketone, from 2-butanol, an alcohol, as an example of a common type of organic synthesis. Discusses three basic steps: synthesis, purification, identification. In the synthesis, 2-butanol is oxidised by sodium dichromate and sulphuric acid to yield 2-butanone. Purification is accomplished by solvent extraction, followed by distillation of the 2-butanone. The identity of the product is established by forming a solid derivative of the 2-butanone and determining its melting point, and is confirmed by infrared spectroscopy"
