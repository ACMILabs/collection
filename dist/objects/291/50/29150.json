        "36,000 kilometres above the Equator, the French/German satellite 'Symphonie' circles the earth. The two governments offered their satellite to UNESCO on an experimental basis for its 19th General Conference, held at Nairobi, Kenya. The film details the facilities made available, and the consequent benefits to UNESCO and the world."
