        "French cinemagazine items:  Agronomy - general ecology, applied on site to vegetation, provides agronomists with valuable information on the natural environment with a view to its eventual development. To meet the needs of the consumer, agriculture has to increase plant production on a vast scale while maintaining conformity with the parent-plant and this is the subject of laboratory research; as is the improvement of species through genetic selection and hybridisation. Agronomical research in the fight against pests that damage crops, has turned to biological methods that are both specific and innocuous, as for example, in controlling caterpillars. Suitable for senior students."
