        "This comedy from director Jonathan Demme (Philadelphia, Beloved, Something wild, The Silence of the lambs) is a spoof on the mobster/gangster genre. Angela DeMarco is unhappily married to Frank, a low-level mafia operator, and is tired of the mob-life with all the trappings. When Frank dies in mysterious circumstances, Angela decides to start a new life, as far from the mob as she can manage. Unbeknownst to Angela, an FBI agent is trailing her in order to get the dirt on Tony. Complications ensue when the agent following Angela, falls for her instead. Demme keeps the tone light throughout with caricatures of New York mob types, in particular the women with over the top hair and a gaudy aesthetic. Modine does well playing to the stereotype of the uncool, bumbling FBI agent. Cast includes: Michelle Pfeiffer, Dean Stockwell, Matthew Modine, Nancy Travis, Mercedes Ruehl, Joan Cusack, Oliver Platt, Chris Isaak and Alec Baldwin. Music by David Byrne of Talking Heads."
