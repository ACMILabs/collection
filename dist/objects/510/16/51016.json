        "Relax its just sex is about a group of twenty/thirty-something friends - a mix of straight, lesbian, bi-sexual and homosexual - sorting through the complexities of their relationships with various lovers and friends. Tara (Jennifer Tilly) is the mother hen of the group who keeps them all together; Vincey is the only single one and longs for a partner; Sarina and Megan break up when Megan sleeps with a man; Robin is their friend who helps Sarina out. On the whole the film has a comic tone - the opening sequence cautions the audience that when it comes to homosexuality there is nothing to be afraid of. Nevertheless, the film soon turns tragic as it delves into issues such as AIDS and gay bashing. Characters frequently address the camera, explaining their inner thoughts and feelings about their current situation as well as musing on the nature of love and sex. With at least ten principal characters, some are not given enough screen time to develop beyond caricature and at times the film is stagnated by its talkiness. Despite these flaws however, \"Relax its just sex\" is by turns amusing, thought provoking and quite sexy."
