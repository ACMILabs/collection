        "Denys Arcand (Jesus of Montreal) directs \"Love and human remains\", a tale of love and longing set in an anonymous Canadian city. The film plots the love-lives of several men and women, seeking love, sex, companionship and friendship in a dreary and lonely city. David is a disillusioned waiter, who has given up on his hopes of being an actor and has recently concluded that he is gay. David lives with his ex-girlfriend Candy - a book reviewer, who is questioning her sexuality due to her failings with men. The film is fleshed out with various characters including David's confidant Benita, a dominatrix and psychic who is a survivor of childhood abuse, and his new friend Kane, a young, attractive busboy to whom David is attracted. Based on a play by Canadian writer Brad Fraser, \"Love and human remains\" is a dark comedy, which at times presents a very dim view of humanity. A sub plot in the film tracks a serial killer stalking David and Candy's neighbourhood. Stars: Thomas Gibson, Ruth Marshall, Mia Kirshner and Cameron Bancroft."
