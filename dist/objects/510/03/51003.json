        "Episode of Series \"Speaking from experience\". Parents and children discuss the circumstances and behaviour that led to their child being diagnosed with epilepsy, ranging from seizures to staring into space. They explain their very personal initial reaction to the news, deciding whether to medicate or not, the importance of a good relationship with medical staff, the impact on family and friends, schooling, lifestyle changes, and how their children have changed with age and on receiving medication."
