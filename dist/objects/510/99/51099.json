        "Two episodes from a 1989 television comedy show hosted by Julian Clary in which the outrageously dressed, openly gay comedian challenges contestents to participate in absurd activities. Clary also sings and performs comedy skits. This was the first television series to star Clary who has become a regular on British television and is also known for his live shows. The show ran for eleven episodes from October to December 1989. It was written and conceived by Clary and Paul Merton."
