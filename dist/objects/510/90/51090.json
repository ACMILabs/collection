        "This early work by Greek filmmaker Giannaris is an evocative road movie shot on location in striking black-and-white in New York and the wide open spaces of the American West. A gay poet from driving across the continent in his convertible picks up a bisexual sailor and a desperate waitress. Cool and leisurely-paced, the film explores the shifting (and occasionally explosive) emotional and power relationships between the three as they play out their romantic and sexual fantasies with one another. Cast: Stavros Zalmas, Howard Napper, Valda Drabla."
