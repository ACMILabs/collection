        "Six early episodes of the world's longest-running television drama serial created by Tony Warren, and set in a fictional street in working-class Manchester. Beginning in 1960, \"Coronation Street\" cast of characters included the haughty Annie Walker, formidable matriarch Ena Sharples, busybody Hilda Ogden and her layabout husband Stan, the ordinary Barlow family and tartish Elsie Tanner. The sixties episodes, despite their primitive production values, were much more in the mould of the hard-edged, realistic drama that established Granada's reputation, than more recent 'soapier' seasons. This collection features the first episode, screened in the UK on December 9th, 1960, two episodes each from 1961 (screened February 9th, Christmas Day) and 1962 (screened July 11th, December 12th) and one from 1964 (screened December 23rd)."
