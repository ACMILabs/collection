        "Written and directed by Bahman Ghobadi \"A Time for drunken horses\" is an Iranian film set amid the mountainous border of Iran and Iraq. Ayoub (Ayoub Ahmadi) is a twelve-year-old Kurdish boy who is burdened with the economic responsibility of providing for his family. He has four bothers and sisters, one of whom is severely disabled. To eek out a living in the harsh landscape where his family live, Ayoub joins his uncle in a dangerous trade - taking pack mules loaded with truck tyres across the Iranian border to Iraq. The work is fraught with perils as the road is treacherous, bandits roam the terrain and rough weather impedes the journey. Once at the border Ayoub and his uncle ply their meagre goods, along with numerous others, for a pittance. Ayoub's brother Madi is in need of a life saving operation that is prohibitively expensive for the impoverished family. Ayoub works against all the hazards to raise the necessary money. \"A Time for drunken horses\" has the feel and look of a documentary, one that expresses poignantly the trials of a valiant and resourceful child and his destitute people. In Farsi with English subtitles."
