        "Hollywood or bust marked the last collaboration between Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin and the second time the pair were directed by Frank Tashlin (who directed numerous Jerry Lewis comedies). When Steve Wiley (Dean Martin) rigs a car raffle in order to pay off the bookies that he is deeply indebted to, he also lands a partnership with Malcolm Smith (Jerry Lewis), the real winner of the prize. With a new car, Malcolm decides to head to Hollywood in order to meet the starlet he is besotted with, Anita Ekberg (playing herself); Steve decides to join him and hopefully win some dough in the Las Vegas casinos to pay the henchmen after him. The two head cross-country with Malcolm's great dane in tow; they also lend a ride to Terry (Pat Crowley), a pretty singer for whom Wiley falls. This musical comedy and road movie contains much of the usual slapstick that was Lewis' signature schtick; it also plays up to Martin's image as the smooth and charming lady-killer. Reportedly the shoot was not a fun one with Lewis being a difficult and rambunctious presence on set."
