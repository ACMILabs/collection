        "Victor Mature plays circus owner, Hank Whirling, an autocratic boss whose business is under threat of closure from changes to the entertainment industry and a saboteur whose work threatens lives as well as business. After borrowing heavily to keep the circus afloat Whirling is burdened with the presence of bank officer Randy Sherman and publicist Helen Harrison. Moving with the times is not one of Whirling's strong points and he takes exception to having a female press agent. In a bid to boost dwindling sales Whirling reluctantly agrees to allow Zack Colino, his top aerialist, to perform a media attention grabbing feat - crossing Niagara Falls on a tight rope. Humour, comedy and colour pervade the film that constitutes good-natured family fun, as well as consisting of some stunning stunts. Originally filmed in cinemascope, \"The Big circus\" features a star cast including Vincent Price, Peter Lorre and Red Buttons. This film was to be one of Mature's last leading men roles. Producer Allen Irwin, also co-wrote the screenplay with some-time Hitchcock collaborator Charles Bennet."
