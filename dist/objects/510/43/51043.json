        "A Czech musical western that spoofs American cinema with obvious affection and demonstrates how the Czech New Wave film movement of the 1960s wasn't limited to ruminations on the history, politics and art of Eastern Europe. Lemonade Joe (Karel Fiala) is the good-natured lemonade salesman who teams up with a temperance leader, the sweet blond Winnifred (Olga Schoberova), to defeat a local saloon and den of prostitution. With his capitalistic know-how and her ideological piety, they believe that they'll soon have all of Arizona trading whisky for lemonade. Composed largely in whimsical sing-song rhyme with the characters breaking into song at every opportunity, the dialogue and tunes arise from a uniquely Czech interpretation of the American Western. In Czech with English subtitles."
