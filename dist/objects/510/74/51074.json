        "A story of ill-fated love between a peasant boy and a wealthy city girl; a film about the notorious \"Black Tiger\", a Thai rural gang member with a touch of the Robin Hoods about him; and the story of how Black Tiger has to choose between love and the call of the outlaw past. So, obviously, the plot is ridiculous - but in this camp Western pastiche that doesn't matter at all. A gloriously delirious subverting of the western genre, \"Tears of the Black Tiger\" features stunning colour cinematography which announces the film's intention to be pure artifice and celebration of cinema as fantasy. The pleasures of the film are all to be found in the art direction, the music and the photography. It is also a homage to the camp excesses of \"Duel in the sun\" while also cheekily undermining the stoic Puritan heroes of the traditional western by lovingly detailing the homoeroticism that underlay so much of the masculine tension in the films of Ford, Hawks and the great Hollywood western directors. With Supakorn Kitsuwon, Arawat Ruangvuth, Sombati Medhanee and Apiroj Jaisinga."
