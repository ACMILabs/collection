        "Continuing episodes of the original Armistead Maupin's television miniseries, \"Tales of the city\" with some old and some new cast members. Set in 1977 San Francisco in a rundown apartment house at 28 Barbary Lane, the story continues with Mrs Madrigal (Olympia Dukakis) as the mother earth landlady who's favourite pastime is smoking and sharing her home-grown marijuana with the eclectic mix of tenants, discussing life, love and sex. Mary Ann (Laura Linney) and Mouse (Paul Hopkins) go on a cruise both in search for romance and Mr Right whilst Mona (Nina Siemaszko) feeling alone and abandoned sets off on a one way ticket to Reno, Nevada where her life is forever changed. Meantime Brian (Whip Hubley) is involved in a voyeuristic exchange with a mystery woman in another apartment block and Dede (Barbara Garrick) is pregnant with twins - but not to her husband Beauchamp Day (Thomas Gibson). If you have seen the first series, then \"More tales...\" must not be missed. There is drama, comedy, romance, sex, drugs, secrets and lies and a wonderful cross-section of characters that keep you totally involved in the twists and turns of the various overlay of plots. Also features an excellent support cast including Colin Ferguson, William Campbell, Jackie Burroughs, Diana Leblanc, Francois Robertson, Domini Blythe, Swoosie Kurtz and a special appearance by Parker Posey. Based on the novel by Armistead Maupin."
