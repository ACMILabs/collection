        "John Water's Cecil B Demented is an anarchic kick to the bloated carcus that is mainstream Hollywood feature films. No one escapes Waters' skewered assault as he derides the mediocrity that now inhabits the American studio system. The plot is a compendium of Waters' previous film work and favorite obsessions, offering up kidnapping, demented ciniphiles, scathing parodies (the highlight being the Forest Gump sequel, 'Gumped again') and highly specific sexual perversity. Steven Dorf stars as Cecil B Demented, the deranged leader of the 'Sprocket Holes', a gang of film fanatics hell bent on overthrowing the Hollywood A-list and out to \"punish bad cinema\". Their insane plan involves kidnapping megalomanic movie star Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith relishing her role as the bitchy diva) and forcing her to appear in their own underground movie. What ensues is a wild parody of hollywood movie making, while Waters affectionately sends up his own days as a filmmaking terrorist. Cast includes: Alicia Witt, Mink Stole, Ricki Lake, Patricia Hearst, Adrien Grenier, Larry Gillard Jr."
