        "This is classic British humor featuring a compilation of sketches, old and new, from the British television show \"The Two Ronnies\". Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett are two very clever, very funny comedians who compliment each other with perfect timing and an amazing use of, and play on, words. Their popular partnership has entertained audiences throughout the world and this video provides a sample of that wonderful unique sense of the ridiculous through the following sketches: Harry and Bert down the pub; Cinema commissionaire; Ice cream parlour sketch; Barber's shop medley; Optician's sketch; A life on the ocean waves medley and of course, The News. Written by: John Hyde, Spike Mullins, Gerald Wiley. Cast includes: Paul McDowell, Sam Kelly, Martin Duncan."
