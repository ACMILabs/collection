        "Five people from different walks of life talk about their experience with epilepsy. Hugo Weaving tells of how it affects/doesn't affect his work as an actor. Retiree Jean reflects on her life as an epileptic mother. Chef Ian addresses how he adapts his work in a stressful job to accommodate his condition. Uni student Sally talks about what it was like to study, then travel overseas, and primary school teacher Amanda explains how her students cope in the classroom. The five talk candidly about their achievements and how epilepsy has affected their lives. Funded by the Health Advancement Branch of Queensland Health and produced for Epilepsy Queensland."
