        "James Toback (Two girls and a guy, The Pick up artist) directed and wrote \"Black and white\" the setting for which is the New York hip-hop/rap scene. Following numerous stories \"Black and white\" is part rumination on the cultural re-appropriation of black hip-hop/rap music by affluent white American teenagers. Charlie, Wren, Scotty and Jesse are rich Upper West-side teens, hanging with a black gang (some of whom have become friends/lovers) picking up on the language and imitating the aesthetic of rap culture; Terry and Sam are documentary filmmakers (unharmoniously married) filming these white teens; Mark is a gambler seeking a fix on a game from basketball player Dean; Cigar and crew are rappers trying to cut a record; Rich Bower is the power broker among the black rappers whose business dealings draw those around him into dangerous ventures. This film is an examination of the intersection of white and black culture in New York, which uses overlapping storylines to present a multitude of narratives. Starring: Robert Downey Jr, Brooke Shields, Elijah Woods, Claudia Schiffer, Ben Stiller, Jared Leto, Joe Pantoliano, Mike Tyson and Bijou Phillips."
