        "Brain Story is a series of six programs exploring the latest research on brain function. Professor Susan Greenfield CBE, presenter of the series, uses current scientific technology to help answer a number of philosophical questions about who we are as people and what makes you 'you' and the brain's role in this. Episode 4: \"First amongst equals\" investigates why humans use their brains beyond survival instincts. The frontal lobes in our brain controls our ability to plan and make goals. An extensive study of chimpanzees and their language ability is used to illustrate the difference between animal and human brain function and why we as humans seek to excel beyond survival. Episode 5: \"Growing the mind\" explores how memory is developed throughout our lives, the physical conditions to facilitate this in the brain and how beyond 'semantic memory' our memory defines us as individuals. Episode 6: \"The Final mystery\" explores vividly how the brain creates the conscious experience of being you. Greenfield establishes how our daily actions are the result of slowly emerging sub-conscious processes in the brain. (Episode 6 features The Jim Rose Circus)."
