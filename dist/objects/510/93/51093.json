        "Final three episodes of this wonderful television miniseries based on the novel by Armistead Maupin. Set in 1977 San Francisco in a rundown apartment house at 28 Barbary Lane the story continues. Mrs Madrigal (Olympia Dukakis) confronts her tenants with the truth about her mysterious past and her connection to Mona (Nina Siemaszko). Mary Ann (Laura Linney) and her new love Burke (Colin Ferguson) are on a mission to recover Burke's lost memory, whilst in the meantime Mouse (Paul Hopkins) is revisited by past love, Dr John Fielding (William Campbell). Mouse, at the same time, is struggling to come to terms with the fact that he may never be able to reveal his true \"identity\" to his religiously fundamentalist parents. Beauchamp Day's (Thomas Gibson) relationship with his pregnant wife Dede (Barbara Garrick) takes a rather nasty turn with Beauchamp plotting and scheming revenge on Dede. And Dede's mother, Frannie Halcyon (Diana LeBlanc) joins the PINUS Society - a special resort for wealthy women to celebrate their 60th birthday with the help of some rather young and gorgeous houseboys. All the ingredients are still there - the characters, the sex, the lies, the humor, the love and of course, always the drama. And the whole feel of the 1970s, love or hate the times, is so much brought back to life in the recreation of the settings, fashion and culture. An excellent series. Cast also includes Jackie Burroughs, Whip Hubley, Francoise Robertson, Domini Blythe, Swoosie Kurtz, and special appearances by Ed Asner and Sheila McCarthy."
