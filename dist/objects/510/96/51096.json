        "This low budget experimental genre-bending exercise from Canadian director John Greyson revolves around the themes of censorship, circumcision and copyright. Greyson interweaves fiction and fact whilst commentating upon the vagaries of popular culture, with an examination of the history of censorship, raging against the conservatism of the era that does not recognise the importance of historical accuracy and truths. The fictional component of the film is set in Ottawa in 1979 and revolves around the fortunes of three Peters - one is writing a book against circumcision; the second is his typist who nurses an obsession with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau; the third is a sinister presence who becomes intimately acquainted with the other two. The documentary component of the film (inter-cut with the fictional elements) concerns copyright laws and examines how such laws are homophobic and hamper creativity whilst protecting the rights and creative output of the rich and famous. Although this work is elliptical, it provides a fascinating cornucopia of issues from the perspective of a polemicist, presenting an irreverent and independent viewpoint about gay politics and mass culture. Cast includes Matthew Ferguson, Michael Achtman, Damon D'Oliveira."
