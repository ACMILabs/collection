        "'Fast times at Ridgement High' is the seminal \"teen\" movie, one that finds a balance between the obligatory sex and drugs, as well as dealing with issues such as juvenile delinquency, strict teachers, underage sex and teen pregnancy. At the centre of the film are siblings Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Brad (Judge Reinhold), Stacy is quickly learning about men and sex while Brad lusts after her best friend and gloats about his career prospects. Supporting characters include theatre usher Rat (Brian Backer) who has a crush on Stacy, and Rat's friend Mike Damone (Robert Romanus) - a smooth talking sleaze. With dialogue that does not progress much beyond expressions such as \"no way\", Sean Penn steals the limelight as the definitive surfer dude Jeff Spicoli - spinning a legion of imitators in subsequent films. Based on the book by Cameron Crowe."
