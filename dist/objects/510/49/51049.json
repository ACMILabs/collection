        "Written and directed by John Waters (Pink Flamingos, Hairspray, Serial Mom), 'Pecker' is an offbeat comedy set in Baltimore, Waters' hometown. Pecker (Edward Furlong) is a happy-go-lucky 18 year old who likes nothing better than to take candid photographs of his eccentric family and friends, as well as unusual aspects of his environment. Pecker's family consist of: Mom (Mary Kay Place) who spends her days dispensing fashion tips to the homeless; sister Tina (Martha Plimpton) who spruiks at a local gay strip bar; grandmother, (Jean Schertler) who receives religious messages from her Holy statue of Mary; and six year old sister Chrissy who is suffering from an eating disorder. Shelly (Christina Ricci) is Pecker's girlfriend who runs a laundromat and encourages his artistic endeavours. At an exhibition of his work, Pecker is \"discovered\" by Rorey (Lili Taylor), a New York art dealer who promises him fame and fortune. Pecker's notoriety brings public ridicule to those nearest and dearest to him and threatens the integrity of his art. Also starring Mink Stole, Bess Armstrong, Brendan Sexton III, with a cameo from photographer Cindy Sherman."
