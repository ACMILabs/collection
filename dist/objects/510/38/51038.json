        "Episode of Series \"Story of steam\". The history of a nation's progress is the history of her sons' achievements, their hopes and disappointments, their failures and successes. English history during the past one hundred years provides no finer example of this than the story of that great railway which linked London with the West Country. This documentary traces the history of the Great Western Railway (GWR) through archival footage and stills, and the Great Western Society which was set up around the early 60s by a group of schoolboys. Over the years the members of the Society have collected and restored all manner of memorabilia belonging to or used by the GWR to the point where eventually they established the Small Relics Museum at the Didcot Railway Centre in Oxfordshire. Many examples of these pieces are shown throughout the documentary along with a visit to one of the last GWR signal boxes still working. A must for all those lovers of railways and steam trains. Introduced and narrated by Mike Savage."
