        "Josiane Balasko wrote, directed and starred in this French comedy of manners about fidelity and modern marriage. Loli (Victoria Abril) is a Spanish woman who has given up a career as a dancer for the role of suburban housewife. Her French husband, Laurent (Alain Chabat), is a real estate agent and chronic philanderer. Loli knows little of his extensive exploits, bar one affair when he was caught in the act. One day a van breaks down out the front of Loli's house and the driver, Marijo (Balasko), comes in search of assistance. Marijo, a free-spirited lesbian, falls for Loli, who reciprocates her lust. Being displaced in the marital bed by a lesbian horrifies Laurent but his outrage is baseless, as his own transgressions have been revealed. Thus ensues a comic set-up involving love, sex, marriage and a battle of sexuality. In French with English subtitles."
