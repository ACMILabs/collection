        "Directed by John McTiernan (Rollerball, The Thomas Crown affair, Last action hero), \"Die hard\" was the film that catapulted Bruce Willis from TV fame to movie stardom. Willis stars as John McClane, a New York policeman on Christmas vacation in Los Angeles, the city where his estranged wife and children have re-located. Attending his wife's Christmas party, McClane is laying low in the bathroom when terrorists invade the building. Taking the entire staff hostage, the terrorists, lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), are depicted as intelligent, ruthless bloodletters who will stop at nothing to get millions of dollars out of the corporation. McClane is in his element (as is Willis), fighting the baddies single-handedly with one gun, some cunning plans and a dose of wry humour. \"Die hard\" features monstrous special effects, with exploding buildings, cars, helicopters and elevator shafts. McClane is a tough customer who terrorises the terrorists with his cheeky approach and inventive schemes. A classic David versus Goliath tale, this special edition of \"Die hard\" features three different theatrical trailers and an ad campaign featurette."
