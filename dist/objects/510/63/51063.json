        "This is a story about Sidney Martin's Carnival, a small-time carnival in small-town America. Sidney's carnival is going through bad times and a feud between Kirk the Animal Trainer and Markov the Magnificent over Kirk's inhumane treatment of the animals doesn't make things any easier. Markov is fired, but unbeknownst to Sidney and the rest of the carnival workers, Markov has a secret weapon in the form of a talking chimp called Alex. Can Alex save the day? Will Markov, who is totally against the exploitation of animals, let Alex perform alongside him in order to keep his job? Experience the magic of a carnival and see what it's like behind the scenes - the people, the relationships, the problems, the good times and the bad times. Cast includes Jennifer Houlton, Howard Segal, Mark Weston and Trudi the chimp."
