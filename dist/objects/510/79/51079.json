        "This darkly amusing and accurately observed off-beat thriller established Chabrol as a master of the genre. An apparently happily married man has his bourgeois complacency shattered by the discovery of his wife's infidelity. Murder is a sudden eruption that only momentarily shatters the niceties of middle class life. Chabrol is neither entirely cynical nor wholly compassionate in his cool dissection of a bourgeois marriage. This film is the first of a trilogy on adultery known as the 'Helene' series (all starring Chabrol's then wife, Stephane Audran) including 'La Rupture/The Breakup'. In French with English subtitles. Cast includes Stephane Audran, Michel Bouquet, Michel Duchaussoy and Maurice Ronet. The film was remade in 2002 as 'Unfaithful' (directed by Adrian Lyne) also scripted by Chabrol."
