        "In the lost space of an opulent Ostend hotel, eerily deserted in the off season, a young but hardly innocent couple on their honeymoon encounter the apparently ageless, sunlight-fearing, lesbian Countess Bathory. Kumel imaginatively balances the erotic malaise and violence of vampire folklore and a European (specifically Belgian) surrealist tradition with thirties Hollywood camp and comic strip tableaux. Perverse sexuality is located in a setting of decadent highlife which seems to immobilise the \"victims\". Originally titled \"La Rogue aux Levres\" (Lips of Blood). Cast includes John Karlen, Delphine Seyrig, Danielle Ouimet and Andrea Rau."
