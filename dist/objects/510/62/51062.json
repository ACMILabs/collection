        "Made-for-television film that chronicles the life of 19th-century American showman and circus operator Phineas T. Barnum. Beginning in 1883 with an eager audience awaiting the opening of Barnum & Bailey's \"Greatest Show on Earth,\" the film flashes foward to an elderly Barnum, then back, as he recalls his life story from his early days in New England to his time as a freak-show hustler and his ultimate triumph as a big time impressario. Barnum's famous motto was, \"give them entertainment and let them enjoy themselves.\" A stage-musical version of Barnum's story made in 1986 is also held in the collection."
