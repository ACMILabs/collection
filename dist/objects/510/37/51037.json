        "Ski bums: Crucial Mike's definition - \"being able to participate in a rich man's sport without the financial means to do it\". This is a fascinating documentary which explores the lives of ten \"ski bums\" in Whistler, British Columbia, where 2.2 million international tourists visit annually and also where 10,000 ski bums live permanently. It is a choice of lifestyle, of extreme skiing and snowboarding, pushing the limits, of living for the moment and not worrying about what tomorrow may bring. It is also a question of survival and just how resourceful a ski bum has to be to pursue their magnificent obsession. Obtaining free passes, skis, clothing, even food sometimes, becomes part of the daily routine. Most have some form of casual or part-time work, but finding accommodation can be quite challenging. The film combines anecdotal stories, past and present, by Crucial Mike, Punchy, Johnny Thrash, Luddy, Cupcake, Stray Doggy and others with spectacular action footage of them skiing or snowboarding the breathtakingly rugged snowcapped mountains. With some great cinematography and music backing, Oscar winning director, John Zaritsky (Just another missing kid, 1982) has produced a refreshingly honest and upfront look at these devotees of the mountains. WARNING: SOME SCENES CONTAIN NUDITY, DRUG USE AND COARSE LANGUAGE."
