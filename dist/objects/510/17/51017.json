        "Betsy and Arlene are typical American girls growing up in the seventies - they love platform shoes, television and talking about David Cassidy. One night the two accidentally witness the Watergate break in and the next day whilst visiting the Whitehouse, President Richard Nixon ('call me Dick') decides to hire the girls as dog walkers in order to keep a close eye on them. The pair idolise their leader until they witness a slew of dubious incidents that lead them to believe that Dick may not be an honest man. Leaking information to Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward of the Washington Post, these two legendary news hounds are depicted as vainglorious, petty and just a little dim. As the story hots up Betsy and Arlene suspect they are being trailed and bugged by Dick's cronies. Could these two spunky friends possibly be the infamous deepthroat? \"Dick\" is a comedy that lovingly sends up the frivolously upbeat world of the female teen, and is backed by a funky 70s soundtrack. The film succeeds as a satire of American politics and the press whilst reliving a particularly lurid period in fashion that revelled in a gaudy aesthetic. Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams are superbly funny in the lead roles."
