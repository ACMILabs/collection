        "Affecting one or two people in every 100, epilepsy manifests itself through three different kinds of seizures - tonic colonic, absence and complex partial. Using dramatised re-enactments and discussions with sufferers, this short program describes what it's like to suffer an attack and what you can do if you witness one. Narrated by Nina Landis."
