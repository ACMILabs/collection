        "The stage production starring Michael Crawford of 'Barnum!' recorded in 1986 when the hit circus musical was performed at the Victoria Palace in London's West End. The story traces Phineas Taylor Barnum's colourful career during 1835 to 1881, from his beginnings as a promoter of sideshows to the pinnacle of his success after he joined James A. Bailey to form the circus which was known as 'The Greatest Show on Earth'. Featuring 14 musical numbers with music by Cy Coleman and lyrics by Michael Stewart. Original Broadway production directed by Joe Layton, the production cast also includes Christine Collier, Sharon Benson and Eileen Battye."
