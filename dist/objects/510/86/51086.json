        "Filmmaker and media critic Peter Watkins directs this epic documentary on the Paris Commune of 1871, an event following the Franco-Prussian War in which France was defeated. Whilst the reign of Napoleon III collapsed, a disgruntled group of commoners decided to take charge, creating their own commune within Paris, thus forming a separatist government that adhered to a type of Marxist ethos. In Watkins' treatment of the event, he effectively critiques modern media as well as commenting upon the illusive and subjective nature of history. Over 200 mostly non-professional actors re-enact the era, slipping in and out of character, discussing their views on the events they are representing. Two rival 19th century TV stations report on the insurrection; one is directed from within the commune and the other is a CNN type of organisation presenting a sensationalist view. Frightened Parisians are interviewed and argue constantly about the validity of the issues, including the rights of women, education issues, the role of the Church and freedom of the press, as the battle for Paris rages. Watkins' film is a fascinating view of a little known historical period as well as an evocative and thought-provoking meditation upon our media saturated lives and the power of television. Watkins challenges the constraints of documentary filmmaking dictated by networks and liberates his six-hour story from such limitations. In French with English subtitles."
