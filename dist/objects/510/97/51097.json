        "Episode of Series \"Absolutely fabulous\". Absolutely fabulous, the popular British comedy series, conceived by Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French, is a hilarious satire that plays with elements of the absurd and high camp, set in the cutting edge world of fashion design. Episode \"The Last shout\" - parts one and two. Part one: Eddie has adopted a dolphin that she is using to cleanse her aura and assist her in losing weight. Having vacated her room above the bottle shop, Patsy is homeless and turns to Eddie for support. The pair decide to head off on a skiing holiday where Eddie has a near-death experience and a chat with God (Marianne Faithful) about fashion. Meanwhile, Saffie has become engaged to an over bearing poser, Paolo. Part two: Eddie's near death experience has left her questioning her existence and she is operating in an altered state. Saffie starts to fold under the pressures of organising the wedding, and suffers from pre-nuptial jitters. Paolo's parents arrive to meet Eddie, who upon discovering that they are from an important and rich family, seeks to impress them with her charms, causing disaster all round. Cast also includes Joanna Lumley, Julia Sawalha, June Whitfield."
