    "description": [
        "A compilation of three episodes from the classic cult television serial of the 1950s, \"The Lone Ranger\" starring Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels as his faithful Indian companion Tonto. For those who remember, and can never forget the famous cry of \"Hi yo Silver, away\" and the sound of The Lone Ranger theme, the William Tell Overture, this video will take you back to a time when good always overcame evil, and a masked hero riding a stallion called Silver and his Indian companion would save us from the perils of the marauding outlaws and bandits of the West - a time of old-fashioned good guy, bad guy. \"Outlaws in greasepaint\": DeWitt and Lavinia Faversham are two out-of-work actors who turn their acting skills and the art of disguise to the more lucrative business of robbing the Wells Fargo gold shipments. The Lone Ranger, not to be outdone, becomes a master of disguise to outwit these two bandits. \"Hotspell in Panamint\": A plot by Big Joe Hunsaker and his band of outlaws to gun down Marshall Roy Bell of Panamint in order to steal a gold shipment is foiled by The Lone Ranger with the help of Miss Sarah Edwards and her small hand mirror. \"White Hawk's decision\": Rivalry between two young Indian brothers, Little Hawk and Fleet Horse for the honour of succeeding their father White Hawk as Chief takes a nasty turn. The Lone Ranger and Tonto step in to help White Hawk in determining the future of his tribe. NOTE: The titles of each episode do not appear and each episode blends into the next without a definitive break."
