        "Remember the days of the steam-train and the wonderful sound of the locomotive engine? Then this documentary will take you back in history, to the \"golden age of steam\". Produced and filmed in Britain, and containing some rare archival footage, the program presents an historical look at the steam locomotive, including the replica (built in the 1970s) of George Stephenson's \"Rocket\". Also shows examples of such well-known company names as Fenchurch, Stowe, Wainwright and Pennine Ltd which are still running today. Photographed in some of Britain's beautiful countryside, these locomotives are seen winding through small villages, climbing up steep grades and passing through busy stations. One of the best attributes of the documentary is that it contains minimal commentary allowing the viewer to experience the sound and atmosphere of a bygone era."
