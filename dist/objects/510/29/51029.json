        "Harvey Miller is a talented golfer who experiences stage fright in front of crowds, preventing him from playing in tournaments. Instead Miller works in a department store where he wreaks havoc with staff and stock with his bumbling, clumsy ways. When Miller meets his fiancee's brother, Joe Anthony, he recognises in him potential talent and offers to coach Joe in order to win the New Hampshire tournament with prize money of 500 dollars. If Joe wins he will use the funds to save his parents' ailing Italian restaurant. In their tenth collaboration together, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis provide plenty of laughs as they play off each other in their established routines: Dean as the suave layabout, Lewis as the idiotic clown. \"The Caddy\" includes several song and dance routines including what was to be Martin's signature tune \"That's amore\". The film addresses the snobbery and class-consciousness of the golfing set, albeit in a comedic manner. Donna Reed stars as Martin's upper class girlfriend whose family are well ensconced in the country club scene. The film features cameos from several real life professional golfers, including Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Julius Boros and Harry Cooper."
