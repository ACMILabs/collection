        "Video footage of a 2001 satellite broadcast to country doctors through the Rural Health satellite network and \"The Health Channel\" which was also streamed on the web. A panel of experts comprising epileptologists, a clinical pharmacologist and a general practitioner discuss epilepsy, a common, misunderstood, misdiagnosed and often unrecognised condition affecting between 1-2% of the population. Emphasis is placed on treating individuals on a case by case basis and the importance of tailoring treatment to the individual. Myths surrounding the disease are explored, facts and figures provided, definitions, types of seizures, diagnosis, treatment, resources and an interview with Tony Grieg, diagnosed with epilepsy age 12. Also features 2 case studies. Norman Swan hosts the panel."
