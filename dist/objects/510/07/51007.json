        "Episode of Series \"Speaking from experience\". Epilepsy affects 3% of the Australian population and manifests itself in many different ways to individuals, families and communities. Epilepsy sufferers and their families discuss the symptoms they experience (varying from stumbling, absent seizures, tonic clonic), the success/failure and side effects of medication, reaction to diagnosis, what it feels like to have a seizure (daydreaming, contortion, deja vu), how the symptoms change with age, warning signs, the impact on employment and relationships, disclosure and impact on lifestyle."
