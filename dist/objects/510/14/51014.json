        "Bigas Luna co-wrote and directed \"Jamon jamon\", which stars Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem, both Spanish actors who would go on to achieve fame in America. \"Jamon jamon\" is a comedy/drama set in the arid region of Monegros, Spain. Jose Luis is a young executive working in an underwear factory, run by his overbearing mother and passive father. Luis is having a relationship with a factory girl Silvia (Cruz) who is pregnant with his child. Jose's mother Conchita, is horrified by the thought of her son marrying anyone at all, let alone a factory worker whose mother is a prostitute. Conchita sets about scuttling her son's plans by hiring Raul, a handsome would be bullfighter to woo Silvia. Complications ensue all round as Conchita takes a liking to Raul herself and Jose cannot pass up his fondness for sleeping with Silvia's mother (who also has a past history with Jose's father). \"Jamon jamon\" is a film about sex, love, infidelity, passion, loyalty and family. Heavy symbolism reflects a macho culture driven by male desire for assuaging of ego and ratification of sexual prowess. Features numerous erotic heterosexual scenes. Winner of the Silver Lion at the 1992 Venice Film Festival."
