        "Gilbert Woolley (Jerry Lewis) is a third rate magician who has difficulty securing regular work in America when he is sent on a tour of Japan to entertain the troops. With his hapless and accident-prone ways Gilbert offends precious starlet Lois Livingston who is also on the bill, and raises the ire of the military with a series of embarrassing incidents. An aristocratic Japanese patron, who is impressed by Gilbert's ability to amuse her depressed and reclusive young nephew Robert, saves Gilbert's career from obscurity. Smitten with Gilbert, Robert causes an international diplomatic incident by following him back to the US. Even though it occasionally lapses into sentimental mawkishness, this film features much physical comedy as well as the usual mugging typical of Lewis' schtick. \"The Geisha boy\" is one of director Tashlin's eight collaborations with comedian Jerry Lewis (others include The Disorderly, Hollywood or bust, Who's minding the store?)."
