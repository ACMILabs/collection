        "At a peak in his career LA Rams quarterback Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty) is erroneously summoned to heaven by an over-zealous escort (co-director Buck Henry). Mr Jordan, a senior official in heaven, (James Mason) seeks to set things in order by offering Joe a place back on earth in the body of another mortal. After seeing environmental lobbyist Betty Logan (Julie Christie) Joe decides to inhabit the body of Leo Farnsworth, a rich amoral industrialist who is in danger from his murderous wife (Dyan Cannon) and her lover (Charles Grodin). When Joe decides to get Pendleton's body into shape he engages the services of his old coach in order to do so. This comedy was Warren Beatty's directorial debut and he has great fun as Pendleton/Farnsworth. A fairly light romantic comedy/fantasy, \"Heaven can wait\" is a remake of \"Here comes Mr Jordan\" (1941) and was a big hit in 1978. Winner of one Academy Award in 1979 for Best art direction, the film was nominated for seven others."
