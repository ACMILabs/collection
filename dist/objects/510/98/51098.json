Three episodes from series 3 of the popular British comedy series, \"Absolutely fabulous\", a hilarious satire, set in the London fashion world, that plays with elements of the absurd and high camp. \"Door handle\": In need of an overhaul, Eddie sets about getting fit, renovating the kitchen and uses an electronic organiser to get her life in order. Meanwhile, Patsy is concerned for her health and turns to Saffie for advice. In a desperate search for the perfect door handle, the pair fly to New York. \"Happy new year\": Eddie decides that her New Year's Eve resolution is to have more fun. Hence, she and Patsy plan a night on the tiles. Much to Eddie's chagrin, Patsy's glamorous and estranged sister joins them. \"Sex\": Eddie and Patsy reminisce about their wild sexual exploits in the 1960s and 70s; Eddie determines to get in touch with her sexual side by hiring a male prostitute. Saffie and her study group prepare their genetics and ethics lecture."
