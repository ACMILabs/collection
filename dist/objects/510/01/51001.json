        "Voted Most Popular Film at the 2000 Vancouver International Film Festival, \"Divided we fall\" is the story of a Czechoslovakian couple trying to survive World War 2 in a small provincial town. Josej Cizek (Boleslav Polivka) and Marie Cizek (Anna Siskova) are a childless couple living a relatively uncomplicated life until they reticently agree to hide a former neighbour - a young Jewish man who has escaped from a Nazi concentration camp in Poland. Josej and Marie's decision to hide David gives rise to tensions between the couple, especially as a frequent visitor to their home is Horst (Jaroslav Dusik), a Nazi sympathiser who has a serious crush on Marie. Josej and Marie are forced into compromised circumstances to keep their act of kindness a secret from suspecting authorities. A black comedy and drama, \"Divided we fall\" is a well-written humorous, sad and moving tale of conflicting loyalties and reluctant acts of heroism. Complex characters are realistically depicted as having ambivalent attitudes towards acts of selflessness. Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2000 Academy Awards. (Awards: Winner Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best film and Best Screenplay at the 2001 Czech Film and Television Academy Awards) In Czechoslovakian with English subtitles."
