        "Lesbian and stand-up comic Sheila Caston is about to get her big break - her own TV show. But when it turns out her (unrequited) first love is a central player in the deal, Shelia is thrown into a struggle between past and present; between her unresolved love for TV producer Lynn, and for her partner of five years, Julie. In this emotional maelstrom, personal and professional lives slip into confusion and chaos, throwing Shelia's career into jeopardy. A love triangle with a 90s twist this film runs the gamut of laughter and tears, joy and sorrow, hope and desperation."
