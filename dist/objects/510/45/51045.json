        "A modern fable in a stylised setting; the void within the two interchangeable heroines, Marie I and II, bursts forth as a destructive impulse, directed at an indifferent world, in the form of a series of happenings built around particular themes (death, consumption, acting, destruction of meaning). The apparent stylisation in performance, cinematography, sets and music is best understood as subversive of \"socialist realism\" which, prior to the \"New Wave\", had been obligatory in post-war Czech (and East European) cinema. The film was banned for a year and condemned as Dadaist and Brechtian, \"at absolute variance with the Marxist-Leninist mission in the arts\" as an \"official\" critic put it. In Czech with English subtitles."
