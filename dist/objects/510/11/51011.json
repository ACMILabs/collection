        "Long before he released \"Spider-man\", director Sam Raimi delved into the world of comics when he created the character Darkman, an amalgam of numerous anti-heroes. Liam Neeson stars as Doctor Peyton Westlake, a devoted partner to his soon to be wife (Frances McDormand) and a kindly scientist working on a synthetic skin that will revolutionise the process of skin grafting. There is only one draw back to the procedure; it melts after 99 minutes in the sun. One night there is an attack on Westlake's laboratory and he is beaten, tortured and placed in a vat of acid. Against all odds Westlake survives, Doctors remove his neurons to alleviate the pain, and Westlake discovers he now has increased strength with a rage to match. Using this newfound energy, he escapes from the hospital to the remains of the lab, makes use of his synthetic skin, calls himself \"Darkman\" and vows to seek revenge. Making use of the pliability of his new facial structure, Darkman is able to disguise himself to arch nemesis Durant (Larry Drake) as well as reclaiming his fiance from the clutches of another man. Unlike many other superheros, Darkman is not concerned with helping others but focuses on his own cause. Raimi takes great comic delight (if one views \"Night of the living dead\" as funny) in focusing on the reality and consequence of Westlake/Darkman's actions, especially as it is wreaked on his two dimensional victims. Music by Danny Elfman. Cameos by John Landis, Jenny Agutter and Bruce Campbell."
