        "Episode number 24 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". How can psychology aid astronauts in space? How can psychology end conflict that leads to war? In this program, Philip Zimbardo shows how psychologists can help astronauts battle physical stress, mental stress, anxiety, boredom and depression. He also examines the psychology of peace - the study of the process of dehumanisation in the nuclear arms race and the art of conciliation in negotiating for peace."
