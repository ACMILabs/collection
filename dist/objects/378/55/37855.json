        "Using excerpts from Arthur Miller's play \"The Crucible\" and dramatisations of the McCarthy trials in the United States in the 1950's, this program looks at the basic ideas in the drama and examines its place in the playwright's development. Draws parallels between writing and life experiences and art reflecting reality."
