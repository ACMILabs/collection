        "This program, narrated by Ian Dunlop, was filmed in 1982 at Yirrkala on the Gove Peninsula in the Northern Territory. Yirrkala was established as a Methodist mission in 1935, but today is an Aboriginal township. This is a film about the importance of cultural continuity in this Aboriginal community. It records funeral ceremonies, traditional dances and songs. It also examines the special educational programs to inform white Territorians about the culture of their Aboriginal neighbours and to educate Aboriginal children in their own language at Yirrkala school."
