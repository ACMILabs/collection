        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Rainbow serpent\". This program, narrated by Aboriginal playwright and actor, Bob Maza, concentrates on the attempts by the 4000 strong Tasmanian Aboriginal community to reveal that Truganini was not the last of the Tasmanian Aborigines, and in doing so, to re-establish their pride and identity in contemporary Tasmanian society. These attempts include the production of the first play by and about Tasmanian Aborigines - \"We are the Survivors\", by Jim Everett, and the campaign by Aboriginal activist and barrister, Michael Mansell, to reclaim the remains of Tasmanian Aborigines stored in the Anatomy Department of the University of Edinburgh."
