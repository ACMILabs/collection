        "An interview with Australian children's author and ex-teacher, Paul Jennings. Jennings' books have been a runaway popular success since his first book, \"Unreal\" was published in 1985. He has since written \"Unbelievable\", \"Uncanny\" and the \"Round the Twist\" series of stories. He believes books are very important for kids because, even more than television, they can take the imagination anywhere."
