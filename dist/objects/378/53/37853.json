        "Using re-enactments and contemporary paintings and documents, this program addresses crime and punishment in 18th Century England, reasons for the colonisation of Australia, the fitting and sailing of the First Fleet and the arrival at Botany Bay and Port Jackson. The inclusion of a re-enactment of this arrival performed in modern Sydney, includes Aborigines protesting about the loss of their land rights. Suitable for lower and middle secondary levels."
