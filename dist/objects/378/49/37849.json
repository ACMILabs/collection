        "A young boy, believing he is being sent a live fish from Japan by his uncle is disappointed when the 'fish' turns out to be a fish painted on a kite. Having already told his classmates that a fish from Japan is on its way he invents an imaginary fish that captures the imagination of all, teacher included. A contemporary variation on the theme of the \"Emperor's New Clothes\"."
