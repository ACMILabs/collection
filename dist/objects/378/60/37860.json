        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Memory is the connection between the past and present which shapes our personality and as such is of vital interest to psychologists. How does it work? This program outlines some of the approaches which have been taken to unlock its mystery, particularly in the fields of neurobiology and neurochemistry, and the study of amnesia and Alzheimer's disease. If we can discover how memory works then maybe cures for these crippling conditions can be developed, not to mention the implications for educators."
