        "Episode of Series \"Through Australian eyes\". Two programs from the series :Through Australian eyes\". In the first program Rosemary Agostino returns to her parents' birthplace in Calabria. In the small village she becomes aware of the sense of community missing from life in Australia. In the second program Angela Sarantis returns to her father's village in Kastraki in northern Greece. She sees that many changes have occurred since her parents left their homeland particularly due to the demands of Greece's main industry, tourism."
