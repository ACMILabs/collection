        "Episode of Series \"Reading planet\". Prism, a young alien from the planet Reading, has been captured by the Lethards, poor readers from the planet Lethargia, who fear unknown words. With Prism's magical powers his five students from Earth are propelled through space as they are being taught to derive meaning from context. The students demonstrate fluency and comprehension by reading units of thought rather than just single words. Prism is rescued by his Earth friends' efforts and the Lethar leader learns the chant: \"Don't stop, keep it moving. It's the sentence not the word.\""
