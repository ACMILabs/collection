        "A film based on an actual incident. In 1864 three young children belonging to a small squatting family wandered far from home and found themselves lost in the Australian outback. The film concentrates on the children's struggle to survive in the bush and on the search mounted by their family to find them. Based on the account of the search written by Les Blake in the 1860's. Cast includes Gabrielle Bulle, Colin Freckleton, Richard McClelland."
