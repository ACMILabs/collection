        "Seven animated short stories based on the traditional spirit world of the Maori. 1. Pania of the reef 2. Maui catches the sun 3. Kuhukura's net 4. Te hautaewa's run 5. Rata and the canoe 6. Timirau's pet whale 7. Rau Tapu's magic feather. The seven programs would be best viewed separately as seven in a row is a bit of an overkill that causes dulling of the appreciation of the content."
