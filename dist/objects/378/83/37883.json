        "Crops might just as well be ploughed into the ground or left to rot in the sun! From Black Thursday, October 1929, Australian productivity had never been higher, but there was no market for it. This documentary depicts causes and effects of the Great Depression in Australia, using film clips of the period. Shows the divisive effect of the disparity in living conditions, attempts by the unemployed to improve their social and economic circumstances and the plight of the children. Linked by songs of the period. Commentary by Telford Jackson."
