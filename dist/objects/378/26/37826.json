        "Episode of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". For all of us, adult life is full of transitions and turning points. How do adults develop psychologically? Do their changes follow some set course, or is their growth varied and unpredictable? This program examines the major transitions in adult life - leaving home, parenting, mid-life crisis and retirement, by interviewing both psychologists and adults going through each of these stages."
