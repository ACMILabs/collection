        "Episode number 8 of Series \"The Civil War\". The Confederacy is crumbling. Sherman and his army burn Atlanta and march eastwards. Grant breaks though the defences at Petersburg and advances on Richmond. Confederate forces set fire to their capital city and abandon it. Lee flees westward, but at Appomattox Court House, outnumbered five-to-one, he is finally surrounded by Union forces. Robert E. Lee surrenders what is left of his army to Ulysses S. Grant. The Union terms are generous; reunification of the nation has begun."
