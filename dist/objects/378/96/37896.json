        "Episode of Series \"The Biological sciences\". Looks at behaviour patterns and their relationship to brain and nerve cell circuits. Shows that behaviour can be both inherited and adaptive by examining simple forms of behaviour in single celled organisms. Also presents an inquiry that culminates in an open-ended analysis of some aspects of human behaviour."
