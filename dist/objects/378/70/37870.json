        "Based on a book of the same name by Carol Carrick, and a sequel to \"The Accident\". \"The Foundling\" begins several months after Chris' dog, Bodger, has been run over and killed. Chris' father takes him to the local animal shelter to pick out a dog to keep, but Chris feels he would be betraying Bodger. Before long a neighbour tells Chris of a stray pup seen in the area and without hesitation he undertakes a search for the missing animal."
