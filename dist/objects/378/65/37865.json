        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Poor research methods can lead to disastrous consequences as illustrated by the early use of lobotomies without adequate investigation of their effect, and also by Bruno Bettelheim's belief in the destructive mother as the cause of autism. Correct scientific research methods which involve random selection and the use of control groups is illustrated in the applied research into improving methods of criminal investigation interviewing techniques."
