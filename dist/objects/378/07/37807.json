        "The first of this two-part analysis of Roosevelt and Hitler, \"Their rise to power\" contrasts the careers and styles of the two men to show how individual leadership can influence history. The careers of both men culminated in 1933 when Hitler achieved total control of Germany through propaganda and terrorism and Roosevelt introduced The New Deal. \"The Dynamics of power\" contrasts their use of the media to further their aims, Roosevelt through his radio fireside chats, and Hitler, ie. Goebbels, through the brilliant use of Leni Riefenstahl's films and newsreels, culminating in the Berlin Olympics."
