        "The likeness of an offspring to its parents, whatever the species, has been traced to a unique molecule that controls the production of proteins and transmits characteristics. This genetic material, dioxyribonucleic acid, or DNA - the hereditary material of life - is described and illustrated in this film by color animation. Mutations are also discussed. A film for science students."
