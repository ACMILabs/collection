        "Episode of Series \"Video Therapy with Alf Fowles\". Stress is a normal, everyday part of life. People have different stress thresholds and individuals react to identical stressors to different degrees. British therapist, Alf Fowles, editor of the magazine \"Natural Medicine\", explains how stress can affect our lives outlining the warning signs of possible mental breakdown and gives ten coping strategies. A simple self hypnosis technique to reduce stress is demonstrated at the conclusion of the program."
