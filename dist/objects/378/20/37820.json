        "Episode number 7 of Series \"The Civil War\". The summer of 1864 is the North's darkest hour and public opinion turns strongly against President Lincoln and the war. That autumn the presidential campaign sets Lincoln against his old commanding general, George McClellan, now the Democrat's \"peace\" candidate. Even Lincoln believes his re-election unlikely, but dramatic eleventh-hour Union victories change the odds. Lincoln wins in a landslide and the Confederacy's last hope for independence dies."
