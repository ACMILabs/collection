        "Time-lapse photography is used to show slow movement in plants such as the Venus flytrap, the albitsia tree, clover, daffodils, beans, fern fronds, climbing plants and water lilies. Provides an excellent means by which to convince children of something that is not readily accessible to the naked eye. Photography by Roger Seccombe and narration by Gerard Kennedy. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
