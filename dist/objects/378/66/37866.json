        "Bright, impish Lucretia is a perfect angel in her homeland, Hell, where good is frowned upon. One Christmas Eve she uses her magical powers to pass through the forbidden gate. Seeking Christmas throughout the galaxies, she finds the planet Earth and an old man's snowy yard. The combined knowledge, yearning and powers of Lucretia and the old man produce a memorable Christmas celebration. Based on a poem by Peter Desbarats."
