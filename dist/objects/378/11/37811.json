        "The Garden is rich with metaphor. The Garden of Eden and the Garden of Gethsemane. In the garden is visible the whole sensual cycle of life and death. We watch the Passion enacted by two male lovers, filmed in the garden Jarman himself created and retreated within to prepare for his own battle with mortality. In \"The Garden\" the spirit and the flesh, sin and redemption, are united. Like Pasolini, Jarman eschews classic narrative for the pleasures of a cinema of poetry and seeks a spirituality based on eros rather than repression. A difficult, maddening, wondrous film. With the glorious Tilda Swinton."
