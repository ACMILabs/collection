        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Why do we do what we do? This program interviews experts in the field who give their opinions as to what motivates us. They include biological influences, extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, reinforcement, cognition or self-esteem and expectancy, and play and curiosity leading to the conclusion that if we understand our motives we have more power to accept or change what we think and what we do."
