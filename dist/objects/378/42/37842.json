        "Episode of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterised by abnormalities of thought (strange beliefs, persecution complexes), abnormalities of perception (hallucinations, hearing voices) and speech abnormalities. The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown, but it is thought to be in part a genetic predisposition and in part the result of environmental stress. This program surveys current research and theories on the causes and characteristics of schizophrenia."
