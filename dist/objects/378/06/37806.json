        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Civil War\". For three years Robert E. Lee has met, measured and defeated a string of Union generals, but now Lincoln elevates Ulysses S. Grant to commander of all Union armies and brings him east to face the brilliant Lee. In a month-long series of battles, Grant's army loses an appalling 50,000 men, but, heedless of the carnage he drives his superior numbers towards Richmond until halted at Petersburg. Meanwhile Sherman relentlessly advances to Atlanta, until he too is halted. Time is running out for Lincoln."
