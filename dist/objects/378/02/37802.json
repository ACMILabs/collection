        "In a brief introductory passage, the now-dead showman, Ziegfield (William Powell), reminisces over his past triumphs (very well depicted with puppets). He then plans, from Heaven, a new \"Follies\". The elaborate acts of his vision follow, with Fred Astaire, Lucille Bremer, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Gene Kelly, Esther Williams, Judy Garland and Kathryn Grayson. Interspersed are three good comedy routines featuring Victor Moore, Ed Arnold, Fanny Brice, Hume Cronin and Red Skelton."
