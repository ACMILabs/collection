        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". What methods do psychologists use to probe human nature? In this program, Philip Zimbardo explains the methods of scientific research including the principles of laboratory experiments, surveys, interviews and psychological tests. In doing so, he considers the validity of lie detector tests, questions the reality of psychic powers and outlines the power of the \"placebo\" effect when a patient's condition improves simply because they believe their treatment is doing them good."
