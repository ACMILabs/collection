        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". What is the brain? What does it do? The structure of this most complex of living organisms is described and illustrated by case studies of people who have suffered damage to specific areas of the brain. Their cases also illustrate the immense plasticity and adaptability of the brain. Appropriate training can actually stimulate the brain to restore functions lost, either by damage or by aging, by transferring them to other parts of the brain."
