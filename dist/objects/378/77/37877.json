        "This practical training course for film and video production consists of four videos, each with an accompanying booklet, and a teacher's guide. 1. 'The camera' compares the camera's view of the world with the human eye, considers focal length and angle of view, outlines the terminology for shot sizes and camera moves, shows how to maintain continuity of direction (34min). 2. 'Planning a program' introduces the basic techniques of recording an event on camera, suggesting ways of improving coverage by planning ahead (17min). 3. 'Interviews' looks at how to tackle interviews both inside and outside the studio and how to maintain the viewer's interest (21min). 4. 'Editing' introduces principles to guide your selection, order and length of shots and shows how your decisions will affect the way the story is told (20min)."
