        "Americans have the most fat-filled diet in the world. On an average, over 40% of the calories eaten daily by Americans are fats. A diet high in fat dramatically increases the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, diabetes and cancer. This program outlines constructive nutritional advice for reducing fat content in our diets and thereby improving our health and decreasing our cholesterol level."
