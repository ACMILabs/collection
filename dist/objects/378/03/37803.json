        "Episode of Series \"This Land Australia with Ted Egan\". Ted Egan's story of the Paddlewheelers of the mighty Murray River begins at Mannum in South Australia which claims to be the oldest of the riverboat towns. Ted travels on almost all the paddlewheelers beginning with \"The Adelaide\". At Mildura a special race is staged for the new and old paddleboats featuring \"The Melbourne\", \"The Rothbury\", \"The Avoca\", \"The Coonawarra\" and \"The Murray River Queen\". At Swan Hill we see \"The Gem\", \"The Pyap\" and a replica of the steam driven \"Emmy Lou\". At Echuca Ted travels aboard the \"Pevensey\", \"The Adelaide\" and the \"Etona\" and an old missionary boat."
