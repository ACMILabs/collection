        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Civil War\". Feeling invincible after the spring's great victories Lee drives north to Gettysburg and three of the most crucial days of the war. 51,000 men fall, one in every three, and when the firing dies, General Lee is in retreat, never again to threaten the North. Grant seizes Vicksburg and the rebels are soundly defeated in Tennessee, but the first military draft provokes a series of anti-war, anti-black riots. Scarcely noticed in all the hubbub is Lincoln's visit to Gettysburg and the address in which he defines the Union and the war in a mere 269 words."
