        "Episode of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". In our everyday life, we experience wear and tear, that is, stress. A stressor is anything that requires the body to respond to life by setting off a series of chemical and physical reactions. Individuals respond to, and cope with, stress in different ways, but increasingly scientists are acknowledging the relationship between high levels of stress and the human immune system. This program examines how and why excessive stress affects us."
