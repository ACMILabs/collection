        "A study of diffusion as it takes place in living cells. Uses photomicrography, time-lapse photography, simple laboratory demonstrations, and models to explain diffusion and to clarify how a selectively permeable membrane functions. Demonstrates osmosis, the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane, and includes practical examples of diffusion and osmosis."
