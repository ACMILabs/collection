        "Episode number 14 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". What is our real personality? Where does it come from? How does it develop? This program outlines the different approaches psychology has taken to answer these questions. Psychoanalysis stresses the tension between the Id and the Superego. Behaviourism believes that behaviour is a learned phenomenon. The Humanists propose continual change and creativity and the latest approach considers five basic personality traits. But are these ideas enough to describe a person? Studies of twins and adoptees would suggest there is a powerful genetic component but with the non-shared environment playing a vital role."
