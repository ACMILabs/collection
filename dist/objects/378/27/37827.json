        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". Can new computer techniques, such as brain imaging, detect whether a person is, or is likely to become, alcoholic, manic depressive or schizophrenic? Can transplanting healthy tissue into an ageing brain improve memory? In this program, Philip Zimbardo examines the structure of the brain and the scientific study of the brain - neuroscience. The scientists interviewed explain the biochemical reactions that determine our thoughts, feelings and actions."
