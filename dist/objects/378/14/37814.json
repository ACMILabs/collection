        "Episode of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". How do you quantify differences in intelligence? How is intelligence determined? How can it be measured? Is it related to the brain? Can it ever be defined? Does heredity or experience define the upper limit of intelligence and what is the relationship between intelligence and motivation? These questions and the usefulness of intelligence tests are considered by a variety of psychologists."
