        "A highly fictionalized account of the rivalry and tenuous friendship between Billy the Kidd (Jack Beutel), Doc Holliday (Walter Huston), Pat Garrett (Mitchell Thomas) and a half breed girl (Jane Russel in her screen debut). Much controversy surrounded the films release regarding supposedly steamy scenes between Jack Beutel and Jane Russel, and Hughes' obvious fixation with Russel's chest."
