        "Based on newspaper articles and personal interviews with Linn Yann, this moving film tells of one young Cambodian girl refugees experiences in America and her fight to be accepted. With the support of her caring American sponsors (played by Mary Kay Place and Wayne Rogers), Linn Yann (Jade Chinn) overcomes the strangeness of her new country and makes a name for herself by winning the regional spelling competition, thus bringing attention to the plight of other refugees like her."
