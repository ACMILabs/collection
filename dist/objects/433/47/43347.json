        "The suspicious death of a miner at the inactive local pit owned by the mysterious Global Chemicals brings UNIT and the Doctor to sleepy Llanfairfach, Wales. Could the waste products from their revolutionary new oil refining process be at fault? For there, deep down in the mines, thousands of giant maggots lay gestating - a dangerously unknown terror waiting to be unleashed upon the world. But by whom? Just who is the power behind Global Chemicals? And who or what is the boss? The Doctor, Jo and the Brigadier must move quickly to find the answers, for the death toll is already rising and the gestation period of the maggots is coming to an end."
