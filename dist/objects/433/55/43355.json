        "Introduced by John-Michael Howson, this tape includes two tales for the family to enjoy. \"The Legend of Robin Hood\"; King Richard leaves for England to crusade in the Holy Land. He leaves the kingdom in the hands of his brother, Prince John. All does not go well however, and Prince John and his Barons use the power recently invested in them to increase their estates at the expense of the citizens. Only one citizen dares to protest against their shoddy behaviour; Robin of Locksley, who becomes an outlaw and adopts the name, Robin Hood. Directed by Zoran Janic. \"Black arrow\"; Squire Richard Shelton, heir to the Turnstall Estate sets out to join the Lancastrian Army. On his way he meets the mysterious brotherhood of the Black Arrow and discovers startling news. His guardian, Sir Daniel Brackley, is plotting to steal his estate and may have been involved in the death of Richard's father. Directed by Leif Gram."
