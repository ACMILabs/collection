        "Faithfully adapted from the Stephen King novel of the same name, this is the chilling story of a man who wakes up from a five-year coma with the extraordinary power to see visions of the past, present and, most frightening, the future. A tense and thought provoking production in which Walken gives one of his most intense and believable performances."
