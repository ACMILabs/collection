        "In this imaginative story by Mark Twain, a modern man suddenly finds himself in the kingdom of King Arthur when he receives a blow to the head. Twain very cleverly compares the two eras customs and attitudes through this entertaining fantasy as the modern Yankee has fun introducing modern innovations to Arthur's kingdom. No other production details available."
