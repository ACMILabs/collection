        "Based on the book \"Talked to death: the life and murder of Alan Berg\" by Stephen Singular, this film presents an often unseen side of talk radio of paranoia and passion. Eric Bogosian (who also wrote the play based on Singular's book) stars as a contentious talk show host. He pushes the boundaries of political correctness and inspires emotions of love or hate from his listeners. His provocative broadcasts push one caller too far, leading to dire consequences. Also starring Alec Baldwin, Ellen Greene and John Pankow."
