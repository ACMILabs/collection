        "These programs from the 'Heartlands' series explore the theory that each individual views the future differently, based on their current life situation, and that as their situation changes, so to does their future outlook. Also explored are some options and outcomes as they may appear if we are prepared to take the challenge of creatively addressing the problems of today. Four people who have a vested interest in the way out future will be are interviewed. Two consultants whose job it is to identify the spectrum of options that might be available, and the implications of some of these outcomes, and two teenagers who will have to live with the consequences of whatever decisions are made today. The program is not about predicting the future - rather the process of creating it"
