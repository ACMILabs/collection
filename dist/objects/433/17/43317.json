        "Set in Kansas in 1910 this film concerns an independent woman, Sarah Wheaton (Glenn Close), who answers an advertisement for help wanted by a widower with two children in Midwest America. It is a transformation from the comfortable security of her seacoast home to the harsh terrain of the \"wild west\". Also starring Christopher Walken, Lexi Randall and Margaret Sophie Stein. Based on the novel of the same name by Patricia MacLachlan."
