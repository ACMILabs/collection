        "Featuring a wealth of talent and innovation from Stephen Blackburn, Geoff Brooks, Peter Brown, Sue Ingleton, Mary Keneally, Rod Quantock and Tim Robertson, this was arguably the first 'truly Australian' comedy show, originating from the comedy clubs of Brunswick Street, Melbourne in the mid 1970s. Featuring such classic characters as Tim & Debbie, The Dodgey Brothers and Chunky Custard."
