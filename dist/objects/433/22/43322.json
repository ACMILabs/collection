        "Montgomery Clift and Paul Douglas star in this reenactment of the Berlin airlift of 1948 which occurred as a result of a Russian blockade of the western sector; refusing to allow the Allies to ship food supplies to starving Berliners. An airlift proves to be the only solution. Paul Douglas stars as ground operations sergeant Frank Kowalski, and Montgomery Clift as pilot Danny MacCullough, both of whom have differing views on the matter. Cornell Borchers features as a love interest."
