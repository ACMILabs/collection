        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Last governor\". The Sino-British talks collapse. In Hong Kong, support for Patten and his democratic reforms is undiminished despite an onslaught from the dissenters. With the help of Baroness Thatcher and other key players, this episode explores Patten's inheritance; the 1984 Joint Declaration, under which Britain and China agreed terms for the handover of Hong Kong. Patten introduces his Reform Bill to the Legislative Council, the vote is make or break for him."
