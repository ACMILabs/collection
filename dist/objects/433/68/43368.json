        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Last governor\". China turns on the heat, promising to tear up Patten's blueprint. Increasing anxieties about Hong Kong's freedoms after 1997 form a backdrop for the film's coverage of the 1995 elections to the Legislative Council. They turn out to be a triumph for democracy and for Patten, but they are soon overshadowed by struggles over other major issues like the Bill of Rights, the Court of Final Appeal and a bitter conflict about British passports for Hong Kong citizens."
