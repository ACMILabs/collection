        "Leo McKern narrates this modern day adventure set in twentieth century Tasmania. The true story concerns Tasmanian doctor and canoeist John Hawkins, who led the fight to save the Franklin River. It was, and still is a dilemma between developing the natural resources of the land or to forgo development at the price of suffering potential economic, political and social consequences. It is an issue that commanded the rest of the nation's attention and continues to be pertinent today."
