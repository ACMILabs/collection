        "Terry O'Quinn is \"the Stepfather\", the man with the generic name because he has been a stepfather many times. He also has a gruesome way of ending relationships and severing the family ties; he kills them when they fail to meet his perfect standards and moves on to the next family. Shelley Hack and Jill Schoelen are cast as his latest victims."
