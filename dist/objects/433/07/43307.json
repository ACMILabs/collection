        "These are five programs from the 'Heartlands\" series about people and how they interact with the environment. It provides examples of people who are actively helping the environment, some on an individual level and some on a global scale, but the principle by which all of these people operate is that every individual can change the world if they start with themselves. We must learn from our living experiences, or else we are compelled to keep making the same mistakes - we live on a single planet with limited resources and we are all responsible for how they are used. Population and consumption cannot be sustained at current usage levels - we need to get back to the principles of living within our means in order to affect change for the better in the environment."
