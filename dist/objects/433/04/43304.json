        "This program looks at Australia's arid heartland, an area largely ignored by the residents of the less arid coastline. The situation has been caused by government lack of control over crown land and over- grazing by pastoralists. Significantly, it is the result of white mans' failure to recognise the limitations of the land. The program offers two alternatives; act now and save what's left or continue as before and further destroy the productivity of the land."
