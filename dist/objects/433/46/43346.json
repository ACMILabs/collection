        "In this exciting adventure the Doctor (Jon Pertwee) is forced into a desperate race against time... An inexplicable power loss strands the tardis on the sinister planet Exxilon where the Doctor meets an expedition from Earth seeking a rare mineral that can cure the virulent space plague that threatens all human life. Nearby Sarah (Elisabeth Sladen) discovers a mysterious Citadel but is captured by the savage Exxilons who prepare for her sacrifice. The Doctor must uncover the secrets of the ancient city, locate the source of the power drain, save Sarah and help the Earth expedition. But his plans are threatened by new arrivals on the planet - the Doctor's oldest and deadliest enemies - the Daleks."
