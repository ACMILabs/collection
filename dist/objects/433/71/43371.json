        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Last governor\". Written and presented by Jonathan Dimbleby, episode one begins in 1992 as Conservative MP Chris Patten leaves for Hong Kong. He was the first politician and non diplomat to be elected governor, and he was the last governor of Hong Kong before the country was handed back to China. This episode looks at the business and democratic culture of Hong Kong, the influence of colonisation on culture, the role of the media in Patten's term, an historical overview of Asia-British relations, and the migration of Chinese peoples to Hong Kong and their present status in Hong Kong society. The episode concludes with Patten having met with Chinese delegates to discuss the terms and conditions of democratic reform."
