        "Other civilisations have ignored the warning signs that Australia is currently receiving regarding salinity. Salinity poses a major ecological problem to Australia in the forms of land erosion along the coastline, and destroying food and water supplies inland. It has occurred because we have taken too much from the land and the natural barriers to salinity have broken down. This documentary interviews a Murray River farmer, attempts to explain why the situation has occurred, and searches for a solution for the future."
