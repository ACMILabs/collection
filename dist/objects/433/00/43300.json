        "This programme, presented by Dean Graetz, looks at mining in Australia and the impact and social costs the depletion of ore resources has on mining communities. Changes to mining methods are also covered, with the industry not needing to hire as many people due to the technological advancements in the field. Dean Graetz also highlights the differences in attitudes towards agricultural and pastoral land and mining, stressing that agriculture will sustain us in the future, and not mining, which is a finite resource."
