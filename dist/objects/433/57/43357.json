        "Based on a fable by Harry Nilsson, this delightful family film is set in the land of Point. In Point, every object, including people, is moulded into a point. Into this world little Oblio is born; the first and only roundheaded child in the town. Oblio and his dog, Arrow, are punished for having no point and are banished to the Pointless Forest. It is not as lonely as they imagined for in the forest they meet several other creatures who have also been exiled because they were different. Join Oblio and Arrow as they discover that you don't have to have a point to be accepted. Narrated by Ringo Starr and animated by director Fred Wolf."
