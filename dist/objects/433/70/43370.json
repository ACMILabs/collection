        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Last governor\". Patten returns from China to find himself facing an array of public and private dissenters; Hong Kong tycoons, British sinologists, and senior politicians who argue that the relationship with China is more important than democracy. Patten decides to internationalise the issue and after much tortuous effort, the Chinese agree to negotiate."
