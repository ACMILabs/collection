        "A documentary report of the intellectual starvation in countries ravaged by WWII. Schools are now lost in the rubble with homes, hospitals and churches; children gather knowledge of the world from the black markets and the refuse dumps, roving in gangs through the litter of civilisation. From mute faces, eyes stare hungrily, marking the desolation war has wrought in minds as well as bodies. It is here that a beginning must be made: textbooks, writing materials, research equipment, and a thousand other tools of knowledge are needed to break apathy and hostility, and to open young minds to the promise of a peaceful world."
