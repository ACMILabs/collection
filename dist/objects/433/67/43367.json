        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Last governor\". The handover approaches and there is no let up on Patten. Word and deeds by China confirm many people's worst fears. Issues, major and minor, from a resolution to the British passports conflict, to the fate of Government House crockery must be finalised. This last program in the series charts the closing months of British rule in the leadup to the 30th June 1997 when the British flag will be lowered for the last time."
