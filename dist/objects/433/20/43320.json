        "What is the macabre secret of the terrifying Red House? Hidden deep within the spooky Oxhead Woods, it guards hidden mysteries of the dark past - puzzlements of passions and torture that threaten to surface and shatter innocent lives. Highlighted by atmospheric photography and a clever script, superb acting from Edward G. Robinson, Lon McCallister and Judith Anderson, with eerie blood-chilling music, this film is a blockbuster of a suspense thriller you will not soon forget."
