        "How Canadians adjust to their long, snowbound season. Filmed with humour, The Joy of Winter shows people making the best of what they cannot change. From tiny tots to human polar bears the film leaves no doubt that, in the eyes of many Canadians, winter may offer more attractions than summer. Film without words. (Awards: Gijon; Necochea.)"
