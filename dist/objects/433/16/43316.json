        "This tape includes 2 tales featuring the Berenstain bears. \"The Berenstain bears Easter surprise\"; It looks like this Easter is not going to be a joyous one. Boss Bunny who delivers the eggs has decided to quit. Fortunately Brother bear (who has heard that he will be receiving a special Easter present) steps in to save the day. \"The Berenstain Bears comic valentine\"; Brother bear is receiving some romantic distractions from the forthcoming Valentines Day hockey game against the Beartown Bullies. The more he tries to concentrate on the game the more he receives Valentines cards. Can he get to the bottom of this and win the game?"
