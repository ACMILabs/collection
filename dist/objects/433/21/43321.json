        "Running for 20 minutes, these are three adventures from the animated queen of cute, Betty Boop! \"Betty and Henry\" (1935), sees Betty offer Henry a puppy if he'll watch the store. Thats where it all began, and Betty's pet store will never be the same again. \"Betty and the little King\" (1936), has His Majesty the King much preferring to be part of Betty's vaudeville show than act as a proper king should. In \"Betty in Blunderland\" (1934), follow Betty through the looking glass into a land of enchantment where she meets the Mad Hatter."
