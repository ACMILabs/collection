        "Adventurer Gulliver leaves home with dreams of drama on the high seas. Tragedy strikes however in the form of a storm, washing Gulliver to the shores of Lilliput; an island inhabited by people who are just a few inches high. Gulliver quickly wins their favour and is crowned hero when he is able to wipe the Lilliputians enemy fleet. After his experiences with the little people he travels to Brobdingnag; a country inhabited by giants. Gulliver is captured by the giants as a potential toy for the Queen of Brobdingnag. Special effects are courtesy of Ray Harryhausen. Starring Kerwin Mathews, Jo Morrow and June Thorburn."
