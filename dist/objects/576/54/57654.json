        "Like nowhere else graphically summarises some of the changes that have taken place in the Australian landscape since European settlement. We see environmental destruction resulting from the \"develop at any cost\" mentality that has shaped human relationships with the environment in this country for so long. We also see hope for the future in the growing community concern and the response of governments and industry. Narrated by Robyn Williams with music by Gondwanaland."
