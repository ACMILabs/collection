        "The establishment of large National Parks in the Mallee have as their objective, the conservation of natural resources. As part of a conservation program, projects include revegetation to support wildlife and conserve the soil and pest control of noxious species such as rabbits. With its largely semi-arid climate, the Mallee, despite suffering from land degradation due to farming and livestock practices, is another of our natural treasures."
