        "Part 1 in a series about alcohol and its effects on women's wellbeing. Even with allowances for the basic differences in size between men an women, women are more susceptible to intoxication and diseases of the liver than are men. Women may be trapped in a dangerous cycle when they combine the empty calories of alcohol with an unblanced diet. Even more serious are the results of alcohol abuse which include loss of judgement and addiction. No other credits available."
