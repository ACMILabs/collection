        "This program examines the devastating environmental effects of the Jappanese paper industry from the woodchipping of Australian forests to the problem of toxic waste produced by Japanese paper mills. Discusses the traditional environmental-safe way of paper making, the attitude to recycling programs in Japan, and the Japanese overuse of paper. If paper use trebles in the next decade, as predicted, Australia being a major supplier of woodchips to Japan, is in danger of losing its forests."
