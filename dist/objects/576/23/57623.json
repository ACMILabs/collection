        "Part 3 of a program designed to control the rabbit populations and their adverse effects on farming. This episode narrated by Maurie Fields suggests a solution to the problem - working in groups. By forming a local \"Rabbit Control Group\" or \"Land Care Group\" farmers would be able to: 1-reduce their costs by having proper equipment and supplies available when needed, 2-have effective rabbit control on all properties, and 3-moral and motivation would be boosted via the social contact between all members of the community. The local C.F.and L. office would also assist with information for the natural regeneration of trees and grasses. Effective rabbit control would benefit the environment by ensuring the return of the natural wildlife and also increase agricultural productivity."
