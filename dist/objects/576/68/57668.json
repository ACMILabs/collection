        "Episode of Series \"Politics of food\". Wealthy western nations in more recent times, have given aid to poorer nations struck by disasters such as famine, flood and war. The primary purpose of aid is to strengthen a political relationship between allies. Both parts of the video compare situations in Kerala and Bangladesh in terms of food distibution and programmes to prevent problems caused by overpopulation. At the time of production, food distribution in Bangladesh was hampered by corrupt political infra-structures in some areas, while education was not a high priority. In Kerala the effects of sound educational programmes and a fairer distribution of resources was examined."
