        "Episode of Series \"Politics of food\". Feeding the hungry of the world is not just an exercise in good agricultural practices or a result of foreign aid and trade. Governments can affect farmers by imposing tarrifs or providing subsidies so that even in times of surplus, the needy may be disadvantaged. More productive agricultural programmes can increase food supply, however in developing countries who receive aid and food, the incentive to develop these practices may not be encouraged by the political forces in power."
