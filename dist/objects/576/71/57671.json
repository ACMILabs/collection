        "Episode of Series \"Politics of food\". These episodes in the \"Politics of Food\" series examine poverty and hunger in Brazil. Brazil is one of the world leaders in food exports yet 1 in 8 children in poor areas will die from malnutrition. Much of the land which could be used to produce food crops is given over to high yield export crops such as sugar and cocoa. With little land to grow food many of the rural population have migrated to the cities where urban poverty is rife. As a consequence, corruption and violence are evident as the battle between wealthy landowners and the impoverished continues."
