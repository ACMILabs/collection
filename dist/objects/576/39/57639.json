        "Not an expose on high fashion, but a look at how clothing is made in a modern mass production factory. The programme is intended to erase any pre-conceived ideas about the factory as a dangerous, unpleasant workplace. The viewer is shown the manufacturing process from concept and design, to the finished garment. Divided into two parts entitled, Fashion and design\" and \"The Factory floor."
