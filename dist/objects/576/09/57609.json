        "The 1982-83 drought in North- west Victoria and South Australia impacted heavily on the environment. This tape examines the effect of the drought in the Mallee region in terms of soil conservation. This area experienced severe soil erosion as farmers were forced to overgraze livestock, in particular sheep."
