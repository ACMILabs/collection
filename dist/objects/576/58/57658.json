        "As an island nation, Australia was fortunate to be untouched by the ravages of war that shook Europe and Asia during World War 2, until the bombing of Darwin. For the first time in our recorded history, the horror of international conflict reached our shore. Australia's isolation was no longer a guarantee of protection. This video presents historical footage of the dramatic events of the Japanese attack."
