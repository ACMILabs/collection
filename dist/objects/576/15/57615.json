        "Examines the subject of tree conservation in Australia. In the past with European settlement, trees were demolished at a rapid rate to make room for livestock and agriculture, our early settlers were unaware that only 15% of Australia was covered by trees. With our policy of deliberate tree felling that percentage has dropped to 5, and the delicate balance of the ecosystems have been distrubed leading to soil erosion and a loss of agricultural productivity. A national tree program titled \"Greening Australia\" is going on in many parts of the country promoting public awareness and community action. Greening Australia is helping the community grow 1 billion tree by the year 2000. No other credits available."
