        "This is not only a documentary of moving image history in Australia prior to and on Federation, but also a tribute to the early pioneers of the motion picture industry. Discusses the role of the Salvation Army as the largest film making body during the earlier part of this century and provides short histories of our early cameras and their operators. Highlights include The Federation Parade, scenes from the Boer War and documentaries representing Australia as part of a \"Greater Britain\". These early film pieces are superbly restored."
