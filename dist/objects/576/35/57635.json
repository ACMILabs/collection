        "Overviews the legal profession as a whole, in terms of the charges for services they provide and the effect of these fees on the clients who need to seek legal advice. The legal profession in Australia, with its distinction between barristers and solicitors, is full of \"archaic rules and traditions\" which, when combined with the increasing costs of legal fees, raises the question of justice and its real cost."
