        "A Peter Couchman program which deals with the topic - Violence in the media - television news, film and video. Peter hosts a discussion with people from a cross section of society which included forensic psychologists, politicians, journalists, actors, T.V. news directors, child psychologists, parents, teachers, pasters, Institute of criminality, movie maker and distributor etc.. Questions such as What are the acceptable levels of violence which are shown on TV?, Should TV news be censored or sanitised?, Do children distinguish between reality and fantasy relating to violence on TV and film and can their behaviour alter because of it?, Do we need government regulations?, What constitutes news?, Are we living in a more violent society?. These and many more are covered in the program and possible solutions are also discussed. A very powerful program which could be used for VCE media studies, and legal studies"
