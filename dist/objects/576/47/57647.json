        "'Out of Sight, Out of Mind', in its depiction of prison conditions, helped to raise awareness about a much neglected section of our society. It provided extensive insight into the prison system, interviewing prisoners, prison officers and administrators. There are four parts titled 'Locked Up', 'Surviving in the Nick', 'The Keepers and the Kept', and 'The Cycle of Crime'. This program pulls no punches, describes the conditions of various correctional institutions around Australia and also offers some suggestions for improvements."
