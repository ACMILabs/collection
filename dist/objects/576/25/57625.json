        "Western Australia, with its history of strong winds in late summer and early winter, is recognised as the wind state in Australia. Records show that the majority of our already fragile agricultural soils are severely eroded by strong winds on average every five years. Changes in cropping practices and the provision of adequate vegetation cover will minimise wind erosion losses and improve productivity."
