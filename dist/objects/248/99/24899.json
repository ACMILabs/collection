        "He was a likable seven-year-old boy, but he had been abandoned by his parents. He was first placed in a foster home; later, new parents were found for him. Joey is a story of adoption as seen from the child's point of view. Made with the cooperation of the Children's Aid Society, the film shows the measure of success that adoption authorities are experiencing today in placing older children."
