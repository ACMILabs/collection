        "The film discusses the advances in aviation since the days of the Wright brothers and explains that the piston operated power unit imposes limits on the altitudes and speeds at which aircraft can fly. The basic principles of jet propulsion are outlined and the operation of a jet engine explained by means of animated diagrams. The advantages and disadvantages of jet engines are listed and different types of jet propulsion illustrated."
