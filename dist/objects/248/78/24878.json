        "Jetflight is the story of the Trans-Pacific delivery flight of the new Boeing 707 jet airliner. The film shows the great power and size of this luxury air giant on the trip from San Francisco to Melbourne. On stops at the islands of Hawaii and Fiji, it is welcomed by the local people. Once again the airliner takes off on the old Southern Cross route. On arrival at Sydney, the jet has completed its trip in 16 hours cutting by half the usual flying time. Narrated by Martin Royal, script by Ivan Chapman, photography by Bert Nicholas."
