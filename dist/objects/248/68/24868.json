        "Episode of Series \"Romantic vs classic art\". Ingres was a pure artist, a believer in art for art's sake. Like Degas, he was obsessed with an ideal of perfect form to which he gave his whole life, but succeeded in capturing it only when the subject was the female nude. Narrated by Kenneth Clark."
