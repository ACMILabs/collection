        "Episode of Series \"Romantic vs classic art\". Examines Ingres' reputation as the archetypal Classic artist and finds it misleading. Ingres escaped completely from orthodox classicism by making direct studies of Greek vases rather than by copying established interpreters. Narrated by Kenneth Clark."
