        "The story of hundred-year-old Herman Smith Johannsen--nicknamed Jack Rabbit by Indians--the man who introduced the sport of cross-country skiing to this country. In the film we see him at the Canadian Ski Marathon north of Montreal, where he is the honored guest, and on a return trip to his native Norway. From present to past, his life is retraced with pictures from sports newsreels, Norwegian archives, and his family album. Narrated by Stanley Jackson."
