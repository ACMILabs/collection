        "This is a film without commentary but with all the sights and sounds, colour and tempo of life of the exotic Indonesian islands in the Java Sea. Here Jalan, Jalan can mean either going on a journey or simply taking a stroll. It is a film full of surprises in the bustling half-modern, half-ancient city of Jakarta, capital of the island republic, and in the lovely countryside. (An abridged and revised version of 'Wet Earth and Warm People' made for younger audiences.)"
