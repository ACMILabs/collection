        "Smokey Bear, a cartoon figure, makes a direct appeal to everyone to help in preventing forest fires. He explains how fires have caused in one year the loss of enough timber to supply the building needs of a large city. He shows a family picnic party carefully putting out their camp fire, while the father grinds his match and pipe ash into the ground."
