        "Spring comes to Japan. The school year starts in April with special ceremonies in every school, kindergarten and university. The educational system is the driving force behind the speedy modernisation and great industrial development of the country. The rainy season heralds summer which is the sporting and shopping season, and of the great Buddhist Festival. Autumn, as well as being harvest season, brings typhoons and chrysanthemums, and autumnal foliage across the land. Most of Japan experiences a mild winter; modern heating and food preservation make thia a \"good\" season in a barren time."
