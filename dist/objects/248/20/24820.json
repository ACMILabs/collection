        "Albert Jacka was raised in the bush, won Australia's first VC at Gallipoli, and went on to become the epitome of the Australian front line fighting soldier. No man better personified the archetypical Australian of the early decades of the century. His heroic feats captured the imagination of a generation, yet, today Albert Jacka is almost forgotten. This film is not only his life story but also an insight into Australian identity and history through archival footage."
