        "Episode of Series \"The Willis Reed basketball series\". Jack Marin, one of the outstanding shooters in professional ranks, demonstrates some of the shots which have helped him achieve this remarkable record. He concentrates on the jump shot, the staple of his repertoire, showing how \"squaring up\" the body and keeping it in line are essential, and how rolling the ball of one's fingers is the proper release. He also demonstrates various driving moves a forward must conquer."
