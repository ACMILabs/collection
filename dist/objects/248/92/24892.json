        "Episode of Series \"Social Security\". One of a series of films created originally for day-time television panel discussions to introduce to the public the range of social services available from Government and other agencies. This program deals with the problems of unmarried mothers and in particular, with Joan, who worked at an assortment of jobs in order to keep her daughter. The film looks back at her life and at how she and her daughter have come through difficult years. It also highlights a social welfare organisation known as CHUM - Care and Help for Unmarried Mothers."
