        "Japan has been influenced by many countries, and today alternate layers of traditional and foreign cultures appear like the rings of a tree. We see this pattern in the ageless architectural beauty of the Shinto and Buddhist shrines and temples, and the later Christian churches; in the ancient castles, palaces and homes contrasting with the modern concrete and steel skyscrapers; and in the arts and crafts - the tea ceremony, formal gardens, pottery and embroidery."
