        "The art of Jiri Trnka the film puppeteer is cleverly and beautifully presented, showing several extracts from past and forthcoming productions, and including many puppets, some now in `retirement'. Trnka is shown at work in the studio and the mechanics of his art are simply but completely presented. An actual scene under production is discussed and analysed."
