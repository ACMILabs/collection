        "Life as a jackeroo on Thylungra Station, a one million acre property in south-western Queensland. The jackeroo tells of the satisfaction of life in the outback. We tour the station and see pelts collected from a trapper, windmills and fences checked, sheep mustered, drafted and sheared, and meet boundary riders. Gives a sense of a hot, dusty and expansive country."
