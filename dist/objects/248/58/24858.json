        "The famous artist Shuson Kono, paints a mountain landscape capturing the serenity of nature in the still muted-toned ponds that border the Katsura, the 17th century Imperial Palace. Bamboo flutes and vocal chorus intensify the deeply reflective mood of this poetic film. Also includes images of rural Japan and illustrates the designing of various Japanese gardens."
