        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Child\". The world at toddler's eye level. For months a baby lies in his crib looking at all those things just beyond his reach. Then he learns to move about, to crawl, to stand and suddenly all those things are his to touch, to taste. This film observes a baby's natural curiosity, his way of \"getting into things\" as part of the experience of learning and adapting. Differences in behaviour of the three babies are noted."
