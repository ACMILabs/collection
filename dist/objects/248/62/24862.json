        "In the Square Gambetta in Paris a little boy's imagination brings a statue to life. There follows a transformation scene and in an imaginary park Marcel Marceau acts out in mime all the habitues of the park - the nursemaids, the young lovers, the policemen, and old men. His impersonations range from the faintly amusing to the maudlin, but Marceau's many admirers will doubtless enjoy this film."
