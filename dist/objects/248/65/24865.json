        "Leonard Bernstein explains and illustrates the nature of jazz and its fusion with serious concert music since the 1920's. Includes three major works performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and soloists to illustrate this fusion: Gunther Schuller's \"Journey into jazz\" featuring jazz musicians Don Ellis (Itrumpet), Eric Dolphy (alto sax), Benny Golsen (tenor sax), Richard Davis (bass) and Joseph Cocuzzo (drums); Aaron Copland's \"Concerto for piano and orchestra\"; Larry Austin's \"Improvisations for orchestra and jazz soloists\"."
