        "An edited version of a film by Chris Owen which examines the impact of Christianity upon the Gogodala Tribes of Western Papua New Guinea. It caused the cessation of major ceremonies and rituals, the interruption of the tribal patterns of life, and the stagnation of their art and expression. However, in 1973, with the aid of the National Cultural Council, attempts have been made towards a cultural revival, which though sometimes influenced by western and other tribal practices, has given the Gogodala a renewed sense of identity."
