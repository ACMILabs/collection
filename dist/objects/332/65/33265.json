        "When Solzhenitsyn was given the Nobel Prize for literature he wrote a speech which was never delivered. When it was published it was hailed as one of his finest and most important works. This film, based on the speech, gives new impetus to some of the writer's widest concepts and enduring convictions. Spoken by Tom Courtenay."
