        "Modern technology provides us with an ever improving standard of living. However we are recognising the tradeoffs we must make between the benefits of progress against the potential hazards to our health. Research indicates that 85% of all cancer may be caused by environmental factors. This program looks into and discusses some of this research suggesting that we owe it to ourselves to learn more about the hazards of our modern world. Narrated by Norman Rose."
