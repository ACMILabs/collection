        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". The chemical revolution since World War II has introduced a new family of poisons- man-made, invisible, powerful, little understood, totally useless but totally devastating. The most deadly of these is dioxin, a by-product in the manufacture of certain herbicides such as Agent Orange and 245T. Narrated by Paul Vaughan."
