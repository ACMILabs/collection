        "Episode of Series \"Man Alive\". Many people would regard Switzerland as an earthly paradise. Why is it then that young people have been rioting in Zurich? Jack Pizzey examines the theory that the price the Swiss pay for their affluence is a sham democracy where the real power lies with big business and that the country's image of Red Cross altruism hides ruthless exploitation of the Third World."
