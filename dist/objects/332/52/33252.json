        "One of the consequences of the Vietnam war is a quarter million Vietnamese drug addicts. This film shot in Vietnam in 1981 shows how an underdeveloped war ravaged country is dealing with this problem. Alternative medicine such as acupuncture, natural medicines and exercises play an important part in the rehabilitation process. It also shows a society trying to cope with material scarcity and poverty - the heritage of underdevelopment and the inevitable result of war. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
