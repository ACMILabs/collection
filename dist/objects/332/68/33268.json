        "A boy named Gus accepts an invitation to spend several days aboard the trimaran Freya. During the cruise he is instructed in the rudiments of sailing and is entrusted with the helm. Ever curious, Gus is taught to identify various forms of marine life. There is a particularly striking sequence of a storm at sea that Gus, the skipper, and the Freya ride out handsomely."
