        "Episode of Series \"Everyman\". Since returning from the moon many astronauts have testified to the strong spiritual impact the space experience has had on them. A number have committed themselves to Christ and Ed Mitchell has founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences. This program looks at how space travel has given these men a new perception of man's place in the universe."
