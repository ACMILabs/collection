        "Depicts life in the small community of Villaleunga del Rosario, set high in the mountains of Andalucia in Spain. The village is sustained by the farms which surround it and a modest workshop manufacturing leather goods. The farms are small, often arid and far from the village itself, providing a meagre living from cattle, sheep and goats. But the sense of community is strong, the people's enduring allegiance and identity being with the village in which they live."
