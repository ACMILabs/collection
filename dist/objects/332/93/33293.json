        "Episode of Series \"World in action\". Looks at Israel's apparent campaign to take over Palestine, not with arms but by building huge settlements all over the occupied West Bank and offering accommodation at heavily subsidised prices to Jewish settlers. Allegations are made that Israel plans to drive Arabs out of occupied territories. Includes interviews with Palestinian farmers who have lost some of their land, Israeli Ministers and neutral commentators."
