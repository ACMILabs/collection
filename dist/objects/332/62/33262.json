        "A concert for the unemployed was staged at the Rainbow with a line-up that included Tom Robinson, the Beat, Black Slate, OK Jive and Alexei Sayle. This film is a record of that concert and of the situation which prompted it. Discussions with the young unemployed are set against the rhetoric of the Thatcher regime."
