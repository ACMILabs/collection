        "A mother, isolated in an outer Adelaide suburb, drives a station wagon full of children to a distant beach. Imagination and reality fuse. Her sense of herself is assaulted by car fetishists in a rural service station. Memory, fear and fantasy are interwoven as this experimental film takes woman's assigned role in the 'Australian Dream' to its absurd conclusion. Music: Brian Eno, The Fabulous Nudes, The Pelaco Bros."
