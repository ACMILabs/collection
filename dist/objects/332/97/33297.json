        "Five men, each decorated for valor in Vietnam, are interviewed from prison where they are now serving time for crimes committed since their return from the war. Focuses particularly on Albert Dobbs, showing family photos and newsreel footage, and presenting his recollections as well as those of his family and a fellow soldier. Expresses the self-destructive forces set in motion by the horror of war and disillusioning homecomings. Narrated by Peter Thomas."
