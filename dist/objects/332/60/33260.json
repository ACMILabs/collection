        "The mining and milling of uranium involves the stripping of vast areas of land, reduction of local water tables, release of radioactive gases into the air, and the creation of millions of tons of radioactive waste. This film explores the impact of this process on the environment, the health of the workers and nearby residents. Also explores social justice issues relating to exploitation of Navajo Indian workforce by the mining companies - to the detriment of the health of the native Americans so employed. Environmental health issues (affecting Navajo Indians living in the mines' vicinity) are a further focus."
