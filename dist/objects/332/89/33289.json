        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Sentinel\". The joint U.S.-Australian naval communications station Harold E. Holt has long been controversial for its strategic role in the nuclear arms race and the tight security concerning its operations on Australian soil. This film, produced for the Australian Defence department, documents the military's view on the naval station and the supposed rationale for its purpose and operation in Western Australia."
