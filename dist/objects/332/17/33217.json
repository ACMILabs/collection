        "Duck farming has been an integral part of Indonesian society for centuries. A Research Institute in Java, set up by the Indonesian and Australian governments, aims to increase productivity by improved breeding and feeding techniques. The film explores the variety of techniques and traditions and, in the process, gives a unique perspective to the complexities of Indonesian society."
