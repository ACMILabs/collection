Also suffering a temporary career lapse is tres gai nightclub entertainer (Robert Preston), who remakes her as a man who in short order becomes celebrated as Paris's foremost female impersonator. In the process she snags the attentions of a Chicago nightclub owner (James Garner). He, however, has a small problem - is it a he or a she who has stolen his heart? 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Score (Henry Mancini). Academy Award nominations for Best Actress (Julie Andrews), Supporting Actor (Robert Preston), Supporting Actress (Lesley Anne Warren), Screenplay Adaptation, Costume Design and Art Direction."
