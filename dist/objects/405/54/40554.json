        "David Byrne from the legendary band \"Talking Heads\" ponders life's more trivial, but nevertheless vital questions. Why do hotdogs come in packets of 10, but buns do not? Featuring Byrne's song-writing talents and the performance of \"Talking Heads\", this film of episodic stories features some of the most amiable but offbeat characters imaginable."
