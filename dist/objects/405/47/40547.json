        "Two of MGM's brightest stars, Gene Kelly in his film debuty and Judy Garland, teamed in this Busby Berkeley musical about a vaudeville song-and-dance duo who buck tough times and World War I on the way to showbusiness success. The film has a collection of nostalgic gems including \"Smiles\", \"Ballin' the Jack\" and the title tune. Kelly's inimitable dance style shines and Garland sustains her position as one of the greatest Hollywood legends. Bursting with energy, this is an old-fashioned musical for everyone who loves the movies."
