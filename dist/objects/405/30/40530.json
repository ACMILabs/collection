        "A well-crafted, hardboiled mystery with sharp perfromances by murder suspect Jeff Bridges and tough-but-smitten defense attorney Glenn Close. The murder victim was a socialite and heiress. Her husband (James Bridges), an upwardly mobile newspaper publisher, now owns his wife's fortune. Embittered by past experiences with criminal law, Close is pressed to defend Bridges, once he convinces her of his innocence. This movie raises jagged questions about an imperfect justice system and will leave you guessing until the very end - did he or didn't he? Robert Loggia received a 1985 Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor."
