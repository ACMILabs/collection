        "Academy Award winning director Francis Ford Coppola's visually stunning adaptation of the S.E. Hinton novel. Starring teen heart-throbs Matt Dillon and Mickey Rourke as two brothers whose desire to break out of their urban trap eventually leads to death for one and a new beginning for the other. Photographed in black and white with colour sequences, this striking production features a brilliant supporting cast including Dennis Hopper and boasts a musical score by Stewart Copeland."
