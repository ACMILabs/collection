        "Joe Pendleton (Robert Montgomery), is a contender for the light heavyweight boxing crown, but is killed in a plane crash. An angel (Edward Everett Horton), realising the error that Joe has arrived in heaven 50 years too early. Trying to rectify the mistake, Mr. Jordon (Claude Rains), the chief deispatcher of the \"Heavenly Express\" sends Joe back to earth in the body of a just-murdered millionaire. This delightful romantic comedy was so successful, it inspired a musical sequel, \"Down to Earth\" and was remade as \"Heaven can wait\" in 1978."
