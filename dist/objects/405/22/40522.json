        "Fred Astaire stars as a fashion photographer looking for a new face to promote Kay Thompson's fashion magazine. He discovers Audrey Hepburn working in a bookstore and transforms her into a model on the cover of the \"Vogue-like\" magazine. Shot on location in Paris and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin, \"Funny face\" is a song and dance delight, with romantic backdrops. Hepburn in her Givency clothes is stunning."
