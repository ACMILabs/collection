        "It's 1896 and the \"naughty\" Can-Can has been banned in Paris. That doesn't stop a vivacious cafe owner, (Shirley MacLaine), from performing it anyway, much to the delight of her patrons. She's been able to ignore the law because her clever lawyer, (Frank Sinatra), has a corrupt judge, (Maurice Chevalier), in his pocket. Their sweet setup abruptly changes when a new judge, (Louis Jourdan), decides to put a stop to this shocking behaviour. Little does he know, that the real fun and excitement is just beginning! Features three Cole Porter songs that were not in the original hit show, lavish sets, stunning costumes and plenty of high-stepping dance numbers. Like Paris in the summer, Can-Can sizzles!"
