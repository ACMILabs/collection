        "Deanie (Natalie Wood) is a beautiful teenager eager to do what is right in her staunchly moral hometown, in the 1920's but the emotions she shares with her boyfriend, Bud (Warren Beatty) are too strong to ignore. Eventually the conflict between what society expects and what their desires demand pushes Bud to physical collapse and Deanie to madness. The young stars bring freshness and intensity to this story of parental domination, moral codes and young love, directed with insight and power by Elia Kazan."
