        "Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Aidan Quinn star in a powerful story of mercenaries, missionaries and a tribe of primitive Indians who clash in fanatical conflict in the remote and unforgiving forest of Amazonia. A tragic chain of events is set in motion when the modern world intrudes on the rainforest and its indigenous people. Shot entirely on location in the Amazon forest."
