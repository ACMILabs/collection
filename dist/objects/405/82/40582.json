        "Set in 1930 in French Indochina, on the cusp of revolution, the 1993 Academy Award Winning Best Foreign Film, \"Indochine\" is the epic story of two women; a French mother and her adopted Indochinese daughter. Their relationship survives social and cultural obstacles, but is ultimately stretched to extremes by their passionate love for the same man. The awesome beauty of Vietnam provides a perfect backdrop for this splendid film. Catherine Deneuve gives a \"tour de force\" performance. In French with English subtitles."
