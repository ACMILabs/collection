        "In the corrupt, crime-ridden Detroit of the future, a multi-national conglomerate has assumed control of the Police Department. Law is now a business and proft essential. When Officer Murphy, (Peter Weller) is brutally murdered by vicious criminals, his body is transformed into a cyborg: Half-man, Half-robot - ROBOCOP. Equipped with the fastest reflexes modern technology can offer, onboard computer-assisted memory and a lifetime of on-the-street law enforcement, ROBOCOP launches into a relentless quest to serve, uphold and protect. Features non-stop action, comic book humour and electrifying special effects. Co-starring Nancy Allen, Daniel O'Herlihy, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer."
