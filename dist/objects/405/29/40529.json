        "In her remarkable Academy Award winning portrayal, Ellen Burstyn stars as Alice, a recently widowed housewife who packs herself and her son into a station wagon and heads off in search of a better life. Alice travels a bumpy road - no money, nowhere jobs and not much luck. She fights back with a spirited determination, which underscores this moving, often funny tale of one woman's struggle for self-awareness and independence. With 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore', director Martin Scorsese shows that he is equally at home in semi-rural surroundings as he is in the asphalt jungle of 'Taxi Driver'. The outstanding supporting cast includes Kris Kristofferson, Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel."
