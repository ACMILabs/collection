        "A terrifying thriller based on the best-selling novel by Ira Levin. Living in South America, Dr. Josef Mengele, (Gregory Peck) gathers a group of former Nazis in his plan to clone Hitler. Barry Kohler, (Steve Guttenburg), informs famed Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman, (Laurence Olivier). Kohler's murder incites Lieberman to investigate, and he begins to unravel a conspiracy which leads to Mengele. Mengele has cloned 94 Hitlers, and is killing their fathers in order to simulate Hitler's own youth. Suddenly, the terrifying extent of Mengele's plan is revealed. Also stars James Mason, Denholm Elliot and Lilli Palmer."
