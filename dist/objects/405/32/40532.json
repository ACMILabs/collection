        "Harry Callaghan is a tough, streetwise San Francisco cop whom they call Dirty Harry. In this classic film, you will see why. You will also see why Clint Eastwood's reputation is secure. No other actor can match his presence. He is magnetising in his portrayal as the shoot-first-ask-questions-later law enforcer who must hunt a psychotic roof-top killer who has slain two people and has kidnapped a girl and threatens to suffocate her if his ransom demands are not met. Harry will get him... one way or the other... no matter what the \"system\" prescribes. Moody cinematography and stunning location filming propel the story and capitalise upon Eastwood's commanding presence. Watch this film and ask yourself: Do you feel lucky?"
