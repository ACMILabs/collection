        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Developing image\". Examines the importance of photographs as an historical record of the American experience, and suggests that care must be taken in accepting the photographs as unbiased or entirely realistic. Viewers visit American Civil War locations as they look today and compare them to historical records. Through photographs, the emotions of a community deep in economical and psychological depression at the turn-of-the-century, are highlighted."
