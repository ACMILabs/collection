        "Millers Crossing contains all the elements of the classic gangster cliches of this genre: fast women, guns and booze. The Coen brothers however have produced a film which is both \"stylish and seamless\", and a \"hero\" who is both a man of principle and a murderer. Starring Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne and Marcia Gay Harden, \"Millers Crossing\" tells the tale of Leo, a benevolent Irish gangster and his trusted lieutenant Tom Reagan. Their control is being threatened by the ever-increasing presence of the \"Italians\". Caught in the grips of a gangland struggle, Tom must walk a tightrope as he tries to control and manipulate the outcome. The Coen's have recreated the look and feel of the gangster era with stunning cinematography and a thrilling plot."
