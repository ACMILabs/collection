        "During a routine peacetime patrol in the Greenland Straits, the USS Bedford's sonar picks up an unidentified submarine. The destroyer's commander, Captain Finlander, (Richard Widmark), relentlessly pursues the lurking sub as a training exercise for his crew, keeping his men at battle stations for hours. Top-flight photo-journalist, Ben Munceford (Sidney Poitier) and NATO observer Schrepke (Eric Portman), try to warn him about this dangerous game, however Finlander is determined to win at all costs. A gripping \"Cold War\" classic."
