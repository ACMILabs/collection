        "New York City, 1941. Barton Fink is a successful Hollywood writer who has come to the land of the rich and famous to make it big in the movies. However, now that Hollywood has embraced him, he finds himself suffering from a severe case of writer's block, has a movie mogul with a passion for wrestling breathing down his neck, and an insane insurance salesman wanting to separate his head from his neck. An enormously amusing crackpot view of the underside of the Hollywood dream and a wonderful, if slightly bizarre, investigation of the creative mind in turmoil. Cast includes John Turturro, John Goodman, Judy Davis, Michael Lerner and John Mahoney."
