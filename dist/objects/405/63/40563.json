        "The greatest space epic of all time reaches its unforgettable conclusion in 2010 - the year we make contact. While the Earth poises on the brink of nuclear self-destruction, a team of Russian amd American scientists, headed by Roy Scheider and Helen Mirren hurtle to a rendezvous with the abandoned Discovery spacecraft and its sole known survivor, the homicidal computer HAL. Their mission is to 'awake' HAL and unravel the puzzling skein of events that culminated in astronaut Dave Bowman's last transmission, \"My God, it's full of stars!\" seen at the end of 2001. This is an emotionally moving thriller in which the human drama takes its rightful place alongside the movie's visual magic."
