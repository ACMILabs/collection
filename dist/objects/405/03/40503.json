        "New York psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand) confronts her own private pain when she delves into Tom Wingo's (Nick Nolte) memories of his family's past. Together they search for the key that may save Tom's twin sister who repeatedly attempts suicide. Nick Nolte gives the most heartfelt and powerful performance of his career as a man who, in order to mend his sister's emotional wounds, must finally come to terms with his own. Based on the best-selling novel by Pat Conroy and nominated for seven Academy Awards, this film is a compelling exploration of love - between men and women, parents and children, and, ultimately, love of oneself."
