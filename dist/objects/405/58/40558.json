        "Kathleen Turner made her acting debut and Kasdan his directorial debut, in this modern day \"film noir\", with a plot resembling that of \"Double Indemnity\". Set in Florida, William Hurt plays attorney Ned Racine. His involvement with the seductive Matty Walker, played by Turner, leads him down the path to murder as they plot to kill her husband, played by Richard Crenna. Turner and Hurt's performances are excellent, yet the film received mixed reactions. Some critics applauded Kasdan's effort to translate the \"film noir\" genre of the 1940's into the more sexually permissable 1980's, while others saw it as a poor remake of a film classic. \"Body Heat\" has the elements of steamy passion, intrigue and murder and features Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke in supporting roles."
