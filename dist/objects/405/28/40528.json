        "Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's rock opera, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" is one of the most successful theatrical musicals of all time. The story of Jesus's Passion is scored to a vibrant, electronic rock beat and is performed by a cast of dancers and singers. The tribal aesthetics of the hippies and the counter-culture are as integral to the work as is the story of the Gospels. Filmed on location in Israel, the movie version of the opera is a pyrotechnic feast with dazzling editing and photography. Finally, however, it is the strength of the music and libretto by which this work has to be judged. The performances of Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene and Carl Anderson as Judas are outstanding. Through their singing, the full tragedy and power of the Passion is realised. Songs include\" \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", \"What's the Buzz\" and a knockout rendition of \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" by Elliman. Melvyn Bragg co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Jewison."
