        "Episode of Series \"The Shirley Temple collection\". After a blistery Southern Colonel (Lionel Barrymore) banishes his daughter (Evelyn Venable) for marrying a Northener (John Lodge), he refuses to see her even when she returns years later with her young daughter (Shirley Temple). As outspoken as her grandfather, the ingenious child turns on plenty of charm and wins his heart. Includes a remarkable tap dance/soft-shoe routine with the famous Bill \"Mr Bojangles\" Robinson. In a role she makes her own, Hattie McDaniel of \"Gone with the wind\" fame, plays Mammy. The original production was in black and white, with the final scene shot in technicolor, however this version has been computer colourised."
