        "After World War One, Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, (Gary Cooper), forsees the deadly power and military importance of airplanes, previously used only by the US Army for reconnaissance. His superiors refuse to heed his advice, despite convincing evidence. When Mitchell persists in his campaign, he is called before a Court Martial and branded a traitor. Although General Duthrie, (Charles Bickford) attempts a cover-up at the trial, it becomes a media event, revealing how one man's vision can shape history. This was the first screen appearance of Elizabeth Montgomery."
