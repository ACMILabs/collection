        "Paul Newman stars as \"Cool Hand Luke\", the irreverent loner, sentenced to work on a chain gang for destroying parking meters. George Kennedy stars as the sadistic convict boss who tries to break Newman's spirit by using an arsenal of punishments and torture such as 'the box'; a windowless cubicle designed to drive an inmate insane. In one of his most memorable parts, Newman as Luke, will not allow himself to succumb to the arbitrary rules of captivity. Nevertheless, the audience is left with an impression of Luke as a victim to be pitied rather than scorned."
