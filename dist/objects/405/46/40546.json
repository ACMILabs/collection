        "It's thanksgiving weekend in New York and Lt. Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) is in town for a slice of the good life: fine cuisine, beautiful women chauffered limousines and a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria. The naive and young Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) is reluctantly along for the ride, getting the education of a lifetime. Slade is one of life's true originals, now blind, irascible yet with a touch of the poet. Charlie is an earnest young prep student facing a difficult crossroads in his life. Their raucous, revealing and at times hysterical adventure in New York will leave them both changed forever."
