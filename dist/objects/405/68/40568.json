        "A wounded Union soldier is discovered by a young student from a crumbling Louisiana girls' school during the Civil War. The academy takes their prize in and cares for him, and the cunning, mysterious soldier uses the all-female situation to coolly play off each of his captors to his own advantage. This carefully manuoevred sexual powderkeg finally explodes and the film spirals downwards into a pit of released repression and psychological horror. Stars Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page. Based on the novel by Thomas Cullinan."
