        "From its seemingly placid opening, this tale of an ordinary British village facing an extraordinary foe keeps piling one eerie and disquieting detail upon another, creating an utterly believable masterpiece of horror. The trouble begins when, one normal day a strange supernatural force makes everybody in the village unconscious. When the villagers come to they they find that every capable woman in the village is pregnant. However, all the children are born on the same day and they all look alike - platinum-blonde hair, piercing eyes and the ability to read the unformed thoughts of human beings. Their rapid physical development is matched by their fast-growing mental powers and with calm, blood-curdling efficiency, they are soon terrorising the tiny hamlet - climaxing in an ending which has long-lasting ramifications on the use and misuse of scientific knowledge. Based on the novel \"The Midwich cuckoos\" by John Wyndham."
