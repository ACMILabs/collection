        "Based on the Neil Simon play, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon star in this offbeat comedy about two divorced men who try to share an apartment in New York without killing each other. Lemmon plays the irritating Felix Unger, obsessive and fussy, who proves that cleanliness is not a virtue, but a mental illness! Matthau, plays the slob Oscar Madison, who wreaks havoc on a room with the speed and thoroughness of a tornado. The performances are excellent, and the precision timing of the two actors infuses the film with a sense of spontaneity."
