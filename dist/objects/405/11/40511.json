        "James Fox is Chas, a working-class London hitman, who is violent, cunning and ruthless. His growing arrogance results in a murder which sets his gangster boss against him. On the run, and fearing for his life, Chas holes up in the basement apartment of an ex-rock star (Mick Jagger) who lives with his two bisexual girlfriends (Anita Pallenberg & Michele Breton). The two men experience an initial repulsion then increasing fascination with each other, and under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, they begin slowly to merge personas. This startling, original film uses the techniques and experiments of underground cinema to investigate the dislocation suffered by both bourgeois and working-class sexualities when confronted by the permissiveness of the hippie subculture. Fox, hard and masculine, and Jagger, soft and androgynous, both give two superb homoerotic performances. The electric rock score includes original music by Mick Jagger, The Last Poets and Ry Cooder."
