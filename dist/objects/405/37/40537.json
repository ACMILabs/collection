        "Cover title: \"The Night of the shooting stars.\" The villagers of San Martino, Tuscany wish upon shooting stars during the Feast of San Lorenzo. It is August 10, 1944 and there is much to wish for. The Germans are retreating. The Blackshirts, still loyal to The Duce, are sweeping the countryside with kamakaze ferocity. The American GI's may arrive tomorrow, or never. An extraordinarly touching, involving, richly textured World War II drama of the final days of World War II prior to liberation by U.S. troops. With simple, lyrical but rivetting images, the filmmakers unravel a life-affirming story of war's absurdities, heroic spirit, hope and survival. Winner Special Prize, Cannes Film Festival. Starring Omero Antonutti and Margarita Lozano. Co-starring Claudio Bigagli, Massimo Bonetti, Norma Martelli, Enrica Maria Modugno and Sabina Vannucchi. Italian dialogue with English subtitles."
