        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Developing image\". The need for accurate recording through photographs is examined, in both the past and the present. The program explores Western survey photography, including an original Western survey album used to persuade Congress to make Yellowstone National Park, Eadweard Muybridge's stop-action photography and Landsat satellite imagery. Photography can now provide viewers insight into places, objects and events, beyond their personal experience."
