        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Art of the western world\". The orgins of humanism and much of Western art can be traced back to Ancient Greece. The development of sculpture, from the archaic, through to classical and the the later more elaborate hellenistic style is discussed by looking at examples of change in the Kouroi and Korai figures. Highlights the perfection reached in architecture, as exemplified by the Parthenon as well as the classic art of pottery decoration in the famous red and black figure vases."
