        "Eric Segal's best-selling novel adapted for the silver screen, became one of the most famous and loved \"tear jerkers\" of cinema history. Starring Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal, they play a young college couple, Jenny and Oliver. The story chronicles their love as they overcome the obstacles of different social status, their marriage and ultimate separation when death claims Jenny. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, the film co-stars Ray Milland and John Marley. The haunting theme song became a hit classic of the movies."
