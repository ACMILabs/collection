        "Whore tells the story of one night in the life of a prostitute. Liz, (Theresa Russell) is a street wise hooker who has seen it all and done it all. In contrast to \"Pretty Woman\", this film does not glamorise prostitution. This is a brash, vulgar depiction of the profession. Although exploitative and titillating in itself, it does raise issues often overlooked in more romantic interpretations, including legalisation, safe sex, drug abuse and the relationship between sex and power."
