        "Based on the Pulitzer prize play written by Mary Chase, James Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Elwood P. Dowd. A good-natured soul, his constant companion is a six-foot-eight rabbit called Harvey, who is only visible to Elwood. To his sister, Veta Louise, Elwood's obsession with Harvey has been a thorn in the side of her plans to marry off her daughter. When she finally decides to commit Elwood to a mental institution, an hilarious mix-up results in her own committal. Elwood and his imaginary friend finally make things right. At the start of this video, Jimmy Stewart talks about the film and his long association with \"Harvey\"."
