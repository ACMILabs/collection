        "With one of the finest film casts ever assembled, this epic has been hailed as the definitive screen version of the life and times of Jesus Christ. As Jesus, the internationally acclaimed Max Von Sydow reveals the compassion, anguish and glory of the \"King of the Jews\" in the performance of a lifetime. The distinguished ensemble cast also features Charlton Heston as John the Baptist, Jose Ferrer as King Herrod, John Wayne as the Centurion, Sidney Poitier as Simon of Cyrene, Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate and Angela Lansbury as Claudia. Combining stellar performances, lavish sets, stunning locations and costing in excess of $20 million dollars, the story is true to the pages of the Gospel, earning five Academy Award nominations to become an enduring and revered classic."
