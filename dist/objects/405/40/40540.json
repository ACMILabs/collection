        "Two lovers could never be more different than the cross-dressing, cigar-smoking writer George Sand (Judy Davis) and the frail, romantic Frederic Chopin (Hugh Grant). The greatest creative minds of all time - including Liszt (Julian Sands), Delacroix (Ralph Brown) and de Musset (Mandy Patinkin) come together for one wild fortnight. The lustful Marie d'Agoult (Bernadette Peters) decides to amuse herself and with her mischievous scheming there is no telling who will end up with who! The outcome is scandalous even by today's standards - an outrageous sex farce that portrays the greatest geniuses with sexual appetites as powerful as their creative fervour. Co-starring Georges Corraface, Anton Rodgers and Emma Thompson."
