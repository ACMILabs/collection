        "Dario Argento's blood thirsty thriller stars British actor David Hemmings. Witnessing the violent murder of a young parapsychologist, Hemmings embarks on a search for the murderer by following the trail of blood and destruction. \"Deep red\" is a film of relentless tension, with a bizarre ending and contains some of cinema's most gripping film sequences. Italian dialogue. Dubbed in English."
