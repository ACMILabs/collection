        "Based on the novel by Bryce Courtenay, this is the story of a young English boy named PK. Orphaned in a foreign land and terrorized for his political beliefs by his schoolmates, the pint-sized youngster turns to the only friend who can help him: a kindly yet world-wise prison inmate who teaches him how to box. As he grows into manhood, he takes on the system and social injustices which arise from Apartheid. Stars Stephen Dorff, Morgan Freeman and Sir John Gielgud and photographed by Australian Dean Semler. One person really can make a difference."
