        "Nellie Melba (Linda Cropper) was the first Australian international \"superstar\". King George V made her a Dame of the British Empire and lovers of singing world-wide idolised her. She achieved fame through a tenacity which took her from an obscure life to the leading stages of Europe and America, but she never once forgot her Australian roots. Melba's private life was as dramatic and extraordinary as her public success. Her complexity matched her fame, as, season after season, she outshone her competitiors to rule the world of the stage for forty years. Featuring the voice of Yvonne Kenny as the Great Dame."
