        "This controversial film was banned for over thirty years in some countries, including Australia. Using a group of circus and carnival performers who were all regarded as \"freaks of nature\" this unsettling film is about a malicious young woman who weds a carnival manager in order to gain his wealth. Her cruel treatment of the various circus performers prompts them to exact a vicious revenge. The final scenes in this movie are possibly some of the most harrowing in horror cinema history."
