        "Double Indemnity is possibly the definitive film noir. It features a sharp, literate screenplay with great dialogue (Raymond Chandler worked on the script), a stylish, cool and erotic mise-en-scene by director Billy Wilder, and a stunning performance by Barbara Stanwyck who, in this film, is queen of the femme fatales. She plays a bewitching ice-princess who seduces a crooked insurance agent (Fred MacMurray) into helping her kill her husband to cash in on his insurance policy. This malevolant, spell-binding thriller is based on James M. Cain's classic pulp novel. Cast also includes Edward G. Robinson."
