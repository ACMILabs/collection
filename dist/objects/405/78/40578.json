        "Based on the stage play by renown author Lillian Hellman, Bette Davis gives an extraordinary performance as Regina, an avaricious wife who will stop at nothing to outwit her brothers in controlling the family business. The cost of this greed results in the death of her ailing husband, Herbert Marshall and rejection by her daughter played by Teresa Wright. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, the acting in this production is flawless, and the story is filled with drama and suspense. The Hubbard family of the \"Deep South\" remain one of the most greedy and rapacious family's bought to the screen."
