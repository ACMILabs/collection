        "Chambermaid Celestine, (Paulette Goddard), a determined young woman wanting to improve her position and willing to use all her assets to do so. She climbs her way up through the various men in her life; her weak master Monsieur Lanlaire (Reginald Owen), his frail son George, (Hurd Hatfield), an eccentric flower-eating farmer/soldier Captain Mauger (Burgess Meredith), and the ruthless valet Joseph (Francis Lederer). What ensues is scandal, blackmail and murder. This was Renoir's fourth American film, based on the novel by Octave Mirabeau."
