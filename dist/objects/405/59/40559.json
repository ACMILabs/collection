        "General Patton was the only Allied General truly feared by the Nazi's. In this riveting portrait of one of the greatest military minds of the modern world, George C. Scott gives an Award winning performance. Patton designed his own uniforms, sported ivory-handled six-shooters, and believed he was a warrior in past lives. Outwitting Rommel in Africa, after D-Day he led his troops across Europe. Rebellious and brilliant, he struggled with his own volatile personality. Co-starring Karl Malden, screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North and winner of eight Academy Awards in 1970."
