        "Cecil B. De Mille's famous epic style is highlighted in this classic Bible story about the legendary strongman Samson, and the temptress Delilah, who seduced, betrayed and helped to destroy him. Victor Mature is the classic Samson; strong, brave and fearless as he wrestles lions and Philistines bare-handed. Hedy Lamarr is stunning as Delilah; in an array of dazzling and seductive costumes. Action packed, this Biblical epic is a spectacle to enjoy. Also stars George Sanders and Angela Lansbury."
