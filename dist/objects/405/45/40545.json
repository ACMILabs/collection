        "A delightful romantic comedy which warms the heart. Cher plays Loretta Castorini, widowed at a young age due to \"bad luck\". Engaged to timid Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), Loretta attempts to mend the estrangement between Johnny and his brother Ronny. Instead, she falls in love with Ronny (Nicholas Cage). \"Moonstruck\" takes us into the hearts and minds of a loving Brooklyn-Italian family, sharing their dramas, tragedies and joys. \"La bella Luna\", the moon, forms a romantic backdrop for the turbulent affairs of the heart and creates an atmosphere where anything can happen, and does! Co-starring Vincent Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis."
