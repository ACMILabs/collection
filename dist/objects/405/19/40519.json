        "Based on Leo Tolstoy's 20th Century masterpiece, it took a decade of preparation and two years of filming to produce this classic version. The personal stories of many characters, love affairs, and philosophies are woven throughout this massive and intricate tapestry of Russia during Napoleon's invasion at the turn of the 19th Century. With great attention to detail and historical accuracy, this epic becomes an unforgettable document as well as a highly moving drama."
