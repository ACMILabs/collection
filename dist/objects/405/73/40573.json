        "Enrico Caruso was considered one of the greatest tenors ever known. Mario Lanza, himself a renown tenor, plays the title role. Studying Caruso's recordings over some years, Lanza sings twenty-seven songs with such passion and sentiment that the result is an outstanding and worthy tribute to the talents of both tenors. The story traces Caruso's career as a cafe singer through to his career at the famous Met. It also follows his happy marriage to Dorothy Benjamin played by Ann Blyth and the troubles he experienced with her family. \"The Great Caruso\" is a musical feast and includes favourite arias from composers such as Verdi and Puccini. Based on Dorothy Caruso's biography of her husband."
