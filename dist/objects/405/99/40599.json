        "Nick Conklin, (Michael Douglas) and Charlie Douglas, (Andy Garcia) are strangers in a strange land. They are New York City cops in Japan, chasing Sato, (Yasuka Matsuda), an escaped murderer and a member of the Yakuza, (the Japanese Mafia). Director Ridley Scott takes the viewer on nightmare journey through the exotic, violent streets of Osaka, into the very heart of the deadly Yakuza. This fascinating thriller tells of men torn by a clash of culture and crime against honour."
