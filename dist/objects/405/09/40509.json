        "Humphrey Bogart is at his best as a hard-boiled sleuth in this '40s film noir classic. He plays Rip Murdock, an ex-GI trying to discover who framed his pal, Johnny, for murder and then rubbed him out. Tracing his war buddy's shadowy past leads Rip to Coral Chandler (Lizabeth Scott), who was once Johnny's sweetheart and is now a chanteuse in a nightclub run by a brutal gangster, Martinelli (Morris Carnovsky). Rip gets a taste of the beautiful blonde's seductive charms and soon finds himself ensnared in a twisted web of deceit and danger."
