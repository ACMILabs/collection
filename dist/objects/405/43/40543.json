        "Comedy set in the red-light district of Paris, where Irma La Douce (Shirley MacLaine) is a \"working girl\". A naive gendarme (Jack Lemmon) falls for the beautiful Irma after conducting a one-man raid on a notorious backstreet establishment. He becomes Irma's \"business manager\" but soon becomes insanely jealous of her clientele and in despair, devises a clever way to keep her all to himself. MacLaine and Lemmon display their impressive comic talents under Billy Wilder's direction. This screen adaptation was based on the successful Broadway musical."
