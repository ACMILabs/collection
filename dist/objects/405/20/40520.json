        "William Hurt is Dr. Eddie Jessup, a scientist obsessed with the most enigmatic of questions: What is God? What is consciousness? How did life begin? His research leads him to experiments with sensory deprivation, schizophrenia, and finally with Native American hallucinogenic drugs which have been used in religious ritual for eons. As his experiments progress Eddie finds himself regressing further into the primordial past and bringing it back into his present. Ken Russell directs with his own hallucinogenic urgency, creating a pop fusion of horror film, psychedelic religiosity, existentialism and sheer knuckle-biting suspense. Wildly misunderstood on its release, \"Altered States\" is a fascinating movie roller-coaster grounded by a devilish sense of humour which refuses to allow the film to drift into pomposity or kant: this is Frankenstein on LSD. Blair Brown is Dr. Jessup's equally brilliant but despairing wife. The enigmatic, frightening music score is by renowned composer John Corigliano."
