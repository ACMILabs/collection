        "Julie Christie won an Academy Award for her performance as an ambitious young model who uses all her assets to achieve social successs. Ultimately, she finds that the life to which she aspired is meaningless and empty. Her relationships with journalist Dirk Bogarde, company director Laurence Harvey, an effeminate photographer and an Italian Prince are never really satisfying. \"Darling\" was groundbreaking in its time because it exposed the \"swinging 60's\" with its more \"modern\" attitudes towards sexuality, homosexuality and infidelity in a frank and adult manner. The viewer may be left feeling that Christie's character is shallow and cold despite her vulnerabilty, and that the emptiness of her life is of her own making."
