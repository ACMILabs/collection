        "He was a writer. She was his \"Number One Fan\". She pulled him out of a car wreck, brought him home, splint and set his mangled legs. All Paul Sheldon had to do in return was write a very special book, just for her, all about her favourite character from his novels. One he had killed off and has to bring back to life. Now he not only has to write to save his character's life, but he also has to write to save his own. James Caan is brilliant as the Gothic novellist who wants to change his genre and Kathy Bates, in her 1990 Best Actress Academy Award winning-role, is perfect as the obsessed fan who only wants to save her favourite character, even if it means killing the person who created it! Cast also includes: Lauren Bacall, Richard Farnsworth"
