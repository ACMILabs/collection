        "Heaven's gate is one of the most talked-about films in cinema history and based on events which occurred in Wyoming in 1892 when ruthless ranchers decided to kill starving immigrants who had been stealing cattle. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken play lawman and hitman on opposite sides of the struggle, who share the love of Ella, played by Isabelle Huppert. The original film was cut by 70 minutes and was never acclaimed in the United States as it was in Europe. This version is presented in its entirety and has compelling performances by the supporting cast of John Hurt, Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston and locational shoots of breathtaking beauty."
