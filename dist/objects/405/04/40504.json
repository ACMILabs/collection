        "Here's your ticket to \"Shuffle off to Buffalo\" with Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell in this beguiling Busby Berkeley showcase; a bold, enticing feast of choreography and imagination. Warner Baxter stars as Julian Marsh, a tyrannical director of Broadway musicals. When his show's leading lady, played by Bebe Daniels, breaks her ankle on the eve of opening night, a wide-eyed chorus girl played by Ruby Keeler is thrust into the role. Also stars George Brent, Una Merkel and Dick Powell."
