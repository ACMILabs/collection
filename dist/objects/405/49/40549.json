        "Audrey Hephurn stars as Holly Golightly in the film based on the short story by Truman Capote. Holly's almost frosty sophistication is only a veneer. Hepburn convey's Holly's underlying fragility with poignance and sympathy. George Peppard, as Paul the writer, like Holly is searching to find a place amongst the \"fleshpots\" and \"rats\" of New York. As their love blossoms, Paul must come to terms with the fact that Holly is a girl on the run, not only from the past, but from herself. New York, Tiffany's, Givenchy's stunning wardrobe for Hepburn, the magical music of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's song \"Moon River\", help make this film a cinema classic. Mickey Rooney as Holly's slightly deranged Japanese landlord, delights in a hilarious comic cameo."
