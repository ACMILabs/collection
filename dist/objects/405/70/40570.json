        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Art of the western world\". Michael Wood and Richard Brilliant look at Roman architecture which embodied the austere ideals of this conquering empire. The discovery and use of concrete and the development of architectural forms based on the keystone arch is highlighted as these had a significant effect on building design in Europe. The Panthenon is seen as a landmark structure and the transition of pagan symbols and forms into Early Christian society is discussed."
