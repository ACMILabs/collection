        "Welcome to the future where humankind has been decimated due to the effects of biological warfare. Robert Neville, played by Charlton Heston, roams the windy, ghostly streets of Los Angeles, searching for supplies. At sundown, other \"survivors\" emerge; the blood-thirsty \"Family\", neopeople who are not quite human. Rosalind Cash stars as the caretaker of a small but healthy band of children who represent the future of our species. Together, she and Heston, must keep them from \"The Family's\" grasp. Based on Richard Matheson's classic sci-fi novel \"I am a legend\"."
