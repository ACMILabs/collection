        "Master filmmaker Scorcese tackled the re-make of the original 1962 classic with resounding success. Cape Fear is more than a journey towards terror and death. Fourteen years after being imprisoned, vicious psychopath Cady, played chillingly by Robert De Niro, emerges with a single-minded mission: to seek revenge on his attorney Sam Bowden, (Nick Nolte). His purpose, to upset the fragile equilibrium of Sam's family life with his wife, (Jessica Lange), and teenage daughter, (Juliette Lewis), escalates until their very lives are threatened. Ultimately, Sam has to resort to unorthodox measures, but cannot escape the ultimate showdown in the murky, stormy waters of Cape Fear. Visually stunning images, and brilliant performances, plus cameo roles from original cast members (Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam) highlight this roller-coaster ride through relentless psychological torment. Screenplay Wesley Strick, based on the screenplay by James R. Webb on the novel 'The Executioners' by John D. Macdonald. Bernard Herrmann's original score has been adapted, arranged and conducted by Elmer Bernstein. Edited by Thelma Schoonmaker. Cinematography by Freddie Francis. Credits by Elaine and Saul Bass."
