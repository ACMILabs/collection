        "The producers of the original \"Night of the living dead\" have remade their classic horror film - this time in gruesome living colour. The story faithfully follows that of the original film - seven strangers trapped in a remote farmhouse while outside an army of undead closes in! The use of high-tech, state-of-the-art technology makes possible special effects that George A. Romero would only have dreamed of while directing the 1968 version with a below $200,000 budget. Nevertheless the dimly shot black-and-white images of the original were far creepier than their modern counterparts."
