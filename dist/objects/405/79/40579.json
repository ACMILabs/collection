        "Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers and Charles Coburn star in the zany Howard Hawks comedy about a chemist who discovers a potent rejuvenation drug. Dr. Barnaby Fulton is a staid scientist working on a youth restoring serum with no success when one of the laboratory chimpanzees accidentally concocts the formula. Fulton and his wife try it with hilarious results and successive doses result in increasingly more juvenile behaviour. When others taste the potion, including Fulton's stuffy boss and his voluptuous secretary, the laboratory really goes wild!"
