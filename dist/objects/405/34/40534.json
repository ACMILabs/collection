        "Despite the sceptics, Milos Forman transformed the ultimate \"tribal rock musical\" of the 1960's into an exuberant film experience. The score is performed in a variety of locations including table tops, Central Park, Wall Street and in march formation aboard a plane heading for Vietnam. \"Hair\" is not just a nostalgic look at the '60's and \"The Age of Aquarius\", but the ideals it espouses about peace, individual freedom, joy and love are just as passionate and relevant today, as they were shocking and radical at the time of America's involvement in Vietnam. Gerome Ragni and James Rado worked on this film production of their original stageplay."
