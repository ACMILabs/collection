        "Pierre and Jean journey to a holy shrine in Northern Spain (Santiago de Compostella). Are they pilgrims or tramps? No one knows their identity or their true motives. During the course of their pilgrimage, their faith is severely tested by some of the irreverent characters. Even chance meetings with Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Devil are not quite what Pierre and Jean have been prepared for through their religious training. This late Bunuel film is one of his most direct treatment of the Catholic Church and the six central mysteries of Catholic dogma: the nature of God, Christ, the Virgin Mary, the Eucharist, divine grace and evil. In French with English subtitles."
