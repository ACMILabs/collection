        "Nobody seems to have time for four year old Jairan. She is from a large Tehranean family, where her parents have to work and her brothers and sisters are all too busy with their homework. One day she manages to convince her neighbour, Mrs Khanoom, to take her on a shopping expedition for a bag of rice. This proves to be demanding feat when, after making their way through the busy streets of Tehran, they find that the shop has already closed."
