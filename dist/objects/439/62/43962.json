        "The onset of menstruation leads to a curious mix of events when Raffaella shares the news with her traditional Italian Aunt. Together they make some special Italian love biscuits, \"biscotti di amore\", with a secret ingredient intimately linked with Raffaella's menarche. When the object of her affections tastes the love biscuits, surprisingly, he asks for the recipe."
