        "This tape is a compilation of 4 award winning films from animator Antoinette Starkiewicz. Included on the tape are: \"Pianoforte\"; The animated adventures of an ambitious young girl pianist taken from the simplicity and magic of childhood into the baroque world of the nightclub. Led by a malevolent master of ceremonies into a hot pink pleasure den devoted to rhumba rhythms and erotic boogie, she is trapped, only to escape through the powers of love. \"Pussy pumps up\"; This is an allegorical tale explaining the differences and similarities of men and women. Pussy has the ability to transpose herself between the opposites, and in so doing typifies the traits of both in unity and division. \"Putting on the ritz\"; This is a kind of animated tribute to Fred Astaire, led by a tap dancing hero who leads a bevy of beautiful babes through an Irving Berlin song. \"High fidelity\"; A young girl, an amalgam of Marilyn Monroe and Shirley Temple goes through her the tricks and steps at her disposal to catch her dancing man."
