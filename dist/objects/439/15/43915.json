        "Since the collapse of his business, Victor (Meyer) has grown increasingly morose, ill tempered, selfish and demanding. Unaware of the plight of his wife and three children to keep the family fed and clothed, Victor persists in treating his wife harshly, and her health deteriorates. To aid her recovery, Victor's wife is sent away from the home duties that have burdened her for so long. In exchange, Victor's old nanny moves in, and treating him as if he was the age when she initially cared for him, shows him the path towards self recognition and amends his cruel ways. Cast includes Johannes Meyer, Astrid Holm, Mathilde Nielson and Clara Schonfeld."
