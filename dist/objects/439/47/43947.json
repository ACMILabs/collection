        "In Stanley Kubrick's chilling adaptation of a Stephen King horror novel, Jack Torrance, a struggling writer, accepts a job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, a luxurious but remote resort with a macabre history of violence. The hotel is closed for the winter, and Jack, his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, will be the only residents for several snowy months. Jack hopes that the solitude will give him a chance to focus on his writing, but he soon spirals helplessly towards madness and murder as the hotel's power plays upon his weaknesses. Cast includes: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Scatman Crothers and Danny Lloyd."
