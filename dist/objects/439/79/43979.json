        "A stranger from the West, Indian actor Billy \"Butch\" Bathshebas (Vejay Shanmugam), arrives in Australia fresh from the glitz of the Bombay studios. In correspondence to his father back home, Billy initially embellishes his flourishing cowboy life and acting career in Australia, that is until he lands a part in a chip commercial. On the set he meets a \"real\" cowboy, and the two are pitted in an ultimate showdown which has surprising results."
