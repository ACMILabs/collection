        "A documentary about a feminist run abortion clinic. Counselling is shown to be an important part of the procedure, which is carried out using local anaesthetic and the vacuum aspiration method. We follow one woman through the termination of her pregnancy, and other women tell why they chose to have an abortion. The film ends with an animated section on the struggle for free, legalised abortion in Australia and information on what to do and where to go if you are pregnant."
