        "A world-class violinist, a committed teacher of young musicians, an active supporter of human rights, a compassionate man. Now in his eighties, Yehudi Menuhin relaxes at home and reflects on his remarkable life. Using a wealth of archival footage, this documentary traces Lord Meuhin's long and varied career, his childhood, his musical influences, and his humanity for those less fortunate than himself."
