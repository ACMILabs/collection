        "Photographed by Frank Hurley, 'South' is the film record of Sir Ernest Shackleton's heroic but ill-starred attempt to cross Antarctica in 1914-16. It is both a historical document, and a tribute to the indomitable courage of the 28 men who set out on a voyage of discovery that turned into an epic struggle for survival. Silent with original music by Neil Brand."
