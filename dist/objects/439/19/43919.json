        "The setting is a Tokyo brothel, ironically called Dreamland. The content is the thoughts, disappointments and aspirations of the occupants. This was Mizoguchi's final film, and one in which he returned to his earlier theme of the exploitation of women throughout the ages. He does so by integrating the stories of five prostitutes which covers the roles of women as daughters, mothers and wives. Many believe that this film was pivotal in the 1957 decision to abolish prostitution in Japan. Cast includes Daisuke Kato, Machiko Kyo and Aiko Mimasu."
