        "Ergonomics is the study of the relationship between people, the equipment they use, and the physical environment in which they work. Ergonomics is a continuous process which aims to improve productivity and health through practical measures which reduce difficult situations. This program and guide looks at how ergonomics is applied, static and dynamic muscular effort, visual controls and displays, as well as a follow up questionnaire."
