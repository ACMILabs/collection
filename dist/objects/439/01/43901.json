        "Union Street is a street just like any other, situated opposite the train line and underneath the flight path. None of the residents get along with each other particularly well, they just go about their daily business in isolation from the activities occurring next door. All this changes when the Armstrong-Taylors decide to renovate, acting as the catalyst to community involvement. The microcosm of the neighbourhood acts as a commentary on the changing face of Australia as the different cultural backgrounds of the individual households interact. Narrated by Andrew Denton."
