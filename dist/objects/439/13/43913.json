        "In the first half a kidnapping takes place and a ransom is negotiated; the second half deals with the manhunt for the kidnapper. The Japanese title - Heaven and Hell - directly suggests exact opposites and more clearly encapsulates the theme. It begins in 'Heaven' - the apartment high over the city - and ends in 'Hell' - the alleyways of Yokohama. The first half is superficially theatrical in its refusal of conventional editing strategies but actually is notable for its subtle dramatic geometry involving permutations of position and composition afforded by the Scope screen. Multiple cameras were used to film long takes. The film suddenly opens out into an action-packed chase. Based on the novel \"King's Ransom\" by Ed McBain. Cast includes Toshiro Mifune, Tatsuya Nakadai, Kyoko Kagawa. In Japanese with English subtitles."
