        "A sexually repressed but inquisitive wife stumbles across an interactive pornographic computer program when she borrows her workmates computer. The program is AUDACIOUS; a husband and wife team who invites you to share your fantasies. She submits her fantasies, and becomes addicted to watching them being enacted on the videos they create. Her husband discovers the videos, leading them to question the relevance fantasy has to their marriage. Sometimes simple fantasies are the most telling. Cast includes Dee Smart, John Polson and Aden Young."
