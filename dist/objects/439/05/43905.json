        "Attracted by the myths of town life, and the chance of work, people from villages all over Papua New Guinea have come to the towns. This documentary tells the story of two such migrants living in the settlements that surround the Capital Port Moresby. Cowboy is a reformed 'rascal' who plays rock and roll on a homemade guitar in the street earning just enough for his family to get by. Maria lives an equally precarious existence. Seasonal gardening, and her husband's small income as a night security guard are their means of survival. Cowboy and Maria are vital players in the new urban Papua New Guinea. Their interwoven stories highlight the consequences of urban drift, where traditional and Western values meet."
