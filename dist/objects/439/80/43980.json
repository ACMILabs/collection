        "Jimmy's attempted escape from the threatening Louis who wants a dept repaid takes him into the outback. But it may as well be around the block, as Louis seems to know exactly where Jimmy is headed. This black comedy is a road movie which playfully engages with genre's conventions. Fortuitous encounters along the way are casual yet quirkily loaded, almost predestined, as the surprise twist at the end of the journey reveals. Cast includes Noah Taylor and Hugo Weaving."
