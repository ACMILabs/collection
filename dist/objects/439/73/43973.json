        "You may not know the name Deborah Halpern, but you will certainly recognise her ceramic sculpture with its unique tiling located out the front of the National Gallery of Victoria. Hers is the story of a young ceramic sculptor with no formal training whose public profile has proliferated as the result of an unexpected major commission from one of Australia's most prestigious art galleries. Deborah Haplpern's art is inspired by Niki de Phalle, the 'Art Brut' movement and the 'Outsider' artists of Europe who live and work outside the mainstream gallery system. In this documentary Deborah talks intimately about the influence of these artists on her work and life. It outlines the structure of her sculpture, Angel, as well as the artistic and intellectual processes and motivation behind her work. This is a story of achievement. It is a passionate account of a two year project, the journey of a young artist and her triumphant arrival into the public art forum."
