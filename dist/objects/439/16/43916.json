        "Helena, manager of flamboyant suburban heavy metal \"vampire\" band Catwitch, has great expectations for their success. Her aspirations are hampered by the reality of organising a group of suburban boys. Through insight into family relationships and the everyday lives of band members and fans, we see how excessive music has a direct relationship to the suburban culture from which they come. A heady mix between heightened fantasy and suburban reality."
