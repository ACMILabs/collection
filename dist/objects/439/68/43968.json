        "The story begins and ends with a funeral. A group of female friends unite for a night of drugs, music and memories under the full moon. One of the girls has been away to the city, and discovers that things don't stay the same, that friendships change, and can be challenged and proven very quickly. Cast includes Raelee Hill and Brigid Kelly."
