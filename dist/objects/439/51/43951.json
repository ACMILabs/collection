        "'Conspiracy' is a dramatic and thought provoking investigation into the bomb attack at the Sydney Hilton Hotel in 1978. It does so through stylised re-enactments and studio interviews and poses such troubling questions as how the bombers managed to evade a huge security operation, mounted at a Commonwealth level. 'Conspiracy' ponders where the bomb was made, the questionable preparedness of the bomb disposal unit, and the abandonment of sniffer dogs prior to the incident. These questions were first asked years ago, they are continuing to be asked at a Federal level in parliament."
