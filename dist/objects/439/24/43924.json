        "This video covers the basics of ferret management and breeding for those keeping ferrets for working, racing, or as pets. Advice on choosing a ferret, types of housing, and what to feed them. The video follows a kit (baby ferret), from birth to its care at different ages, and covers how to train, handle and breed. The video explores the myth of ferrets being aggressive animals, revealing how engaging and good-natured they can be. Presented by James McKay, zoologist, writer, broadcaster, and internationally acknowledged as one of the world's leading authorities on ferrets."
