        "Set in a bleak north-east American beach town, this nihilistic drama circulates around Luane, the bedridden town gossip, who manipulates members of the down-and-out community with her vicious rumour-mongering. Her machinations drive her victims to increasingly desperate acts that cumulate in a final showdown. While the world Greenwald reveals is relentlessly bleak, her portrayal of human sleaze and savagery is achieved by subtle means. She injects Thompson's novel with a wry black humour and a hint of the surreal."
