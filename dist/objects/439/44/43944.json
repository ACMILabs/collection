        "An intense, psychological comedy/drama about a disabled girl, Angela (Andrea Schober), who plots to get herself, both her parents (Alexander Allerson and Margit Cristensen), and their respective lovers (Anna Karina and Ulli Lommel) to the family's country house all at the same time. The scene is set for a weekend of intense embarassments and confrontations, climaxing in the game of psychological warfare, Chinese Roulette. Typically Fassbinder, the film is a biting attack on the institution of marriage and on middle-class morality. In German with English subtitles."
