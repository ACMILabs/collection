        "Producer and presenter Greg Grainger embarks on a journey into the ancient civilization of Egypt's past, as well as the vibrancy of modern Egypt. He begins his journey at Abu Simbel near the Sudanese border, sails across dams in Aswan, along the river Nile to Luxor, and in Cairo explores new excavations around the pyramids. Along the way he encounters boatmen, bellydancers, feasts, markets, bazaars, and wedding festivities. The sights and sounds are a lasting legacy of an amazing ancient culture."
