        "Closely follows a group of American women recruits through a grueling six weeks of basic training, during which time, some manage and some fail to come to terms with some of the realities that recruiting brochures never mentioned. Closely follows the four women at Fort Gordon, Georgia through the mental and physical rigors of the camp. \"Soldier Girls\" was the winner of the 1981 British Film Awards' best documentary award."
