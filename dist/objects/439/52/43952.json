        "Caravan Park is filmed both from the point of view of a small child and from an observer. A family of three is stranded in a caravan park when their car breaks down on the road home. A stray cat found near the car is taken as a good luck sign by the father and adopted by his son. As the family continues to struggle to make ends meet and get back on the road, the cat continues to be a sign of good luck for the father, until it dies. This is a slow paced narrative and requires careful examination of the characters to understand its purpose."
