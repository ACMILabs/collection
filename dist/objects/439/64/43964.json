        "Phoebe, Spencer, Felix and Mike have reached a point in their lives where they can no longer call Australia home. Is this due to the recurring statement that Australia is the little brother of America, or the fact that they work at \"All American Videos, where too much is never enough\"? It is in the videostore, a direct representation of American popular culture, that they devise a plan to rob a bank. They use their favourite films as source material to create the perfect crime."
