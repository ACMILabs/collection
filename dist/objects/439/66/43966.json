        "This clever clay animation film centres around a gathering of elderly women neighbours who meet for their weekly gossip. Item number one on the agenda, \"rats\" (whom one presumes represents men), and those women who are devilish enough to keep them in a building that prohibits their existence. Adapted from a short story by Olga Masters and featuring the voices of Penny Biggins and Gretel Killeen."
