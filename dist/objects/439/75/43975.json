        "Two women who live quiet, eccentric lives have to come to terms with the possibility of separation when one of them has a stroke. At the point when Martha's only option is being placed in aged care, Nancy steps in to bolster her friend's spirits. This is a sensitive portrayal of two older women's friendship and their struggle to retain this special relationship amid a daughter's intention to place Martha in care. Cast includes Melissa Jaffer, Betty Lucas and Judy Morris."
