        "From dawn one morning until dawn the next day, a man in deep despair tries to end his life by jumping off \"The Gap\", a cliff at the mouth of the Sydney Harbour. The entrance is one of mixed and dichotomous meanings, as it is the gateway to a majestic city as well as a place of unutterable sadness where people go to die. Two cops are sent to talk him down. The man outdoes them in his dignity and his courage."
