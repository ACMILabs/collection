        "Initially following the trajectory of a car which is taking 'The Girl' (Celia Ireland), out to a social function, this short film allows the viewer to be privy to the thought processes of what it means to go \"out\". The girl ponders issues such as timing, kissing, a no sex policy, being interesting, making an impression, pit stops, and identifying the highlight of the evening. Cast also includes John Polson and Suzy Dougherty."
