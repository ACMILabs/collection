        "The great impressionist Monet created his most inspirational subject on his own doorstep; Giverny is a garden that was planted to be painted. The production crew of this outstanding documentary were given unlimited access to Monet's estate for a year, which allows the viewer to witness the full cycle of the seasons. Monet was a passionate horticulturalist who invested a lot of time in the garden at Giverny; this programme explores the enduring legacy of beauty that he left in the garden and in his art, and the incredible interrelationship between the two. Includes interviews with artists Kaffe Fassett and Paul Riley and photographer and Monet authority Vivian Russell."
