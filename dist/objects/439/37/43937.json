        "Canadian independent filmmaker and animator Caroline Leaf is most recognised for the animated shorts she created for the National Film Board of Canada. To make her films she prefers alternative methods to the traditional \"cell\" animation, which she feels is devoid of emotion. \"Out on a Limb\" is a compilation of her works. In \"The Owl Who Married a Goose\" (producer, Pierre Moretti) she uses sand to create the the image. With \"Entre Deaux Soeurs/Between Two Sisters\" (producers, Robert Forget and Yves Leduc)she scratches emulsion from the film stock. In \"The Street\" (producer, Caroline Leaf), Leaf utilises waterbased tempera colours mixed with oil on milkglass as a medium. Her other films include \"The Interview\" (producer, David Verall), \"I Met a Man\" (producer, Caroline Leaf), \"The Metamorphosis of Mr Samsa\" (producer, Caroline Leaf) and \"Hand Crafted Cinema\" (producer and director, Erik Roberts), which is a filmed workshop where she talks about her work."
