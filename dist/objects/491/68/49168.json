        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Jazz\". The third volume in the comprehensive series on the history of Jazz music in America contains three episodes which outline the developments in Jazz and its symbolism in the United States as well as world wide during World War II, and discusses Jazz in immediate post war America and the constant issues of race and segregation that underlay its history and evolution. Episode seven traces Swing as a symbol of freedom on the world front, acting as a reminder and support to those that went to war and those at home through musicians like Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Dave Brubeck, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington and their spokesmanship in support programs, recordings for soldiers and their constant tours at home and to soldiers' camps throughout war ravaged Europe. This episode also details the simultaneous revolutionary developments in the underground Jazz scene on the home front in the United States, despite war time difficulties. Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker emerged, as did Minton's Playhouse where such musicians were encouraged to jam and experiment outside the regimentation of the Big Bands. Other musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Roy Elderidge, Milt Hinton, Mary Lou Williams and Chew Berry also flourished and developed through this outlet and contributed to the formulation of a new direction in the performance and composition of Jazz. The eighth episode traces the Nazi's various failed attempts to crush Jazz, including reconfiguring classic tunes into propaganda music, but Jazz abounded in the underground resistance movement, especially through Parisian musicians such as Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelly. In the United States, the heart of Jazz moved from the now dangerous Harlem, where the hypocrisy of discriminatory legislation and racial violence was most pointed, to 52nd Street in New York. Here the innovations occurring in the American Jazz scene began to be heard more widely, especially following the lifting of a two year recording ban, with a mixed reception but undoubted impact on the direction Jazz was to take as the Big Band era came to an end. Episode nine details the end of the Swing bands, as singers were foregrounded and Jam session improvisation style performances of instrumental Jazz took precedence with the emergence of Bebop. Jazz audiences shrunk as those used to more dance style Jazz were confused by the new form but its development flourished along with further revolutionary styles that emerged to recapture broader audiences. The international profile of Jazz increased further with the first International Jazz Festival in 1949, as did its protagonists' impact on discrimination as mixed performances increased and the determination of musicians to defy segregation became more powerful. At the same time the influence of narcotics began to change the dynamic of Jazz in some areas, with many young musicians effected in a wave of increased usage, including the renowned Charlie Parker, temporarily slowing new innovations."
