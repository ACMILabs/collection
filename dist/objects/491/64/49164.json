        "This moody, atmospheric rendition of the Henry James novel stars Jodhi May as the governess entrusted with the care of two seemingly adorable children whom she suspects may be under the influence of supernatural powers. Rumours abound regarding the previous governess - Miss Jessel, who killed herself when she became pregnant to her master's valet, Peter Quint, also now dead. Both Jessel and Quint begin appearing to the governess, who learns the children can see them too, particularly the boy. Unable to contact the orphaned children's guardian (Colin Firth) due to a clause in her contract which prohibits any contact, the young governess must face the unknown alone if she is to save the soul of the children. Cast also includes Pam Ferris, Joe Sowerbutts and Grace Robinson."
