        "French cinemagazine items:  1. Le Centres Economiques - fishing and harvesting pose a problem for French economists in dealing with consumers and supplying a growing urban population. 2. Pierre Cardin and the car - creations are meant to be worn for the future. He models his fashions like a sculptor. Like a car he considers \"details\" and \"accessories\" are most important. Fashions are made for the street. 3. Le Hotesses Internationales - several young women got together and created \"International Hostesses\" to help guide foreign businessmen arriving in Paris. 4. Gustave Courbet - an artist born 150 years ago who launched a campaign of \"realism\" despite much criticism and died a social outcast. An exhibition is held to celebrate his work. 5. Herbert Von Karajan - following charles Munch's death, the Orchestra de Paris invited karajan to be its musical director. We see him rehearsing Brahms Requiem."
