        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Jazz\". The second volume in the comprehensive series on the history of Jazz music in America contains three episodes which outline the developments in Jazz in the period leading to and throughout the Depression up to World War II and discusses the constant issues of race and segregation that underlay the history and development of Jazz. The fourth episode details the emergence of Jazz as a widely popular form in the 1930's with its increased exposure to a wide range of people in radio broadcasts, through the distribution of recordings, national and international tours and the opening of legal Speakeasies which increasingly demanded Jazz bands as their main attractions. Band leaders and composers Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington featured prominently at this time, with national and international tours and performances on live radio programs such as the Saturday night 3 hour feature, \"Let's Dance\", and nation-wide broadcasts from the Cotton Club, opening the way for the beginning of the Swing Era. Episode five details the revolutionary impact of Jazz, renamed Swing, re-defining the notion of popular American music and dance scenes for a whole generation. Along with the celebrated names that consistently featured, the emergence of numerous Big Bands introduced a mixture of Swing and more classical styles, adding their own innovations and performance styles to the development of Jazz and featuring musicians such as: Tommy Dorsy; Woody Herman; Bob Crosby; Dave Brubeck; Artie Shaw and the showman extraordinaire, Glen Millar. Innovations also came about in the emergence of one of the most important female vocalists in Jazz, Billie Holiday, and the beginning of the collapse of musical segregation through the actions of band leaders such as Benny Goodman and Chick Webb, though the country remained less colour blind than the music itself for some time to come. The final episode in this volume covers the position of Jazz as Swing became a national craze, through big business and events such as the 1938 debut outdoor Jazz festival, and as World War II began. It also details the transformation from Big Band swing to more solo oriented performances. In particular with the impact of the styles of Count Basie, Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young as the virtuosity of particular instruments such as the saxophone and the singing voice in the case of Billie Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald became striking features of Jazz performances and expansive musical exploration and innovation."
