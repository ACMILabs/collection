        "Based on the novel by Thomas Hardy, \"The Woodlanders\" is a passionate story of love. Giles Winterborne (Rufus Sewell) and Grace Melbury (Emily Woof) have had an agreement to marry since childhood. However, Grace's return from boarding school and subsequent elevation in society cause their engagement to be called off. Silently adored by his friend, Marty, Giles continues to pine for Grace, whilst she in turn falls in love with the handsome new doctor, Fitzpiers. But as they follow their separate courses, Grace and Giles find that their lives become inextricably entwined."
