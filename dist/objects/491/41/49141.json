        "From celebrated epic disaster movie director Irwin Allen, this tale of destruction wrought by swarms of millions of killer African and South American bees stands alongside \"The Poseidon adventure\" and \"Towering Inferno\" in Allen's production record, though with a somewhat lesser impact. Entomologist Brad Crane (Michael Caine) discovers that deadly South American bees have been breeding with their harmless relations in the North. Worse still, something is making them come together in huge killer swarms and the terror of their destruction threatens to spread throughout North America. As the bees close in on Houston, Crane joins forces with General Slater (Richard Widmark) to try and stop the devastation. Filmed with an estimated 22 million bees, this doomsday epic also boasts a collection of stars including Katherine Ross, Olivia de Havilland, Henry Fonda, Fred MacMurray, Richard Chamberlain, Jose Ferrer, Patty Duke Astin, Lee Grant and Bradford Dillman."
