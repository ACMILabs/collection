        "Set in Ireland in the 1820s, this is the story of Irish-born American Sean Thornton (John Wayne) who, after a long and profitable career as a boxer, returns home to settle down and forget a tragic accident in the boxing ring which killed his opponent. Sean buys back his ancestral home, Thornton Cottage, much to the disgust of the neighbouring squire, Red Will Danaher (Victor McLagen). To further complicate matters, Sean has fallen in love with Red Will's sister, Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara). Sean must battle against all manner of Irish blarney to get the hand of the girl he loves. This amusing romantic comedy was a change of pace for John Wayne (and John Ford) at the time, although the movie is usually remembered for the fight scene between the characters of O'Hara and Wayne which culminates in him dragging her across a field followed by the entire village."
