        "French cinemagazine items including: 1. The Comparison Salon - For the organisers of the Comparison Salon, faithful to the guiding principles uniting them, it is necessary to adapt to the changes of an art in perpetual movement. 2. Marshal Foch - France paid a solemn tribute to Marshal Foch on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his nomination as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces during World War One. 3. The lovers of Provence - Many are the lovers of Provence, with its flowers blowing in the breeze, with its fragrant forests, and with its criss-crossing streams glistening. 4. Decorations and forms - In 1900, on every street corner, paris discovered an art with fluid forms...it was called \"art nouveau\". 5. \"Do's and don'ts\" for tourists - You cannot help but enjoy your stay in the French capital, on the one condition that you know the mores."
