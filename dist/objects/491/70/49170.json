        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Jazz\". The first volume in the comprehensive series on the history of Jazz in America contains three episodes which look at the earliest musical roots and founding pioneers of Jazz music from its beginnings in New Orleans to its gradual popularisation across America up to the roaring twenties and which, throughout, discusses the constant issues of race and segregation that underlay the history and development of Jazz. The first episode details the origins of Jazz in the diverse musical expression of immigrant Americans and slaves in New Orleans, in the formation of Minstrel Troops and following the Civil War, in the development of Ragtime, Blues and Gospel and the influx of Creole musicians into Black bands whose subsequent combination of diversely trained and personal, secular and spiritual styles of music contributed to the development of the early Jazz tradition. The program then traces the innovation of personality in Jazz as individual musicians such as Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton, Sidney Bichett, James Reece Europe and Freddie Keppard reformulated the emergent music and invented new hybrid styles which they toured across America, beginning the solidification of the broadly popular appeal of Jazz along with its first recordings by the Original Dixieland Band in 1917. Episode two details the configuration of Jazz into a more recognised art form through the emergence of gifted musicians such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, who embodied the future of the craft, and the appearance of varied and ground breaking Jazz scenes in Chicago and New York that fostered them and others. From the virtuoso piano playing of the Harlem stride masters to the society, Jazz scene of popular band leaders such as Fletcher Henderson and Paul Whiteman, Jazz became an ever more popular and creative art form that increasingly showcased individuals' musical talents and their diversity of personal expression. The third episode traces the careers and contribution to the form of such musicians including Armstrong, Ellington, Bessie Smith, Bix Beiderbecke, Frankie Trumbauer, Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw in a definitive outline of the enthusiastic Jazz age that thrived in the speakeasies and clubs of the 1920s before the onset of the Great Depression."
