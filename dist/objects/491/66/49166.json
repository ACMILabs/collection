        "Set against the Tredegar riots against Jewish shops in 1911, \"Solomon and Gaenor\" is a tragic love story of Jewish cloth merchant, Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd), and Gaenor (Nia Roberts), daughter of a struggling Welsh mining family. Solomon keeps his Jewish heritage a secret from his new love, who becomes frustrated by his inability to settle down and marry, and for the unspoken secrets between them. They are forced to re-evaluate their relationship when Gaenor falls pregnant and tensions mount between striking Welsh miners and Jewish storeholders, placing Solomon's family in the front line. Director Paul Morrison asserts that the film is principally about the universal notion that we hide aspects of ourselves from those we love. He also manages to capture a painful chapter in the British Jewish experience. Cast also includes Sue Jones Davies, William Thomas and Mark Jones. In Welsh, Hebrew and English with English subtitles."
