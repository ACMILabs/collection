        "French cinemagazine items:  1. Travaux d'equipement - Planning and development is necessary for the growing number of vehicles in Paris. More areas for car parking are being built; also a new boulevard circling Paris will be completed in two years. In the provinces, similar progress is being made to build super highways. 2. La France et L'Europe Spatials - Paris is the headquarters for the launching of the European space research. Its object is to place a stationary satelite in circular orbit for an independent European telecommunication and world-wide television use. 3. Femetres sur le Passe - A showcase on the past. The left bank of Paris is the mecca for all things antique. The 4th International Biennale Antiques Show held at the Grand Palais in Paris, 28 Sept-20 Oct 1968 for lovers of antiques and beauties of the past."
