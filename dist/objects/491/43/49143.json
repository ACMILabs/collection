        "Episode of Series \"Religions of the world\". This documentary turns its focus back into history to examine the diverse spiritual traditions of ancient Mediterranean cultures, and offer insight as to how the rituals and belief systems of these societies may have influenced modern religions such as Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Humanity's basic desire to co-exist in harmony with the natural world was one of the primary factors involved with the increasing worship and deification of animal spirits. Agricultural advances saw wild animals - and therefore, wild spirits - being simultaneously domesticated. Gods and goddesses portrayed in a more accessible human form, or in a human form merged with that of an animal, grew in popularity. From Mesopotamia and Egypt to the Greek and Roman empires, different forms of worship, underpinned by similar archetypal myths and images, flourished and expanded. Narrated by Ben Kingsley. Includes teacher's notes."
