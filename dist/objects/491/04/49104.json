        "French cinemagazine items including: 1. Bicentennial - the President of the French Republic in Ajaccio, Corsica, officiates over celebrations of the bicentennial of Napoleon's birth. 2. Folk traditions - 11 nations take part in the 12th Annual International Folklore Festival at Confolens, in Charente. 3. Kinetic art - two Paris galleries and the Museum of Modern Art present exhibitions of Kinetic Art. 4. An old gem found again - after the Central Market of Les Halles moved out of Paris, Parisians rediscovered the Church of Saint-Eustache, a gem of medieval architecture and a regular museum, with an organ which is one of the finest in the world."
