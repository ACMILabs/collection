        "'Mary' combines colour film from the early 1950s as well as modern 16mm footage. Scratched and painted upon, this experimental film links timeless images of the ocean with old footage of a young woman.  The effect is both mysterious and moody creating an intangible, lingering feeling of melancholy."
