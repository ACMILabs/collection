        "Deadly Treadlies is a bike-rebuilding project that has operated out of Alice Springs, in local town camps and in remote Aboriginal communities since January 2003. The project was initiated in response to young people identifying bikes as a popular alternative to petrol sniffing and other substance and solvent abuse. The project has worked with over 500 young people since its inception in local town camps, schools, drop-in centres and on remote communities. In conjunction with the bike building, a series of video workshops were run and Deadly Treadlies uses footage taken by young people from Santa Teresa, Papunya and Titjikala communities.
