        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Nature of healing\". The emphasis of acupuncture is on prevention rather than cure. First documented in ancient Chinese texts, acupuncture can be combined with other therapies to alleviate pain and is often used instead of anaesthesia. Cupping and acupressure use acupuncture techniques without the insertion of needles."
