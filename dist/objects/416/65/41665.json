    "description": [
        "Laura Tweedle Ramsbotham is about to enter another world. From her home in sleepy, rural Australia she ascends to the dreaming spires of an exclusive college for young ladies, a very strict Victorian boarding school in Melbourne. Laura (Susannah Fowles) is strong willed and rebellious, which creates conflict with her peers and her teachers. In a desperate attempt to find acceptance with her peers, she weaves the most lurid yarns imaginable. The only real soulmate she finds is one of the senior girls. The novel by Henry Handel Richardson was published in 1910, and was so shocking at the time that the author's name (Ethel Richardson) was stricken from the records of the school in which she set the thinly-disguised autobiography. An amusing and sometimes touching story which features an excellent performance from Barry Humphries as the repressed fire and brimstone minister. Also stars John Waters, Sheila Helpman, Patricia Kennedy and Julie Blake."
