        "Calogero Anello is a streetwise nine year old whose father Lorenzo, fights to keep him from being corrupted by the neighbourhood in which they live. The boy witnesses a murder but refuses to identify Sonny, the local crime boss he has long admired, as the perpetrator. Sonny becomes a \"surrogate\" father to the boy, teaching him to survive in the streets. Over the next eight years, Lorenzo is powerless to stop his son from adopting the dangerous lifestyle of his hero Sonny. Robert De Niro stars and directs this often poignant but tragic motion picture."
