        "Peter Ustinov stars as Agatha Christie's famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot in this all-star production of 'Evil under the sun'. Diana Rigg is bitchy Broadway musical star Arlena Marshall, on holiday with her husband and stepdaughter on an Adriatic island. The hotel is filled with people who have a reason to hate her and when she is found strangled on a beach, Poirot must exercise \"his little grey cells\" and find the murderer. Excellent costuming, a witty screenplay by Anthony Schaffer and a delightful Cole Porter soundtrack will delight."
