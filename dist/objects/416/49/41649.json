        "Paul Newman is the hero in this exciting, hard hitting western. John Russell is a white man raised as an Apache who faces the prejudices of a society which despises him. He is made to sit outside the stage coach by the white passengers who soon find that their lives are dependent on the man they rejected when outlaws leave them stranded in the desert. Co-starring Diane Cilento, Frederic March, Richard Boone and Barbara Rush."
