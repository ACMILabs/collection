        "A lavish production set in France in 1572 when French Catholic and Protestants were at war. Catherine de Medici, mother of King Charles IX, arranges a political marriage between her daughter Margot and the French Protestant King of Navarre, Henri. Thousands of Protestant flock to Paris for the wedding and are butchered in the infamous St. Bartholmew massacre. Margot takes a Protestant lover, La Mole, but the repercussions of the massacre are destined to tear them apart. Isabelle Adjani is excellent as the sensuous, strong-willed Margot while Daniel Auteil is La Mole. Italian actress Virna Lisa plays the evil Catherine de Medici. Spoken in French and subtitled in English."
