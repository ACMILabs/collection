        "For lovers of ships, particularly the golden age of sailing ships, \"The Marco Polo: Queen of the seas\" is a fascinating documentary. The ship began its career as a timber freight carrier but became a passenger ship which carried emigrants to Australia. Produced by the acclaimed National Film Board of Canada, this program uses archival footage and dramatisations to recreate the era."
