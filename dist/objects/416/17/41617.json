        "Guy Pearce and Claudia Karvan star in this comedy which looks at the battle between the sexes from a new perspective. Brett and Tash fall in love but when a lack of compromise threatens their relationship, the forces of the universe intervene. One day they awake to find themselves prisoners in each other's bodies. Brett learns that being a woman, particularly Tash, presents its own challenges, while Tash learns more than she had bargained for about the male psyche."
