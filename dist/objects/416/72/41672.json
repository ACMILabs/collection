        "Christoph deeply resents the eccentric new tenant who has moved in upstairs and has turned his home upside-down. Slowly he begins to understand the genius of the man, the torment of his deafness and the beauty of his music, for the tenant is none other than Ludwig Van Beethoven. Set in 19th. century Vienna, this is a lavish production and features excerpts of Beethoven's best loved works."
