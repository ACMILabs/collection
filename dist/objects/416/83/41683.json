        "Marty Feldman was the goggle-eyed clown whose innovative slap-stick humour helped usher in the anarchic age of Monty Python. Part Chaplin, part Keaton, part Python, he was the scriptwriter of \"Round the Horne\" for radio and \"Bootsie and Snudge\" for TV - who turned comic to take Hollywood by storm in movies with Mel Brooks & Gene Wilder, such as Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie and Yellowbeard. This video is a compilation of some of the very best of Marty Feldman, taken between the years of 1968 & 1969. It includes famous and often controversial sketches - The Cabbie 'Squadron, The Loneliness of the long distance golfer, - these and others put his zany, surreal style on the map. The scriptwriters read like a roll-call of British comedy - Barry Took, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, and topping the list is Feldman himself. But then this is his show, a fitting tribute to a comic iconoclast. (Due to the archive nature of the material the sound and picture quality may vary occasionally, please do not adjust your set.)"
