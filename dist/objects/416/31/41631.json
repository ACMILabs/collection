        "Cornel Wilde is the tragic composer Chopin and Merle Oberon plays the radical feminist writer George Sands. 'A Song to remember' tells the story of this great pianist, fighting for the freedom of his beloved Poland and inspired by two beautiful women - one who loved him selflessly; the other who was cruel and aloof. Chopin's life and genius was cut short in the full flower of his musical greatness. 'A Song to remember' is a sentimental costume drama and features the skilled playing of Jose Iturbi. This film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and also stars Paul Muni as Chopin's mentor and nina Foch."
