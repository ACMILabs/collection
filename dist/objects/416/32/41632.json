        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". This program examines Picasso's painting \"The Crucifixion\" painted in 1930. It was an unusual subject for the artist, given his indifference to religious themes, however evidence from his sketch books indicates that he was secretly drawn to this subject. The program analyses the painting in terms of its relationship to depictions of the Crucifixion over time, and in the context of the artist's life and work. The troubled relationship he was experiencing with women, in particular his wife at that time is reflected in the figure of Christ."
