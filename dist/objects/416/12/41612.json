        "The local authorities join forces with the military to ward off an invasion of flying saucers. Undeterred, the aliens continue their attempt to conquer Earth by resurrecting corpses from a San Fernando cemetery. \"Plan 9 from outer space\" has been described as the worst film ever made. This dubious honour has led to the cult status and notoriety the film enjoys to this day, proving that any publicity is good publicity. Those who have seen Tim Burton's homage, \"Ed Wood\", will enjoy seeing this original masterpiece. Bela Lugosi played the definitive vampire as Count Dracula in Tod Browning's 1931 classic horror. In \"Plan 9\", he revives his ghoulish persona in this, his final screen role."
