        "Alicia Silverstone plays Cher, the most popular and glamourous girl at Beverly Hills High. Cher is a girl with a mission; she wants to find a love match for her debating teacher so she can improve her grades and a fashion makeover is a must for her dowdy friend. While she tries to organise everyone else's love life, when it comes to her own she is utterly 'Clueless.' Amy Heckerling's film about designer clad Los Angeles teenagers is an infectious comedy while Silverstone's performance is delightful."
