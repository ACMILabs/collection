        "In \"Triple treat\", confusion reigns supreme when Conrad and Otto make two replica's of Penelope's magic opal. There's lots of opal rubbing but little magic as a result! Bruce finally gets the opal back to the cave in \"It's still magic\" and is about to free himself when Penelope and Baz accuse him of selfishness. Eventually some sort of compromise is reached and Bruce finds out about the magic of romance."
