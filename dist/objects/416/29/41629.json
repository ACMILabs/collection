        "Tyrone Power stars as a matador who started out as a ragged urchin and became the hero of his country. At the peak of his career he succumbs to the charms of a beautiful but cold-hearted woman. To win back the crowd with whom he has fallen out of favour, he risks his all and is fatally gored to death. Linda Darnell and Rita Hayworth star as the \"femmes fatales\" who cross paths with the matador. This is a lavish production which captures the atmosphere of the subject matter and brings to life the tragic tale created by Vicente Blasco in his novel."
