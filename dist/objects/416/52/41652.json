        "Only one word of dialogue, (spoken by Marcel Marceau), in this Mel Brooks satire. Brooks portrays a director who comes up with a radical idea to save an ailing movie studio. He and his cronies band together to make a silent movie. Filled with slapstick gags reminiscent of the original silent classics, \"Silent movie\" features cameo appearances from a star studded cast including Mel Brooks, Marty Feldman, Dom DeLuise, Sid Caesar and Bernadette Peters."
