        "Tim Bowden takes us on one of the last greatest adventures - a voyage to the Australian Antarctic Territory in this spectacular 6 part travel series. Over a period of 2 months Tim visited all 4 of Australia's Antarctic stations at Macquarie Island Casey, Davis and Mawson. The result is a fascinating 'behind the scenes' look at what Australians are doing in Antarctica - a wild and beautiful icy wilderness that has attracted adventurers and scientists since the days of Scott, Shackleton and Mawson. Highlight include spectacular views of Australia's only ice-breaking ship \"Aurora Australis\" charging through the pack ice, a visit to a new Emperor Penguin colony the day after it was discovered and superb footage of penguins, elephant seals and albatrosses on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island."
