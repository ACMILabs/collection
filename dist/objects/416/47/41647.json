        "Set during the Vietnamese conflict in 1969, \"Hamburger Hill\" is a realistic, horrific dramatic depiction, almost documentary-like in format, of one of the bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War. The film follows the fortunes of 14 recruits through 10 days of hell as they make repeated assaults on a heavily fortified hill. The developing relationships between the young soldiers is tested by the grim realities of war and death. \"Hamburger Hill\" is a moving tribute to the men who fought a futile campaign which resulted in 70% of casualties."
