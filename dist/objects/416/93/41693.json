        "The National Film and Sound Archive has drawn on its unique film collection in a selection of vintage newsreels, home movies, advertisements and feature film footage looking at women's contribution to Australia's sporting culture. The video is accompanied by an excellent teacher resource guide. Presented in chronological order some of the highlights include Annette Kellerman's underwater ballet in 1914, Vera James in the classic film of 1921, 'A Girl of the bush', The Australian Women's Cricket team of 1937 and of course the golden girls of the Melbourne Olympics of 1956."
