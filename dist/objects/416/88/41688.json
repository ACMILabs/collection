        "A masterpiece by Tony Gatlif is a \"docu-musical\" which explores the rich cultural, social heritage of the world's Gypsies. The program is a political statement about the persecution suffered by Gypsies but is presented as a celebration of their music, dance and song from the around the globe. Singers, dancers and musicians from India, Egypt, Turkey, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain are featured. This is an energetic, powerful, joyous experience."
