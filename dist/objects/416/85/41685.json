        "Uys, a South African filmmaker, produced, directed and wrote this delightful, almost slapstick comedy about gentle Kalahari bushman Xi, who sets off on a trek to the ends of the earth to destroy a Coca Cola bottle which the \"gods\" had thrown from the sky. This 'gift' threatens to destroy the usual peace and happiness of the tribe. On his journey he unexpectedly collides with the modern world in the form of ruthless terrorists, a schoolteacher and a bumbling scientist studying elephant dung. 'The Gods must be crazy' is a comic fable which can be enjoyed by all ages."
