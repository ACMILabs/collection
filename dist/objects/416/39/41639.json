        "Wyatt Earp was one of the most famous lawmen of the american Wild West. With his friend Doc Holliday, Earp and his brothers tried to keep law and order in a land where lawlessness and violence was a way of life. Kevin Costner stars as Wyatt Earp in this epic production and is ably supported by Gene Hackman who plays Earp's strong-willed father, and Dennis Quaid who is excellent as the sickly but lethal Doc Holliday."
