        "A tragic but moving love story starring Ingrid Bergmann and Leslie Howard. The great concert violonist Holger Brandt is attracted to Anita Hoffman although he is happily married. He soon finds his love for Anita overwhelming and leaves his wife to tour Europe with her. But he cannot leave his past and his family ties behind and Anita sensing his dilemma, leaves him although it breaks her heart. Eventually Holgar and his wife are reunited as they share a personal tragedy. Sentimental, 'Intermezzo' is a great romantic classic."
