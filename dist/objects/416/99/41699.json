        "A compilation containing six short animated films which have received Academy Award nominations for Best Animated Short Film since 1984. \"Bob's birthday\" (1995 Oscar) is David Fine and Alison Snowden's hilarious look at a mid-life crisis; \"Creature comforts\" (1991 Oscar) from the Aardman Animation studios; \"Manipulation\" (1992 Oscar) is Daniel Greaves' brilliant battle between a cartoon character and his creator; \"Adam\" (1992 nomination), again from the Aardman studios; \"Second class mail\" (1984 nomination) is Alison Snowden's graduation film, another wryly amusing look at growing old; and \"The Big story\" (1995 nomination), Tim Watts and David Stoten's take on Billy Wilder, featuring no less than three Kirk Douglases in the starring roles and screened in the UK as the support to \"Pulp fiction\"."
