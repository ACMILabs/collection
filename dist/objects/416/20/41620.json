        "Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston and Alan Alda star in this slick comedy about marriage and murder. The sudden death of their neighbour has Carol, (Keaton) convinced that a murder has taken place. Larry (Allen) her nervy publisher husband of 20 years wants to ignore it, their friend Ted, (Alda) is excited by the thrill of the chase, while Marcia, (Huston), a shrewd author joins Carol in an hilarious chain of events to solve the mystery."
