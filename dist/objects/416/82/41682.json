        "Lynch's debut film has been re-released with a new print and stereo mix soundtrack. Opinion is divided as to film's brilliance but over the years it has achieved cult status in it's genre. Shot in black and white with an incredible soundtrack and tight script, 'Eraserhead' is the story of a timid printer Henry Spencer (John Nance) who lives in an apartment building trying to figure out what to do with his horribly mutated son. Lynch described the film as \" a dream of dark and troubling things.\""
