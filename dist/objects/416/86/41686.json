        "'Little Caesar' made Edward G.Robinson a star and exemplified the 1930's gangster movie. Robinson plays \"little tough guy\" Caesar Enrico Bandello, whom with his cohort Joe Massara played by Douglas Fairbanks Jr., head for the big city in pursuit of power and wealth. His ruthlessness sees him climb to the top over his rivals, but success is short-lived in a world filled with violence and corruption. Mervyn Le Roy hired three mobsters as advisors and the film's authenticity is a testimony to his attention to detail and fascination for the subject matter."
