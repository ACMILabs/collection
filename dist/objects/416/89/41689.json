        "From the novel by P.C. Wren, \"Beau Geste\" is the adventures of three aristocratic British brothers who turn their backs on their privileged lives and join the French Foreign Legion. Drawn together by the ties of blood and loyalty, their courage and honour are tested in the harsh desert world. This is another excellent BBC adaptation and stars Benedict Taylor as Beau Geste, Anthony Calf as Digby and Johnathon Morris as John."
