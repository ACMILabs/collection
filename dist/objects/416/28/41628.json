        "Episode of Series \"Eyewitness\". Did you know that there is an island completely made of skeletons? What is the strongest bone in the body? The answers to these questions can be found in this episode of the excellent 'Eyewitness' series. The skeleton is a vital support system but there is an incredible variety of structures and complexity; the most complex being the human skeleton. This tape also includes bonus footage on how the 'Eyewitness' episode was made."
