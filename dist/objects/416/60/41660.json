        "Based on the comic book character created by Bob Kane, this \"Batman\" reflects the darkness of the original syndication and in no way resembles the 1960's successful television series of the same name. Michael Keaton is Batman and Jack Nicholson portrays \"The Joker\", his arch enemy. The sets are dark, gigantic and forbidding and the finale is set amongst a cathedral backdrop reminiscent of the set of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\"."
