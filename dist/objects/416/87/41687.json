        "From the acclaimed director of 'Entre Nous', 'C'est la vie' is a touching story of a young teenager who witnesses the disintegration of her parents' marriage over the summer vacation. Julie Bataille plays Frederique, who must deal with her own emerging sexuality as well as witnessing her mother's sexual antics with her lover, an artist called Jean-Claude. The film is rich in detail and ambience and captures the bittter-sweet poignancy of growing up."
