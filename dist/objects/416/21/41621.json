        "Based on a true story, Balto is part husky/part wolf looking for a place to belong. An outcast in Alaska, he has few true friends - Boris the Russian snow goose, polar bear cubs Muk and Luk and the beautiful husky Jenna. Balto becomes a hero when the small town of Nome is struck by a diptheria epidemic. A blizzard means that medicine for the children cannot be delivered unless a team of sled dogs can race 600 miles to bring it back. When the dogs become lost, Balto must come to the rescue. Features the voices of Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins and Phil Collins."
