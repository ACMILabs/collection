        "Pink Floyd's landmark album was translated into an original rock music motion picture experience. Bob Geldof plays Pink, a burnt out rock superstar who thinks he is going mad inside a room at a Los Angeles hotel. The film takes us on a downward spiral into Pink's hell. Live action is intercut with brilliant animation by Gerald Scarfe and the soundtrack by Pink Floyd has given this film its cult status."
