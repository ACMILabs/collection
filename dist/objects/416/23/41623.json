        "Explores Australia's population debate showing how after 50 years of continuous growth, new arguments about limiting Australia's population are emerging. This program examines the post-war era when the cry to \"Populate or perish\" fostered Government sponsored immigration shemes, provided the applicants were white. It traces the gradual evolution of Australia as a multicultural society, primarily concentrated on the east coast."
