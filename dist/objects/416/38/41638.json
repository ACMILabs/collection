        "Norman Wisdom was famed for his ability to combine pathos and slapstick. In this motion picture he is an assistant to local butcher Mr. Grimsdale. During a hold up, Norman persuades Mr. Grimsdale to hide his gold watch in his mouth. This foolproof strategy comes unstuck when the watch is swallowed and Grimsdale has to be taken to hospital. Once there Norman is able to wreak havoc and chaos amongst patients and staff alike, but eventually his lovable charm wins the day and he manages to come out on top. Also stars Edward Chapman, Jerry Desmond and Lucy Appleby."
