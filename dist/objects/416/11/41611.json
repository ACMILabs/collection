        "Two bored sisters Dimity and Vicki-Ann live in a small country town. Their new neighbour, a brooding self-centered radio personality arrives on the scene and threatens to turn their world upside down. Dimity and Vicki-Ann find themselves in competition for his affections as each develops a severe crush on the aging Lothario with a predilection for '70's music and young women. Awarded the Camera D'Or at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival and starring Miranda Otto and Rebecca Frith (as the love-torn sisters) alongside George Shevtsov and John Alansu. Cinematography by Mandy Walker."
