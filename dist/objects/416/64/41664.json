        "Bruce Beresford's classic Australian comedy exposes Australian social mores in the suburbs. Don and Kath have invited a group of friends to celebrate what they believe will be a Labor Party victory on Election night. The night begins happily enough until the guests receive the news that Labor is losing. Old enmities erupt as hostilities break out amongst the guests as the party disintegrates into an alcoholic disaster. Cast includes Ray Barrett, Graham Kennedy, John Hargreaves, Graeme Blundell, Jeanie Drynan and Clare Binney."
