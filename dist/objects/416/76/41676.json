        "The culture clash between the English and Americans is the subject of this offbeat romantic caper, written by John Cleese and directed by veteran Charles Crichton. The \"Yanks\" are Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover/partner in crime, Otto (Kevin Kline). The \"Brits\" are barrister, Archie Leach (John Cleese) and Ken (Michael Palin), a stuttering animal rights activist and criminal. A diamond heist brings them together, as they all attempt to confiscate the hidden loot behind each others backs. A romantic quadrangle adds to the fun."
