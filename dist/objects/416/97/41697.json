        "An amphetamine paced delight, this furiously edited Hong Kong film is about a group of killer female assassins who decide it is time to enact their revenge on the men who have obstructed their lives. The plot is largely preposterous but what is undeniable is the sheer pleasure taken by the film-makers in delivering a never-ending feast of action, spectacle, colour and martial arts fighting. Director Fok-Yiu is one of the talented South East Asian directors who have proven an influence on directors as diverse as Quentin Tarantino and Australia's Geoffrey Wright. The film features a cold-blooded lesbian killer, Princess, who steals the show in a subversive feminist reworking of the karate \"villain\". Though violent, the action is tongue-in-cheek. In Cantonese with English and Chinese subtitles."
