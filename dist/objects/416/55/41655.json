        "Part 1 of the program explains what happens at the point of conception when the egg and sperm are formed and united. A discussion about DNA and chromosones is also included as well as an examination of the development and changes which occur during puberty. Part 2 examines the development of the fertilised egg as it implants itself in the wall of the uterus and the progression of the embryo to foetus until birth. Also featured are the physiological changes which occur during pregnancy. The photography and computer animation used in the program are outstanding."
