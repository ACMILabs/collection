        "Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette) are two drifting youths, a petty crim and a prostitute, who find each other and swear eternal love. But their happiness is short-lived: very soon they have a coterie of violent sadistic gangsters on their trail. Tony Scott's thriller is a hip, fast and very violent homage to the action, thriller and noir genres. Scripted by Quentin Tarantino, the film features cameos by Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer and a very excellent Dennis Hopper, and is filled with knowing jokes and references to Hollywood, Hong Kong and exploitation cinema. The performances by Slater and Arquette are inspired. Their performances add a dimension of grace and substance to what is a film with a very 90s consciousness: amoral and obsessed by surfaces. A rollercoaster ride of a film - fun but not for the squeamish."
