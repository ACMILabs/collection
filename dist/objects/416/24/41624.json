        "Australia rode on the sheep's back for over a century. Wool and the people who grew it became entwined with our national identity and the image of the sheep adorned postage stamps and coinage. The Country Party was a powerful force in Australian politics, however by the 1960's it was Australia's mineral deposits, particularly iron ore which began to dominate trade. As a consequence, rural Australians found themselves out of step with Australians living in our rapidly changing cities. This excellent documentary looks at the history of wool and examines what the future holds for those Australians who once rode upon the sheep's back."
