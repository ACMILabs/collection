        "An excellent documentary which not only looks at the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, but at how his dream for an integrated United States has been realised today. Interviews with participants of the Civil Rights Movement, friends and family of Dr. King and those who sought to destroy him such as the FBI. As well as fascinating archival footage, there is also an excellent soundtrack which features Afro-american music contemporary to the era."
