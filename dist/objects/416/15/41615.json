        "If you're interested in the art of storytelling, then you'll enjoy \"Flirt\". Hal Hartley takes the same narrative and retells it three times, changing the cultural and gender contexts of each story. Set in America, Berlin, and Tokyo, the same twisted love story unfolds with the same quirky twists and dramatic conclusion. Hartley flirts with the audience as he playfully includes many self-conscious allusions to his role as the 'storyteller', even including himself as a player in the final version of the narrative. While \"Flirt\" may not have the same dramatic intensity of some of Hartley's other films, it becomes compelling through the differences and similarities revealed with each new unfolding of the narrative."
