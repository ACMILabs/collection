        "Episode of Series \"Searching for values: a film anthology\". Uses extracts from the feature film \"Barabbas\" (produced by Dino de Laurentiis, directed by Richard Fleischer) to explore the theme of finding excitement and entertainment in the spectacle of violence - in this case, gladiators killing each other in battle. Easily accepting violence as an enjoyable aspect of 'civilised life', the Romans applaud the destruction of human lives and show no mercy to those defeated in combat. Suitable for upper secondary level."
