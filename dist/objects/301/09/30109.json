        "Van Gogh's life story, the development of his work and his struggle against madness and poverty told by excerpts from his letters to his beloved brother, Theo. The artist's paintings and scenes taken at localities in which he lived and worked provide the visual material. Shows his early drawings, his move to Paris, his time in Arles and Saintes-Maries and his enthusiasm for the southern landscape, his time in hospitals at Arles and Saint-Remy, Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh's final sojourn with a doctor in Auvers near Paris."
