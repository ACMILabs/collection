        "In 1973 the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (N.A.C.C.) was elected for the purpose of giving Aborigines a direct voice in the government. This was the first Australia-wide, elected and representative body of Aborigines in Australia's history. This film, narrated by the Aboriginal poet Kath Walker, tells the story of the election up to the declaration of the poll and the first meeting of the N.A.C.C. Also takes a searching look at Aborigines as some of the candidates for election speak about their problems."
