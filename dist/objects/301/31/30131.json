        "Paul, a young French Canadian, is caught between two ways of life, and must choose for himself between the old and the new. After a two year absence, Paul returns to the Quebec village where he grew up. His father hopes he will stay and take over his boat-building trade. Despite family ties, Paul sees the inevitable change that is coming to the province and responds to the stronger call of the industrial world."
