        "The Baj Teatr, Warsaw, is one of nineteen Polish puppet theatres for children. Everything at the Baj has a professional appearance - the finely constructed puppets, sets, beautiful costumes - all made by the theatre's staff of artists and actors. A short play is presented, using puppets seen in construction earlier in the film. Commentary spoken by Lucie Gray."
