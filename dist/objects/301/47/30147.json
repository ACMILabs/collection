        "Every city, proud, historic, picturesque though it may be, has need for renewal. Blighted areas must give way to new development so that vitality and growth may continue. Filmed in 1967 in the cities of Montreal and Quebec, this film shows how renovation projects may be introduced while still preserving the traditional character of long-established thoroughfares and residential areas."
