        "A dramatic episode in the story of the British lifeboat service, ending with a thrilling rescue at sea. We witness the naming ceremony of a new lifeboat in the Cornish village of Coverack. Various members of the volunteer crew are seen going about their daily work. Then suddenly, at twilight, the boat is called out and the whole village turns out to watch the launching. After a search, during which night falls, a crashed training aircraft is located and its crew of two are saved."
