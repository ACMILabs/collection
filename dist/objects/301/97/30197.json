        "Inspired by Silas Roberts, a tribal elder of the Allawa clan who wrote to the 1976 Australian Government inquiry on uranium mining, this film gives an insight into the Aborigines' attitude towards uranium mining. They tell of the myths and legends associated with the land and their sacred places, and why they object to the mining being carried out. Commentary by Bob Maza."
