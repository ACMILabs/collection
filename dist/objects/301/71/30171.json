        "Looks at Queensland's first Crown Industrial Estate at Wacol. Commenced in 1967 and situated 12 miles from Brisbane near the satellite township of Inala, the estate which was designed to meet the needs of industry, has expanded rapidly. The central location has added to the success of Wacol, and future industrial decentralisation is planned by the Government."
