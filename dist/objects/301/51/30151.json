        "Voices of Malaya was made before hostilities in Malaya began, in the period immediately after World War 2. It is primarily a background study of the problems facing a country with a population of five million people - Malayan, Chinese-Malayan, Indian-Malayan and European - who are suffering from the aftermath of war. It shows the efforts of the mixed nationalities of Malaya working and living together in the best interests of their country. Music by Elizabeth Lutyens, played by The Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by John Hollingsworth."
