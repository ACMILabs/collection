        "Episode of Series \"The Earth\". Evidence of high termperature and pressure beneath the earth's surface is seen in bubbling mud pots, hot spering geysers, lava fountains and thunderous volcanic eruptions. Further effects of volcanic action on the earth's crust are seen in cinder cones, crater lakes, calderas, shield and strato-volcanoes."
