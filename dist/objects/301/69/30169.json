        "Relates two sides of Blake's work which are normally considered separately - his art, particularly his illustrations, and his poetry. Concentrates on \"Songs of Innocence and Experience\" and the much closer relationship between text and illustrations than usually admitted. The delicate colours of the illustrations, often no more than half an inch across, are shown in close-up."
