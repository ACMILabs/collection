    "description": [
        "A graphic satire on the representation of violence in the cinema, this early work by George Miller has \u201cpsychologist and media critic\u201d, Dr. Edgar Fine, providing an academic account on the various theories around this subject. What starts as a fairly didactic and dry discourse on violence in the cinema takes a turn for the gruesomely demonstrative. Brutal acts are performed in visceral detail. This short by Miller was also his first collaboration with producer Byron Kennedy, whom he met at the University of New South Wales. The success of this collaboration led them to form the production company Kennedy Miller and to embody their fascination with violence in the feature film, \u2018Mad Max\u2019 (1979)."
