        "In Senegal, youthful villagers are sent off to learn simple new things in a government course and then returned to their own towns to teach their skills to the rest of the people. In Indonesia, French agronomists teach the \"Green Revolution\" to the whole region and set up a co-op to purchase machinery and guarantee a market for rice. And in Peru, a Government begins a land reform program in spite of the suspicions of those whom it is designed to help."
