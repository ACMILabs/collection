        "A study of the work of Picasso showing the development of his technique from his 'blue' period, through Cubism to abstraction. A series of paintings, sculptures and ceramics in the first part of the film lead to a personal interview with the artist in his studio at Vallauris in which he gives an unusual demonstration of his technique by sketching white paint on an invisible sheet of glass placed between himself and the camera. Examples of the artist's work in the film are from the Musee d'Antibes at Vallauris which is devoted almost entirely to the exhibition of Picasso's work."
