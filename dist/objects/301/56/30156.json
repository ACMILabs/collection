        "On-location photography and animated drawings illustrate volcanic phenomena in Hawaii, Mexico, Italy and Iceland. The film distinguishes shield, cinder cone and strato-volcano by showing how each type of volcano is formed and how each erupts. Before and after footage of the 1973 destruction of Helgarfjell on Iceland's Heimaey Island vividly documents the effect of volcanic eruptions on man and his environment. Suitable for lower and middle secondary levels."
