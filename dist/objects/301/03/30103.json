        "This good-humored satire on a Quebec village notary is narrated in rhymed commentary. Facile at unravelling family legal complications--sometimes as his own interests dictate--the notary can relax in the confidence that people must come to him for sage advice or crafty council. His unrivalled position in the community is described as the film follows the involved legalities that arise when a farmer dies intestate, leaving to his heirs the dispute over the estate--and, to the notary, the solution."
