        "This film discusses the economic and environmental problems of the Muskingum Watershed, which makes up 1/5 of the State of Ohio. The area was becoming more poor due to frequent floods, droughts and intensive farming. Through co-operation among various agencies, the area has become completely renewed. By explaining how this happened, the film makes suggestions for solutions to similar problems of conservation elsewhere."
