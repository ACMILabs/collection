        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\" Experiments for medicine, defence and commerce are shown briefly and the regulations and control of vivisection, in the various states, are mentioned. The alternative - cell, tissue and organ cultures from humans - is shown to be more accurate in some cases. Throughout the film, opinions on the morality and the necessity of vivisection are given."
