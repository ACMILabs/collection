        "The structure of the eye is shown in detail by means of models and diagrams; the functioning of the eye is explained by an examination of the optical system of a camera, together with structural changes indicating short or long sight and the correction and relief given by correct glasses. The relation of the eyes to the rest of the body is illustrated by diagram, emphasis being given to the advisability of seeking medical advice in cases where corrective glasses are not sufficient to correct a defect."
