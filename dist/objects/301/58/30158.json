        "Demonstrations by Horace Skeet, Mary Heeley, Miki and other celebrated players. Emphasises the importance of correct positioning of the feet for backhand and forehand volleys, and points out that it is better to place a volley rather than give it power. The smash is seen to be executed in the same way as a serve."
