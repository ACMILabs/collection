        "The first full-scale documentary of the conflict that cost 620,000 lives and redefined the meaning of freedom in America. The story is largely told through a huge variety of archival photographs, with a sound track composed of a narration by David McCullough and readings by a distinguished cast from writings of the participants, interspersed with commentaries by historians and other experts, most notably with Shelby Foote and Barbara Fields. The voices include those of Sam Waterston, Julie Harris, Jason Robards and Morgan Freeman with Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Irons and Kurt Vonnegut."
