        "This program poses questions about what happens when Aboriginal concepts of ownership meet Western copyright laws in terms of Aboriginal art, its exhibition and distribution both nationally and internationally. Viewed as central to the lives of Aboriginal people, the art works elucidate a connection to the land and the vital importance of Aboriginal community, cultural and historical traditions. When these forms of expression are illegally reproduced and manufactured the consequences for the artists and the community at large loom further than the Western concept of violation of copyright, an issue that this documentary explores in depth."
