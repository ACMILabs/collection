        "Episode of Series \"Art of the western world\". An episode in the comprehensive art history series, \"Art of the Western World\", that focuses on art work from the Abstract Impressionists to the Pop artists of the 21st century. Narrated by Michael Wood, this program focuses on the works of such artists as Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Klaus Oldenburg, tracing the progression of New York as a centre for the visual arts and the development of Pop Art. Through a discussion of the works in their historical, intellectual and social context, this program provides both a thorough outline of these periods in art history and underlines their relevance to issues outside the parameters of the works themselves."
