        "Descriptive film about Spain, the land of wine and other agricultural products. Southern Spain yields a rich harvest of grapes, raisins, wine and wheat. Andalusia in southern Spain gives way to age old ways of harvesting wheat. Goats produce milk for cheese and skins for wine bags. Oak trees are a wealth in southern Spain and cork is made from the bark. Another product is fine needlework. Also shows gypsies dancing in their camps. Narrated by Alois Havrilla."
