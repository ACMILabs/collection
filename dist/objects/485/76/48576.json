        "Gus Van Sant's faithful scene by scene colour 'recreation' (the term preferred by the director over 'remake') of Hitchcock's classic thriller about the fate of Marion Crane (Anne Heche in the role made famous by Janet Leigh) who, on-the-run with a large amount of stolen cash, stops at an isolated motel run by Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) , where she meets an untimely end. Cast also includes Julianne Moore as Marion's sister and William H. Macy as the private investigator she hires to find her sister."
