        "Guy Ritchie's second feature follows on seamlessly from his first: the music video/caper movie, \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\". It's cast - peppered with Hollywood stars Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina and Brad Pitt - portray a crowd of London small-timers torturing, mutilating and wise-cracking their way across Ritchie's home territory: ludicrous plots, racial stereotypes and groovy pop music, all in the name of derisively good fun. If \"Lock, Stock\" was an escapade into guilt-free sick violence, then \"Snatch\" is exactly the same."
