Identifying the problem is easy, however analysis of the problem once identified is not so easy. This short program and trainer's manual concisely identifies 5 problem solving tools; fault tree analysis, force field analysis, cause/effect analysis, repetitive analysis and sequence of events analysis and outlines which methods are the most applicable to different situations."
