        "This film from the director of the \"Star Wars\" trilogy is one of the most popular films of the 1970's. The misadventures of four Californian teenagers on a late summer night in 1962, two of whom are leaving for college the next day, became the focal point for a trip back to the last \"innocent\" year of the 1960's. Features a fine group of young actors who went on to become cinema and TV favourites, including Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss and Cindy Williams. The soundtrack features nostalgic hits from the heyday of Rock'n'Roll which takes the viewer back to a more innocent era when life was a lot less complicated. Don't miss the great cameo appearance from Harrison Ford in the \"toughest\" role of his career."
