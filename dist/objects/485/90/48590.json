        "This seductive, elegant thriller is a dazzling masterpieces of Hollywood film noir. Johnny (Glenn Ford) is a petty-crim on the Buenos Aires docks who works for the decadent Ballin Mundson (George MacReady), owner of an illegal casino. When Ballin brings his new bride Gilda (Rita Hayworth) to the casino he is unaware that she and Johnny were previously lovers. Her arrival precipitates a chain of jealousy and betrayal which destroys the fragile triangle of relationships. Around this bare plot Charles Vidor creates an atmospheric night-world tinged with the sophisticated ambience of alcohol, gambling and slow sensuous jazz.\"Gilda\" includes some of the most memorable set pieces in film history including Hayworth's erotic strip to \"Put the Blame on Mame\". The performances are excellent and Glenn Ford and George MacReady manage to defy the strictures of the Hollywood code to convey a rare, at that time, adult bisexuality. However, it is Hayworth who is the glittering centre of this movie."
