        "Featuring a rare and lengthy interview with Roy Lichtenstein discussing his work, past and present, and his career, this documentary offers a comprehensive insight into one of the pioneers of Pop Art in the United States. The program documents the rise to record prices of Lichtenstein's work and his steadily built reputation as one of the world's foremost contemporary artists for the breadth and depth of his paintings. The impact of his work, its critical status in the contemporary art world and his contribution to the pop art movement are all discussed through the interviews with Lichtenstein himself as he is seen working on paintings in his studio in New York. Such notions are also approached through interviews with long-time supporters, gallery owners and curators and art critics to provide a thorough study of the man and his work."
