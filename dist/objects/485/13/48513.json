        "From river to sea, and back to river again, this film follows the arduous life cycles of east and west coast salmon, revealing both the perils of nature and the threats posed by man. Vivid close-ups capture exciting moments when the salmon hatch, jump rapids, and perform their intricate spawning ritual. Other footage examines the Canadian government's programs to protect the salmon runs. The film makes it clear that the continuation of indiscriminate high-seas salmon fishing could prove fatal to one of the world's most important food and industrial resources."
