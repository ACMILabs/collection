        "Episode of Series \"Art of the western world\". An episode in the comprehensive art history series, \"Art of the Western World\", that focuses on art work from the impressionists to the Post-Impressionists. Narrated by Michael Wood, this program focuses on the works of such artists as Gustave Courbet, Georges Seurat, Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Cezanne, presenting the rejection of academic techniques that impressionism represented and its celebration of colour and light to the progression of these themes in the works of Post-Impressionism. Through a discussion of the works in their historical, religious, intellectual and social context, this program provides both a thorough outline of these periods in art history and underlines their relevance to issues outside the parameters of the works themselves."
