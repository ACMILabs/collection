        "Episode of Series \"Art of the western world\". An episode in the comprehensive art history series, \"Art of the Western World\", that focuses on the art of the Western classical world. Narrated by Michael Wood, this program focuses on the origins of humanism and classical works of ancient Greece as well as Roman architecture and engineering. Through a discussion of the works in their historical, religious, intellectual and social context, this program provides both a thorough outline of these periods in art history and underlines their relevance to issues outside the parameters of the works themselves."
