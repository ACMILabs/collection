        "A crazy General, Jack D. Ripper, obsessed by the fear that the Communists are controlling the fluoridation of the U.S. water supply, unleashes his wing of H-bombers against Russia. The President of the United States, his Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and even the sinister Dr. Strangelove, realise it is too late to call off the attack so they await the awesome consequences. This controversial black comedy stars Peter Sellers in three separate roles; other stars include George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden and Slim Pickens. In turn hilarious, satirical and even terrifying, Dr. Strangelove is a guide on How To Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb."
