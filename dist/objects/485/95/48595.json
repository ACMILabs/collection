        "Directed by Steven Soderbergh, 'Out of Sight' has been adapted from the novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard. When Jack Foley (George Clooney) robs a bank, his car breaks down and he is sent to a Florida prison. His escape attempt is witnessed by Federal Marshall Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) who, as a result, is kidnapped by Foley's partner, Buddy Bragg (Ving Rhames). Despite being on opposite sides of the law, Foley and Sisco discover their attraction to each other and Sisco is faced with a moral dilemma as she questions whether or not to turn him in."
