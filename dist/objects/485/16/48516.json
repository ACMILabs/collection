        "Terry Gilliam directs this extraordinary film starring Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe. Willis claims to be a time traveller from the year 2035. He wants to save the world from the effects of a deadly virus and with Stowe, who at first does not believe him, the two set out to save the world from a disaster. The film is filled with imaginative special effects from the inventive Gilliam. Based on the work 'La Jetee' which is also held in the collection."
