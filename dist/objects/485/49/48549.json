        "The development, key figures involved and the historical, political and economic context of the Bauhaus school of architecture, design, and craftsmanship is detailed in this program with narration by Frank Whitford. It is a comprehensive historical and analytical study of the movement which was a turning point in European and then world-wide thought on varied facets of design through its integration of notions of design, industry and functionality. This relationship created designs, buildings, art works and performance art synonymous with rationalised, sharp-edged and industry machine based ideals, which are closely analysed in this program from its development in the early 1900s to the struggles of the revolutionary aims of those involved during the Nazi regime and its contemporary influence. It presents a collection of archival footage, interviews with relevant experts as well as its students and teachers and the representation and discussion of an array of exemplary works and achieves a thorough outline of the Bauhaus school and its impact on modern design and architecture."
