        "Mr Prokouk works in a menial repetitive job. Hunched over, uncomfortable, he decides to invent some apparatus to raise his drilling machine to his height. While at the drawing board he falls asleep and dreams that he is a successful inventor with thousands of patents to his name. He awakes and rushes to borrow books on patents. He then uses the books to elevate his machine. Animated film."
