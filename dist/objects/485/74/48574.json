        "Marine oil exploration, as seen on the Sedco-H, an oil drilling rig anchored off the Nova Scotia coast over Canada's continental shelf. Here oilmen hope to discover black liquid treasure deposited by the same natural processes that formed the oil fields of the western prairies. This film shows the intense round-the-clock activities aboard the Sedco-H and the precautions taken against pollution and possible blowout."
