        "Dr Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer), a respected zoologist and her assistant Jimmy are called to Gallup, Texas, following a high incidence of bat attacks. She find this news bizarre, as bats usually avoid all contact with humans. Arriving in town she meets local sheriff, Emmett Kinsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), who confirms that aggressive bats are responsible for the attacks. Together they discover that the bats have been genetically altered by local mad scientist, Doctor Alexander McCabe (Bob Gunton), under instruction by the U.S. Government. When the town is attacked by a swarm of bats, it is up to Casper and Kinsey to track down the bat's cave and stop them before they wreak havoc on another town."
