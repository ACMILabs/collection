        "In this third program, Mario Massanyi and his colleagues explain and explore the principles involved in the use of colour in drawing and painting. They discuss methods of creating your own colour combinations to create varying tints and shades and the evocative qualities of colour to create mood and texture. In painting particularly, they demonstrate the effective methods of creating such mood and texture through the application of paint in a variety of different ways."
