        "The final of the 'European Art School' series, this program discusses guidelines for composition in a range of artistic work including painting and drawing. It outlines how shapes can be geometrical, natural or abstract and the varying effects, some positive, others negative, that this can have on composition. The program also covers how other elements in art, such as balance, colour and movement, can be used to create contrasting or unifying values in the composition of an art work."
