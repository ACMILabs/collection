        "Episode of Series \"Art of the western world\". An episode in the comprehensive art history series, Art of the Western World, that focuses on art work from Cubism and abstract art and architecture to Surrealism. Narrated by Michael Wood, this program focuses on the works of such artists as the Fauves, Pablo Picasso, Frank Lloyd Wright, Salvidor Dali and Joan Miro. Through a discussion of the works in their historical, intellectual and social context this program provides both a thorough outline of these periods in art history and underlines their relevance to issues outside the parameters of the works themselves."
