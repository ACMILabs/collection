A troop of championships swimmers demonstrates in turn the various aspects of the stroke - the attainment of balance by combined leg and arm movement; the correct leg action, observed from above, and below the water surface; breathing; arm action, the thumb entering the water first; co-ordinations of all movement; and the turn."
