        "Mighty Aphrodite (1995): Writer-director Woody Allen plays Lenny, a sportswriter who is dissatisfied in his marriage to art dealer, Amanda. Lenny becomes obsessed with locating his adopted son's natural mother, feeling convinced that she will be a brilliant and intelligent person. Instead she's Linda, a ditzy porn star and prostitute. Despite the initial disillusionment, Lenny soon develops a fondness for Linda, and decides to help her get her life back on track. Cast includes: Woody Allen, Mira Sorvino, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Rapaport, F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis and Peter Weller. Deconstructing Harry (1997): Harry (Woody Allen), a New York author, has just released his latest novel, \"loosely\" based on the characters from his own life - his ex-wives, mistresses, family and analysts. No-one likes his depiction of them, and in an hilariously ironic mixture of flashbacks to his new novel, flashbacks to his past, and mishaps in the present, the true story comes out. In classic Allen style, this autobiographical story is a fascinating mixture of fiction and reality. The cast is another line-up of characters in itself,including Kirstie Alley, Demi Moore, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Elisabeth Shue, Stanley Tucci, Amy Irving, Julie Kavner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mariel Hemingway and Judy Davis."
