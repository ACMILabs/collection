        "A dream-like appraisal of the life and work of Pablo Picasso, a universally acclaimed modern artist whose development through so many styles of painting and other forms of artistic expression had a revolutionary impact on the way we see things. This program traces his 80 years of painting, particularly his fascination with the mythological figure of the minotaur intertwined with the history, events and political life of Spain during his lifetime and his own personal concerns. It also focuses on the development of his portrait series, his fascination with his models, including his young lover Marie-Therese, and his coded exploration of humanity tender, cruel and solitary. Such landmark works as \"Guernica\", \"Las Meninas\" and his many portraits both in painting and sculpture are analysed in great detail in this documentary with thorough discussion of the history and thematic concerns of the pieces in the narration written by Jean Michel Michelena."
