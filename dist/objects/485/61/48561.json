        "Director Hal Hartley is a genre to himself. His body of work reflects a unique style that is essentially Hartlesque in it's acting, scripting and execution. What that style encompass is a performance mode that comes off like a choreographed dance of gestures. While the script which is usually laden with quick rhythmic bursts of dialogue require the actors to deliver their lines in the most deadpan manner. Having said that Henry Fool is Hartlesque in every sense of the term. James Urbaniak plays Simon Grim an introverted garbage man whose demure he confesses leads people to conclude that he is retarded. Enter Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan) a brash, vulgar ex-con who moves into the basement of Simon's family home. Soon enough the mysterious Henry has hit onto Simon's promiscuous sister (Parker Posey> and their manic depressive mother (Maria Porter), while his seductive influence over Simon leads to the timid garbage man writing an epic poem which has the power to dramatically affect whoever reads it. Cast includes James Saito, Kevin Corrigan, Nicholas Hope."
