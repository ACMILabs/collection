        "Episode of Series \"Art of the western world\". An episode in the comprehensive art history series, \"Art of the Western World\", that focuses on art work from Classical and Renaissance Italy. Narrated by Michael Wood, this program focuses on the readaption of the classical style in works by Titian and Tintoretto and the Renaissance works of such artists as Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael. Through a discussion of the works in their historical, religious, intellectual and social context this program provides both a thorough outline of these periods in art history and underlines their relevance to issues outside the parameters of the works themselves."
