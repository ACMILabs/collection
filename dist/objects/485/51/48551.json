        "Presented by Mario Massanyi and his colleagues this program presents an easy to follow guide to basic drawing and the range of preferred tools that can be used in the process. It covers techniques such as contour drawing, gesture drawing and modelling and highlights practical examples for practicing drawing skills. The episode ends with a tour of a pencil factory where some of the materials discussed earlier in the program are looked at in detail."
