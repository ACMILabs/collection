        "Episode of Series \"Daria\". The unlikely heroine of this offbeat animated MTV series is a cynical and quick witted teenage outsider named Daria Morgendorffer. Her cutting barbs are of course a way of coping with her vacuous teenage sister, her indifferent parents and the cliquey high school she attends which would be complete hell if it wasn't for her like minded best friend, Jane. These three episodes (See Jane run, Daria dance party, Jane's addiction) focus mostly on Daria's relationship with her best friend and partner in sarcasm and alienation, Jane."
