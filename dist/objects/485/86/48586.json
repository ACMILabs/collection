        "Pitch black is a futuristic science fiction thriller filmed on location outside Coober Pedy, Australia. It includes Australian actors Radha Mitchell, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black, and John Moore. The story begins with a spacecraft crashing onto an unknown plant. The few that have survived must band together in an attempt to live through the unknown dangers the plant hides. Initially, the group's concerns are for water, shelter and the threat of murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel), who has also survived the crash. However, when one of the group is killed and its leader, Fry (Radha Mitchell), is nearly killed also, the group concedes they must enlist the help of Riddick in order to survive. Still unsure of what the new danger is, the group prepares themselves as best they can, only to find when night falls that nothing could have prepared them for what comes out of the darkness."
