        "Based on Michael Crichton's best-selling novel of the same name, this is a Spielberg masterpiece of imagination, suspense, science and cinematic magic. On a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur (Richard Attenborough) secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs ressurected from extinction through the use of fossilised DNA. Before opening it to the public he invites renowned paleontologist (Sam Neill), paleobotanist (Bruce Dern) and mathematician (Jeff Goldblum) with his two grandchildren, to experience the park - with fatal results. This entertaining film carries a strong message regarding the use of science for material gain and to manipulate life."
