        "Episode of Series \"Art of the western world\". An episode in the comprehensive art history series, \"Art of the Western World\", that focuses on art work from the commissions arising from the church's campaign against the Reformation to works commissioned by the Royal and wealthy of Europe in the 17th century. Narrated by Michael Wood, this program focuses on dramatic depictions of religious scenes in the work of Caravaggio and Bernini as well as the work of such artists as Velazquez and Rembrandt. Through a discussion of the works in their historical, religious, intellectual and social context this program provides both a thorough outline of these periods in art history and underlines their relevance to issues outside the parameters of the works themselves."
