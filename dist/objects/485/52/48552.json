        "This program introduces more advanced drawing techniques moving to instruction in the representation of images in three dimensions. Simple shapes like the sphere, cone, cube and cylinder are used as practical examples for drawing and then methods of creating a mood and weathertype or a sense of perspective are explored through the use of particular patterns. The use of different art materials such as charcoal and ink and differing types of paintbrushes are also discussed with attention to their popularity and the quality of those available."
