        "This film reveals, in layman's language, something of the progress made at the Montreal Neurological Institute in unravelling the mysteries of the human brain and nervous system. It shows some of the highly complex equipment used in neurological research and diagnosis, and follows a brain operation performed on an epileptic. Man's brain and nervous system are, we see, a vast, unexplored universe about which much remains to be discovered."
