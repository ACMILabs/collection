        "The Sport and Recreation Service of New South Wales has centres throughout the state which encourage both adults and children to make the most of their leisure time. Specialised staff at the centres give instruction in many sports including: canoeing, archery, swimming lessons for adults, golf, skiing at Jindabyne in winter. Not only are active sports encouraged, but also the less active games such as chess."
