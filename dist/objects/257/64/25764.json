        "Although most managements take precautions to prevent foreseeable accidents, they are still common, a very large percentage being caused by personal carelessness. In this film, the duties of the foreman in accident prevention are stressed. It goes on to show a series of \"typical\" accidents and \"puts the clock back\" on them to show how they could have been prevented."
