        "Episode of Series \"Pacemakers\". Louis Armand is the most famous of all France's civil servant/technocrats - the great moderniser with a clear and steady eye on the needs of people rather than just the capabilities of machines. During the war he organised railway resistance to the Germans, and after the war he was responsible for the electrification of the French National railway system. He persuaded the French to look for oil in the Sahara; he was the man behind Euratom; and is the leader and driving force of the French Channel Tunnel Company."
