        "The Jengka Triangle Program located 120 miles north-east of Kuala Lumpur involves a broad spectrum of development activities - clearing of jungle areas, planting of rubber trees and oil palms, resettlement of thousands of under-employed families from overworked agricultural areas and the establishment of new communities with provision for health care and education. The project is a joint undertaking of the Malaysian Government and the World Bank, and provides a vivid example of the international community's mandate to assist developing countries."
