        "An account of the training of Kelpie dogs in the handling of sheep on an Australian sheep station. Explains the possible origin of the breed; shows the special training a dog receives from the time he is a small pup until he can muster and control a mob of a thousand or more sheep; shows the confidence of the dog and the bond of friendship which springs up between the animals and their masters."
