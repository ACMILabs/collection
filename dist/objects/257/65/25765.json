        "The haunting melodies of the flute played by Herbie Mann against the changing moods of New York city. Mann discovered that the flute could well carry a melody against a primitive rhythm of drums. His music proved popular, and the flute is now well established in the world of jazz; a world which reflects the influences absorbed from the environment of New York."
