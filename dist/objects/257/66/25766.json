        "This animated film illustrates the organization and functioning of Labor-Management Production Committees (L.M.P.C.). Through the account of an L.M.P.C. organizer we learn how such committees serve to improve labor-management relations, factory efficiency, employee morale and accident safety records. He tells how, upon visiting a factory where there was friction between management and labor, he was able to clear away the individual objections of the manager, the superintendent, the union president and a laborer to an L.M.P.C., and to help start a committee in their factory."
