        "Episode of Series \"Pacemakers\". Marcus Wallenberg is not the only man behind Sweden's success, but he is almost certainly the most outstanding. A study of his methods gives an insight into Sweden's prosperity. He and his brother Jacob are each chairman of ten companies and on the boards of a further fifty, and are closely involved with five of Sweden's eight leading firms. Through the drive of men like the Wallenbergs Sweden, with a population of only seven and a half million, has become an object lesson for the smaller industrial nations of the world."
