        "Shows the cost of careless and drunken driving in Australia. By demonstrations, a parallel is drawn between the effects of a head-on collision at 30 mph and the result of dropping a car from a fourth-storey height. Compares road-deaths with mortality in two world wars. Points to diversion of community resources by accidents, eg hospital equipment, and panel beaters."
