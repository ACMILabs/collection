        "Lord Russell speaks about his fears and hopes for the future and explains that he sees the possibility of a world so organised and static that there will be no fun to be had anywhere. He points out also that with education and the realisation that many of the world's troubles lie in individual psychology, we could abolish war, poverty and disease. No other credits available."
