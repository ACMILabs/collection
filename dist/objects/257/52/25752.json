        "What happens in England when a man is arrested and put on trial on a charge of burglary; illustrated by the case of John Ludd who was caught one night running away from a house that had been broken into. The film follows the course of justice stage by stage, giving details of police and court procedure; and shows how the rights of the accused man are safeguarded, whatever his previous record."
