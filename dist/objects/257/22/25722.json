        "Master craftsman Yitzhak Mambush describes and demonstrates the results of blending of the painters and tapestry maker's talents. Visiting the artistic community of Ein Hod, Israel, where Mambush works, the process of preparing for weaving is shown. Mambush characterises his translation of the painters art into a tapestry as not simply a reprise of the canvas."
