        "A humorous cartoon, about the danger signs of cancer, showing that a man can be irrational about a new rattle in his car, or a warning pain in his body. Stresses the need for regular six-monthly visits to a doctor. The \"hero\" of the film reacts with gibes, sarcasm, clowning and devilish anger when his wife advises him to take the car to a reputable garage, and have a physical check-up himself. However, he finally seeks expert advice."
