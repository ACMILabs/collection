        "On the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Queenstown Heights, October 1867, the people of Canada were invited by a newspaper in the capital to submit poetry songs to commemorate that historical event. This film recreates in live action an event in which a town schoolteacher was encouraged to enter a poem in the contest, he did so and the result became the popular Canadian song \"The Maple Leaf Forever\"."
