        "A recruitment and orientation film depicting a psychiatric aide's realisation, in his daily contact with the mental patients under his care, that his work has a therapeutic function, and that he is more than just an attendant hired to take care of the elementary physical needs of his patients. Emphasises teamwork between himself, the psychiatrist, psychiatric social worker, and nurse, and on the meaningfulness of play therapy when coupled with psychotherapy."
