        "Episode of Series \"Pacemakers\". The Aga Khan is the creator of one of the world's most dramatic and imaginative development schemes - a planned riviera along 35 miles of Sardinia's Costa Smeralda. He is also the spiritual leader of more than 12 million Ismaili-Muslims scattered around the world, and a wealthy Parisian, racehourse owner, and Olympic skier. Shows the Aga Khan in a variety of activities. He comments personally, analysing himself and his different faces with the same detached lucidity he brings to all his undertakings."
