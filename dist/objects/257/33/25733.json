        "Episode of Series \"Great Themes of Literature\". This film, edited from Zeffirelli's lusty version of Shakespeare's \"Taming of the Shrew\", unfurls with great fun a Renaissance version of the spectacle known as 'the battle of the sexes'. Stars Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. As the commentator points out the dramatising violent conflict between men and women in search of love is one way that world literature has dealt with the relationship between the sexes."
