        "Episode of Series \"Australian Geography\". Looks at the human geography of our arid zones by examining the lives of Aborigines, cattlemen and miners - men who live in the waste-land of Australia's deserts. Almost 90% of arid lands are used by someone at some time for some purpose. Questions why man is attracted to the desert. Explains how man has adapted to this environment and what effect this has had on the environment."
