        "Stresses the need for pastoralists to maintain their grasslands once established. Shows the use of superphosphate in seeding, also lime and trace elements (in this case, molybdenum). While showing the use of an electric fence for regulated use of pasture, the film warns against overgrazing of the resulting strips. Also explains the need to let grass mature to maximum feed value, and to keep down weeds. Suggests that farmers should grow and store surplus feed."
