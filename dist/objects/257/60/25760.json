        "Tells of the efforts of Francis Sutton to save the Australian coastline from pollution. Dedicated to this task Sutton works ceaselessly on maps, diagrams and plans in an attempt to find an alternative to the disposal of sewage through ocean outfalls. Though receiving many rebuffs, gradually he is gaining support, from a scientist, politician and from the people who live around him. Cinematography by Don McAlpine."
