        "The trial and death of Socrates is one of the significant moments and most dramatic events in the history of Western civilization. It poses questions that are still deeply troubling to our society - how far should a society go in suppressing someone it feels is dangerously disruptive? The film draws on many Greek philosophers and touches on many facets of Greek life."
