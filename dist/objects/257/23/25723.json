        "What do the anteater and the seal have in common? They both have some kind of hair and nurse their young. When vertebrates have these two characteristics, they are classified as mammals. The great diversity of mammals is illustrated by representative members of the major groups - carnivores, rodents, ungulates, marsupials and primates."
