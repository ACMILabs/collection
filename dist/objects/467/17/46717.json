        "On graduating from high school friends Spike, Danny, Silk and Tracy are eager to make their mark on life but are concerned at their lack of suitable job prospects. When Danny discovers he has inherited the Majestic Hotel for the cost of $8000, he takes his friends and makes the move from the city to the country. With town planners on their back with a hidden agenda for a proposed chemical \"preprocessing\" plant and hostile townsfolk, it becomes a test of stamina to endure the persecution as well as continue the hard work required to renovate the dilapidated motel. Cast includes Daniel Jordano, Matthew Penn, Leon W. Grant, Mary B. Ward and Marisa Tomei."
