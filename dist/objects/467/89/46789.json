        "Comedy based around the lives of three Sydney women: publisher Sarah (Wendy Hughes); Cee (Sandy Gore), the rejected wife of an academic; and the ever pregnant Jane (Anne Tenney), wife of a philandering wine dealer. The trio of friends meet regularly at the harbourside restaurant run by the diminutive Luigi, who provides them with champagne, fine food and solace as they discuss one another's mid-life crises in the world of New Age beliefs and the stock market crash. Co-written by actor Judy Morris and Wendy Hughes, this film leaves many comic opportunities underdeveloped, and was criticised at the time of release for the low standard performances by an obviously talented cast."
