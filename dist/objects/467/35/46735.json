        "Directed by Joseph Losey in 1954, \"The Sleeping Tiger\" was his first feature made in Britain which came to typify what was later referred to as, 'Losey Baroque'. In this domestic drama, criminal Frank Clements (Dirk Bogarde) becomes a 'home-trial' case patient for psychologist, Dr. Clive Esmond (Alexander Knox) and inadvertently his wife, Glenda (Alexis Smith). Forced to undergo psychoanalytic reform in place of a prison sentence, Frank proceeds to provoke emotional conflict in all their relationships. Frank with his excessive passions, and Clive with his emotionally detached approach provide great shadow plays. As Freudian displacement eventuates the themes of disaffection, frustration and alienation spark dramatic changes in all their lives. Dr. Esmond.\" In the dark forest of every human personality there is a sleeping tiger.\" Who will be freed from their compulsions? Based on the book of the same name by Maurice Moiseiwitsch."
