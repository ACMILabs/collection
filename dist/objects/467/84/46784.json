        "Shows the various species of the beetle and treats in detail the life cycle of one type - the striped flea beetle. Illustrates mating in the spring, hatching of the eggs and feeding of larvae on plant roots; burrowing of the larva into the soil for pupation. Time-lapse cinematography is used to record the whole of the ten-day life cycle of the beetle. Destruction to plant life by adult insects is also illustrated."
