        "This made for television feature film was based on the novel \"Baja Oklahoma\" by Dan Jenkins. Set in the 1980s in Fort Worth, Texas, \"Baja Oklahoma\" tells the romantic comedic tale of Juanita Hutchins (Lesley Ann Warren), a barmaid, single mother, would-be songwriter, but most of all a soul-searching dreamer who wants to be free of all her dead-end romances and make it big in the world of country and western music. In walks Slick Henderson (Peter Coyote), Juanita's teenage flame who has been out of town for many years. His return stirs the old passions and memories and creates complications to Juanita's plans of fulfilling her dream to go to Nashville and becoming a star. This is definitely one for lovers of country and western music and scene. Co-starring along with Lesley Ann Warren is Swoosie Kurtz, Juanita's foxy and never a dull moment best friend, Doris, and a very young Julia Roberts as Juanita's daughter, Candy. Features special guest appearances by Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Dan Jenkins and Bob Wills Jr. and a great country/blues soundtrack by Willie Nelson and Emmylou Harris. Cast also includes Anthony Zerbe, William Forsythe, Billy Vera. Teleplay by Bobby Roth and Dan Jenkins."
