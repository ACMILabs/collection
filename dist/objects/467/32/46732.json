        "Set in Paris after the Third World War; an imprisoned man is being used by scientists to investigate time travel. He is haunted by a childhood memory of the pier at Orly Airport, a woman's face, a man's death. The fiction is constructed through still photographs. Photographs - images of the past - thus replace moving images with their power to create the illusion of the present."
