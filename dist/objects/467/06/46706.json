        "Its 1965, and rock'n'roll has ricocheted around the world. Nowhere is the music more popular than Philadelphia, where smooth-talking Perry Parker (Joe Pantoliano) hosts the city's hottest TV show \"Dance Party\". The dancing fever has also infected the suburbs where Del Green (Donovan Leitch), a high school senior, spends most of his time spinning, twisting and daydreaming of Vicky (Jennifer Runyon), \"Dance Party's\" reigning teen goddess. On a dare Del foregoes his college entrance exam, auditions for the show, is chosen and becomes an instant success. Del and Vicky become \"Dance Party's\" hottest new couple. To the beat of 60s rock'n'roll, and against a steamy backdrop of fancy footwork and raw competition, their make-believe romance becomes a doomed off-stage love affair."
