        "Hollywood, 1955, and independent film director Stanley (Peter Coyote) is eking out production day by day on a film financed by gangster Frank Silva, and starring Silva's girlfriend, Carol (Victoria Tennant) as the leading lady, Betty. Stanley's film is a love story about a boxer, a gangster, and a girl, and in a case of life imitating art, the leading actor (Blaine Novak) falls in love with Carol/Betty, unbeknownst that she already has a boyfriend who also happens to he a vicious gangster and the financer of the film. This film about a film is supposedly a fictionalised account on what went on behind the production of Kubrick's \"Killer's kiss\", and has earned comparisons to a later production - Woody Allen's \"Bullets over Broadway\" (1994). Cast also includes Richard Romanus and Dan Shor."
