        "A story of relationships, love, loyalty and family - and intruders who upset the balance. Wendy (Teri Garr) is a young divorced mother with two sons, Jake (Christopher Collet) and Brian (Corey Haim). Mother and sons appear to cope reasonably well in their relationships towards one another with the usual generational disagreements and ups and downs all families face at one time or another. However, when Sam (Peter Weller) enters into Wendy's life, the boys find themselves gradually being pushed aside as their mother's interest in Sam turns increasingly to love. When Sam moves in, both Jake and Brian become suspicious of his motives and eventually it is up to Jake, as first born, to try and take control of a situation that is rapidly getting out of hand. Both boys are determined to protect their mother at all costs but for Jake it is a moment of confrontation and making choices. Contains some violent scenes. Cast also includes a very young Sarah Jessica Parker as Jake's girlfriend, Lisa and Robert Downey Jr (also in his teens) as one of Jake's friends, Lee."
