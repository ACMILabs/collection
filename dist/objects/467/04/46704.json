        "This is the off-beat story of Richard Dice (Rob Lowe), a college dropout who comes back home only to find himself on jury duty in the trial of his high school-sweetheart, Molly (Colleen Camp), who is charged with murder. Convinced she's been framed, he sets out to prove her innocence - only things don't go according to plan when he finds himself the target of a band of crazy thugs; shady conspirators; millionaires; jurors; judges and the police. But really, what's a little perjury, blackmail, burglary and murder among friends."
