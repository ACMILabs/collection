        "A satiric look at the world of tabloid journalism in Britain. 'The Brit' is a muckraking tabloid newspaper that will stop at nothing in its thirst for scandal. The way the paper constructs its front page expose of two sex-scandal stories that emerge on the same day - one involving a cabinet minister and the other a soapie star - reveals much about the state of journalism and politics in England at the end of the eighties. (Awards: British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best Single Television Drama, 1990). Cast includes Adrian Edmondson, Alison Steadman, Linda Bassett and Christopher Fulford."
