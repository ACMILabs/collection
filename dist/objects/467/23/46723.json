        "Prudence (Julie Hagerty) is a conservative and slightly mixed-up young woman who thinks Bruce (Jeff Goldblum) is crazy. Bruce is crazy about Prudence, despite the fact that he is bisexual. Their therapists are no better off. Prudence's therapist (Tom Conti) is more interested in scoring with his female patients than in treating their problems. Bruce's therapist is as flighty as they come. Throw in Bruce's jealous lover Bob (Christopher Guest), and his overly protective mother, and the scene is set for madness and mayhem. Adapted from his Broadway play by screenwriter Christopher Durang."
