        "It is the very early 1980s. Alice (Chloe Sevigny) and Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale) are two ambitious publishing assistants who transform themselves into glamourous disco queens and spend their nights dancing at The Club. That is until their disco-world is turned upside down by a seemingly bisexual lothario, Des (Chris Eigeman), whose involvement with drugs lands him and his money-siphoning friends in trouble with the law. A hilarious tale of tangled romances, friendship and music you just can't stop dancing to!"
