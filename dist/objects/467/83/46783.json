        "At a school assembly program during Fire Prevention Week the children are told how they can help prevent fires and each child is given a form to take to their parents to check their home for fire danger. One boy and his father go over their home observing electric outlets, danger spots in the basement and attic, care of matches and use of home-type fire extinguisher. Next day the children report what they have learned."
