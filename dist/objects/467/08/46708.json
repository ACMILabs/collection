        "Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell star in this vivid look back at the wartime conditions that stood society on its head - and a sensitive, romantic story of the good times and the bad times a whole generation of Americans will never forget. The movie stays at home and follows the stories of men and women working in the factories that produce weaponry for the battles overseas, all produced predominantly by the round-the-clock efforts of over 3 million female workers. Many, like Hawn's character Kay Walsh, have never held a wrench before - but you're never too pretty to learn. Christine Lahti, co-starring as Kay's sultry neighbour, Hazel, proves that even a dance-hall singer can handle a rivet gun. Russell plays Lucky Lockhart, the 4-F classified trumpet player who'd rather be handling real guns - until he falls in love with Kay. Kays' husband Jack (Ed Harris) comes home on leave and finds out that his wife has betrayed him. Lucky then decides to pursue Hazel, driving a wedge between the two friends."
