        "This account of Labor-Management Production Committees in the construction industry in wartime Britain takes as an example the building of an airfield, and shows some of the problems involved in a construction job of this kind. The film also demonstrates the methods of election of the men's representatives on the Committee, the discussion and decisions of the Committee and how the Committee acts as a channel for suggestions by the men for improving production efficiency. As a result relations between management and men are good, everyone works together to get on with the job, and the speed of construction is accelerated."
