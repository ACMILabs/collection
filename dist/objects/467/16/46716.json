        "A Scottish poet past his prime has become an alcoholic and is dining off past glories, whilst living in an New England town. His penchant for successfully bedding a string of bored local wives, waylaying them with seductive poetry and sexual finesse, is derailed upon his encounter with the wholesome student Geneva Spofford (Kelly McGillis). Tom Conti plays Gowan McGland as an artist filled with self-loathing whose inability to recognise an opportunity for happiness makes him a tragic figure. Despite its at time depressing subject matter, \"Reuben, Reuben\" is an amusing romantic comedy about artistic drive and mis-matched lovers."
