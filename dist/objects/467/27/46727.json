        "Libby Tanner (Dinah Manhoff), a 19 year old aspiring actress travels to LA to call in on her screen writing father, Herbert (Walter Matthau) who she has not seen since she was 3 to try and get him to help her get into the industry. On arriving there she quickly discovers he is not as successful as she thought he would be, regularly receiving rejection letters from networks and barely holding down a relationship to make-up artists to the stars Steffy Blondell (Ann-Margret). Father and daughter have a lot to learn from each other and find the answers to why they are they way they are has to a lot to do with the way they interact with each other. As the possibility of becoming getting into acting becomes more real, Libby begins to question her motives for coming to Hollywood. Screenplay by Neil Simon."
