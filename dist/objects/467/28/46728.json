        "Nick Stark (Eric Roberts) is a Los Angeles architect who has it all - graced with vitality, good looks, loyal friends, a thriving career, a down-to-earth attitude and an irreverent sense of humor. Although he looks healthy, he has been fighting off AIDS related illnesses for years, and he discovers that he has untreatable brain lesions which will, at best, decimate all his brain faculties within days and he may die within a week. He intends to savour his remaining time by gathering everyone he loves for a two-day farewell party. Nick is a generous host to the diverse crowd he attracts. He draws his guests into a highly charged atmosphere where opinions collide, secrets spill, and old wounds heal as everyone struggles to accept Nick's fate."
