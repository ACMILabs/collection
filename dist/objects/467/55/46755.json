        "Western propaganda presenting life on the Eastern side of the 'Berlin Wall'. Filmed from the Western side of the border, the film records activities on the Eastern side and provides an anti-communist interpretation and commentary. Shows locals carrying out daily activities; armed guards patrolling the border; watch-towers and concealed observation areas; propaganda billboards; 'indoctrinated' youths recruited as guards and frontier police; the 'forcible' removal of families from their ancestral homes into detention centres; and endless footage of barbed wire and uniformed personnel."
