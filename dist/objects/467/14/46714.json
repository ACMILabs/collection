        "Anne (Laura Harrington) is a photographer trying to advance her career taking snaps of high profile people in compromising situations. While working on a futuristic fashion shoot, she makes friends with two of the models, Gracie and Sugar, who also happen to dabble in prostitution on the side. Gracie particularly catches Anne's interest when it is revealed that she has been in a relationship with Champagne Sam, one of the city's most notorious pimps. Anne soon breaks up with her boyfriend, Joey (Joe Mastroianni), and starts leading the high life, frequenting strip clubs with her friends, and pursuing unsatisfactory relationships with a number of different men. However, Anne's new-found freedom comes at a price; her latest photographic assignment turns into a nightmare when Champagne Sam, whom she was secretly photographing for an assignment, discovers that she has been hiding Gracie, and ransacks her apartment. Suddenly Anne realises how close she has come to total disaster. But has she realised too late?"
