        "An old Jewish couple the Rosens (Ruth Gordon and Lee Strasberg) who migrated to Brooklyn, New York after the war have lived in harmony within a mostly ageing community until now... Threatened from the increasing violence of street gangs who target the elderly and most vulnerable, the Rosens stick to their convictions, determined to keep home - home. As the attacks escalate and Becky Rosen's health declines David Rosen is forced to take the law into his own hands. Director Verona manages to achieve a sense of empathy as he removes all formal symbols of law and order creating a playing field where it is every man for themselves. Cast includes: Janet Leigh, and Joe Silver."
