        "It was the end of high school and nearing the end of an era when teenage friends Scott (Kiefer Sutherland) and Ralph (Robert Downey Jr) face the full brunt of events in society at the time - the war in Vietnam, Neil Armstrong walking on the moon, and a boom in hippie culture. Scott, a pacifist, has a brother in Vietnam and clashes with his father over his views. Ralph seems to be avoiding the issue through drugs - much to the chagrin of Scott, and Scott's younger sister, Beth (Winona Ryder), who takes on a bigger role in their lives. In the space of one Summer, two families are drawn together by love, death and war, changing their relationship to one another and society irrevocably. Features a soundtrack of classic 60's music. Cast also includes Bruce Dern and Mariette Hartley."
