        "When a new freeway is built that bypasses the tiny but thriving Florida town of Ticlaw, depriving it of the livelihood it garners from passing motorists, the mayor and other oddball citizens of the town dream up hair-brained schemes as a lure to the tourist trade. The film follows a group of equally eccentric range of travellers who inadvertently find themselves in Ticlaw--a place they never intended to visit. Cast includes Beau Bridges, Hume Cronyn, Beverly D'Angelo, William Devane, Teri Garr and Geraldine Page."
