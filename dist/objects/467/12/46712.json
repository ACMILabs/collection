        "Set in Harlem in 1931 during the era of depression, bootlegging, mobsters and smokey nightclubs where white patrons came to see black jazz singers. Also a time when the mafia were trying to move in on the nightclubs and assert their control over the black Americans, a time of violence and machine guns and death to those who dared to challenge \"the boss\". Georgia Freeman (Cynda Williams), a black jazz singer and Johnny Verona (Nick Cassavetes) a white mobster who works for Costanza (Joe Viterelli), \"the boss\", find themselves entangled in a fiery and passionate affair which eventually can only lead to disaster, especially when Johnny is already betrothed to Costanza's daughter. When Costanza decides to take over the nightclub where Georgia sings, all hell breaks loose. Racial tension, dangerous liaisons, lots of action and a great jazz soundtrack with a cast including Lawrence Monoson, Richard Brooks, Garrett Morris, Richard T. Jones, Tony Burton and Maria Ford. Music produced by Paul di Franco."
