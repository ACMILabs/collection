        "Australian documentary aimed at primary school children, dealing with the 4 most common drugs in our society: 1. Medicines, prescription and non-prescription. 2. Alcohol. 3. Tobacco. 4. Cannabis/Marijuana. The program's young presenter explores the question \"what is a drug?\" and the notions of legal/illegal, harmful/helpful drugs. She interviews primary school children, a pharmacist, winemaker, doctor and policemen, drawing on a wide range of perceptions, questions and information. The result is a comprehensive \"discussion\" of these drugs. A good drug education video, suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Related topic = peer pressure."
