        "A documentary which studies the facilities for education - both good and bad - available to Afro-American children in the southern states of the USA during the mid-1940's. An interesting documentary for its time for its sympathetic attitude towards the plight of Afro-American children in getting an education. Photography by Roger Barlow and Jospeh Braun."
