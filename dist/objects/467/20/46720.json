        "Produced for television with teleplay by William Irish, Jr, \"The Heist\" is about revenge with an amusing twist. Neal Skinner (Pierce Brosnan), has served four years in prison for a robbery he did not commit. Believing he had been set up by his business partner, Ebet Berens (Tom Skerritt), he is out to even the score. Skinner finds himself even more determined to bring Berens down when he discovers that his partner has also moved in on his girlfriend Sheila (Wendy Hughes). It becomes a cat and mouse game as Skinner sets out to plan the ultimate heist - to rob the race track and set Berens up at the same time. This is a light-hearted film with a touch of the Remington Steele/James Bond feel played by the ever-suave and charmingly witty Pierce Brosnan in the main role. Cast also includes Noble Willingham, Tom Atkins, and Robert Prosky as Dancer."
