        "This romantic comedy, starring Jon Bon Jovi, is set in the London theatre world. When successful playwright Felix Webb (Lambert Wilson) can't enjoy the success of his latest masterpiece because he has fallen passionately in love with a young actress, he enlists young, charismatic Hollywood actor Robin Grange (Bon Jovi) to seduce his wife into leaving him. However, as Felix weaves his web of mischief, fate intervenes and both Felix and Robin learn that real life doesn't always follow the script."
