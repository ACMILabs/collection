        "Made in 1947 to promote good grooming techniques for males and females. Shows boys and girls of senior high school taking care of their skin, hair, nails and teeth thus demonstrating habits which should form part of every 'civilised' person's daily routine. Although the film has dated, it captures the styles and attitudes of the time."
