        "Set against the background of music from The Whitlams, Alex Lloyd and Rumanastone, \"Greening out\" offers a candid view of teenagers and marijuana use. Teenagers in rural areas discuss what drives them to drugs, siting isolation, lack of things to do and depression. They talk openly about their experiences and what they've learnt from it. Salient medical advice is provided, with particular emphasis on how marijuana affects individuals in the formative adolescent years and how it affects your emotions and social interaction. Musicians Alex Lloyd and Tim Freedman also share their experiences with the drug. Cartoons intersperse the discussion, illustrating youth culture and drugs in action. Also includes interviews with Triple JJJ announcers Sarah Macdonald and Caroline Tran who discuss the pressures on youth today, and how they themselves cope with pressure. Dedicated to Chiquita Sturges. Suitable for secondary level students."
