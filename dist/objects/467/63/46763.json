        "This film has lent itself to comparison with the work of Lynch and Cronenberg, as it tells its story using a violent array of flashbacks, fast-forwards and nightmarish dream sequences. The action centres around a young metal fetishist who tries to insert pieces of metal into his own skin. Running out into the street he is knocked down by a car and the accident gives him strange powers as his body begins to painfully mutate into a synergy of flesh and metal. Meanwhile the salaryman who ran him down finds his own body is also transforming into a metallic monster. This bizarre, sexual fantasy mixes black humour and sexual imagery with a hypnotic post-industrial soundtrack. In Japanese with English subtitles."
