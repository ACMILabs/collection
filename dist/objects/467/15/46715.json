        "Set in beautiful cattle farming country New South Wales during the 1980s, this quirky comedy drama centres around a family reunion to celebrate grandfather's 80th birthday. Spanning three generations, the relatives all gather at the historical family homestead, some from the city and others from the country. Add to this an intruder from Czechoslovakia, lots of alcohol, family jealousies and rivalries, \"dangerous\" liaisons, a somewhat bewildered and bemused grandfather, and an important announcement which will affect the whole family, there can be only one outcome - disaster. Cast includes Bill Kerr, Rowena Wallace, Carol Raye, Ray Barrett and Norman Kaye. Music written and played by Norman Kaye and photography by Tom Cowan."
