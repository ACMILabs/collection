        "Documentary from around 1935 about the attractions for tourists at Phillip Island, Victoria. Phillip Island, discovered by Bass in 1798, is a beautiful location which provides tourists outdoor activites such as swimming and surfing, and a chance to see the natural wildlife on the island such as koalas, fairy penguins and seals. Particularly interesting from a historical point of view."
