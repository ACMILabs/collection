        "Paul Simon used his own knowledge and experience of the rock music industry in writing the script to \"One Trick Pony\". He plays Jonah Levin, a one-time successful musician who is approaching middle-age and is increasingly seen as a has-been by the business people who run the industry. His wife (Blair Brown) is frustrated with Jonah's continual life on the road and wants him to begin to take up the responsibilities that come with marriage and age. Simon wrote the music and songs for this film which forms a musical counterpart to the narrative. As much as it is about music and performance, the film is also an examination of what happened to the ideals and hopes of the hippie generation once it aged. Cast also includes Rip Torn, Joan Hackett and Lou Reed and features cameo appearances by Tiny Tim, soul legends Sam and Dave, the Lovin' Spoonful and the B-52s."
