        "Essentially a travel video, \"The Cherry blossom trail\" uses the revered time of beauty in Japan - Hanami (the brief period of time in which the cherry blossoms, known as sakura, flower before being driven away by the rain - as a compass for this tour of Japan. Beginning in Kyushu, host Greg Grainger and his guide/interpreter Ian visit a shinto shrine, observe the superstitions surrounding Japan's national flower, visit a canola crop, hot sands and natural springs, countryside walkways, samurai village, origami cranes in the peace park, a traditional tea ceremony, sake and pottery production, geishas, sumo school, traditional villages and a seventeenth century castle, all set against the backdrop of exquisite flowers and gardens. The journey ends at Mount Fuji."
