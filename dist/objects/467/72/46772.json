        "This short romantic docudrama was made in the year after World War II and begins by showing troops returning home and what \"freedom\" means to them and the women waiting for them after the horrors of war. A nationalistic film, with commentary about the future Bill and his girl Sue had planned before Bill was called off to war - symbolic of a nation with a great future. Set in the scenic beauty of the Blue Mountains and the colorful hustle bustle of Sydney. Featuring John Temple and Coralie Kelly as the lovers, and commentary by Robert Pollard."
