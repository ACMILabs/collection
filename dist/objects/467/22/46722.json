        "Joan Rivers directs and stars in this acerbic comedy also starring Billy Crystal as a young virgin male, engaged to be married, who finds himself pregnant. His agony and ecstasy of being the first male to bear a child is paraded before an endless gallery of freaks and maniacs - his family and friends (not to mention the media)."
