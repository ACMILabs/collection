        "Peter Smith, aided by Dave O'Brien as a factory operative who never does the right thing, offers some hints on industrial safety. As in the NFB of Canada \"Accidents don't happen\" series, a humorous approach is successfully used to sweeten important lessons. Both a good comedy and an excellent training film for machine-tool workers, apprentices and pupils in technical schools."
