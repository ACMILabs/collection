        "Dr. Larry Roberts (Albert Finney) is a skilled Beverley Hills plastic surgeon who specialises in resculpting stunningly beautiful women into paragons of pure perfection. However, his privileged life begins to crumble around him when three of his surgically-enhanced patients die under mysterious circumstances, thrusting him into the spotlight as the number one suspect. Determined to clear his name and prevent the possible death of a forth patient, Cindy (Susan Dey), he begins his own investigation into the murders, discovering links between the dead models and a sinister research facility known as Digital Matrix. Infiltrating the complex, he uncovers an experimental advertising project where computer-animated images employ an auto-hypnotic suggestible trance to manipulate audiences into purchasing products. The situation turns nasty when Cindy is taken hostage, and Dr. Roberts becomes trapped in a race against time to save her from suffering a similar fate to the other victims. Written and directed by Michael Crichton."
