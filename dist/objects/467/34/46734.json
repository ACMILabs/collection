        "Based on Donald E. Westlake's novel \"The Hunter\", Lee Marvin stars as an amoral and apathetic antihero in this stylish landmark thriller. Walker (Marvin) is a professional criminal who helps pull off an underworld heist, then is double-crossed, gunned down and left for dead on deserted Alcatraz Island. But he resurface in Los Angeles to track down his share of the loot. Aided by an accomplice (Angie Dickinson), he takes on the syndicate at it's own deadly game, doggedly stalking his prey across the ever-changing backdrop of seething '60s L.A. The trail piles twist upon twist as it leads Walker to a cunning mobman (Carroll O'Connor) and a surprise ending. Remade in 1999 as \"Payback\" starring Mel Gibson."
