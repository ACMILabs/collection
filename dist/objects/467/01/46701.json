        "In this comedy in the vein of \"Desperately seeking Susan\" a young German woman (Hanna Schygulla), struggling to survive in New York City, dreams of becoming a novelist. One day, broke, lonely and on the street she stumbles across a photograph of a beautiful blond named Lulu (Debbie Harry) and decides to track her down. Instantly, both her luck and her life take a dramatic new direction. Her madcap quest leads her into a real-life gangster mystery involving drugs and murder that just might bring her the fame and fortune she craves."
