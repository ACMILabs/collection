        "The story of a Canadian community which mobilized the energy of all its citizens to protect the health of its children against the common threat of diphtheria. We see how all groups contribute to the success of an immunization campaign. High-school children act as publicists, churches and schools place the issue before parents, a volunteer registration committee makes a door-to-door survey, and as winter weather slows the progress of the drive, service clubs provide \"toxoid taxis.\" From the awareness of one or two, the community is stirred to act for the good of all."
