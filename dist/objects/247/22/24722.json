        "A traditional Hindu wedding in Western India; local customs may vary but most weddings follow the same pattern. The parents consult, priests read the horoscopes of the couple and a formal betrothal is made. On the wedding day, special music is played and many symbolic ceremonies take place, followed by a reception and breakfast, and finally a colorful and exciting procession takes the bride to her new home."
