        "Vivid animation portrays Jewish history, beginning with the time of the Patriarchs, including the destruction of the temple and the great dispersion, and concluding with the Nazi persecutions. Taut documentary footage depicts the eventful and tragic years from the Zionist movement in 1900 through the birth of the Jewish nation in 1948. The film's modern footage presents an objective and forthright description of the progress and problems of Israel today."
