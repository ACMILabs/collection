        "Farce about the Paris bourgeoisie. One visual detail after another creates a devastatingly witty satire at the expense of the French middle class. Set in Paris, 1895, the story concerns a bridegroom whose horse eats a Leghorn straw hat of a young married woman absorbed in a clandestine love affair. The wedding day must be interrupted while the groom searches frantically for an identical hat. Adapted from the play by Eugene Labiche and Marc Michel (II). Credits include: photographers, Maurice Desfassiaux, Nikolas Roudakoff; music, Jacques Ibert; editing, Henry Dobb; art designer, Lazare Meerson; costume design by Souplet; assistant directors, Lily Jumel and Georges Lacombe."
