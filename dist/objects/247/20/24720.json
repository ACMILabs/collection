        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Commonwealth of Nations\". A review of how British constitutional government and British forms of law and order became a valued heritage and a unifying link between members of the Commonwealth. The film moves from one Commonwealth country to another to observe how the democratic formula of government is exercised and kept flexible according to the changing ideas of the time, while the Crown symbolizes a continuity and permanence free of politics. A most significant test of this principle was that of India's rise to nationhood. Edgar McInnis comments on how institutions inherited from Britain were preserved in the country's statutes."
