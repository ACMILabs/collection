        "The right marriage partner need not be one's exact counterpart, but for a happy marriage two personalities must complement each other. this film shows a series of young people, each one reacting to an identical tense situation, and each one disclosing the essential pattern of his or her personality. Successful marriages, the film stresses, are those where the partners choose each other with care, with a sure knowledge of each other, and then accept each other for what they are - not for what each might wish the other to be."
