        "Episode of Series \"The Great Religions\". Like Christianity, Islam is winning converts, particularly in North Africa. This film explores the faith of the Muslims, taking you to Mecca, birthplace of the Prophet Mohamed, and to the shrine of Islam's holy of holies, the Ka'aba, or Cube. Following the routes of Muslim conquest, you see shrines of holy men and heroes from Cairo to Pakistan. Wherever you go in this vast empire, the power of Islam is apparent in soaring domes and noble architecture of great cities. Against this background the film relates the history of Mohamed and his rise to leadership, spiritual and temporal. Narrated by Douglas Rain."
