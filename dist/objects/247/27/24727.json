        "It is difficult for the outsider to understand the astonishing solutions to life that the handicapped can find. Gordon Stent went blind in 1962. He was running his own business, but was forced to give it up. He retired to Bournemouth where he set out to make a new life. There was one thing he wanted to do - he wanted to become an artist - the first blind artist in the world."
