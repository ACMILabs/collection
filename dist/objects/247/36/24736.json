        "Preparing for the summer season at the Mount Buffalo Chalet is a busy time. The ponies are brought up from the valley below where they had been on agistment during the winter. The stables are made ready and the riding gear dusted and cleaned in readiness for the visitors. Horse riding through the scenic countryside of Mount Buffalo is a popular holiday recreation."
