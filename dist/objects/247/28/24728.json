        "Presents two methods of measuring ionisation energy: photo-ionisation and electron bombardment. A high vacuum system is used with a simple conductivity cell. The photo-ionisation of sodium by the use of a mercury light source and monochromator is carried out. The electron bombardment method is then demonstrated with sodium and three inert gases. Animation shows what occurs on the atomic level during the ionisation process."
