        "Land without water is arid and desert, unable to support vegetation; humans, by their ingenuity, are able to bring water to irrigate such land; engineers harness melting mountain snows, and divert and dam rivers, and farmers use pipes, ditches, canvas, and channels to carry the water to the roots of their crops and pastures."
