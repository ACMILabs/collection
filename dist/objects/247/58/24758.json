        "Episode of Series \"Earth and it's peoples\". Life in urban and rural Japan, showing the customs and work of a Japanese farm family as observed by their young cousin from the city. Shows how this country of 80,000,000 people, handicapped by mountainous terrain and without the necessary raw materials for industrial development, has done to overcome her difficulties. Japan's industry is based on the importation of raw materials and the selling of finished products throughout the world, made possible by low wages and long hours of work. In rural areas, people work long and hard to gain a livelihood from the soil."
