        "Deals with the isolation many migrants feel when they are unable to communicate their difficulties and problems to Australians, especially those in authority. To help with these problems they have established their own clubs, where they can share their own language. Recently the New South Wales Government has established the Ethnic Affairs Commission to deal with migrant affairs and welfare."
