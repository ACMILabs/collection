        "This fast moving parable, designed to provoke discussion without alienating any group, highlights the centres of divisiveness in our society, the generation gap, poverty, war and race. It tells of a land \"where men were always right\". This animated film is a winner of many awards including an Academy Award. Narrated by Orson Welles."
