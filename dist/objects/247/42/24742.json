        "A panorama of ancient cities, palaces and temples whose splendours awed the eyes of all mankind - recreated in colour by the skill of the animation artist. In documenting the changing concepts in architecture through the ages, the film moves from one tradition to another, illustrating how each reflects the sentiments and values of the time, from the massive temples of the Pharaohs to the soaring skyscrapers of today. Winner of eight film awards, including Rapallo Film Festival, Italy and Canadian Film Awards."
