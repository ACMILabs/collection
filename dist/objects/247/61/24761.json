        "Turtles are found in the seas around the islands of the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland. Living most of its life in water the female turtle comes to land to lay her eggs in the sandy shores. After 9-10 weeks the eggs hatch out and the young turtles make their way to the sea. Also shows crested terns and other sea birds on the islands. Additional photography by C.P. Mountford."
