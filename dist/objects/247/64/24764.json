        "The leisurely life of the people of Tahiti and in particular the township of Papeete is depicted. Marketing, boating, fishing, dancing and going to church make up the lives of a people who work to live rather than live to work. The beautiful scenery of a typical tropical island forms a background to the dances and music of the islanders. Although, also showing the coconut industry, spear fishing and diving for pearl shell, the film primarily emphasises the scenic attractions and the easy life on the island. Narrated by Claude Dauphin."
