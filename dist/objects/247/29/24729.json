        "An impressionistic collage without commentary, directed by Claude Lelouch. Iran is shown as a country in transition. On the one hand it has modern cities, the oil industry and cosmopolitan city dwellers, and on the other hand it has mud villages, and is home for ethnic minority groups and families steeped in the tradition of making rugs."
