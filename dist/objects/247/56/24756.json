        "When a Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees the money was used to rehabilitate refugees in Greece, many of whom were skilled workers living a life of inactivity, misery and despair. With the arrival of a UN social worker, life for the refugees took on a new meaning. But, in many countries, the struggle for better conditions still goes on."
