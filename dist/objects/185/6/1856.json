        "'The Hiding place' makes frightening Freudian references to Enid Blyton's children's story 'The Magic faraway tree'. 'The Hiding place' examines the fraught relationship between siblings and their mother.  'The Hiding place's' use of Flash animation and faraway tree theme lulls the viewer into a comfort zone that quickly evaporates as the viewer explores the work. The work features advanced use of net based interactivity."
