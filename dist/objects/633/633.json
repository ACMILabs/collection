        "The central theme of 'Postcard from Tunis' is writing itself - its histories, its inscriptions and its relevance to the human-computer interface. This is explored in a personal, audiovisual portrait of Tunis, the home of my family-in-law. I designed and programmed the unique interface so that it echoes an actual visit, where you can't help learning a few Tunisian words and with time, starting to read written Arabic. Although the work was designed for adults, children have shown a strong affinity with it."
