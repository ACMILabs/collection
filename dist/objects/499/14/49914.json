        "Foster parents in rural Victoria discuss what it's like to care for a foster child, covering issues such as selecting a child, financial implications, emotional support, and most importantly, the benefits. Families interviewed include a single mother with children, an older childless couple, and a middle aged couple with their own children. A young man whose lived with a foster family also shares his experience. Worthwhile viewing for anyone considering fostering a child. Supported by the Federal Department of Family and Community Services."
