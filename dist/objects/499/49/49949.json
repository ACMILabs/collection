        "Bob, a retired bank robber and compulsive gambler masterminds a raid on the casino at Deauville to cover his gambling debts. An underworld comedy of manners unfolds as Bob's morality is tested through the double-crosses of the other protagonists and an unforseen murder. The film is a homage to American cinema, namely John Huston, through the underlying motif of failure. Its gritty, free-wheeling style with its jump-cuts, jazzy score and visual quotes predates the French New Wave. Melville was only able to afford three lights when shooting the film which meant that most of the backgrounds had a hazy appearance. This effect became a trademark of the film and made Henri Decae, a director of photography, in high demand. Cast includes Isabel Corey, Roger Duchesne, Daniel Cauchy and Guy Decomble. In French with English subtitles."
