        "Stalinist Hungary, 1948. A young nurse, honest enough to criticise the conditions in the hospital where she works, is singled out by the party for political training. Gabor's understated drama follows her transformation from a relatively naive eighteen year-old into a cool political operator, her integrity traded for a position in the Party. The film objectively critiques the years of oppressive Stalinist dogma in Hungary, leaving the viewer to draw his or her own conclusion. Based on the novel by Endre Veszi. Cast includes Veronika Pap, Erzsi Pasztor, Eva Szabo and Tamas Dunai. In Hungarian with English subtitles."
