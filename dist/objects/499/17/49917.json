        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Grey voyagers\". 80 year old Coffs Harbour identical twins Toni and Adelie Hurley travel to Antarctica on a voyage commemorating Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated expedition of 1914-16. Their father, Australian director and cinematographer Frank Hurley, was the official photographer aboard the 'Endurance' which was crushed by ice as it approached Antarctica, leaving the entire crew stranded on the flows for 6 months. Forced to take to the open sea in 3 small boats when the ice broke, the crew eventually landed on uninhabited Elephant Island and remained there until Shackleton organised their rescue. Toni and Adelie recount their memories of their father as they return to the region where he struggled to survive. During their voyage, they discuss their father's photographs and diary with Jonathon Shackleton, a relative of the Irish explorer, as they approach Elephant Island. Adelie Hurley also talks about her own career, and her status as Australia's first female press photographer. Cinematography by Erika Addis. Edited by Tony Stevens. Narrated by Anne Phelan."
