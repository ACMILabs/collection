        "Originally made to commemorate the tenth year of the overthrow of Czarist Russia, Pudovkin's film tells the story of a peasant boy who comes to St. Petersburg in search of work and witnesses the October Revolution. Set against the background of the historical events which culminated in the attack on the Winter Palace, the film contains graphic anti-war statements and was so realistically shot, that some interpreted the footage as documentary evidence of real events. Despite numerous crowd scenes, Pudovkin focuses on the struggle of the individual to relay the concerns of a people. Contains striking black and white cinematography, and expressionistic performances from Alexander Chistyakov and Vera Baranovska. Based on the poem, \"The Bronze horseman\" by Pushkin and the novel \"St Petersburg\" by Andrev Biely."
