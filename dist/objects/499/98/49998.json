        "Gena Rowlands portrays a middle-aged widow whose life is on the threshold of change. Her daughter has just left home on less than amicable terms and her married son is totally absorbed in his own life. When Mildred is approached by her neighbour (Marissa Tomei) to mind her young son, JJ, after her abusive husband walks out, she immediately consents. Initially quiet and tentative, JJ gradually gains confidence as the two develop a strong bond which provides them with the support they lack from their own families. The film explores the evolving relationship between Mildred and her two children, contrasting it to the unconditional friendship she shares with JJ. Cast includes Gena Rowlands, Marisa Tomei, Gerard Depardieu and Jake Lloyd. Edited by Petra Von Oelffen. Photographed by Phedon Papamichael. Written by Nick Cassavetes and Helen Caldwell."
