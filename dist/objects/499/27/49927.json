        "Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, this wry film stars Jack Nicholson as an inmate feigning insanity in an asylum. Nurse Ratchitt (Louise Fletcher) a woman whose cool, controlled demeanour masks her own form of insanity in the execution of iron-fisted control over her domain and all who come under her care. The story is an allegory of an era. While the people may seem crazy, it is the system which defines craziness, and by doing so, it is the system which has problems; not those who suffer under it. Few other films have made such a strong impression on repeated generations of filmgoers, and few films will ever match the power and integrity of this masterpiece. Winner of four 1975 Academy Awards: Best Director, Actor, Actress and Adapted screenplay."
