        "Sofia Coppola's feature debut is an elusive and intoxicating work about the beautiful Lisbon sisters, five teenage girls who mysteriously and tragically decide to end their lives. Based on Jeffrey Eugenides cult novel, the story of these girls is filtered through the idealized eyes of the boys in their neighbourhood, who, years later, try to make sense of the Lisbon sisters lives and deaths. Coppola captures perfectly the essence of a difficult book which is as much about the disintegration of idealism in the 70's as it is about the joys and pains of adolescence. Working with potentially dark material, Coppola appropriately infuses the film with a sense of nostalgic longing that is both seductive and melancholy. Narrated by Giovanni Ribisi. Cast includes: Kirsten Dunst, James Woods, Kathleen Turner, Josh Hartnett, Michael Pare, Scott Glen and Danny DeVito."
