        "Based on the stage play \"A Chorus line\", here is a behind the scenes look at the experience of what it's like to audition for a musical chorus line. Michael Douglas plays Zach, a chain smoking director holding auditions for his new show. Throughout the day we meet the hundreds of hopeful dancers that are slowly narrowed down to 16. It is at this point we are really introduced to the remaining dancers as they open themselves to Zach about their past and hopes for the future. A past lover of Zach's, Sheila, once herself a star dancer who broke his heart by leaving town to be in a major show of her own, also turns up to audition. During the day Zach will push every boundary of these dancers to ultimately have the best chorus line of 8 for his show. Nominated for 3 Academy awards this is a vibrant and character driven movie adaption of a popular broadway play."
