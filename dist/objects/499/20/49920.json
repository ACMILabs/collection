        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Grey voyagers\". 66 year old American emigre Louise Firouz lives and works in the remote north eastern corner of Iran. She breeds rare Turkoman horses, and co-ordinates exotic adventure treks into ancient and remote landscapes which attract international visitors. Two Australian women in their late 60s, Nelly Gelich and her friend Joan Beslich, join Louise and her entourage on a trek which follows a path dating back to Alexander the Great. Along the way, they encounter Kurdish nomads whose hospitality and lifestyle have remained unchanged for centuries."
