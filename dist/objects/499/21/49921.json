        "One of the few Australian feature films in which the narrative is centred on the portrayal of workers on the job - a group of shearers working on an outback station in 1955 in the months leading to the nine months shearers' strike. While the gun shearer played by Jack Thompson is the central character, the focus of this episodic and unsentimental drama is on the communal values of the group rather than on those of the individual. Cinemaphotography by Geoff Burton. Cast also includes Max Cullen, Peter Cummins, John Ewart, John Hargreaves, Sean Scully, Ken Shorter, Gregory Apps."
