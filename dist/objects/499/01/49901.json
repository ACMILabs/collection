        "Episodes nineteen (\"Altared States\") and twenty (\"Ties that bind\") of the first season of the groundbreaking television series about Xena, a female warrior struggling to come to terms with her evil past and her faithful sidekick, the bard, Gabrielle. Together the two women roam across ancient Greece, battling warlords and righting wrongs. Highly postmodern in tone, the series mixes martial-arts-inspired action sequences with 'camp' humour, lesbian subtext, contemporary cultural references, and a wild disregard for historical accuracy. In \"Altared States\", a clever reworking of the Abraham-Isaac story, Xena and Gabrielle intervene to prevent the sacrifice of a young boy by his father in the name of the \"Supreme Deity\" worshipped by a group of zealots. They discover that the older son has fabricated this God in order to replace his brother as his father's successor. This was the first episode to insert self-conscious subtextual references in response to fans of the show who read the relationship between Xena and Gabrielle as a romantic one. \"Ties that bind\": Xena rescues a mysterious warrior who later claims to be her estranged father. But the reunion is anything but happy, as a suspicious Xena tries to find out if the man's claims are true."
