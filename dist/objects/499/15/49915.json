        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Grey voyagers\". 86 year old Mavis Taylor travels from Yarrawonga to East Timor on her first trip overseas. Against the odds, she plans to establish a sewing co-operative for the local women. Frustrated by bureaucracy, Mavis seeks assistance from the local community to help her transform an abandoned hospital into a warehouse and training centre for the co-operative. Her determination and perseverance is rewarded when the first order arrives and a group of local women are trained and organised to meet the delivery deadline. The project provides an opportunity for the women to establish economic security and independence for themselves and their community. During her stay in East Timor, Mavis also visits a church whose congregation was massacred by the Indonesian militia. Cinematography by Catherine Marciniak. Edited by Andrea Lang. Narrated by Anne Phelan."
