        "It is 1901, South Africa. The British war against the Boers has deteriorated into bitter guerilla warfare. A unit of the Bushveldt Carbineers, made up mainly of Australians, is ordered by the British High Command to fight the Boers on their terms and take no prisoners, orders that were to prove fatal for Harry Morant. Cast includes Edward Woodward, Bryan Brown, Jack Thompson, John Waters and Charles Tingwell."
