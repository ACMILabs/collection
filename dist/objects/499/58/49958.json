        "This 1978 Hong Kong film, one of the earliest to star Jackie Chan, highlights the relationship between a student and his martial arts master. Wong Fei Hung, played by Chan, is a 19th Century folk hero in Chinese culture and cinema, a master of kung fu who fights the injustice of British colonialism (this character would later be portrayed by Jet Li in 'Once upon a time in China'). 'Drunken master' finds Wong in his early years as a troublesome fighter who is sent to his uncle, the hard-drinking title character, for instruction in discipline and martial arts. After enduring torturous training, Wong runs away only to encounter some local villains. Being badly beaten, he returns to his uncle who finally trains him in \"drunken style\" kung fu. Cast includes: Jackie Chan, Simon Yuen and Lam Yin."
