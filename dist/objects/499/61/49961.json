        "Gidget Goes to Rome is the third film to be made inspired by the sun-happy and beach-loving characters created by Frederick Kohner in the mid 50s. In this film, Francie \"Gidget\" Lawrence goes to Italy with her boyfriend, Moondoggie, and their friends for a whirlwind tour of Rome. Although chaperoned by Aunt Albertina, the two aren't stopped from experiencing brief extracurricular flirtations. Cast includes: Cindy Carol, James Darren, Jesse Royce Landis, Cesare Danova, Danielle de Metz and Joby Baker."
