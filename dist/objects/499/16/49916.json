        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Grey voyagers\". Mechanic Doug Sunderland has been riding motorbikes for 60 years. At 75 years of age, he sets out on a journey to ride through India and Nepal, overcoming ill-health and a collision to celebrate the new Millennium and 2 million kilometres in the saddle. During his voyage, he recounts the 6 years he spent in an orphanage, suggesting it fueled his desire to seek nature and open spaces. Doug also visits Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Cinematography by Catherine Marciniak. Edited by Tony Stevens. Narrated by Anne Phelan."
