        "Harrison Ford stars as Henry Turner, a successful but ruthless New York lawyer who must win at any cost, even at the expense of his family. A single, freakish gunshot brings Henry's world crashing down as he is left incapacitated and with no memory of the life he used to lead. Now, faced with starting over, Henry will learn the painful truth about his life and rediscover the family he never really had. Also starring Annette Bening as Henry's long-suffering wife, this thought provoking film questions the importance of money over family and ultimately - the price of happiness."
