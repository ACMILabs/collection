        "Malcolm, a simple genius played by Colin Friels, loses his job at a Melbourne tram depot after building his own one-man tram and taking to the streets. With funds dwindling, Malcolm is forced to take in a lodger, a small time criminal who moves in with girlfriend, Judith. Frank soon realizes that Malcolm's mechanical wizardry can help his career - the result - a series of oddball but unsuccessful robberies that culminates in the heist of the decade that stretches Malcolm's devises to the full. \"Malcolm\" was critically acclaimed world wide and received eight AFI Awards including best director and best film."
