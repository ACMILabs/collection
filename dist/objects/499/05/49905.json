        "Another Cohen production, \"O Brother where art thou?\" follows the black comedy tradition of \"The Big Lebowski\" and \"Fargo\". Once again the story centre arounds hapless anti-heroes who stumble from one humorous disaster to another. The story is set in America's South during the time of the depression. It loosely follows Homer's Odyssey, but instead of soldiers, the heroes are criminals on the run, escapees from a chain gang eager to retrieve cash from a robbery. The trio are lead by George Clooney's character Everett Ulysess McGill, a likeable rogue who has a passion for bryl creem. Like Odysseus, Everett and his fellow escapees eventually reach their destination only to find not all is as it was or as they were lead to believe."
