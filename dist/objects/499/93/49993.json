        "Once upon a time in a land far, far away, and so begins this animated fantasy. Set in a fantastical kingdom inhabited by fairy tale creatures, the story finds the enchanted princess, Fiona (Cameron Diaz) locked away in a tower guarded by a dragon; a scheming Lord Farquaard (John Lithgow) who wants to marry the princess so he can become King; an unlikely hero, the lovable ogre Shrek (Mike Myers) and his sidekick, Donkey (Eddie Murphy), who are sent by Farquaard to rescue the princess and bring her back to be his bride. Children will enjoy the tale for what it is - a lively romp, while adults will enjoy the many intertextual references to numerous other fairy tales. This video version has an extended ending not included in the original movie."
