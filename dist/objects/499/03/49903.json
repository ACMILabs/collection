        "Episodes 11 (Here she comes...Miss Amphipolis) and 12 (Destiny) from the second series of the groundbreaking television series about Xena, a female warrior struggling to come to terms with her evil past, and Gabrielle, her faithful sidekick. Together the two women roam across ancient Greece, battling warlords and righting wrongs. Filmed on location in New Zealand, the series is highly postmodern in tone, mixing martial-arts-inspired action sequences with 'camp' humour and contemporary cultural references. As a physically strong, independent woman, the character of Xena has been adopted as a feminist icon of popular culture. The implication within the subtext of the show that Xena and Gabrielle might be more than 'just good friends' has led many adult viewers to read the couple as lovers. In the gender-bending comic episode \"Here she comes...Miss Amphipolis\" Xena masquerades as a beauty contestant, and enters the \"Miss Known World\" beauty pageant in order to discover the identity of saboteurs. A drag queen wins the contest. \"Destiny\", the first of a dramatic two part episode, sees Xena suffering a near fatal wound. In a delirious state she revisits some of the experiences that shaped her life including her first encounter with Julius Caeser, and her relationship with a mysterious women. A beautifully photographed episode directed by Robert Tapert, the creator of the series."
