        "A lonely old inventor in a castle upon a hill dies and leaves his greatest creation, a boy called Edward, unfinished. Instead of hands, the boy has sharp shears of metal. Until his rescue by a kindly Avon lady who takes him home to the pastel paradise of suburbia, Edward lives alone in darkness. \"Edward Scissorhands\" is more than a fairy tale by masterful director Tim Burton. This is a satire/allegory which is both funny and moving. Johnny Depp as Edward is a gentle creature full of pathos, yet dignified; much less a monster than the fickle humans who at first embrace him and then seek to destroy him. Dianne Weist stars as Avon Lady Peg, and Winona Ryder as her daughter, Kim. The sets are typical of Burton's famed surreal style. \"Edward Scissorhands\" is a film of great poignancy with its own special beauty."
