        "Director Christopher Guest and cast members from his previous film 'Waiting for Guffman' reunite in this mockumentary following the exploits of five dogs and their handlers before the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. Guest himself plays Harlan Pepper, a fly-fishing store owner and amateur ventriloquist, who decides to enter his beloved bloodhound Hubert in the prestigious competition. His competition includes \"Winky\", a Norwich terrier, owned by neurotic couple Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara) and \"Beatrice\" a high-strung Wiemaraner owned by preppy couple Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock). Also making the trip to Philadelphia are Scott (John Michael Higgins) and Stefan (Michael McKean), life-partners from New York and their beloved Shih Tzu \"Miss Agnes\", and trophy wife Sheri Ann Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) and her friend and dog trainer, Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) and their poodle, two time 'Mayflower Best in Show' winner, \"Rhapsody in White\", also known as Butch. Cast also includes Fred Willard, Bob Balaban, Ed Begley Jr and Lewis Arquette."
