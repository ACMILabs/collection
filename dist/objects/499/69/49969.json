        "The concentration camps of World War 2 is an unlikely place to start this faithful film adaptation of the long running Marvel comic series. Director Bryan Singer however quickly makes the connection apparent as this tale of difference and intolerance unfolds. Set mainly in an unspecified future, 'X-Men' sets up the premise that human evolution has taken un unexpected leap when various children are born with a gene that mutates into extraodinary super powers. These special beings however are met with suspicion and fear by the wider community, in particular by right wing Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison), who wants to register the much maligned 'mutants'. Singer carefully introduces us into the labyrinth world of the X-men by following the plight of shy teenager, Marie D'Acanto (Anna Paquin), who discovers, much to her horror, that she has the power to absorb the life out of anyone she touches. Through her we meet Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a dangerous loner who, when provoked, protrudes steel blades out of his knuckles, as well as meeting the rest of the X-men who reside in a special school set up by the wheel chair bound and telepathic Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Of course every super hero must have it's villain, and a powerful foe is created in the mysterious and tormented Magnetto (Ian McKellen), a mutant who has the ability to harness magnetic energy and wants to start a war between the intolerant humans and the mutants. Cast also includes Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos and Ray Park."
