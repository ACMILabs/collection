        "Episodes twenty-one (\"The Greater good\") and twenty-two (\"Callisto\") of the first season of the groundbreaking television series about Xena, a female warrior struggling to come to terms with her evil past, and Gabrielle, her faithful sidekick. Together the two women roam across ancient Greece, battling warlords and righting wrongs. Filmed on location in New Zealand, the series was created as a spinoff from the popular fantasy-action series 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys'. Highly postmodern in tone, the series mixed martial-arts-inspired action sequences with 'camp' humour, contemporary cultural references, and a wild disregard for historical accuracy. As a physically strong, independent woman, the character of Xena has been adopted as a feminist icon of popular culture. The implication within the subtext of the show that Xena and Gabrielle might be more than 'just good friends' has led many viewers to read the couple as lesbian lovers. \"The Greater good\". When Xena is incapacitated and left near death after being struck by a poisoned dart, Gabrielle is forced to impersonate the Warrior Princess in order to protect a group of innocent villagers. In \"Callisto\", Xena is once again reminded of the sins of her past when a malicious female warrior, whose family was killed by Xena's former army, exacts her revenge on the Warrior Princess by impersonating her. This was the first appearance of the character of Callisto, known amongst \"Xena\" fans as \"psycho-Barbie\", who appeared as Xena's evil nemesis in a number of subsequent episodes. This episode also features one of a number of action-sequences borrowed from Hong Kong action movies that appear throughout the series. In this case the sequence where Xena and Callisto fight on an elaborate series of ladders is taken directly from \"Once upon a time in China\" (1991)."
