        "Samantha Morton is Iris, a young woman who is increasingly estranged from her happily married older sister, Rose (Claire Rushbrook). When their mother is diagnosed with a terminal disease Iris is thrown into such a turmoil of grief, anger and despair that she leaves her home, her job and her boyfriend and attempts to dull her pain by immersing herself into a frenzied abuse of alcohol, drugs and sex. As if countering her jealousy of Rose by becoming her exact opposite, Iris involves herself in casual sado-masochistic encounters that leave her both exhilarated and disturbed. \"Under the Skin\" won the Jury Prize at the Toronto Film Festival and the Michael Powell Award at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Carine Adler's debut feature film dares to tackle the ambiguities and contradictions of female sexuality and female competition in a contemporary world were many of the challenges of second-wave feminism have become accepted and institutionalised. In allowing Iris to be boldly naked - physically, metaphysically, and emotionally - Samantha Morton creates an unique and stunning central character. Cast also includes Rita Tushingham as the mother."
