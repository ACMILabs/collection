        "Jacques Demy (best known for his earlier film \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\") weaves a criss-cross tale of romantic thrill and extravagant dance numbers. Catherine Deneuve and real life sister Francoise Dorleac play twins Delphine and Solange, tired of living in the small town Rochefort. Delphine a dancer, and Solange a composer, dream of moving to Paris where they hope to find success, and most importantly, love. Unbeknownst to them their true loves can be found in the very town they live in. Colourful and romantic, \"The Young girls of Rochefort' is a homage to the American musical, with charismatic and charming performances to support the two leads - Gene Kelly plays the American composer Solange falls in love at first sight with, and George Chakiris (best known as Chino in \"West Side story\") plays a flirtatious carny. Lyrics are written by Jacques Demy and music is by long term collaborator Michel Legrand. Cast also includes Michel Piccoli, Jacques Perrin, and French screen legend Danielle Darrieux. In French with English subtitles."
