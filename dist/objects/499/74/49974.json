        "Talented and eager Mississippi lawyer Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) is called upon to defend Carl Lee (Samuel L. Jackson) after he kills the two rednecks responsible for the brutal rape of his ten year old daughter. Carl's act of retribution unleashes racial tensions in the small community fueled by the tactics of the Ku Klux Klan. Juggling a small, struggling law practice, his family life and attacks by the Klan, Jake reluctantly accepts legal help from law student Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock). He also appeals to his mentor (Donald Sutherland) and friend (Oliver Platt) for support against an unscrupulous prosecutor (Kevin Spacey). Against the advice from friends, the will of his wife and the wrath of white supremacy, Jake assembles a team committed to fighting against racial intolerance forcing those around him to examine Carl's actions and motives. Cast also includes Ashley Judd, Kiefer Sutherland, Charles L. Dutton and Brenda Fricker. Based on the novel by John Grisham. Screenplay by Akiva Goldsman. Music composed by Elliot Goldenthal."
