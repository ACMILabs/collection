        "Best-selling author of \"The Vampire Chronicles\", Anne Rice, discusses subjects that have had a profound affect on her both as an individual and a writer. She focuses mainly on her home town of New Orleans, and covers such diverse but related areas of interest including the people of New Orleans, churches, Catholicism, houses and architecture, religious art, festivals, and death. Includes still images of properties and locations used in some of her novels."
