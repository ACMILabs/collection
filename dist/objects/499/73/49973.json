        "A farcical comedy starring Cary Grant as Jim Blandings, an advertising man with two precocious daughters and a loving wife (Myrna Loy). Frustrated by their cramped and chaotic New York apartment, the Blandings purchase a property in Connecticut, hoping to relocate their family to an idyllic country estate. When their vision of peace and tranquility is shattered by the news that the house should be demolished, they embark on a expensive and highly charged journey to build a new home. Narrated by their pessimistic lawyer-friend (Melvyn Douglas) who anticipates problems and consistently advises the couple against their extravagant dream. Screenplay by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, based on the novel by Eric Hodgins. Cinematography by James Wong Howe."
