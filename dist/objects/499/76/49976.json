        "Based on that very famous and popular ABC television series \"Bellbird\", this feature film brings together all the main cast in yet another wonderfully put together story. The small country town of Bellbird is facing a crisis - one of its worst droughts in history. Can the farming community survive? Combining drama with romance and interspersed with some of that typical Aussie wit and humor, \"Country town\" faithfully recreates the warm charm of its original television series. Cast includes Gary Gray, Terry McDermott, Lynette Curran, Anne Charleston, Maurie Fields, Stella Lamond, Gerda Nicolson, Rosie Sturgess, Peter Cummins, Sheila Florance. Director of Photography: Bruce McNaughton."
