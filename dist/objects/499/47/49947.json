        "Based on a Jewish folk tale, this animated short tells the story of a Shmendrik, a lovable fool who leaves his village on a circuitous quest for knowledge. The story of Shmendrik's new life and its uncanny closeness to his old life offers a humorous take on people's tendency to romanticize what they don't have. Co-directors Fedorenko and Newlove filmed paper cut-outs on layers of glass to achieve unique, textured visuals."
