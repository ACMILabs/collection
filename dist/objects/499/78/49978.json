        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Bayside reflections: Port Phillip Bay on film\". Part one of a most comprehensive and fascinating two part history of Port Phillip Bay, dating back from the 1880's to present times and incorporating archival footage, both professional and amateur, to cover over a century of settlement in Port Phillip Bay. In particular, focus is on the two main southern peninsulas of Mornington and Bellarine, including Queenscliff, Point Lonsdale, Geelong, Portsea, Sorrento, Mornington and Frankston. The program is divided into seven segments and covers many topics including paddle steamers, fishing, boating, maritime disasters and dramatic rescues, lighthouses, filmmaking, storytelling, environmental issues and the people and architecture of the time. Composed entirely of original film and uses newsreels, documentaries, tourism promotions, advertisements, home movies, dramatic features and short subjects. Commentary by Paul Higgins."
