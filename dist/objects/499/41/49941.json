        "Based on the memoirs of Lilly Wust as recorded by Erica Fischer in her best-selling book, published in 1994, \"Aimee and Jaguar\" is a compelling love story that transgresses socially and politically imposed regulations around gender, race and culture. It tells the true story of two German women, one Jewish and one Aryan, who dared to fall deeply in love with each other at the height of the Holocaust. 1943- Lilly is a model bourgeois German mother of four children who indulges in affairs while husband is away fighting on the Eastern front. When she receives a love letter signed 'Jaguar,' she suspects a male admirer. But it is from the audacious Felice, a Jewish Resistance fighter, who initiates the passionate love affair that ignites between the two women amidst the bombing raids and anti-Semitic persecution. Inevitably it is a romance that is destined to end in tragedy. An immensely moving period drama, that also offers a visually impressive evocation of life in Berlin during WWII. In German with English subtitles."
