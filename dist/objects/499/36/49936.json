        "John Grady Cole (Matt Damon) and his friend Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) are young Texan men dreaming of an exciting life as cowboys. They set out for Mexico in search of employment, adventure and a better life. On their travels they met Jimmy Blevins (Lucas Black), a drifter wanted for stealing a horse, and they allow him to join their travels. In Mexico, they begin working for Hector de la Rocha (Ruben Blades), a wealthy landowner, raising his young and idealistic daughter, Alejandra (Penelope Cruz) alone. When Alejandra professes her love for Cole, her aunt (Miriam Colon) fights desperately to break up their love affair. When the authorities discover the boys working on the property, their past catches up with them and they are arrested for the theft of the horse. Cole must fight to prove his innocence and win back Alejandra. A coming of age western directed by Billy Bob Thornton, based on the novel of the same time by Cormac McCarthy."
