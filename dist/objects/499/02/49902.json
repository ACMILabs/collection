        "Episodes nine (\"Death in chains\") and ten (\"Hooves and harlots\") of the first season of the groundbreaking television series about Xena, a female warrior struggling to come to terms with her evil past and her faithful sidekick, the bard, Gabrielle. Together the two women roam across ancient Greece, battling warlords and righting wrongs. Highly postmodern in tone, the series mixes martial-arts-inspired action sequences with 'camp' humour, lesbian subtext, contemporary cultural references, and a wild disregard for historical accuracy. In \"Death in chains\" the arrogant King Sisyphus traps Celesta, the messenger of death, in his castle after she arrives to escort him to the underworld. Unless Celesta is released and her eternal flame restored, those who would die in normal circumstances are condemned to eternal suffering. Xena must find a way to free her before her flame is extinguished forever. \"Hooves and Harlots\" is the first episode to feature the Amazons and the Centaurs, two groups who paid major roles in subsequent episodes. It is also the episode in which Xena's sidekick Gabrielle, initially a naive and idealistic village girl who insisted on tagging along with Xena, comes into her own. After trying to save the life of a young Amazon woman, Gabrielle is given right of caste, becomes an Amazon princess and learns how to fight. With Xena's help she prevents an all-out war between the Amazons and the Centaurs that is being stirred up by an evil warlord with vested interests."
