        "In May 1971, in Ascot, England, John Lennon and Yoko Ono recorded the classic \"Imagine\" album in their own private studio. This documentary encapsulates the trials and tribulations of producing an album, from the direction and guidance of Phil Spector and his sound technicians to the collaboration of the musicians including George Harrison, Nicky Hopkins, and Klaus Voorman. During the making of \"Imagine\", John and Yoko took the unusual step of filming every aspect of the recording sessions. Enriching this documentary is footage from that filming including intimate moments between John and Yoko, life and friends outside the Studio, and a wonderful glimpse into the fashion and culture of 1971. Famous faces that pass across the screen include Jack Nicholson, Andy Warhol, Miles Davis and a very young Julian Lennon. Commentary throughout the film by John and Yoko, John's wonderful wry sense of humor and not least of all, the studio performances by John Lennon of the songs that make up this memorable classic album, all add to a must see documentary."
