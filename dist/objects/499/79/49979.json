        "Mike Max (Bill Pullman) is a leading Hollywood producer, whose triumph has come from a string of extremely violent action films. His work is his life, and he neglects his wife Paige (Andie MacDowell) in his pursuit of success. Paige, frustrated with his lack of attention, leaves him, and Max is forced to admit he was a less-than supportive husband. Not long after, Max becomes involved in a violent killing, and fearing for his life, goes into hiding, falling victim to a new top-secret surveillance system, which caught the crime on camera. Escaping into L.A.'s underworld, Max confronts a violence more terrifying than anything he could put on film. Directed by Wim Wenders (Wings of desire; Faraway so close; Paris, Texas) 'The End of Violence' is a tale of conspiracy, the effects of violence in our culture, and personal transformation. Cast includes Traci Lind, Rosiland Chao, Gabriel Byrne, Udo Kier, Frederic Forrest and director Samuel Fuller. The film's score was composed by Ry Cooder."
