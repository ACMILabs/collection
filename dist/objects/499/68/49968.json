        "This AFI award winning film is based on the life of Mark Brandon - \"Chopper\" - Read, a notorious Australian criminal who became a best selling author, publishing 9 books of his life and times as a key stand man in Melbourne's underworld. Eric Bana plays Chopper following his conviction for abducting a judge who was proceeding over the case of his best friend, Jimmy Loughnan (Simon Lyndon). Read ends up serving a 16 year sentence for his efforts, during which he shares a cell with Jimmy and has to contend with Keithy George (David Field), a crime boss who runs the prison. After an attack of violence instigated by Chopper, he kills Keithy and finds himself the target of numerous prisoners wishing revenge on him. As he sees it, the only way to escape the notorious H division is to get his friend to chop his ears off so that he can be transferred to another prison. Eight years later, Chopper is released and finds himself battling his own personal demons and psychotic episodes to try and adjust to outside life. All he can focus on is seeking revenge on arch enemy Neville Bartos (Vince Colosimo) and looking out for his girlfriend, Tanya (Kate Beahan). This special edition includes deleted scenes, theatrical trailer and footage of director Andrew Dominik and Eric Bana's visit to Chopper in Tasmania while researching the film."
