        "Night train is a romantic drama by first time director John Lynch featuring Oscar nominees John Hurt (Elephant Man, 1984) as Michael Poole, an ex-con man, and Brenda Blethyn (Secrets and Lies, Saving Grace) as Alice, the landlady's daughter. Upon release from prison, Michael Poole seeks refuge in an effort to avoid pursuit by a sinister gangland boss to whom he owes money. He moves into a house owned by an elderly domineering mother (Pauline Flanagan) and her emotionally repressed daughter, Alice. Poole finds his passion for electric model trains has Alice intrigued and together they find escape in his strange fantasy world. An awkward and tender romance begins to develop between these two rather sad and lonely people, frustrated by their pasts, and determined to find happiness in their future. But Poole is forced to take flight as the mob boss closes in, and with him Alice, on a real night train adventure on the Orient Express. Set in Dublin and filmed on location in Ireland, England and Italy, \"Night train\" has many delightful and touching moments performed by two great actors and a very capable supporting cast. Cast also includes Lorcan Cranitch, Cathy White, Peter Caffrey, Paul Roe and Rynagh O'Grady. (Awards: Winner Silver Rose Best Actor John Hurt, Schermi d'Amore Verona; Nominated Best European Film John Lynch, Brussels International Film Festival)"
