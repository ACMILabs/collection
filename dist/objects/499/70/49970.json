        "Director Cameron Crowe's experience as a teenage journalist for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine was the inspiration for this academy award winning film. Set in the 1970s, William Miller (Patrick Fugit) lives with his loving but over-protective mother Elaine (Frances McDormand), rebelling against her by writing music reviews for an underground newspaper. He is discovered by Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), editor of a controversial rock magazine, and is hired to review a Black Sabbath concert. While he is unable to review the band, he interviews opening act 'Stillwater', and the resulting article gains the attention of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. Despite his mother's distrust in the world of rock music, William joins Stillwater on tour, becomes friends with the band, falls for leader of the 'Band-aids', Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and discovers what really goes on behind the scenes in the rock and roll world. Cast includes Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Anna Paquin, Fairuza Balk, Noah Taylor, Bijou Phillips and Zooey Deschanel. (Awards: Academy Awards, Cameron Crowe for Best Screenplay)."
