        "This film from the National Film Board of Canada profiles a Mohawk Indian from Kahnawake just outside of Montreal Canada, who is a steelworker, working on the construction of skyscrapers in Manhatten New York. The Mohawk Indians from Kahnawake are famous for erecting the steel frames of skyscrapers and it is a tradition, which goes back generations. Some truly death-defining footage is shown of the steelworkers up on top of buildings skillfully shifting metal beams into position. The Indians community life is also shown in Kahnawake as well as some stunning historical photographs of Indians working on the Quebec Bridge in 1907 which ended in disaster. A song ballad by Bruce Mackay called Mountains of Iron and Steel is effectively mixed through the film. Directed by Don Owen."
