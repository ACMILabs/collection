        "After producing BIRTH OF A NATION and INTOLERANCE Griffith was commissioned by the American government to produce a propaganda film for the Allies in World War 1. Although not in the same class as his two masterpieces, HEARTS OF THE WORLD is nevertheless well in the Griffith tradition of striking sets, visual flair and spectacular battle scenes. A group of youngsters grow up and love in a peaceful French village. But war intrudes and peace is shattered. The German army invades and occupies village, bringing both destruction and torture. The young people of the village resist, some successfully, others tragically, until French troops retake the town. Stars Lillian Gish, Robert Harron, Dorothy Gish, Adolphe Lestina and Josephine Crowell. Noel Coward and Erich von Stroheim play small parts."
