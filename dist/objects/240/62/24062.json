        "A boy with a creative impulse is exposed to the influence of war toys through his companion and through commercialism. His conscience forces him to resist. He cannot decide what is better, reation or destruction. He eventually finds destruction more amusing than appreciation or creation, he abandons his drawing pad and runs off to play war. Music composed and sung by Glen Tomasetti."
