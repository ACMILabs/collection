        "First aid at the roadside - a clear demonstration of what the first person, or persons, on the scene of a motor vehicle accident should do during those critical minutes before ambulance and police arrive. A comprehensive film, dealing not only with on-the-spot treatment of injuries, but with the individual responsibility of every motorist in today's total traffic picture. It was produced with the counsel of federal and provincial medical and traffic authorities."
