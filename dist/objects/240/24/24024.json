        "Episode of Series \"This is the United Nations\". When Pakistan became an independent country in 1947, help was need by the United Nations to develop the land more extensively and establish industries. It was the people themselves who first received help from the UN. As a result of the Technical Assistance Schemes of the United Nations, Pakistanis are making more of the things they once imported, thus achieving a balance between agriculture and industry."
