        "The Bogong High Plains contribute to the prosperity of Victoria both as grazing land for cattle and sheep during summer months and as a catchment area for the Kiewa Hydro-Electric Scheme. However, fire, excessive stocking, insect pests and wind have damaged the pastures and soil erosion is now menacing the catchment area. The film outlines methods being used by the Soil Conservation Authority to combat this menace to the State's hydro-electric projects."
