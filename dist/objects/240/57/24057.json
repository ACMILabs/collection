From the Pee-Wee division to the Bantam league, from the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to the big-league professional stars, the film climbs the ladder, showing what it takes to make a hockey player - stick-handling ability, skating speed, science, strategy, expert coaches, and expensive equipment. And from east to west, the close identification of fans with players is evident in the excited cries, not of \"They've won,\" but of \"We've won!\""
