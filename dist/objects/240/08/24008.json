        "Narrated by Peter Finch. Music composed by Marguerite Monnet. Sung by Colette Renard. This film, co-produced with Great Britain and France, attempts to depict the personality of \"Modern\" France. Covers highlights of pre-1960's history - the revolt in Algeria; the German occupation and France's part in the two World Wars; the \"Indo-China War\"; and the influence of General de Gaulle on French history. Illustrates this theory with examples, showing how the average Frenchman lives - a peasant farmer, a Parisian craftsman jeweller, and a worker in the Renault factory."
