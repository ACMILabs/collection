        "This film deals with Australia's road problems. Describes how each member of the public is dependent upon road transport and points out that poor roads increase prices. Shows how cheaper methods of road transport can eventually be more costly. Suggests that the correct approach to the problem is lacking and offers a solution. Commentary by David Low."
