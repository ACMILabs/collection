        "Traces a prejudice against immigrants from its beginnings to its development into a socially damaging outburst. In the dramatisation, Tom Gregory's father, frustrated in his white-collar job, has contaminated his son with the anti-Polish feeling which lets out his repressed hatreds. Tom's mother also influences the boy with her defensive hostility to different ways of life. Doctors and social workers become involved after Tom's teenage gang attacks a party in the home of a Polish teenager. The social worker reveals the causes of the teenage riot."
