        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". The procedures for producing and measuring temperatures in the region of 2000 degrees are shown. Also studies the bond strength of gaseous titanium monosulphide and shows how its gaseous molecules as well as gaseous titanium and sulphur atoms are produced by the vaporisation of the high melting crystalline titanium monosulphide at this temperature."
