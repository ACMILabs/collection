        "Politicians under pressure during the 1966 election campaign in Britain. The camera goes to meetings up and down the country with an eye to angry and excited audiences. Suggests the heat, rather than the light, of a campaign. It is crammed with off-beat observation and fascinating side-lights on the techniques of leading politicians."
