        "A documentary on the sculptures and drawings of the young Vorticist sculptor who was killed in World War I at the age of 23. The film emphasises Gaudier-Brzeska's involvement with the Vorticist movement and Ezra Pound. Gaudier-Brzeska's statements on sculpture are drawn from his extensive correspondence and contributions to \"Blast\", the vorticist magazine. Much of the narration is drawn from the artists writings on his art."
