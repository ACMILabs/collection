        "The chromosomes in cell nuclei and their relation to the genes for the inherited characters of an animal, the processes of mitosis and meiosis, and the formation of gametes are explained by animated diagrams. Mendel's first law of segregation and dominance are illustrated. When more than one pair of genes are involved, it is shown how they segregate independently. Cross breeding illustrates the emergence in the second generation of a new type. Results of selective breeding of horses and dogs are also shown."
