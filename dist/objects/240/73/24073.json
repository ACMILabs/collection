The effect of alcohol and self-control; medical opinion estimates that the official figures on road accidents greatly underestimate the role of alcohol; the need for a scientific standard of intoxication; how the blood test helps police and protects passengers and others on the road; how the carelessness induced by alcohol frequently ends in tragedy. The story follows several people who combine drinking with driving."
