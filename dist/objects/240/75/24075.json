        "All along India's northern frontier run the Himalayas, a formidable chain of snow-clad mountains and glacial valleys. Clothed in this cold and glittering mantle lies the kingdom of Bhutan, remote and mystic. This film is a study of this neighbouring kingdom, its people and their art and culture. Narrated by Berkeley Hill."
