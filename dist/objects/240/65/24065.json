        "The story of a young man who, despite a crippling malady is determined to experience as many of life's offerings as possible. Brian Wilson is a spastic, confined to a wheelchair, but he works at a job, looks after himself, moving about from place to place on his own. Every day has its challenges and victories and sometimes defeats. An insight into the private daily struggle of the handicapped."
