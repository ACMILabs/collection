        "The visit to Melbourne of Hennessy, a 180-pound St. Bernard dog. He sees the Botanical Gardens, the Sydney Myer Music Bowl, and the Shrine, and takes a run around the M.C.G. After intensive grooming he wins a prize at the Royal Melbourne Show, the takes a ride on the \"Mightie Mouse\" [sic], and he also enjoys a ride on Puffing Billy and a spin on the bay in a speedboat. A modelling appointment, having his portrait drawn by a cartoonist, and an appearance on In Melbourne Tonight help make his visit a memorable one for all."
