        "Good heartkeeping makes life better, is the message of this animated cartoon film. Mr Anybody lives in a four-roomed apartment, in the four chambers of his own heart. He loves eating and smoking and hates to move around, but smoke fills his arteries and fat invades his heart. His home starts crumbling, the walls are cracking, the heart is sick. Help arrives in the form of a lady doctor who cleans up the house, throwing out the cigarettes and bringing in fresh air."
