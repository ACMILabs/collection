        "An ecological study, in full colour, of plant and animal life on the Queen Elizabeth Islands in the Canadian Arctic, and of the life cycles that are the law of nature even in these frozen wastelands. Animals such as the musk-ox, lemming and arctic hare, and various forms of plant life, are seen as part of an evolution that began in pre-history. Commentary: Strowan Robertson"
