        "Two young men who have been boyhood friends for years are taking their regular holiday together on a Scandanavian island. However, with approaching adulthood, the sexual tensions in their relationships begin to emerge. This is a serious and beautifully crafted story about adolescence and innocence, and the inevitability of change. By concentrating on the physicality and intimacy of the two male bodies in space, Mosvold creates a haunting, resonating work."
