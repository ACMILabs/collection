        "The evolution of civilization throughout the world is contrasted with the lack of development, the exploitation, and agony of Vietnam, through the ages. Problems of power, human rights, domestic politics, national prestige, and development of economy are so involved with fallible political processes; \"Peace\", \"Ceasefire\", \"Negotiation\", become meaningless re-iterations. Petty's first film comprising footage that he shot on a trip to Vietnam combined with animation of some of his newspape cartoons. Accompanied with music by George Dreyfus, the narrative builds to a strong anti-war statement."
