        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Engineering heat treatment of steel\". Shows how steel is tempered; how the structure, toughness and hardness of a plain carbon steel change at progressive tempering stages; how steel is normalised, by furnace heating and subsequent cooling in still air; how steel is annealed and how such an annealing process relieves stresses in steel castings and softens the metal."
