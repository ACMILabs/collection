        "This inspiring film received an Academy Award for the best feature documentary of 1956, A biography of Helen Keller, it traces her life from her birth to her mid seventies - when this documentary was made. As a small child, she was left totally blind and deaf by an illness. For years she was cut off from the rest of the world, until Ann Sullivan taught her to read braille, read lips and talk. This film shows excerpts from the silent docudrama: \"Deliverance\" in which she starred. Also contains the only newsreel footage of Ann Sullivan. Narrated by Katherine Cornell. Music by Morgan Lewis."
