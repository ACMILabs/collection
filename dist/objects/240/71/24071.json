        "Looks at sex stereotyping in schools. A female teacher and her children discuss the reaction of the children to the teacher's engagement, and to boys carrying out some activities often thought of as female-oriented, e.g. cooking, sewing. Also includes a discussion between a female principal and other teachers about women at the top and pupils choosing a course/sport regardless of gender. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
