        "Richard Dreyfuss plays Glen Holland, a musician who falls into a temporary teaching position at J.F. Kennedy High and stays for 30 years. The opus he composes takes second place to his great work, that of enriching the lives of his students as they pass through his class. This is not a film about a hero who performs brave deeds; but of ordinary people in everyday settings who strive daily for excellence in their lives. Dreyfuss is ably supported by Glenne Headly, Jay Thomas and Olympia Dukakis. \"Mr Holland's opus\" is a sentimental, warm film which will uplift the spirit."
