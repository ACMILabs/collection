        "'Children of the Revolution' is a delightful comedy which takes an irreverent look at political idealism. When Joan Fraser (Judy Davis), a zealous communist, visits Stalin in Moscow it's the height of the Menzies era. She returns to Australia pregnant. Could her Stalinist love child change the course of Australian history? Wonderful performances from Judy Davis and Sam Neill (in an ironic twist on their roles in 'My Brilliant Career'!) as well as Geoffrey Rush, Richard Roxburgh, Rachel Griffiths and F. Murray Abraham as Stalin."
