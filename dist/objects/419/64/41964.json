        "Director Howard Hawks reteams with John Wayne, who heads a group of highly skilled professional game hunters in Africa. They don't use bullets, rather capturing the ferocious big game with rope and cameras for zoos and circus attractions, an exciting business that pits man against beast. \"Hatari\" means \"danger\" in Swahili and the fine cast of this spectacular adventure film also includes Hardy Kruger, Red Buttons and Elsa Martinelli and Gerard Blain."
