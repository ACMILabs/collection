        "Based on the H.G. Wells novel 'Kipps', Tommy Steele stars as Arthur Kipp, a young draper's assistant who inherits a fortune and enters Edwardian society. Arthur finds out that wealth doesn't necessarily buy happiness. Apart from the lavish costumes, this production features some big numbers such as the title song and the wonderful \"What a picture'. Also stars Julia Foster."
