        "Not fourteen again is the fourth in a series of film documentaries about the social histories of three working class women. The series examines the womens' achievements, failures and changing attitudes. In this episode the women are mothers and wives in their thirties. Their teenage daughters, who are now at the age their mothers were when the series began are documented with equal importance. \"Not fourteen again\" presents a personal account of three young women and Armstrong, who is by now an old friend, builds a fascinating document."
