        "The Roaring Twenties come to life in this Academy Award winning musical starring Julie Andrews as the naive Millie, a country girl who comes to the big city in search of a husband. She befriends the sweet Miss Dorothy played by Mary Tyler Moore, fends off white slaver Mrs. Meers (Beatrice Lillie) and meets up with Muzzy played by Carol Channing who manages to solve all of Millie's romantic problems which involve her boss (John Gavin) and paperclip salesman James Fox."
