        "Les Feux Follets (Will-'o-the-Wisps) was founded as an amateur dance group in Montreal and developed into a professional group whose repertoire represents the folklore and the ethnic origins of the Canadian people. Two dances illustrate the group's virtuosity - a Plains Indian Betrothal dance, and a more frenetic exhibition of the sixties \"go-go\" dancing. Choreographed by Michel Cartier; music Claude Poirier; sound by Ron Alexander, Roger Lamoureux, Bernie Bordeleau and photographed and edited by Jean-Claude Labrecque."
