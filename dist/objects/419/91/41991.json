        "Teenagers, smooth-talking party animal, Rick (Aden Young) and his shy twin brother Stephen (Simon Bossell) fall for the same gorgeous uni student, Melissa (Saffron Burrows). Rick woos her and then loses her. A decade on and Rick is working as the manager of Hotel de Love, a tacky, neon-laced romantic hideaway, whilst Stephen has buried himself in the world of stockbroking. Life is dull and unchallenging until Melissa arrives at the hotel and the hijinks begin. Also starring Pippa Grandison, Ray Barrett and Julia Blake."
