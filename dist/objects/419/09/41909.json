        "Peter Greenaway's film is visually sumptuous and confronting. Inspired by images of billboards featuring young children as icons, Greenaway's film is set in the seventeenth century where child martyrs were similarly exploited. Rape, death, dismemberment occur when a miraculous child is the subject of a play that becomes too real. Stars Ralph Fiennes and Julia Ormond."
