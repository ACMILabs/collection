        "Belle vows to bring a little of the Christmas spirit into the Beast's castle, even though he has lots of misgivings about the success of her plans. All the enchanted objects chip in, even the reluctant Angelique, a beautiful tree ornament. The evil Forte, a pipe organ wants to undo all of Belle's plans and so spoil Christmas for everyone, but as in all good fairy tales, it all ends up happily ever after with the Christmas spirit intact."
