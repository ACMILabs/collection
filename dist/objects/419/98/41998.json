        "Episode of Series \"The Century of cinema\". White fellas dreaming. Written and directed by George Miller. Produced by George Miller and Doug Mitchell. 1996. Miller presents an entertaining journey through Australian cinema. Cinema is discussed in relation to the changing nature of society and how Australians have constructed and deconstructed a national cinema through celluloid. A must see for anyone interested in Australian cinema heritage. \"Cinema of unease. A personal journey by Sam Neill\". Written and directed by Sam Neill and Judy Rymer. Produced by Paula Jalfon and Grant Campbell. 1995. New Zealand cinema is a recent addition to the realm of national cinema, experiencing a significant growth in the previous two decades. Neill visits the land he migrated to and his experience as a performer and a viewer. \"Typically British\". Directed by Mike Dibb and Stephen Frears, produced by Colin MacCabe. Frears explores the notion of the incompatibility of 'British' and 'cinema' in a personal way to present the outstanding films and film-makers of Britain."
