        "Ang Lee directs this well scripted, acted and beautifully photographed version of Jane Austen's first novel. Emma Thompson, (who wrote the screenplay), and Kate Winslet are Elinor and Marianne. Elinor follows her head and Marianne is guided by her heart. Both sisters eventually find love but only after the usual complications. A star-studded cast includes Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman"
