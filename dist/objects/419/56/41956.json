        "To Live (or Lifetimes) is an extraordinary film which takes us through the major events in 20th century Chinese history. Gong Li and Ge You play a couple who struggle to survive in the midst of the tumultuous events that unfold in their lifetimes. With great power and subtlety Zhang Yimou places his characters in the fringes of the civil war, the great leap forward and the cultural revolution. Through their struggle to survive we experience the devastating effects of these historical events. Winner of the \"Grand Jury Prize\" and \"Best Actor\" in Cannes 1994, To Live is a moving tribute to all people who struggle to survive against the powerful arms of fate and history. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
