        "Episode of Series \"The Century of cinema\". Scorsese's enthusiasm for his country's film history is infectious and it permeates this second volume of the Century of Cinema. Divided into three sections, \"A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American cinema\" doesn't attempt to be objective or all inclusive. Instead Scorsese leads us through a fascinating tour of American cinema, conjuring interesting connections and unearthing lesser known gems. Includes interviews with Gregory Peck, Clint Eastwood, Billy Wilder, John Ford, King Vidor, Howard Hawks, Francis Coppola, Brian De Palma, Fritz Lang, Andre de Toth, Douglas Sirk, Nicholas Ray, Samuel Fuller, Orson Welles, Elia Kazan, Arthur Penn and John Cassavetes."
