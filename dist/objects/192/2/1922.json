        "In 1906 there was a brief gold rush to central Victoria following the discovery of the Poseidon Nuggets - the largest of which was 953 oz, on Melbourne Cup day. The rush was named for the winning horse that year. In this short interview Jack Flett recalls the schoolboy excitement of that time and of holding one of the famous nuggets."
