        "When Cohuna Higher Elementary School wanted to raise money for a film projector, local resident Tom Olsson decided to help by filming life in the township and surrounding countryside, and then showing the footage in the local Town Hall. His footage has been lovingly compiled by the Cohuna Historical Society and the resulting film gives us a special glimpse into rural life in 1950s Victoria. The school received their projector, and Olsson's films were shown annually as a Christmas treat for many years afterward. This segment documents, at the time, the world famous invention of a step up cowshed by local resident Frank Mathers."
