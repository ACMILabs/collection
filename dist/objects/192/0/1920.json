        "When Cohuna Higher Elementary School wanted to raise money for a film projector, local resident Tom Olsson decided to help by filming life in the township and surrounding countryside, and then showing the footage in the local Town Hall. His footage has been lovingly compiled by the Cohuna Historical Society and the resulting films give us a special glimpse into rural life in 1950's Victoria. The school recieved their projector, and Olsson's films were shown annually as a Christmas treat for many years afterward. This segment documents the QEII Coronation parade in 1952."
