        "When Noel Matthews watched this old film to see if it could go into the MAP project he realised that it was of enormous personal significance to him. This footage of Ararat township circa 1930 is combined with a voiceover by Noel explaining why watching this film had such a powerful effect. One of earliest submissions to the MAP project."
