        "As his teenage daughter's life hangs in the balance, a surgeon recalls crucial moments of his life, including an angst-ridden affair with a marginalised Albanian woman (a seriously de-glamorised Penelope Cruz) who he raped, but subsequently became sexually and emotionally entangled with. Adapted from the best-selling novel by Margaret Mazzantini, Castellitto (who also wrote the screenplay and previously directed the charming drama \"Mostly Martha\") presents an unflattering view of male anguish, betrayal and brutality as Timoteo becomes conflicted by his double life as an urbane husband on the one hand and a violent lover to a troubled waif, living in abject conditions, on the other."
