        "A married woman, and mother of three youngsters, is devastated by the infidelities of her philandering husband, which coincides with the death of her beloved father. With the view to reassess her life, she absconds to Thailand where she falls for a beautiful Balinese dancer. Despite her enjoyment of sexual fulfilment, freedom to explore her desire, and space for reflection away from her conventional suburban life, Maria is conflicted about her maternal duties and obligations. This interesting, early work by Phillip Noyce, intelligently probes the themes of female independence, motherhood and female sexuality within the context of 'the other' in this case being Maria's lover. Maria questions her attraction in light of his exoticism and culture, which contrasts sharply to her rigid upbringing. Stars a young Claudia Karvan as Maria's daughter. Also known as \"Echoes of paradise\"."
