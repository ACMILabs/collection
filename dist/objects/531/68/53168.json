        "The power of seduction is explored in this dramatic thriller where corruption is rife in the business and political world. Media tycoon Michael Bergman (John Savage) meets a married executive secretary (Kerry Armstrong) and the two begin an affair. She, seduced by promises and material wealth, falls for Michael and moves into his mansion and life for good. Once part of his domain, however, like a moth to the flame (a literal image in the film) her new world starts to unravel. Written, directed and produced by Frank Howson. Cast includes Guy Pearce, Rebecca Rigg, Jeffrey Thomas, Rhys McConnochie, Nicholas Bell."
