        "Gatlif's passion for Gypsies and their music continues as a theme in this his fourth feature film. A young French boy Max discovers Gypsy music and lifestyle whilst on summer holidays with his grandmother. He takes guitar lessons from a master player of Manouche Jazz in return for reading and writing letters to Social Security on his teacher's behalf. During lessons he begins to fain headaches to spend more time with the beautiful gypsy tomboy 'Swing'. Swing teaches Max, who is from the wealthy side of the river, about nature and brings him to some wild musical evenings at the caravans."
