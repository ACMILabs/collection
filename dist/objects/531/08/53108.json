        "With friendship and love as the key themes, this romantic comedy is refreshingly adult in its interrogation of two men (a priest and a rabbi) who fall for the same woman. Ben Stiller is utterly believable as Jacob Schram, an ambitious but highly personable rabbi whose faith and community are outright central to his life and value system. All this comes under threat however when he falls for Anna, a childhood friend who is not Jewish. She falls for Jacob hard but unbeknownst to both of them their mutual friend Brian (Edward Norton, who also has director duties) has serious designs on Anna, which sparks a moral and religious dilemma for the celibate priest. Also stars Eli Wallach, Anne Bancroft and Milos Foreman as mentors to the three troubled youth."
