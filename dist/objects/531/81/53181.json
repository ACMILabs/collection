        "Lost documentary concert footage of the great Ray Charles shot during a tour to Tel Aviv and historic religious sites in 1973. Not uncovered until 30 years after being filmed, Ray and his big band (also featuring some awesome back-up singers the \"Raylettes\") give a great performance of blues, soul and even a couple of Beatles tunes. Segments of the concerts are intercut with footage of Ray visiting religious sites and mixing with the locals. Note that some of the film is a bit scratchy due to the archival nature of footage. Tracks include \"Let the good times roll\", \"Yesterday\", \"Shake\" and \"I can't stop loving you\"."
