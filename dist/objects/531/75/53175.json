        "Brooding, gothic thriller about a beautiful, naive country girl whose dreams of a grander life are realised with her sophisticated and urbane cousin who resides at the palatial estate, \"Dragonwyck\". Dazzled by his social mobility and wealth, Miranda is soon betrothed to the faintly menacing Nicholas, but the marriage becomes wretched as Nicholas' true nature is revealed. Shades of \"Rebecca\" (1940) hang over this mystery drama, but the Hitcockian tones are diluted in favour of a more romantic tone. What remains is an engaging, and at times suspenseful, murder mystery. Directorial debut of screenwriter and producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz."
