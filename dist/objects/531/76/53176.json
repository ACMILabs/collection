        "Episode of Series \"American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection\". Lauded and much admired adaptation of the caustic Harold Pinter play about three estranged brothers and their father. When one son - an accomplished university professor - visits from America with his wife, the family are reunited in their London home only to find that tension and malevolence simmers dangerously below their every interaction. As a study of male violence, family dysfunction, rage and suppressed emotion, Pinter's screenplay shines even if the characters' motivations are opaque, and their capacity for hatred, disturbing. Cast includes: Vivien Merchant, Terence Rigby, Paul Rogers, Cyril Cusack, Michael Jayston, and Ian Holm who is brilliant as the menacing pimp, Lenny."
