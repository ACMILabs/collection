        "Phil's falafel shop is where it all goes down - some peoples' lives culminate in a single defining moment and how they all get to that point over a forty-eight hour period is the storyline. Set in 1990s Sydney, the drug and techno music lifestyle of a group of young men and women is explored. DJ Lush Puppy (Nathalie Roy), the good-looking girl DJ and skateboard rider, is friend of Jess (Kylie Minogue) who is working in the sleazy underworld crime scene. Jess and her beau (Simon Lyndon) aim to make off with some cash, leaving the gangster lifestyle behind. Homeboy Joey and his mate Gus have a gun and not much to occupy their time except to be wild and crazy out on the streets. Sam (Joel Edgerton) has a premonition that his girlfriend is going to overdose and wants to get out of town on a holiday. Nightclubbing, sex and hallucinogenic trips send the friends into a spin and pursuit by the upset gangsters sets up some tension - all leading them to Phil's Falafels where an armed robbery and death occur. Some lighter moments and one-liners aim to relieve the tense atmosphere, as does the rock/techno soundtrack. Cast includes: Ben Mendelsohn, David Field, Paula Arundell, Justin Rosniak, Matthew Wilkinson, Gandhi MacIntyre, Dorian Nkono."
