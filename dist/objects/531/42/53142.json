        "Gurinder Chadha continues her yen for light-hearted comedy in this coming-of-age, culture-clash, sports comedy about a young English teenager who dreams of playing soccer like her hero David Beckham, much to the horror of her traditional Indian family. Jess must defy familial expectations, in order to achieve her goals, and attain personal fulfilment, risking familial alienation and parental disappointment. Some great moments of cross-cultural hilarity made this film a very popular crowd pleaser."
