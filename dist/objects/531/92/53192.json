        "Historically significant horror film by Wes Craven, is a rape-revenge drama that is unflinching in its depiction of murder, rape, sadism and violence. Despite the poor acting and cheap production values \"Last house on the left\" has a visceral impact that imparts a sense of dread and loathing upon the viewer. This film, at once derided for its brutality and yet praised for its daring, soon became a cult classic and was consequently, highly influential upon future horror-genre filmmakers. Along with \"The Night of the living dead\" (Romero, 1968) this film heralded the golden age of horror, ushering in an era of 'realistic' depiction of brutality in the American heartland. Contains graphic images and some scenes may disturb."
