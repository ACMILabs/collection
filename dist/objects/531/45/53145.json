        "Camp comedy, based on a true story, about a group of gay and transsexual men who join a volleyball team and are led to victory by an unassuming but determined coach. Drawing comic conflict from the protagonists preening and interpersonal problems, the film travels a fairly standard arch regarding tolerance difference and overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds. A huge hit in Thailand, this film also played in numerous festivals, including Toronto Film Festival. Followed by a sequel The Iron ladies 2 in 2003."
