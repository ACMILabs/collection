        "Set in Tudor London, Edward IV, Price of Wales, is only thirteen years old, yet he is heir to the throne. Some rather unexpected events take place when, for amusement, he changes his clothes with Tom, a pauper, who bears an uncanny resemblance to him. Made for television this animated film is based on the story by American writer, Mark Twain."
