        "Steve Martin stars in this fairly rudimentary remake of the Spencer Tracey/Elizabeth Taylor original of 1950, directed by Vincente Minnelli. On her wedding day, the bride's harried father reminisces over the rocky journey from proposal to ring swapping, for he and his family. Feeling increasingly sidelined by the trappings of the big day, George Banks (Martin) gets in to no end of trouble as he tries to steer his way through the mysterious rites of modern marrying whilst also recognising that his daughter is all grown up. Also stars Dianne Keaton and Kieran Culkin."
