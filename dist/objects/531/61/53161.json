        "A remake of the Judy Holliday film from 1950, this version stars Melanie Griffiths in the title role as the gauche mistress of a shady businessman. Keen to enter politics, but reluctant to ditch his liability, he makes her over with the aid of the tutor Paul Verrall (Don Johnson, in the role originally played by William Holden). Billie gains more than just an education however - she falls in love, starts to value herself and begins to recognise the transgressions of her brutish lover. Based on the play by Garson Kanin."
