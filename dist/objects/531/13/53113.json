        "Famed director Zhang Yimou delivers a spectacular martial art masterpiece that, in the style of \"Roshomon\", presents a tale from numerous perspectives. Set during the Warring States period (when China was divided into seven states) the film supports various strands - a nameless soldier (Jet Li) embarks upon a dangerous quest to avenge his massacred people; a lone female warrior seeks to match the exacting standards of her master; two legendary assassins, who are also lovers, play out their final act. The graphics and set pieces of the film rival those of \"Crouching tiger, hidden dragon\", being quite spectacular in nature, with an outstanding colour palette, depicted thematically. Highlights are the female warriors fighting in an autumnal forest, a lakeside showdown and the mountain top finale for the lovers. Bolstered by a top cast (Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Zhang Ziyi) Yimou creates an exciting addition to the wuxia genre, whilst sustaining a lyrical, romantic and elegiac tone."
