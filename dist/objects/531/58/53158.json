        "Episode of Series \"American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection\". A satirical comedy about bored and alcoholic office worker Stanley (Gene Wilder) and his friend John (Zero Mostel) who bare witness to a strange 'illness' in which fellow human beings slowly turn into Rhinos. A film rendition of Eugene Ionesco's play, part of Theater of the Absurd, \"Rhinoceros\" looks to explore the themes of conformity in society and keeping-up-appearances. Will Stanley be able to resist becoming one of the herd and maintain his individuality? This low budget film has some compelling performances, particularly that of Mostel when he makes his transition to the animal kingdom and some wacky black comedy situations, such as a stampede of Rhinos (that are left to the imagination to see) that take out the stairs of the office leaving Stanley and his workmates stranded. Stanley has his own particularly simple attitude: \"I'm indifferent to life, so I take a few drinks and then it doesn't bother me anymore.\" Cast includes Karen Black, Joe Silver, Robert Weil."
