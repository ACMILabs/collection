        "Iconic film noir set in New York about a pickpocket who lifts microfilm bearing US secrets from the handbag of the former mistress of a Communist spy. Sam Fuller combines brisk pacing with sizzling dialogue to create a masterful political thriller that plays upon the over-ripe fears of Communism, espionage and political conspiracy. Richard Windmark plays a wonderfully amoral Skip McCoy, a freshly sprung jailbird, trying to play for all best angles, in an increasingly dangerous game he barely comprehends. Also stars the peerless Thelma Ritter as a street-wise grifter and Jean Peters as the louche femme fatale."
