        "Hilarious, cult, low-budget, highly eccentric slasher horror flick from Frank Henenlotter is about two Siamese twins, reluctantly separated in adolescence by merciless doctors. Seeking revenge, the two (one a full bodied man, and the other a head in a basket) set up in a seedy New York hotel, where they encounter an array of fringe dwellers. Minimal and basic special effects do not detract from the gruesome fun of seeing a mutant, enraged head on the rampage. Followed by two sequels in the 1990s."
