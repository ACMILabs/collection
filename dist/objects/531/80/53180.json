        "Episode of Series \"American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection\". Simon Gray's screen adaptation of his play \"Butley\" which was originally produced on the West End Stage by Michael Codron and directed by Harold Pinter. Alan Bates (who won a Tony Award for this role on the stage) is outstanding as Butley, a university lecturer whose life is falling apart. This day-in-the-life drama, set in his work place (a small college office) gradually unfolds as his life unravels. Butley's sharp verbal wit is relentless as is his need for a smoke and stiff drink - especially as his wife (Susan Engel) has left him for another man. His workmate and previous flatmate Joey (Richard O'Callaghan) is leaving him too to be with his boyfriend Reg (Michael Byrne). Confoundedly confrontational as he feels everyone is deserting him, Butley could be disliked by the viewer but there is a subtly to Bates' performance that somehow makes him likeable beyond the verbal gymnastics and dishevelled exterior. Cast includes Jessica Tandy, Georgina Hale, Simon Rouse."
