        "This hilariously sexy comedy has critics everywhere standing and cheering! The irresistible Sarah Jessica Parker (Honeymoon in Vegas, L.A. story) stars as Gwyn Marcus - a recently-engaged young woman about to make a shockingly funny discovery: marriage and fidelity don't always go hand-in-hand, especially in her own family! From then on, it's comical chaos as one by one, Gwyn unravels the details of their outrageously tangled affairs. Stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Mia Farrow, and Antonio Banderas."
