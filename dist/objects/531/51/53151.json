        "A political thriller that is the true story of a young African leader, elected at the age of 36 to become the first Prime Minister of the newly independent state of the Congo. Patrice Lumumba (Eriq Ebouaney) in the 1950s was fifty years before his time as he was seeking the ideal of a country free of colonial rule and a true democracy but he became a victim to corruption and powerful international big business interests. The film traces his journey from humble beginnings as a beer salesman to a voice of the people and great leader, finally to his torture and assassination. Powerfully acted and empathetically realised, this story resonates on two levels both as a personal life story of the man but also as an historical political account. Winner of a Peace Award at the Political Film Festival in the United States. A French, Belgian, German, Haitian co-production. Cast includes Alex Descas, Maka Kotto, Theophile Moussa Sowie, Andre Debaar."
