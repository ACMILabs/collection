        "Sigrid Thornton stars in this dramatic thriller as Angela, a young hairdresser who has just split up with her boyfriend Daryl (Vincent Gil). Daryl is obsessed by Angela and can't move on after their break-up and follows her around in his \"Mr Whippy\" van. Upon meeting the exotic and glamorous Madeline (Chantal Contouri) Angela gives up hairdressing to try out as a model in glamour photography. Her first shoot is a topless one and suddenly she becomes very popular - the quick fame and money is a case of too much too soon and her youth and inexperience lead Angela to be manipulated. Tensions also rise as she becomes victim to an anonymous stalker. With music by Brian May, two songs performed by Sherbet and shot on location in Melbourne, this is also a snapshot of the city in the late 1970s. Released in the United States as \"The Day before Halloween\". Note: the quality of the transfer to DVD is low. Cast includes Denise Drysdale, Robert Bruning, Julia Blake, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Bob Brown."
