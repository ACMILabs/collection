        "Impressive debut from Argentinean filmmaker Fabian Belinsky, sees two con-artists link up, despite their mutual mistrust and misgivings, in order to pull off increasingly complex, daring and lucrative scams. This culminates in a scheme to sell a valuable sheet of stamps, the Nine Queens of the title, to a wealthy businessman. To do this the pair must continuously re-invent the set-up and its execution. Reminiscent of the work of David Mamet, Belinsky keeps the audience delightfully bewildered by the state of play as the narrative threads gradually unravel. An amusing and clever addition to the caper genre."
