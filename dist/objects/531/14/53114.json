        "A remake of the popular children's animated TV series, this family oriented comedy, traces Gadget's history as a mild-mannered security guard, reborn as super-detective, Inspector Gadget, able to foil criminals with his innumerable tools - which due to a freak incident - are now a part of his body. Gadget seeks to bring down the evil Dr Claw, (played with charm by Rupert Everett) - the man responsible for his transformation. Also stars Joely Fisher as Gadget's romantic interest and Matthew Broderick as Inspector Gadget."
