        "Based on a true story this 70's thriller is a powerful and horrifying police drama. It follows the story of the hunt for a serial killer who has raped and murdered dozens of women in the Boston area. Rapists and sexual offenders are dragged from the street to undergo interrogation in the hope of finding the killer. Disturbing and tense this film is extremely well acted, and uses the then fashionable multi-image technique. A docudrama that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Cast includes Tony Curtis, Henry Fonda, Hurd Hatfield and George Kennedy."
