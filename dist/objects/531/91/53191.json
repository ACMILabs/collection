        "Roger Vadim directed Brigitte Bardot in her last feature film, as a female version of the legendary lover, Don Juan. Told in flashback, the narrative depicts Jeanne's confession -- to seducing an array of vulnerable men, several of whom meet with sticky ends. Partly a critique of sexual mores, this film plays as an intriguing timepiece of female sexuality and the corruptive urges of human nature. Cast also includes Jane Birkin as one of Jeanne's lovers."
