        "In this early Stephen Frears feature, Terence Stamp plays Willie Parker, a philosophising mobster who adopts a tranquil life in Spain after betraying several cohorts. Ten years on they track him down, and two crims, Braddock and Myron, are charged with driving him across Spain en route to Paris where he will be assassinated. The journey is complicated by Willie's ability to undermine Braddock (a young hot-shot, keen to impress) and Myron (a cool professional). Although tension and violence infuse the set-up, the film is marked by dark humour, and enhanced by Terence Stamp's wry performance. Cast also includes John Hurt, Tim Roth, and Bill Hunter."
