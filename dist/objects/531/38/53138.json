        "Written, produced and directed by Australian filmmaker Bill Bennett (\"Kiss or Kill\") this erotic thriller set in Louisiana, New Orleans, explores the boundaries of fidelity and friendship. A wealthy businessman Charlie (Burt Reynolds) pays a young carpenter, Jimmy (Peter Facinelli), who is under his employ to try and seduce his wife, offering to pay him $10,000 for the attempt and a further $40,000 if he can identify a 'mark' hidden on her body. Although he swears not to tell anyone about the offer Jimmy confides in his best friend, showing him the photograph of the young and beautiful wife Lilly (Saffron Burrows). Not trusting his wife or Jimmy, Charlie uses the services of a private detective to wire his house and obtain video evidence of any possible sexual encounters. As it is the steamy South, guns, intrigue and murder ensue as Lilly finds out about the deal and goes ahead with the affair. Great original music composed by David Bridie adds to the swampy New Orleans locations."
