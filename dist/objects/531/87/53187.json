        "In this documentary, focusing on horror films from the 60s and 70s, director and screenwriter Adam Simon convincingly argues that the artists crucial to those works (in particular the directors) were reflecting the greater problems facing American society at that time - the Vietnam War, corruption of government, the conflicts of the Civil Rights movement and the divisiveness between generations. Interviews with key directors and scholars is interspersed with extensive clips from films such as \"The Last house on the left\" and \"Night of the living dead\" as well as news footage from Vietnam, political assassinations and other terrifying world events. Interviewees include: George A. Romero, John Carpenter, Tom Savini, David Cronenberg, Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, John Landis. Contains graphic images and please note, some scenes may disturb."
