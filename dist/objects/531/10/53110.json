        "Essentially two shorts, these charming animated child orientated tales are hosted by perennial Disney favourite Jiminey Cricket. The first, \"Bongo\" is a musical about an escaped circus bear searching for love and meaning in life and the second, \"Mickey and the beanstalk\" is based on \"Jack and the beanstalk\". Features the voices of Edgar Bergen, Dinah Shore, Luana Patten, The Dinning Sisters, Clarence Nash, and Walt Disney. This was Walt Disney's last film as the voice of Mickey."
