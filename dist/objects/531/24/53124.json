        "Set in the Gobi Desert, Southern Mongolia, this narrative-style documentary explains a wonderful custom that could be used as an allegory for motherhood in the modern world. Made by two student filmmakers, they travel to Mongolia to meet a family of three generations living a simple nomadic lifestyle. During the spring, one of the family's camels has a difficult delivery, giving birth to a rare white colt but she then rejects the youngster. Two family members set off to fetch a musician who plays a violin-like stringed instrument. The musician and a female family member perform a simple ritual that will re-unite the mother camel with her young. Striking landscape vistas and moving insight into the nomadic family life are captured by Luigi Falorni's cinematography in this poignant representation of folklore and traditional storytelling. Nominated in the 2004 Academy Awards for Best Documentary (feature length)."
