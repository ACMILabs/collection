        "Tinged with a sense of foreboding and mystery not unlike the landscapes in which the film is set, \"In my father's den\" is a mix of coming-of-age story and murder mystery. Paul (British actor Paul MacFadyen), a war photographer, returns to his isolated hometown in New Zealand for his father's funeral. He left the town when his mother committed suicide and his brother (Colin Moy), who remained behind, does not welcome his return warmly. Staying on for a longer time that he anticipated, Paul starts a friendship with his ex-girlfriend's illegitimate 16-year-old daughter Celia (Emily Barclay). Celia is a typical angst-ridden teenager with a sharp mind and yearning to explore the wider world - not unlike Paul in his youth. When Celia disappears, Paul becomes the main suspect and the town turns against him. An adaptation of Maurice Gee's novel of the same name, first time feature writer/director Brad McGann has created a cinematic treat, building unspoken tensions and fears as the story unfolds. Cast includes Miranda Otto."
