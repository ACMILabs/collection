        "Charlie Parker, famously known as Bird, won fame as the king of the hipsters with his virtuoso saxophone playing and innovative jazz. This work traces his life story from Kansas City to the New York jazz scene of the 1950s, tracing the short, somewhat tragic journey of a lauded and revered, if commercially ignored, musician. As well as providing key performances of signature tunes - Ballade, Yardbird Suite, Just friends, Koko, Confirmation, Au Privave and Kim Bloomdido - this work also comprises his only surviving TV performance, and interviews with Bird's contemporaries. Contains wonderful vintage footage of Bird performing, plus tunes performed by Thelonious Monk, Louis Armstrong and Count Basie."
