        "The perfect scenario - a remote island vacation with the man you love. He proposes, you say yes, life is wonderful. Then you are called away to do a one-day shoot in Tahiti and suddenly your life changes. High-powered New York magazine editor Robin Monroe (Anne Heche) finds herself in this very situation when the plane, engaged for the one-day shoot and piloted by the rough and ready Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford), is forced to land in stormy weather on an unknown remote island. Robin and Quinn are left to deal with each other, with survival and an uncertain future, whilst Robin's boyfriend Frank (David Schwimmer) and Quinn's girlfriend Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors) share their fears and concern at the hotel bar. Filmed on location on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Cast also includes Allison Janney, Temuera Morrison."
