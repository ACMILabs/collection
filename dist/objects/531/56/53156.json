        "Three small time confidence tricksters unite to try and get money by robing the poor. \"Il Bidone\" is crime-doesn't-pay film with a realistic starkness only Fellini could instigate. Strong performances play out in a harsh setting and with dire consequences for the main protagonist Augusto (Broderick Crawford) as he tries to help his estranged daughter with money to attend college but ends up betrayed by those who, like him, are swindlers up to no good. The second film in Fellini's so called trilogy about loneliness (which include \"La Strada\" and \"Le Notti di Cabiria\"). Cast includes: Giulietta Masina, Richard Basehart, Franco Fabrizi."
