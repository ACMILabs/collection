        "A classic example of the Western genre, written, directed and produced by maverick Samuel Fuller. Shot in black and white and \"cinemascope\" this lush film is filled with all you would expect from a Western: guns, fancy horse riding, showdowns and a bit of romance. The tough town femme-fatale Jessica Drummond (Barbara Stanwyck) has a posse of forty hired guns that make her the de facto leader of the County. She falls in love with a Marshall (Barry Sullivan) who arrives to restore law and order with tensions building up to a showdown."
