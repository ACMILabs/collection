        "'Its not about the destination but the journey' is an appropriate cliche to describe this teenage road movie - a group of Year 12 students finish high school and set out by bus, train and car to get to \"Schoolies Week\" celebrations at the Gold Coast in Queensland. This teenage comedy has a rocking soundtrack that emphasises the excitement as these youth find themselves without boundaries and without parental supervision - they all seek the hedonism of a sex, drugs and rock n' roll ethos that they think will help them 'party hard'. But for some along the way old relationships are challenged and a new dynamic emerges as some friends come-of-age on their travels and others simply end up with terrific hangovers. Based on a play by Stephen Davis. Cast includes Tony Brockman, Travis Cotton, Jamie Croft, Jessica Gower, Craig Horner, Mark Priestley, Charlotte Rees, Nathalie Roy, Kristian Schmid, Veronica Sywak, Petra Yared, and Matthew Newton. -- Mate (prod. Jan Aird, 1997, 10min.) This witty short film also by filmmaker Evan Clarry is included in the special features. Shot on location in Far North Queensland it is the story of two mates who make a promise to each other that should they die, their remains should be cut up and fed to the local crocodiles. Cast includes Damien Garvey and Andy McDonell."
