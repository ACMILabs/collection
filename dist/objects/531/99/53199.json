        "Expressive romantic tale, which invokes the spirit of South American author Garcia Marquez, about an aging man who strives to atone for past errors in order to embrace a new romance. Whilst living in a remote part of the Amazon jungle, Antonio becomes a virtual recluse following the death of his beloved. Within his jungle home he has only one friend, a charismatic lothario (Hugo Weaving) who introduces him to Josefina, a beautiful local woman who works for the mayor, a corrupt official. When the mayor grants illegal visas to poachers, a litter of jaguar cubs is slain; the fearsome mother finds and kills the poacher, but having acquired a taste for human blood, the village is now in peril. The mayor suggests a hunting party, lead by Antonio. During the hunt, Antonio recalls key incidents from his past, including his marriage, his passion for Josefina, his love of reading and his friendship with a native that contributed his sadness. Rolf de Heer (Bad Boy Bubby, The Tracker) evokes a handsome story of redemption, lyrically encapsulated within the old man's memories, whilst presenting a paradisaical, if brutal, environ."
