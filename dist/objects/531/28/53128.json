        "Episode of Series \"American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection\". Adapted from French playwright, Jean Genet's absurdist play, \"The Maids\" is about a pair of sisters caught up in a twisted play-acting game whereby their antipathy for their mistress and for each other, is revealed. After having her husband framed and imprisoned, the sisters, employed as maids for Madame, plan to poison her. In her temporary absence however they fantasise about dominance, wealth and power with Claire (Susannah York) acting as Madame, whilst Solange (Glenda Jackson) alternately fawns over then rants mercilessly, spitting out endless bile that speaks of her own self-loathing and hatred for her class. The film presents an impressive, and appropriate, sense of claustrophobia as the two women steer along a tragic course. Stellar cast also includes Vivien Merchant."
