        "Children's themed anime about a young girl fleeing pirates and corrupted government officials, who pursue her for a magical necklace that she wears. Pazu is the young boy who catches Sheeta as she floats down from the sky, and accompanies her on perilous adventures. Both seek Laputa, Sheeta's ancestral home and a place of boyhood dreaming for Pazu, an elaborate and alluring Hayao airborne castle. Containing the visual spectacular feast that was the hallmark of \"Spirited away\", Miyazaki presents an exciting adventure film, fleshing out his preoccupation with feisty (and imperilled) children, aeronautics and otherworldliness."
