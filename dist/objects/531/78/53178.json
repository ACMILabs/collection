        "Originally shot in colour 16mm film, this DVD edition has some of the hallmarks of an old print - scratches, pink tinge in the colour and generally dubious quality. But all of this can be forgiven, as the content of the work is a wonderful documentary of live footage of concerts of UK punk bands given in late 1970s London and Germany. Features bands The Clash, The Adverts, The Jam, The Boomtown Rats, The Electric Chairs and others. Includes interviews, shots of street-wear fashion and crowds, including loving audiences pogo-ing with great delight and alcohol fuelled fervour. This film captures the youth of the day and their quest to make themselves seen and heard, singing \"Oh Bondage, Up Yours!\" Directed by Wolfgang Buld from the Munich Film School. (Please note a small glitch occurs at 00:09:57 min)."
