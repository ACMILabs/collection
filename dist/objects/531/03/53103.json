        "Classic black and white British comedy from the 1960s starring the indomitable Peter Sellers as a lusty (but married) Welsh librarian. Set in Aberdarcy Wales, the Public Library is visited by the chairman's wife (Mai Zetterling) in search of picture books to research costume design for the Aberdarcy Players new amateur theatrical. She flirts shamelessly with the librarian John Lewis (Sellers) and they attempt to have an affair. His potential for job promotion and his marriage seem to be in jeopardy as a result. Richard Attenborough has a guest appearance as a rival for his wife's (Virginia Maskell) affections. A witty plot filled with as many cigarettes as sharp one-liners, a delightful film. Based on the novel \"That uncertain feeling\" by Kinsley Amis."
