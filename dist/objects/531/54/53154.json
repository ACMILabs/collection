        "Directed by Australian Samantha Lang (The Monkey's mask), this is a tale of two different souls who find solace in each other - and a kind of obsession. Set in Paris, France in an apartment block with a winding staircase that binds the people who live there. In an empty apartment opposite the elderly resident of Chinese origin called Zao (James Hong) arrives the beautiful and melodramatic Sarah (Leelee Sobieski), a young theatre actress from Australia. Sarah wants to feign a suicide to scandalise her relationship with her married lover but until she does the deed Zao asks that he may cook for her. Together they face the prospect of the end of life, love and sexual yearning - and an enjoyment of good food. Based on the novel \"A L'Heure Dite\" by Michelle Tourneur."
