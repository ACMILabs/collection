        "A film very representative of the era and place in which it was made - New York late 1960s. \"Greetings\", directed by Brian De Palma, is about three hip intellectual young men who come up with some novel ideas on how to avoid the draft that will send them to the conflict in Vietnam. Paul (Jonathan Warden), Jon (Robert De Niro) and Lloyd (Geritt Graham) present as gay and extreme right-wingers to the army all the while trying their best to seduce women to keep themselves occupied. This is a witty and satirical view of American culture at the time and is more a series of fun episodes in the protagonists' lives than a straight-forward narrative. Co-written by Brian De Palma and Charles Hirsch and also edited by De Palma. Music by 'The Children of Paradise'."
