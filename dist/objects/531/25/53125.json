        "Shane Meadows writes and directs this drama about two young boys' friendship and their coming-of-age. Neighbours, the boys share life experiences (and porno magazines) and support each other as one is physically unwell and the other's parents have separated. The friendship is tested however when a creepy stranger manipulates his way into their lives by trying to date the attractive older sister of Romeo. Tensions arise as the stranger becomes more violent as his affections are rejected. Touching, funny and disturbing, this feature stars Paddy Considine as the stranger, with wonderful performances by the two young leads Andrew Shim and Ben Marshall. Bob Hoskins makes an appearance as a visiting teacher. Soundtrack features music by Beck, Beth Orton and Billy Bragg."
