Initially set in the 1960s in a small Victorian country town, a teenage boy returns home from boarding school to his father, the town doctor, and his best friend Silvy. On the night of the town dance Sam and Silvy slip away to go for a swim, unfortunately with dire consequences. Twenty years later Sam (Guy Pearce), now a psychologist, returns to fulfil his father's final wish to be buried in Genoa. He meets a strange woman called Ruby (Helena Bonham-Carter) on the train and she proves to be a link for Sam back to his Silvy and his lost emotions. Written and directed by Michael Petroni in his feature film debut with original music composed by Dale Cornelius. Cast includes Frank Gallacher, Lindley Joyner, Brooke Harman."
