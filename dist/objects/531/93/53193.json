        "Episode of Series \"American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection\". From the American Film Theatre series of the 1970s comes the adaptation of the Bertolt Brecht play \"Galileo\". Adapted for the screen by Barbara Bray and Joseph Losey from the English version by Charles Laughton. An all star cast tell the tale of 1600's astronomer and scientist Galileo (Topol), his struggle with authorities and being ostracised - something which writer Brecht could identify having left Hollywood in 1947 to avoid having to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Galileo comes up with the notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun - and desires astronomy become the much talked about subject of his era. He finds out about the telescope presents it as his invention to the Republic of Venice. The Papal astronomer then confirms Galileo's discoveries much to the chagrin of the theologians of the church. So, for eight years he remained silent on his discoveries. Galileo then becomes a prisoner of the Inquisition until his death. Linking the scenes throughout are songs sung by a trio of choir boys and written captions that move the narrative through time to significant events in Galileo's life. Cast includes Tom Conti, John Gielgud, Edward Fox, Colin Blakely, Georgia Brown, Margaret Leighton, Michael Lonsdale, Patrick Magee, John McEnery, Clive Revill."
