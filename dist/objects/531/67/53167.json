        "A fun romp set in 1960s middle-class white America, in a private girls' school that is set to become co-educational. Odette is a new student and finds herself a fish-out-of-water until she embraces her new roommates and friends learning of the girls' secret society - the D.A.R. (Daughters of American Ravioli) a reference to the cans of cold pasta they pilfer from the school kitchens via their secret attic dwelling. The girls go about ruining the imposed decision that they merge with the boys at St Ambrose by sabotaging the school dance and becoming politically active, much to the pleasure of the strict but approachable headmistress (Lynn Redgrave). At Miss Godard's School for Girls this coming-of-age tale is full of sass and toe-tapping fun. Written and directed by Sarah Kernochan. Cast includes: Kirsten Dunst, Gaby Hoffman, Rachel Leigh Cook, Vincent Kartheiser, Monica Keena, Heather Matarazzo, and Merritt Wever."
