        "Fifth and final installment of Francois Truffaut's \"Antoine Doinel\" cycle. Largely a series of flashbacks, this episode sees Antoine about to be divorced, and hence, reflective about his life. He is in love with Sabine but is filled with conflict about his responsibilities, in particular, his son, and is introspective the about the past. Aboard a train Antoine meets up with former love, Colette, and although they initially recall the past fondly, she subsequently berates Antoine for his lack of maturity and enduring self-absorption. This bittersweet work was largely derided as a disappointing end to an iconic series, but it maintains the lyricism and comical whimsy that are signatures of Truffauts \"Doinel\" work, whilst also being the most mediative."
