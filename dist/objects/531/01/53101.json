        "Lucia's life and her past merge when she is shocked by the death of her lover, a writer. Seeking answers to his death, she travels to an island idyll where she remembers but also makes new connections to a couple who have a past with her now dead partner. Visually stunning and erotically charged, this film is not just about sex but a search for truth, love and living life to the full. This arresting film by the maker of \"Tierra\" and \"The Red Squirrel\" is edgy, luscious and hot. Cast includes Paz Vega, Tristan Ulloa, Najwa Nimri, Daniel Freire. Warning: contains full frontal nudity and sex scenes. In Spanish with English subtitles."
