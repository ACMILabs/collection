        "Flawed but intriguing documentary from Nick Broomfield, about the deaths of rival African American rappers, Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls. Tupac Shakur was born into an impoverished and fractured family life, but went on to become a hugely successful musician; Biggie Smalls came from less humble beginnings but was similarly successful in his field. Once close friends, these two became bitter rivals in a gang war between rappers and their entourages on the East and West coasts. By interviewing a slew of the pair's contemporaries, including Biggie's mother, Broomfield investigates the possibility that Death Records impresario Suge Knight murdered the two and that the LA police were complicit. Broomfield certainly stumbles where angels fear to tread, including a visit to prison to interview Knight, as well as filming some very agitated characters, presenting an ambivalent but fascinating portrait for the viewer to draw on."
