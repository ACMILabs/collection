        "Trapped within New York's 19th Century high society, a time of lavish excess and social hypocrisy, Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is caught between two women and two worlds - his lovely fiancee May Welland (Winona Ryder) and the world he knows, and the scandalous Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the world he dreams of having. Based on Edith Wharton's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \"The Age of innocence\" is the quintessential story of forbidden love, luminous with passion, temptation, intrigue and sacrifice. Also available on VHS [305955]."
