        "Tackling the themes of chronic illness and relationships this relatively early work from Michael Winterbottom chronicles a young man's path from an affable lucky-in-love bloke, to an irascible invalid. Along the way he tests the patience of his loyal girlfriend as he struggles to come to grips with the disease, his diminished physicality and his place within his working class milieu as man who does not work, and who, at a young age, faces an uncertain future. Wonderful plebeian Scottish brogue by screenplay writers Paul Henry Powell and Jimmy McGovern."
