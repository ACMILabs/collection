        "A remarkable epic about honour, courage and the family spirit, Mulan chronicles the daring adventures of a young Chinese woman whose irrepressible spirit clashes with her tradition-bound society. When her country is forced into war by the invading Hun army, Mulan searches deep within herself, takes her ailing father's conscription notice, and joins the Chinese army in order to save his life. Features the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Lea Salonga, Eddie Murphy, Miguel Ferrer, B.D. Wong and Donny Osmond."
