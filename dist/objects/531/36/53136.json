        "From the director of \"Broken Highway\", \"Dogwatch\" is a thriller set at sea aboard a rusty cargo ship with equally as dubious a crew. Captained by alcoholic and corrupt skipper (Steven Vidler) aka 'The Judas Captain', the doomed ship is to be sunk by Heckle, the first mate (John Brumpton) once the captain has navigated the vessel to deep waters - all paid for by Triad gangsters. The hapless (sometimes farcical) crew and mysteriously cryptic Palmer (Russell Kiefel) make the journey unbearable for the captain. Stopping off to do a bit of gun smuggling in exchange for gold, the crew discover a stench in the hold and as one crew member points out 'The Triad' that organised this cruise won't be expecting anyone to return. Mutiny and murder take over the minds of the crew as each man tries to assert his will and survive the situation in which they find themselves. Written and directed by Laurie McInnes. Cast includes Richard Carter, Joel Edgerton, John Alansu, Yaw Glymin."
