        "A photographic study of plant and animal life in the arid plain which stretches from Oregon to Mexico and from California to Texas. Includes scenes of a death struggle between a hawk and a rattlesnake, an encounter between a bobcat and wild pigs, the pursuit of a kangaroo rat and her babies by a Kingsnake, a contest between two male turtles for the favour of a female, the courtship dance of a pair of scorpions by moonlight, and a time-lapse sequence showing desert wild flowers coming into bloom. Narrated by Winston Hibler."
