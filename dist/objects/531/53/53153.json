        "Animated fantasy adventure about a young high school girl, Haru, who finds herself being rewarded for a good deed carried out as a child. She simply feeds a hungry kitten but when this unique kitten grows, it is decided in the cat kingdom that Haru is special and should be given gifts. Daughter of a single mother, the young girl has the usual teenage angst and wants to impress the handsome boy in her class. Her usual routine is forgotten however as she is transported to the Kingdom of Cats. Haru also unwittingly finds herself engaged to the Prince of Cats! A coming-of-age film with a difference as this is a magical and fantastic adventure suitable for family viewing. From the creators of award winning \"Spirited Away\" [318123] the moving classical soundtrack adds to the enchanting nature of the story."
