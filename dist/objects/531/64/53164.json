        "Two horny rogues on a road trip are out to find the illustrious lover (aka 'womper') from Alaska named Eskimo Nell. Dead Eye Dick (Max Gillies) and Mexico Pete (Serge Lazareff) travel around the Australian goldfields trying to bed women wherever they go. Dead Eye Dick is more talk than action as he has his heart set on finding Nell. Very much the storyteller, Dead Eye's fanciful tales land the two in trouble and they often have to leave town in a hurry. Boobs and bawdiness abound in this 'historical' comedy drama from writers Alan Hopgood and Richard Franklin - also produced and directed by Franklin. Music by Brian May. Cast includes Abigail, Grahame Bond, Kris McQuade, Elli Maclure, Paul Vachon, Anthony Bazell, Ernie Bourne."
