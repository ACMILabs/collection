        "Ecologically themed anime from famed Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki set in a post apocalyptic world whereby the air is poisoned and insects engage humans in fierce battles. Princess Nausicaa, the fearless leader of her imperilled tribe, is sympathetic to the insects that others fear and loathe, and understands that she must treat them with respect in order to achieve peace. Typically outstanding animation underscores a sensitive and earnest screenplay that, unusually for its time, steers away from the distinctive violence of anime and sets the tone for subsequent Ghibli studio works."
