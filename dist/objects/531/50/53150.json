        "Fourth instalment in Francois Truffaut's \"Antoine Doinel\" series depicts the still somewhat immature Antoine facing the birth of his first child, infatuation with a Japanese woman and the petty squabbles of married life. Whilst perhaps not as well realised as \"Stolen kisses\", \"Bed and board\" nevertheless maintains a laconic charm, aided by the redoubtable Truffaut mainstay, Jean-Pierre Leaud."
