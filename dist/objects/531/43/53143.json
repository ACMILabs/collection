        "From the same talented writer (Paul Laverty) and director (Ken Loach) team of \"My name is Joe\" fame, comes a well-made but similarly realistic and despairing film about the harsh life of a fifteen year-old Scottish youth. Liam (Martin Compston) wants a new life for his mother when she gets out of prison and foils plans by her boyfriend to smuggle drugs inside during a visit with he and his grandfather. After a severe beating by the boyfriend and being kicked out of home by his grandfather, Liam takes refuge at his sister Chantelle's house (Annmarie Fulton). Liam and his best mate Pinball (William Ruane) try and raise some cash to buy a caravan for his mother on her release but the boys get involved with drug trafficking and gangsters, resulting in a series of events that are also their undoing. Winner of Best Screenplay Award Cannes Film Festival 2002. A UK/German/Spanish co-production."
