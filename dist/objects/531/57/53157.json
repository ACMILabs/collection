        "Episode of Series \"American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection\". In this searing film adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's play, Robert Ryan stars as Larry, a barfly and self proclaimed philosopher eagerly awaiting death all but for his iron constitution. He and his gang of drunk cronies anticipate the periodical visit of Hickey (Lee Marvin) who usually turns up in a generous mood and with generous purse for the bar owner Harry (Frederic March) and the whole gang. This time, however, he is late in arriving and everyone is on edge and the anticipation of the bender they are about to go on is rousing them out of their alcoholic stupor. Hickey's visit doesn't bring them the fun they were hoping for; he instead challenges them all to forget their hopes and dreams and deal with reality. He is especially hard on Larry but his words affect more deeply the young Don Parritt (Jeff Bridges) whose relationship with his mother is a reality too hard for him to bear."
