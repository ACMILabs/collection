        "Majestic and tragic story of an adolescent boy and his little sister, made homeless by firebombing in Japan at the end of World War II and abandoned by callous relatives. Seita is a wily teenager, with the weight of the world on his shoulders as he seeks to find refuge and food for himself and Setsuko, his four year old sister who longs for their mother. After a disagreement with a distant aunt who briefly takes the pair in, Seita and Setsuko start living in an old shelter by the river. At first life is partially idyllic without adult presence; but soon the realities of homelessness start to take its toll on their health. This evocative and typically exceptional anime from Studio Ghibli, is a moving work and an extraordinary narrative about the Japanese experience of WW2. Disc 2 offers an array of fascinating support material."
