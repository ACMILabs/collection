        "Using the great Australian sporting tradition of Aussie rules as a catalyst to explore gay male sexuality, this sweet, funny take on mateship and fair play on and off the field gives a whole new meaning to the term 'holding the man'. Kicking on ultimately highlights the intimate spaces men create for each other that allow for physical contact and a dogmatic loyalty that in any other name would be called love."
