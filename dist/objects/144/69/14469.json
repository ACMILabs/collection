        "Animated 'fractured fairytale' story about Norbert, with abnormally big ears, and the prejudices he faces from the local townsfolk. Being different, Norbert soon discovers, means a lonely and alienated life. A rather bleak piece laced with moments of off-beat black humour. Narrated by V J Shanmugam. Graduate work from an AIM (Centre for Animation and Interactive Media) RMIT graduate, 2006."
