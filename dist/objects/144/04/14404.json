    "description": [
        "Co-op is the collective efforts of 8 students doing Honours in Multimedia Design at Swinburne. Structured in a  similar way to the game 'Exquisite Corpse', each participant was given a single frame and a section of audio then asked to create a sequence of animation based on these - the idea was to create something that would seamlessly blend with clips created by 2 other students, without having seen any of their animations. The resultant works explore themes of cooperation and competition -      Part 1:  Education (James Cook)      Part 2:  Fisticuffs (Will Barry)      Part 3:  Floating (Onur Aksoy)      Part 4:  Paper comet (Andrew Di Pietrantonio)      Part 5:  Splurge (Cedric Austria)      Part 6:  Compete with us (Jon Gorman)      Part 7:  The Awakening of a psychopath (Matt Alpass)      Part 8:  Terrorblade (Wilfred Patriarca) Visit www.the-co-op.net to find out more."
