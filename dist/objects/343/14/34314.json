        "Provides an insight into what it's like to be young and black in Australia by introducing two rock bands \"No Fixed Address\" and \"Us Mob\" and following them through two days on the road. The film is punctuated by run-ins between the young musicians and white authority. \"Wrong side of the road\" shows a courageous minority standing up to a racist society, the close relationship within the black community and the respect given to women within this community."
