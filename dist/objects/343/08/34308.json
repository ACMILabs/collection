        "Looks at the Tan-Zam Railway (known locally as the Freedom Railway) which the Chinese have helped to build in Africa. 14,000 Chinese, working day and night with 40,000 Africans, have pushed this railway 1,900 kilometres from Dar es Salaam on the Indian Ocean to Kapiri Mposhi in the heart of Africa. The film conveys how the Chinese and Africans live, in their work camps, and the relationship which has developed between peoples of such different cultures."
