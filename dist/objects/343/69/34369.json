        "In 1958 the Chinese people of ShaoShan in Hunan Province, built a reservoir on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River for the irrigation of the fields. It was eventually abandoned through fear of the counter-revolution until 1965 when it was resurrected again to prevent droughts and/or floods over 2500 square kilometers. This film documents the rebuilding of the irrigation canals under the guidance of Chairman Mao and the manual labour of the Chinese peasants. ShaoShan is the birthplace of Chairman Mao."
