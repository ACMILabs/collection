        "Dennis O'Rourke's brilliant study of Papua New Guinea's independence celebrations does not belong to the tradition in which an all-knowing, anonymously honeyed voice lulls us with loaded instructions for interpreting a world which it empties of interest. Skilful and humorous editing of the vividly beautiful images and the superb soundtrack of voices, music and radio broadcasts brings out a sense of wonder at a society composed of extraordinary juxtapositions. It is not just that traditional tribal customs co-exist with both the paraphernalia of British and Australian colonialism and the new institutions for independence. Each element actively transforms the others and gives them new meaning. Contains footage of Gough Whitlam, Prince Charles and other dignitaries, as well as the handover ceremonies signifying Papua New Guinea independence. Contains interviews with Papua New Guinea's first Prime Minister."
