        "Episode of Series \"Human Face of China\". Shanghai in 1979, with its 11 million people, and the second biggest city in the world, was for years dominated by foreign powers. Following the end of the revolution in the early 1970s, China is now caught up in the urgency to accelerate progress and this is expressed by a massive campaign to make everyone personally committed to the aim of the 4 modernisations: to catch up with the west in science, education, agriculture and defence by the year 2000."
