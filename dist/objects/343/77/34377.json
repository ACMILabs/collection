        "Documentary film about Ch'u Fou, Shantung Province, the birthplace of K'ung-Fu-Tze (Confucius, 551-478 B.C.). Examples of the architecture, art and sculpture of this period are shown including the Chinese Classroom, built many centuries later in dedication to the memory of Confucius and his democratic ideal of a classless education. Temples, stone carvings and ancient Chinese culture are luxuriously presented in this historically informative film. English language, Chinese title and credits."
