        "Episode of Series \"World in action\". Brindle House in Cheshire treats people with acute psychiatric problems in an informal atmosphere, as out-patients. The staff believe that by being more accessible they are able to intervene before patients reach a critical stage. They also believe that the process of recovery is aided if the patient can remain within the community among family and friends."
