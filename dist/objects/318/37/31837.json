        "An exciting view of the Arctic Winter Games held in Schefferville, northern Quebec, in 1976. The events range from table-tennis to curling, and include six indigenous Arctic sports. The games spanned seven days of hard competition, as well as a week of sharing common northern experiences and good will. And, despite temperatures of -30C, the participants' enthusiasm created an atmosphere of great warmth, which we witness as the losers congratulate the winners, and the winners apologise."
