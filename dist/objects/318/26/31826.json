        "Episode of Series \"The wonderful world of Paddington Bear\". Paddington and the Old Master is adapted from Chapters 4, 5 and 8 of \"A Bear called Paddington\" by Michael Bond. Paddington learns from Mr Gruber, an antique dealer, that old masterpieces are sometimes covered by newer paintings and that the \"old master\" can be restored. Paddington decides to apply this technique to one of Mr Brown's paintings with disastrous results. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
