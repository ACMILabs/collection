        "Fogo is a windswept island off the coast of Newfoundland where the inhabitants have lived by, on and from the sea. A fisherman and his sons take a day off from the nets for a journey to the gannet colony on the Funk Islands, fifty miles farther out to sea. There are exceptional close-up views of enormous flocks of seabirds swarming the cliffs and the sky."
