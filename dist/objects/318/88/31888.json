        "Episode of Series \"The Nature of things\". Through the modern-day magic of micro-photography, viewers are led deep into the mysterious folds of the world's oldest known eco-system - the coral reef. Here, cameras study how a coral reef is formed and perpetuated by a complex system of recycling that makes use of all available energy and materials. But more then that they find fantasy in a biological wonderland. Narrated by William Whitehead."
