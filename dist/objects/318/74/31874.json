        "Hawick, in Scotland, has been the centre of a thriving knitting trade for over 200 years. Shows the raw material of the industry, obtained from the Kashmir goat in the mountains beyond the Himalayas, transformed into the finished product. Highly skilled workers are seen making the articles for which the industry is justly famous. Historic Edinburgh provides the setting for a display of fashionable sweater designs."
