        "Episode of Series \"West\". That is the resolve of Agri-Pool, seven farm families in Lestock, Saskatchewan, who have pooled their resources so that rising operating costs will not drive them off their land. By pooling their land, their equipment, their livestock, and farming as a cooperative, they are able to live as they choose, to maintain their standard of living, and even to have some spare time left over to enjoy. This is an engaging look at a novel approach to big-scale farming."
