        "Aimed at the 8-12 year-olds, this film takes children down to the ashtray world of Bill and Betty, the cigarettes, then into their own world of running, dancing and surfing where, for the smoker, everything is just that little bit more difficult. Smoking slows reflexes, induces breathlessness and coughing. Voices by Ernie Bourne and Beverly Dunn and animation by Dennis Tupicoff."
