        "Uses the recollection of octogenarian Robert Cushman Murphy to provide a historical view of whaling and to present a plea for the preservation of the whale. The more recent footage shows the sophistication of modern whaling techniques and notes the years 1960-1970 represented the greatest decade of over whaling in terms of numbers killed. Narrated by Jack Palance. Suitable for upper primary and secondary levels."
