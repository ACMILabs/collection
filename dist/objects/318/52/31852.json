        "Against a backdrop of charming paintings and the Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, landscape they reflect, Maud Lewis: A World Without Shadows celebrates the life and work of one of Canada's foremost primitive painters. Emerging from her youth crippled with arthritis, Maud Lewis escaped into her painting at the age of thirty. She had never seen a work of art and had never attended an art class but her paintings captured the simple strength, beauty and happiness of the world she saw - a world without shadows."
