        "The neglected exterior quality of Inner City is an environmental sculpture which takes us to the veiled border between illusion and reality. Michael McMillen began building Inner City in 1975, finishing it in Nov 1977 for the opening of his one-man exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art."
