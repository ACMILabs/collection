        "At a children's party a contest is held to see who can make the most interesting sandwich. The popularity of peanut butter leads to an inquiry into food processing, its mechanics and economics. The filmmaker poses questions to the children about the origin of food, especially peanut butter, filling in the historical, geographic, cultural and other factors."
