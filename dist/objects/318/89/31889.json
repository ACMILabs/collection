        "In this acclaimed Capra extravaganza, warning against the threat of fascism, Gary Cooper portrays a naive street tramp who becomes the unwitting tool of corrupt politicians. Journalist, Ann Mitchell (Barbara Stanwyck) conveys the story of John Doe, who then becomes the voice of the people and the champion of decency and fair play. Doe threatens suicide as the ultimate protest against corruption; and thousands of good citizens rally to prevent his death. Director Frank Capra weaves touching comedy into this powerful screen masterpiece. Also stars Edward Arnold and Walter Brennan."
