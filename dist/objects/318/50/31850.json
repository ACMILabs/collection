        "Examines small ivory sculptures created by anonymous masters from 700-1200 A.D. Much of their work decorates devotional objects such as croziers, crosses and caskets and their themes are mainly religious. Includes carvings from collections in Brunswick, Brussels, Copenhagen, Munich, Paris and New York besides a number from the Victoria and Albert and other museums in Britain. Describes these art objects in their historical and artistic context. Narrated by Sir Kenneth Clark."
