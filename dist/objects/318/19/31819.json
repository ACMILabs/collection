        "Introduced by Geoffrey Edge, this film is concerned with the process of urban renewal and the problem it poses. It focuses upon one of a series of schemes which have been carried out in Chicago's South Side since the Second World War. The scheme, in the South Commons area, attempts to achieve a mix of black and white residents and a wide range of income groups."
