        "Tells the story of the fight waged against a plague of phasmatids, a destructive stick insect, which unchecked would have killed large areas of forest, leading to erosion in the catchment and reduced supply water for the hydro-electric power stations. Shows the planning of remedial action climaxing in an aerial attack by spraying from a helicopter."
