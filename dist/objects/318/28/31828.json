    "description": [
        "An account of the Vietnam War as seen through the camera of the late Australian war correspondent, Neil Davis. David Bradbury's multi-award winning documentary also examines the ethical issues facing a man in the frontline who is not an active combatant. Vietnam was a television war, a war said to have been lost in the lounge rooms of middle America, and not on the battlefield. This film explores the conflict, and Davis' involvement in it, combining his original footage, comments and archival film. It includes the famous, historic footage of the fall of Saigon, which Davis was the only Western journalist to film."
