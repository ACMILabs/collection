        "Outlines the destruction done to the New Zealand Kauri forests at the end of the century. The forests were plundered for the wood, the highly profitable resinous gum and the land. Due to careful replanting programs and selective tree felling, the forests are now slowly increasing and there are strong hopes of a future for the giant Kauri tree."
