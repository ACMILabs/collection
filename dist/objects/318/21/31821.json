        "An entertaining film on a favourite British sport, featuring the skills of such famous golfers as Bobby Locke and John Beharrel, and the play of other famous personalities such as Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and Australia's Herb Elliott. Gives some clear and sound illustrations of correct stance, grip and approach, and makes the point that golf is a useful \"second string\" game for all types of sports people."
