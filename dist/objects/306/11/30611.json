        "This film shows the rounding up of sheep, droving, shearing, hand carding, spinning and weaving by a variety of people, dyeing, design and the finished products. With virtually no commentary, the film relies on excerpts from lectures on spinning and weaving, design, tapestry etc. to make its points. Scenes of New Zealand are interspersed throughout."
