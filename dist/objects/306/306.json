        "World #37...previsited is a 3D computer animation (created on 3D Studio 4) of a futuristic city run by warring armed robotic soldiers. The film initially navigates the viewer through the city absent of people to focus on the only visible inhabitants being the robotic soldiers who begin to march to war. The 3D Cafe (Platinum Pictures) made the original models for the mountains, trees, the colossal statue, dragon gargoyles and robot's skirts and boots."
