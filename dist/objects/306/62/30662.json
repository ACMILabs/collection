        "The work of the United Nations World Health Organization in the battle against disease. Tuberculosis was the cause of many deaths in Istanbul, but the government lacked the resources to attack the problem. The World Heath Organization assisted the government to set up a model demonstration and training centre for the fight against the disease. In Israel the WHO is helping to control the spread of rabies. In the desert area around the United States Mexican border an epidemic of rabies broke out, meaning cattle as well as people. With help and advice from the WHO, experienced hunters and trappers were sent out to trap the rabid animals."
