        "Man's inevitable and invaluable associate, the soil, is shown in a new light, a veritable thriving community in miniature, populated by living things of the animal, plant and insect worlds, some draining the soil of its usefulness, others contributing to its productivity. How this soil world maintains a harmonious balance is shown in highly magnified sequences employing time-lapse photography and photomicrography. The film deals extensively with soil substance, analysing different types of soil structure and their resistance to varying natural conditions. Suggestions are made as to how man can make his own contributions to the good of the earth."
