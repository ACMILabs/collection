        "Springtime in Kew Gardens, London, finds daffodiels, bluebells, and cherry blossom in full flower; in the hothouses, exotic plants from the tropics, the Andes and the Himalayas are in bloom. In these beautiful surroundings Londoners find relaxation for themselves and an ideal playground for their children. In the herbarium, an important part of Kew Gardens, research into ways of controlling plant pests and plant diseases goes on year by year, while in another section, botanists classify and study specimens of rare plants sent to Kew for identification from all over the world."
