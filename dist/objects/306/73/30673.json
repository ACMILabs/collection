        "About the manufacture, care and uses of textile fibres. Looks at the four main fibres - animal (wool), vegetable (cotton), chemical (nylon), and raw vegetable material (rayon). Examines the most commonly used fibres - the natural animal and vegetable fibres and those made chemically like nylon and terylene. Shows how an understanding of their natures helps in following the simple but necessary rules for avoiding trouble when washing, especially with the newer synthetics. Script, Sarah Erulkar; editor, Nicholas Gurney; music, Edward Williams; animation director, Henry Stringer."
