        "Water is the most effective agent of erosion. Its action is analysed. The formation of alluvial fans, meanders, potholes, waterfalls, cliffs, ledges, pillars, dikes, arroyos, desert and, and the upwards movements of the earth's surface are studied in relation to running water. Models and scenes from all parts of the world show how running water wears away the land."
