        "The film dramatises how two persons who are concerned with the same values may differ quite fundamentally in their understanding of them. The film considers freedom as related to security and to change, to morality and to obedience. The immediate incident on which the structure of this film rests is simple: a father's visit to his son at College. However, the emotions which motivate the visit are complex, emotions which have been dormant and which burst into action when the father discovers that his son has been participating in campus demonstrations."
