        "How the analytical techniques of Work Study can be used to improve operations carried out by more than one person. Emphasises the need for good communications and for having the men concerned take part in groups discussions where criticism and suggestions can be fully voiced. Shows the original conditions in a galvanising shop, the identification of improvement needed and how they were adopted co-operatively. Touches on problems of redundancy."
