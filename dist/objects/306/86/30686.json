        "How wide strategic movements on land and sea gave World War I a scope unknown in previous wars, and how the war affected entire populations and utilized new, mechanized weapons. Identifies the Allies and Central Powers and reviews their relative advantages in war potential. Discusses the German master strategy and its failure, the major campaigns of the middle years, 1915-1918, and the final phases of the war."
