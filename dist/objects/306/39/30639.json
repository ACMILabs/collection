        "An analysis of press cropping of mild steel bars is designed to help work study lecturers; each operation requiring special work skills and techniques. The first part is a complete record of the original method filmed as it would be see by a work study engineer. The film would then be stopped for students to carry out their studies before seeing the improved methods actually installed by the firms."
