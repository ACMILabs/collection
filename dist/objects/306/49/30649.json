        "The story of co-operative farming in Sweden. In the 1930s farmers faced the threat of eviction from the land - only with difficulty could they sell the products from their soil. Today, through voluntary co-operatives, modern farming methods have been adopted bringing greater efficiency and prosperity to the industry. Illustrates co-operatives at work in the dairy, meat what, timber and poultry industries and in providing finance or home building, community centres, libraries and study circles."
