        "A lively, exciting experience of art, from the words and paintings of David Milne. \"Art\", he said, \"isn't a fire in the grass; it's an explosion.\" Milne's letters read as a commentary, tell how he felt about what he painted, how he tried to catch the essence of his feelings \"before the power ran out...like escaping steam\". We see many of his paintings and a sequence in which we observe the development of his own unique style."
