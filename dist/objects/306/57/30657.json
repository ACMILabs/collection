        "Episode of Series \"The World around us\". The New Forest stands at the crossroads. For 900 years it has remained relatively unspoiled, providing a refuge for shyer animals such as badgers, deer and foxes. But the combined pressures of thousands of visitors keen to \"get back to nature\" plus the harvesting of trees are threatening the forest's very existence."
