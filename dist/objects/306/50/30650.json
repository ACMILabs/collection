        "Dramatises a case history of labor-management co-operation in an American industrial plant. In 1937 unionisation was introduced in an atmosphere of bitterness and hostility on both sides. Today, workers and management have learned from experience that working together pays. The film defines tensions and difficulties between the company \"local\" and management, explaining the grievances of both. Points out that thoughtful men on both sides can work for and gradually obtain mutual understanding."
