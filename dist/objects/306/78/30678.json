        "A dry but carefully measured historical account of marijuana use around the world. From its use in the Chinese Imperial court and as a ritual aid to Hindi mysticism in India, pharmacological properties of hemp have been recognised and exploited over succeeding epochs. Although the film is too broad in its scope to dwell at length on this subject, the film does present an intriguing analysis of more recent attempts at prohibition, which parallel the rise of industrial capitalism and advances in state regulation of civilian behavioural norms."
