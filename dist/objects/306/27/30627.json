        "Mass production is basic to the standard of living in the United States but labour, money and management must be brought together before goods can be produced in quantity. The film goes on to explain how businesses are able to expand and raise capital by listing their securities on the Stock Exchange; the measures adopted to safeguard buyers and sellers of a company's securities before listing on the Stock Exchange; how transactions are made on the Stock Exchange and how the investor is paid for the sale of their securities. Includes footage of the Stock Exchange."
