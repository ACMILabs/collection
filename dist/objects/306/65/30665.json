        "A documentary using footage from around the world, shot over a 30 year period. It shows that the world's potential food resources are sufficient to supply the world population with an adequate diet. Anarchy in production and distribution, outdated and wasteful agricultural methods, black marketing and food speculation in food are causing famine in many countries, while in others \"surplus\" food is stored unused or burned. Illustrates how, given a sane economic system, food distribution and production could be geared to the actual needs of the entire world population."
