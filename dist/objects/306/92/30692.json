        "Compares and contrasts three major phyla of worms: flatworms, roundworms and segmented worms. The approach to flatworms is experimental: worms are cut, demonstrating regeneration, and are subjected to light, demonstrating tropism. The approach to roundworms emphasises parasitism, and for the annelids the evolutionary advances of segmentation are stressed."
