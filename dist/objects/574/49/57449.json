        "An animated production that presents a segment on each letter of the alphabet. A magician introduces a rapid succession of words beginning with the particular letter. Despite the fact that the words used are phonetically quite complex, the overall rich choice of language could be a useful tool for language development. Note that the writing technique demonstrated for each letter is not that used for Victoria."
