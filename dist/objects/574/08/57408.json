        "Ilustrates a method of teaching keyboard skills to primary school children in an integrated language program. A child centered approach where pupils develop written language to use as keyboard drills instead of using set typing tests. The program describes the use of master work sheets and emphasises ergonomics and computer environments. Keyboard skills are seen as essential computer skills for extensive word processing."
