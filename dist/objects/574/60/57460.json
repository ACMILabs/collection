        "This program is in three sections. 1. \"Convict bolters\", 2. \"Wild colonial boys\", 3. \"The Kelly gang\" and focuses on the question \"Why have we glamorised bushrangers? Uses extracts from early Australian feature films which recreate the incidents of the era 1790-1880. The bushrangers are shown as outlaws who inflicted terror and destruction on the public. This program is an edited version of \"Australian bushrangers. Yrs. 7-10\""
