        "The story of the integration into life's normal activities of a Down's syndrome child as related by his mother. The acceptance of the child into the school community is effectively portrayed enabling the program to be utilised by a school contemplating the integration of disabled students. A positive program that supports the belief that the whole community benefits from the integration of disabled people into society."
