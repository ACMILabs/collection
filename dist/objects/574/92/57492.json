        "Part 1. \"Listen to us\": \"Linguistic and Cultural Diversity\". Britain now has a multi-ethnic and multicultural society which is also multilingual. This program acknowledges that diversity in order to benefit pupils. Part 4. \"The Way We Speak\": \"Considering Dialect and Learning\". Considers whether schools should permit and teach dialects of the English language. In both of these programs we see activities which may help to develop and reinforce language, showing teachers using the activities in actual classrooms.
