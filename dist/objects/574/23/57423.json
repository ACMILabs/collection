        "Shows the process of landholders realising that the problems of salinity and erosion need to be tackled in groups rather than as individuals. Illustrates the establishment of the Warrenbayne Boho Land Protection Group. Shows the group working with Agriculture Extension Officers and Soil Conservation personnel, owning their involvement and taking responsibility for their actions. Useful as a model for people planning to establish community action groups."
