        "Looks in detail at two eras of Australian bushranging. Uses extracts from feature films which recreate the incidents in the era 1790-1880 to focus on the question \"Why have we glamorised bushrangers?\" Part 1. \"The Convict bolters\" Bushranging in Australia started in the convict era. Convicts who broke out were known as bolters. The program focuses on the reasons the convicts bolted and gives information about some of the bolters. Part 2. \"The Wild colonial boys\" With the end of transportation bushranging moved into a new era. Bushrangers became associated with daring, bravado, defiance of authority and chivalry. Gives names and details of several of the \"new\" bushrangers. Overall the bushrangers are shown as thieves and murderers who inflict terror and destruction on the public. Companion volume to \"Australian bushrangers. Part 3\""
