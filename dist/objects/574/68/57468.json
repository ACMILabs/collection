        "A young boy is integrated into a primary school in the Dandenongs. He suffers from chronic tuberous sclerosis and his disabilities include lack of speech and motor dysfuntion of the hands. This video reflects the change in his mother's attitude as he progresses in his school life. Indicates how integration can be a most positive achievement for all those concerned given a sympathetic and helpful environment."
