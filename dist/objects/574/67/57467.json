        "A combination of animation and live-action which celebrates the creative process. A stylised exercise using black and white photographs to represent reality and coloured overlays representing flights of fantasy. The artist learns by trial and error to take possession of his creative energy. Useful in the areas of art, media studies and as a stimulus to discussion in English classes."
