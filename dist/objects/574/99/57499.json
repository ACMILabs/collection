        "This video presents black and white propaganda footage from WW1 and WW2. Part 1 presents excerpts from World War I propaganda in Germany and Australia. Shows early animation/political cartoons by Harry Julius and an excerpt from a Charlie Chaplin film \"The Liberty Bond\". Part 2 presents excerpts from World War II propaganda in Australia, Germany and Britain. Includes excerpts by directors Leni Riefenstahl, Humphrey Jennings, Harry Watt and Karl Ritter. The success of cinema propaganda was well established by World War Two. In Germany, Goebbel's Ministry for National Enlightenment and Propaganda, Britain had its Ministry of Information, in the USA film propaganda was only one part of the total propaganda picture and in Australia we had the Commonwealth Dept. of Information which was responsible for official propaganda and news items."
