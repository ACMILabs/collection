        "Western Australia had 5% forest cover at settlement. In 150 years that has been reduced to just 1%. \"Last Stand\" is a critical examination of south Western Australia's natural forest reserves and present forest practices which threatens the remaining ancient Karri Forests. It sounds a timely warning that whole areas af Australia's wilderness will be lost to future generations if short term commercial gain is the sole criteria for their management."
