        "In the security of the family the foundations are laid for the child to take steps toward independence. At preschool the five-year-old has the opportunity to develop in a larger social group, building on and practising all those skills necessary for later learning. This video shows the conditions within the family, the preschool and the school which contribute towards a good attitude to learning."
