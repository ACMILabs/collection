        "Recent changes in the ozone layer have refocused attention on the importance of the atmosphere to life on our planet. Pictures from space show the swirling wisps and bands in the mass of air surrounding the Earth. Convection cells, the Coriolis Effect, the structure and composition of the atmosphere, and the invisible forces that keep the atmosphere in continuous motion are illustrated through demonstrations, laboratory experiments and animation. A well presented introduction to the atmosphere which is ideal for background information on the Greenhouse effect."
