        "This Disney adaptation of the classic 17th century French novel by Alexandre Dumas features Chris O'Donnell in the lead role of the swashbuckling hero D'Artagnan, a musketeer in the King's guards in Paris. When D'Artagnan discovers that the scheming Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) is plotting to oust the King from his throne, he joins up with three other musketeers - Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen) - to protect King and country and thwart the unscrupulous Cardinal's plans. Also stars Rebeccca De Mornay as Milady de Winter. Beautiful cinematography by Dean Semler and lavish costuming and set design."
