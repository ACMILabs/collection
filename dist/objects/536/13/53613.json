        "Addressing the issue of whether women belong on the battlefield, Ridley Scott's \"G. I. Jane\" stars a seriously buffed Demi Moore in the title role as an ambitious Lieutenant, keen to make it as a navy SEAL. Pitted against a ruthless commander (a pre-\"Lord of the Rings\" Viggo Mortensen) Jordan's quest is damned by the corrupt presence of a female Senator, who must stage-manage the recruit's failure for political gain. A fantastic premise is at times left aside for detailing of military training sequences that involve your standard \"spit in your face and kick you when you are down\" routines. Cast also includes Anne Bancroft, Jason Beghe."
