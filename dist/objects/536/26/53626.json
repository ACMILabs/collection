        "A love story involving a young Indian girl, Iola, with a white prospector, Harper, who rescuses Iola from the hands of two cut-throats. Iola soon discovers that Harper already has a sweetheart who is on her way to visit him and that she, Iola, must return to her tribe. A melodrama with an equally melodramatic ending. Cast includes Mary Pickford, Alfred Paget, Frank Evans, Dorothy Bernard."
