        "Charles Chauvel's first feature tells the story of a country girl, Dell Ferris (the Moth of Moonbi), drawn to the bright lights of the big city where her inheritance is soon frittered away with high society revelling. A wiser Dell returns to Moonbi Station where she is beset by the cattle rustler Jack Bronson, but finally finds peace and happiness with the faithful head stockman, Tom. Cast includes Darla Townend, Colleen Richards, Charles O'Mara, Marsden T. Hassell, Doris Ashwin, Arthur Tauchert."
