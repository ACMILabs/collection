        "Based on the Raymond Carver short story \"So much water so close to home\", this is a compelling drama about a marriage drawn asunder by a young girl's murder. Stewart Kane, played by Irish actor Gabrielle Byrne, goes fishing with friends to a remote spot; when he and his friends find a young girl's mutilated body they continue with their trip, reporting the crime upon their return. Such callousness makes Claire (Laura Linney) question her marriage and her husband's humanity and she is drawn into a web of intrigue and ethical dilemmas. Expanding upon Carver's original text, Lawrence examines Aboriginal rites and ceremonies and places, central to the narrative, the uncomfortable relationship between the black and white communities."
