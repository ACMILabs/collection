        "Sky trackers is a television series about children, parents and the universe, which combines lively action, strong emotion, high adventure and the cutting edge of science. \"Sky trackers: Family and self\" includes three stories dealing with human relationships; \"Letting go\" Mike and his dad are forced to revisit the death of their mother/wife several years ago. \"Rocket to me\" Nikki and Mike's complaints about parental demands are dwarfed by the discovery that a friend is subjected to physical and psychological violence. \"Origins\" Cleo discovers she is adopted and resents her \"parents\" who have hidden the facts from her. This curriculum package comes with a guide book and is designed for use by teachers of upper primary and junior secondary school (years 5-8)."
