        "Action thriller set on the island of Alcatraz where 81 tourist hostages are being held by a somewhat unstable Marine Corps general called Francis X. Hummel (Ed Harris). The ransom is $100 million for war reparations to the families of servicemen killed in covert operations and if this is not paid then Hummel and his men will bomb San Francisco with deadly gas. Enter FBI chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) and former British spy Jack Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) whose assignment is to penetrate Alcatraz and stop Hummel at all cost. Fast-paced and frenetic."
