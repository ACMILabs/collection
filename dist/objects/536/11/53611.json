        "This psychological thriller is about an anthropologist, Ethan Powell, who leaves human society to live among gorillas. Fully ensconced in this animal world, Powell is extradited back to the United States after murdering two gorilla poachers. Once there, it falls to an ambitious psychiatrist to discover the non-communicative Powell's secrets. With in-form performances by Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr, this film attempts with profundity to address human nature, harmony with the natural world, and what motivates passions bordering on insanity. Cast also includes Donald Sutherland."
