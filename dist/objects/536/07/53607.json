        "Based on the novel by Dodie Smith, and a sequel to Disney's 1996 live-action adaptation of their animated classic, '101 Dalmatians', this live-action film once again features Glenn Close in the role of the over-the-top and rather bizarre Cruella De Vil. After three years in prison Cruella is determined to keep away from animal fur - especially of the doggy kind - but it seems despite all her best intentions, Cruella unwittingly finds herself again embroiled in a 'haute couture' situation. Cast includes Ioan Gruffudd, Alice Evans, Tim McInnerny, Ian Richardson, Gerard Depardieu."
