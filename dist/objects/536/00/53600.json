        "In this action thriller from director Tony Scott, Will Smith plays Robert Clayton Dean, an innocent everyman who gets caught up in espionage, murder and government corruption. When Robert is handed a tape with damning evidence, he discovers there is no hiding from the insidious technology that tracks his every move. Robert seeks the aid of former covert operative Brill - Gene Hackman in a role that references his iconic Harry Caul from key 1970s paranoid thriller \"The Conversation\". Cast also includes Jon Voight, Gabriel Byrne, Jason Robards."
