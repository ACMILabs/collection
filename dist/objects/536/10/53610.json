        "When a baby is born at ten weeks gestation, he ends up a child living in a man's body. Kept at home by his parents, Jack is finally forced to enrol in the fourth grade but his physical appearance (as a forty year old man) is the cause of much derision. Confused, and upset, Jack seeks the company of older women whilst being mentored by a caring teacher. A comedy that seeks to convey the multitudinous talents of Robin Williams, \"Jack\" works must less effectively than its obvious influence \"Big\" (1988, Penny Marshall), but still succeeds as an intermittently charming comedy about family, childhood and self-acceptance. Cast also includes Diane Lane, Jennifer Lopez, Brian Kerwin, Bill Cosby. Allan Rich."
