        "This remake of the classic 1936 screwball comedy, stars June Allyson in the key role of the kooky heiress who falls for her butler. David Niven plays the apparently impoverished butler, employed by a wealthy, if decidedly eccentric family. Once immersed in their employ, Godfrey's presence causes endless turmoil, firstly when Irene falls hopelessly in love with him, and secondly when her jealous sister tries to frame him for theft. Set in Depression-era America, this is a delightfully light-hearted comedy that also comments on the importance of compassion. Based on the novel by Eric Hatch."
