        "This melodrama, set during and after the Civil War, is something of a sketch for 'Birth of a Nation'. Against Griffith's wishes it was released serially in two parts. In the first part, a faithful black servant, played by a white actor in black face, rescues his master's child from the burning house. Her father has died fighting for the South. In the second part the old servant after using all his savings, is tempted to steal to pay for the young woman's education. Cast includes Wilfred Lucas, Claire McDowell, Mack Sennett, Del Henderson, Gladys Egan."
