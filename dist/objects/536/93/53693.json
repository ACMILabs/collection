        "Sarah Watt's feature film \"Look both ways\" is a highly unusual but most engaging narrative about death, grief and foreboding. Meryl (Justine Clarke), a talented artist who paints greeting cards for a living, she sees death and disaster everywhere she looks. These dire visions are amusingly presented in animated visions of her art work. When Meryl meets Nick there is the hope of romance; but Nick's is saddled with his own bad news. Around these two, numerous characters swirl with an array of crisis' to conquer."
