        "Entertaining light-hearted comedy about three bachelors living in a New York apartment whose lives are suddenly and dramatically changed when a baby is left on their doorstep. The three are somewhat challenged in their new role of parenthood and it is the interaction between them that provides most of the humour. Stars Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson in the lead roles with Nancy Travis, Margaret Colin and Celeste Holm."
