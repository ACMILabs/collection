        "Samuel 'Rocky' Douglas Jnr (Michael Treanor), and his brothers Jeffrey 'Colt' (Max Elliott Slade) and Michael 'Tum Tum' (Chad Power) have been trained in the art of Ninja by their wise old grandfather (Victor Wong). Their testing time comes when confronted by bad guy Hugo Snyder (Rand Kingsley), once a former pupil of their grandfather's but now on the run from the boys' FBI agent dad for arms dealing. Reminiscent of 'The Karate Kid' but not in the same league."
