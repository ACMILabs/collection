        "Family and marriage are put under threat when Alice's (Meg Ryan) drinking becomes an addiction. Husband Michael (Andy Garcia), an airline pilot, is a perfectionist and finds it increasingly difficult to control his often reckless and neglectful wife. It takes an accident before Alice realises she has hit rock bottom and needs help. After attending a rehab clinic Alice finally returns home stronger, more independent and alcohol free but Michael, on the other hand, has problems adjusting to the new Alice. He prefers the needy and dependent wife. As the marriage begins to break down, Michael and Alice take the long and difficult road to recovery through counselling. Cast also includes Lauren Tom, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tina Majorino, Mae Whitman, Ellen Burstyn."
