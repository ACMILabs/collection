        "A picture of life in the colony of Sarawak, youngest of the British protectorates and the home of the head-hunting Dyaks. With the discovery and production of oil, much industrial progress has been made - progress which often contrasts sharply with the ancient crafts. The film shows the living conditions, the production of sago by old and new methods, the growing of pepper, and the immensely important oil industry."
