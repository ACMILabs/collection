With the assistance of his twin sons, Eli discovers he must fight for control of the town's future against the town's corrupt mayor. With Jim Dale playing the three main roles this is essentially a family oriented adventure film set in the old Wild West, replete with gunslingers and outlaws. Cast also includes Karen Valentine, Don Knotts, Jack Elam and John Williams."
