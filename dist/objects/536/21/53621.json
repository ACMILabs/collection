        "The script was based on original transcripts of the trial of Jeanne d'Arc, period detail was carefully researched, unusually solid sets were constructed and a monumental performance given by Falconetti as Jeanne. However, it is the films formal rigour which places it in the forefront of experimental film art. Cast includes Renee Falconetti, Antonin Artaud, Michel Simon."
