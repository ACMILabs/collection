        "This local documentary focuses on a group of elderly men and women who have embraced canoeing. Most train and belong to the suburban Fairfield Canoe Club where they thoroughly enjoy the recreation as well as the social aspect of the sport. Interviews reveal that the elderly members enjoy the physical benefits and challenges of competing, the camaraderie, and the chance to offer young people guidance."
