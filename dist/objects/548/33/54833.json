        "This film shows that there have traditionally been two labour markets in Britain based on the concepts of \"mens\" work and \"women's work\". Traces the history of women workers in the twentieth century with emphasis on the roles they played during the two world wars. These national emergencies shaped the change in attitudes regarding women and work, and during those conflicts, \"a woman's place\" was no longer just in the home."
