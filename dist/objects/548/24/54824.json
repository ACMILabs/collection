        "A marionette show set on the mythical Isle of Dragonia. Princess Moonglow has to choose a dragon to ride in the grand parade. Star is a beautiful but lazy and conceited dragon and his brother Spot is modest and punctual, but quite ordinary in appearance. She must select the first one she sees at sunrise. Encourages ideas about promptness, reliability and modesty. Suitable for middle primary level."
