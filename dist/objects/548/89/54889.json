        "Episode of Series \"Short story showcase\". In Dostoyevsky's unfinished story \"The Crocodile\", the genteel life of a Russian middle-class social circle is disrupted in an unusual way - one of its members is swallowed by a crocodile. To everyone's surprise, though - including his own - the swallowed Ivan Matveyevitch finds life inside the reptile quite bearable. Realising that his presence inside the crocodile adds considerably to the animal's value as a sideshow attraction, the practical and public-spirited Ivan readily accepts the opportunity to help increase the value of capital. His wife and friend are somewhat concerned for his welfare, but Ivan refuses to be rescued. \"The principles of economics come first\", he says. Cast includes: Eldon Quick, Robyn Millan, Britt Leach. Adapted for the screen from the book of the same title."
