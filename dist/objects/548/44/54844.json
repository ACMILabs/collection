        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\" This film asks whether or not there should be an expansion in the woodchip industry. Using Eden and Coff's Harbour as examples, the film presents some differing views on the value of woodchipping. A basic conflict over land use is raised and the viewers are left to make up their own minds."
