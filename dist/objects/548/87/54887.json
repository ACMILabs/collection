        "A history of the Beatles and the 1960's from the exuberant, youthful days to the socially conscious end of the decade. Kinestatic imagery captures the Beatles in concert, being interviewed, appearing in news reports interspersed with art, collages, animation, photographs and scenes of social and political activity. Excerpts from their films are also effectively intercut, presenting the spirit of the Beatles, the spirit of the times and the lasting imprint on life and culture made by this remarkable group of musicians.
