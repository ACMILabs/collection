        "This film looks at two tribes in the Philippines - one which has been resettled in a mountain valley, and the Tasaday, who have only just been discovered. The valley tribe is seen briefly, in a slash and burn agricultural setting. The Tasaday tribe, however, is still living a stone age existence. Narrated by Leslie Nielsen."
