        "This film explores how far the position of women in the labour market reflects the position of women in the home, and discusses the status of women's work in the home. Three couples are interviewed regarding their views on women working and how it affects their own relationship and family. Also included in the discussions is a woman journalist who specialises in women's problems. Housework is looked at and evaluated as if it were paid work."
