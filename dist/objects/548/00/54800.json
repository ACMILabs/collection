        "There is no narration in this study of the many forms of water. A bright-colored surfboard is reflected in rippling water and the image returns as a kind of punctuation mark throughout the film. The abstract patterns of water and spray introduce other uses of water and the film ends in a climactic surfing sequence with experts riding giant waves."
