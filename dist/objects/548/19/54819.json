        "Uncle Smiley shows his young friends how a playground can be created from discarded junk. Using hammers, saws, shovels, spanners, wooden boards soon become slides, cable reels become cars and tyres and ropes become swings. Paint, a tree and flowers also help to brighten the junkyard. The children discover that the best play equipment need not be expensive. Suitable for lower and middle primary level."
