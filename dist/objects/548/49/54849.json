        "This film concentrates on the process involved in the production of woodchips in the Eden area of New South Wales, from tree-felling to the shipment of chips to Japan. The film stresses that the logged areas will rejuvenate naturally thus allowing continual use of the forest. For a more critical view of woodchipping see \"The Vanishing forest\". Suitable for upper primary and secondary levels."
