        "Winner of the 1976 Australian National Travel Association Jedda Award at the Australian Film Awards. The mutton bird industry of the Furneaux Islands (Cape Barren Island and Flinders Island) in Bass Strait is a little known and historic primary industry started by sealers more than 150 years ago. The film records the rugged life style of the small band of people involved in Mutton birding. Narrated by Ross Thompson and photographed by Kevin Anderson. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
