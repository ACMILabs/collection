        "A wryly amusing, surrealistic animation using the analogy of the Earth to a ball in a pinball machine being manipulated by pressures arising from inequitable allocation of resources. Emphasises the urgency of finding suitable solutions to the Earth's problems, how a little more sharing of wealth by the \"have\" countries might ease many of the world's economic ills and presents three alternatives. Script by Don Arioli."
