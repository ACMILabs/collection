        "This is one of the beautifully made Lotte reiniger silhouette puppet films of the traditional fairy story. To decide which of his daughters should marry next, the king tosses each of them a golden ball, which the youngest one catches. She accidentally drops it down a well and it is recovered by a frog who is later transformed into a handsome man."
