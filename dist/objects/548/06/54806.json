        "This film illustrates the philosophy of the Pre-Raphaelite painters, who made a concerted effort to \"save\" art by returning to the \"truth of nature\". The narration and the visual content evoke the era of the Pre-Raphaelite in around 1848. The film helps to clarify the individual approaches of the painters and how they achieved the return to nature. Narrated by John Wood and poems of Tennyson, D.G. Rossetti and Christina Rossetti read by Freda Dowie. A fasinating and interesting film."
