        "Shows how a developing country's economic livelihood depend on the production and export of a narrow range of raw materials. Practically all of Ghana's export earnings come from a short list of primary products, headed by cocoa, and timber. Concludes with the important point that the slightest shift in world cocoa or timber prices can send shock waves through the whole economy."
