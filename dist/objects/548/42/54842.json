        "Episode of Series \"Psychology Today\" Elisabeth Hall, editor of Psychology Today, interviews the emminent Behaviorist, B.F. Skinner. Skinner explains, with examples, his theory of behavior modification (\"operant conditioning\") through positive and negative reinforcement. He cites the five classic examples of mistreatment, then explains the use of tokens in a program of reinforcement therapy. the director of the Adolf Meyer Center explains how token economy is practised. Views all aspects of the Center's life and contrasts its extremely high success rate with the generally lower rehabilitation rate of traditional therapy. Also Bernard Wagner discusses the concept of \"time out\"."
