        "An animated story of a pathetic organ-grinder who cannot play an entire song without striking a sour note. He wanders through a city filled with neon signs, sleek automobiles, bank note collages, and humanoid figures, searching for a sympathetic response. The city's indifference merges into hostility and the little musician is left only with his dreams. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
