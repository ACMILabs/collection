        "An intimate view of Dorothea Lange filmed during the last year of her life as she worked on a retrospective exhibition for the Museum of Modern Art. As she reviews her work, she is self critical and revealing, explaining how she felt when she took certain pictures. Most famous for her rural images during the depression, particularly the photograph 'Migrant Mother'. Photographed by Phillip Greene."
