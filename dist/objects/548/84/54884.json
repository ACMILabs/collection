        "An animated film concerned with solving the problem of crossing the seven bridges of Konigsberg, Germany, in a single continuous walk. Early attempts to solve it by trial and error are shown, including Leonard Euler's analysis of the problem. This is a claerly explained and attractive film which would complement a study on topology or network theory. No other credits available. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
