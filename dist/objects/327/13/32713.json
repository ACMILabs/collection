        "Episode of Series \"Animated Conversations\". This brilliant short animation directed and animated by Henry Lutman uses a real conversation recording to portray two architects discussing a plan to build a new shopping mall. While the characters flick through large technical drafts of the mall a homeless man walks across the pages to reveal the social consequences of redevelopment and to show the viewer between the lines of the real conversation. The film outstandingly shows a multiplex of possible realities- the real conversation recording - the animated architects and a homeless man minimally draw into the stark architectural line drawings. The animated characters begin to seem more realistic than the real conversation recording the film is based on. This title is part of a series of animated films made by the BBC called Animated Conversations."
