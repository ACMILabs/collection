        "Episode of Series \"Animated Conversations\". Another in the series of films whose starting point is the sound track, made by pinning a radio microphone to the central character. The resulting 'natural conversation' was edited down to five minutes and the animator allowed free visual interpretation. This one is about a visit to the dentist."
