        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Life on Earth\". Part 3 of a series which traces the dramatic history of life on earth from its beginnings about 3,500 million years ago to the final emergence of man. In this episode David Attenborough discusses the evolution of plants from the first algae and moss-like plants that crept onto the land from the waters edge to the giant trees of todays forests, showing how they solved the two major problems of support and reproduction in the absence of water. The arrival of plants on land made it possible for animal life to live there as well and the evolution of the first plants and animals is inextricably linked. Also examines how plants grew taller, seeking light and how insects developed wings to reach their food sources. Microphotography is used to reveal unsuspected details of mosses, liverworts, ferns, cycads and conifers."
