        "Raymond Loewy's streamlined functionalism has set the standards in modern industrial design for 70 years. Loewy animatedly discusses the elements of good design, and strolls through a hardware store finding ineffectively designed items among the store's wares. At 85 he is as sharp as ever, and still working to improve the most ordinary object. Includes his personal philosophy on the function of the designer."
