        "A compilation of four excellent short films; two from The National Film Board of Canada and two from Will Vinton who pioneered clay animation. \"Hot Stuff\" (Canada, 1972, 10 min.): An award winning animated film about fire as the servant of man. \"The Ride\" (Canada, 1963, 7 min.): A slapstick comedy about a chauffeur for an eccentric tycoon chasing a runaway sled. \"Dinosaur\" (U.S., 1980, 14 min.): A clay animated interpretation of how earth existed before man. \"Rip Van Winkle\" (U.S., 1979, 29 min.) An adaptation of Washington Irving's classic tale of a man who would rather tell stories than work in the fields."
