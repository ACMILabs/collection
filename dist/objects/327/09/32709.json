        "A non-narrated, animated cartoon with humorous sound effects, giving an understanding of how people react when confronted with behaviour patterns different from their own. Deals with a number of concepts related to groups and conflict: cultural awareness, beliefs and ignorance, scarce resources and the value of alliances. No other credits available."
