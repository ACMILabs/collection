        "Part 5 of a series on Australian women artists, examining some of their thoughts, struggles, aspirations, influences and disappointments, and the effect of sexual discrimination and stereotyping. Some of the women strongly believe in using their art as a form of political protest, but they all agree that their aim is to bring Australia out of the cultural desert and bring recognition to women generally as artists in their own right. The painters and sculptors include: Inge King, Margaret Hinder, Margaret Priest, Mirka Mora, Rinske Car, Anne Newmarch, Denese Oates, Kate Briscoe, Joan Grounds, Bonita Ely, Micky Allan and holographer, Margaret Benyon. Suitable for secondary and tertiary levels."
