        "Shows how individuals function with unconscious mental restrictions, and tells how to become free of such restrictions and discover our own creativity, thus increasing the ability to solve problems. Examines several of the common emotional, perceptual, cultural and environmental blocks that limit the quality of out ideas. Looks at problem solving techniques such as 'brainstorming' and 'synectics', shows how the concepts discussed in the film can be utilised, and explains ways in which management can encourage creativity within an organisation."
