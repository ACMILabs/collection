        "The film contains footage of both city and Peasant Chinese during the Cultural Revolution beginning 1966. Gives some background to the movement and compares Mao's comment that it was 70% good and 30% bad with a current Chinese assessment that it was a 10 year reversal of the Chinese socialist cause."
