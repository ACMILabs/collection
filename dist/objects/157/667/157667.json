    "description": [
        "Shows a range of sights and people throughout the city of London including Pall Mall, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Bridge, Houses of Parliament, Thames River scenes, docks, Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. Previously without a formal title and otherwise not known to survive, this footage was identified at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia by visiting University of London film historian Professor Ian Christie in 2006. This film is the oldest known documentary footage of London, of which only ten minutes of edited footage from the original forty minute film survives. 'Living London' bears resemblance to later city portraits such as Vertov's 'Man with a Movie Camera' (1929) or Ruttmann's 'Berlin: Symphony of a Great City' (1927).
