        "Nine stories from residents of Lennox Head, a small town that was rocked by a tornado in June, 2010."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "On the 3rd of June 2010, the residents of Lennox Head, on the North Coast of New South Wales, were preparing for the day ahead when their town was struck by a tornado. Despite having no warning, the tornado managed to pass without any loss of life but left over a hundred homes destroyed and hundreds more without power.  Nine residents of Lennox Head, mostly children, tell their stories about the disaster, revisiting the events of the morning leading up to the tornado and the chaos that followed. They speak frankly about the terror of the moment it hit and the way that day's events have affected them since."
