        "Giorgio Mangiamele\u2019s first full-length feature, 'Clay' was the most European of all his film works. One can see the influences on this film of Italian neorealist cinema as well as the cinema-as-art features of such directors as Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman and Alain Resnais. Moving away from the immigrant themes of Mangiamele\u2019s earlier films, 'Clay' charts love, obsession, jealousy, loss and the influence of these ingredients on the heroine\u2019s creative work. In a way that anticipates the opening of Peter Weir\u2019s 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' (1975), 'Clay' is book-ended by voice-over reflections on dreams, reality and existential meaning. The film\u2019s immaculately composed images helped it win the Silver Award, the Silver Medallion and Kodak Silver Trophy at the 1965 AFI Awards. Source: Graham Shirley"
