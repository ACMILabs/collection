        "The 2nd of December 2011 will mark one hundred years to the day that 29 year old geologist Douglas Mawson sailed from Hobart with the Australian Antarctic Expedition. Charting the Antarctic coastline and territory of East Antarctica, the 1911 expedition and subsequent voyages by Mawson was to form the basis of Australia's eventual claim of 42 per cent of the Antarctic continent."
