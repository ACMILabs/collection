    "description": [
        "ACMI Curator Sarah Tutton speaks to acclaimed contemporary artist Julian Rosefeldt, offering a unique insight into his creative process.  German-born Rosefeldt makes visually opulent film and video installations. Following the exhibition of his 5-channel work 'American Night', Julian\u2019s work  'The Shift' appeared as part of ACMI\u2019s 'Star Voyager' exhibition in 2011. Rather than focussing on the exhibited work, Rosefeldt discusses his previous work, themes and influences, by way of prelude to his current projects.  This conversation provides the rare opportunity to hear one of the world's most renowned moving image artists discuss his remarkable work."
