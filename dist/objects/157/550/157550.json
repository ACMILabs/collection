        "Amateur filmmaker, James Poppleton, delivers an account of WWII from the home front in Melbourne, Australia. Newspaper headlines set the scene and provide a timeline, starting with the declaration of war and various wartime activites such as air raid drills, marching, sandbagging and trench digging. Poppleton concludes with the end of World War II and marks the occasion with the Victory Day celebrations and marches that took place on the streets of Melbourne."
