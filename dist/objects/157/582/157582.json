        "A figure, shown by stop-motion animation, much like a zombie, walks through a world in pain. The Earth and people on it are being treated unfairly. Only if the figure wakes up to the fact that we need to respect the world and its inhabitants will the world become a better place. Under the category 'Secondary Animation', Sunbury Downs College's Shannon Castle, Year 9, was the Screen It 2011 winner."
