        "Taken by Damien Parer for the AIF Department of Information, this footage captures the departure of Australian troops from Port Melbourne at the beginning of World War II in 1939. Leaving the Melbourne Showgrounds, troops are transported by electric tram to the RMS Strathallan, where they set sail to war. Silent up until the last minute, the cheers of the crowd and soldiers are captured as the ship departs."
