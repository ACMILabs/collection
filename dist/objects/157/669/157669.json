        "Although the Corricks were not likely aware of it, their collection contains a number of films featuring the handiwork of one cinema\u2019s earliest and most innovative special effects artists (Segundo de Chom\u00f3n) who used dyes applied by hand which demonstrates colourisation in early film.  At least eleven films from Chomon's stint at Path\u00e9 were purchased by the Corrick Family including this fantastic colour extravaganza. This silent hand coloured film is based on a fable by La Fontaine of wealth and greed told in four acts: 'The Conjurer\u2019s Lottery', 'The Fantastic Fowls House', 'Ephemeral Fortune' and 'The Miser\u2019s Fate'."
