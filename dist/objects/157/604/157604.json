    "description": [
        "Beam Software produced a series of groundbreaking games in the 1980s, most notably the seminal games of 'The Hobbit', which allowed characters to direct other characters, and 'The Way of the exploding fist', one of the first one-on-one fighting games developed for the home computer. Beam was sold to Krome Studios in 2006 which, in turn, ceased operations in 2010. These unedited interviews with some of the key members of Beam Software were filmed at ACMI in April 2006.  Andrew Bailey and Trevor Nuridin discuss how they both entered the games industry and their work at Beam's publishing arm, Melbourne House. They talk candidly about the culture at Beam and the reasons why they left to start Tantalus Media together in 1994."
