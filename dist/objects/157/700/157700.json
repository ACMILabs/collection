        "When Emily Somerville first heard the loud bangs in the morning, she thought it was her family making the noise. When she realised it was more serious than that, Somerville and her family took shelter under the stairs, surviving the tornado but finding it hard to control her emotions afterwards. On the 3rd of June 2010, the residents of Lennox Head, on the North Coast of New South Wales, were preparing for the day ahead when their town was struck by a tornado."
