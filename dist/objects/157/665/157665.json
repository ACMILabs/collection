        "Five rare 35mm silent films from the Corrick Collection - part of a variety act that toured the world 100 years ago."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Over 100 years before the modern 'mashup', the Australian-based Corrick Family Entertainers were not only making and screening their own productions but also repackaging complete versions of films with special effects, comedy and actuality (non-fiction) both in black and white and dazzling colour. These silent films screened with live musical accompaniment provided by the family, 'Leonard's Beautiful Pictures' formed a part of a variety act touring Australasia, South-East Asia and Europe from 1897 to 1914. A painstaking five year project to restore the surviving 130 films in this collection has uncovered films once considered lost. These five films represent a snapshot of this incredible collection from the National Film and Sound Archive."
