        "Piper and Nick were best friends from a young age but as they grew up, Piper became one of the most popular girls in the school and studious Nick fell into the nerdy group. School bullies harass Nick while Piper looks on concerned. She is torn when Nick calls to her for help. Will Piper risk her popularity to respect their life-long friendship, or will she be caught in the crowd? Written and directed by India Thompson with Film Support by Michael Hilbert and Sue Chapple. Cast includes: Piper Adams, Nicholas House, Emma Johnstone and Cameron Wicks. Under the category 'Primary Live Action', Norwood Primary School's 5/6 Chapple/Dennis class were the Screen It 2011 winners."
