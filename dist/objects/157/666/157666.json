        "Shot in Perth, this is likely the first dramatic narrative film produced in Western Australia. 'Bashful Mr Brown' depicts the awkwardness of a young bachelor in his endeavour to help his hostess dispense afternoon tea.  After many accidents including his flight from the garden with the afternoon teacloth attached to his coat-tails, he's pursued by a number of small boys where he finally manages to climb into a passing cart and takes refuge in a barrel labeled 'Fat'. Mr. Brown was likely played by company funny-man Chris Young, and in typical self-promoting fashion, a poster advertising the Corrick Family Entertainers is seen pasted on a street hoarding during the chase sequence. Source: West Australian, Perth Monday 11 March 1907."
