        "In a sea of hats and umbrellas, racegoers for the 1927 Melbourne Cup arrive at Flemington station and gather around bookmaker stands on the racecourse prior to the event. Women are equally interested in their form guides and can be seen parading in typical 1920's fashions. With a cloud of dust behind them, they're off!  The race was won by Trivalve, trained by James Scobie and ridden by Bobbie Lewis. Odds for Trivalve were 6/1 and winning time was 3 mins 24 seconds."
