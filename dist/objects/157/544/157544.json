        "With the ANZACs on their first home leave during the Great War, this wonderfully detailed footage captures the excitement and celebration that welcomed the troops as they sail in. Shot around September 1918, the returned soldiers are greeted by a motorcade which takes them through the streets of inner-city Melbourne, lined with cheering crowds. While the source of this film is unknown, it is suggested that due to the quality of footage and editing  it was professionally shot and intended for newsreel use."
