        "This unique footage of the 1925 Melbourne Cup provides an example of sepia type film with its characteristic brown tone, obtained by a chemical reaction that occured during early film processing. 1925 marked the first year that ABC Radio commenced transmission for the Melbourne Cup. In key parts of the race, footage is slowed down so that we can see the magnificence of the horses in action. The race was won by Windbag, trained by G Price and ridden by J Munro. Odds for Windbag were 5/1 and winning time was 3 mins 22 seconds."
