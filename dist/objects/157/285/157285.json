        "Highlights Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton's contribution to the field of film criticism."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "When SBS television producer Margaret Pomeranz was first introduced to film critic David Stratton in 1985, neither could have foreseen the significance of their meeting. Finding common ground in their mutual love of film, it wasn't long before the first seed of 'The Movie Show' was planted.  'The Movie Show' debuted on SBS Television on 30 October 1986, screening for 18 years to a loyal and enthusiastic Australian audience. On 1 July 2004, Pomeranz and Stratton moved their show to ABC TV, where they continue their passionate discussions and disagreements about film on 'At the Movies'.  ACMI\u2019s exclusive exhibition 'Margaret and David: 25 Years Talking Movies' highlights the duo's ongoing advocacy of the Australian film industry, their support for art-house and foreign film, their anti-censorship campaigns, and their substantial contribution to the field of film criticism."
