    "description": [
        "'Twin' is a videogame that highlights the importance of self-respect. It is based upon the Hero's search for those who took away his 'colour'. As his colour has been taken away, he has been reduced to his black and white form; his own being is split into two. The Hero realises his colour was in fact not stolen and by being able to overcome the puzzles and challenges brought by each level, the Hero begins to respect himself and is ultimately able to retrieve his \u2018colours.\u2019  A 2D problem solving/puzzle showing respect starts with self. This trailer illustrates how the game is played. Under the category 'Secondary Games', James Ruse Agricultural High School's Nicholas Lee, Year 12, was the Screen It 2011 winner."
