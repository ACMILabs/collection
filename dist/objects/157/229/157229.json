        "The unreleased version of 'The Spag' presents a harsher view of the impact of Australian racism than the different version Giorgio Mangiamele made and released several years later. While the unreleased version contains a couple of minor characters prepared to stand up for, even defend Giovanni, most of the people in his day-to-day life are in the habit of verbally, even physically abusing him on the grounds of his racial difference. Mangiamele chose not to complete this version (which still has some sections roughly edited and mute) but instead re-scripted and re-made it as a separate film, one he considered would be more palatable to most Australians.
