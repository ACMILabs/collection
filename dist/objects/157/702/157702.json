        "Justin Somerville never thought he would be in the middle of a tornado, so his first reaction was that he wanted to witness this phenomena. His account of the aftermath provides detail well beyond the media coverage of the devestation of this small town. On the 3rd of June 2010, the residents of Lennox Head, on the North Coast of New South Wales, were preparing for the day ahead when their town was struck by a tornado."
