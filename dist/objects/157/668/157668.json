    "description": [
        "'La Metallurgie au Creusot' is remarkable for its strikingly detailed colouring evoking the dark, close interior of the plant, at times lit only by the glowing-hot metal as it is guided by the skilled hand of shadowy workers. The film effectively expresses the full scope of the forge with shots of the workmen, the burning coals, raging fires, billowing smoke, the massive steam hammer and other machinery. It follows the fiery blocks being taken to the rolling machines in order to be given the most diverse forms and evokes a hellish landscape of modern industrial processing."
