        "Maree Somerville acknowledges that, despite the devastation, the day could've had a different ending - one more tragic. For Somerville, it has been an opportunity to recognise what really matters in life. On the 3rd of June 2010, the residents of Lennox Head, on the North Coast of New South Wales, were preparing for the day ahead when their town was struck by a tornado."
