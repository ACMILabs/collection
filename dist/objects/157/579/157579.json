    "description": [
        "This clay-animated story is about respect for others who are different or have different cultures. Overcome by Bees, The Jewel Beetles must flee their home to find a safe place to live. Forced to brave a treacherous river and evade hungry predators, the Jewel Beetles reach the safety of Grasshopper Land. They overhear a debate between two grasshoppers. One grasshopper believes that beetles would bring new perspectives and cultures to Grasshopper Land, while the other grasshopper, fearing change, thinks the beetles don't belong. Intolerance or acceptance will determine the Jewel Beetles' fate. Under the category 'Primary Animation', Yarraville West Primary School's 5/6 Film Team were the Screen It 2011 winners."
