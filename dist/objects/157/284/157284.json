        "The 1960s brought on a change in government in Australia, resulting in greater funding towards the arts and Australia's film industry in particular. In turn, this political change gave rise to what was to be called the 'Australian New Wave' in cinema. Celebrated film critic, David Stratton, shares his recollections of this pivotal time with fellow key players: Jan Chapman, Matt Carroll, Paul Cox and Phillip Noyce (via SKYPE). This panel discussion was filmed at ACMI as part of the 'Margaret and David: 25 years talking movies' exhibition."
