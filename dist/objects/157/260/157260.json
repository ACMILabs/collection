        "Over breakfast, Caitlin Foley and her family spotted a tornado coming from over the water. Caitlin's mum said they never make it onto the land. Despite hitting the community so suddenly and quickly, the tornado left physical and emotional devastation in its wake. On the 3rd of June 2010, the residents of Lennox Head, on the North Coast of New South Wales, were preparing for the day ahead when their town was struck by a tornado."
