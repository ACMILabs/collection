    "description": [
        "Great Australian drama based on actual events, produced less than a decade after they took place. On 11 November 1975, the Labor Prime Minister was dismissed by the Queen's representative in Australia, the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. 'The Dismissal' brings to life the events leading up to this extraordinary event that shook the nation. The drama is played out in the Federal Parliament, the back rooms and the ministers' offices, while the world of those now far off times is drawn through archival images and a fine narration to establish the point in history when the Arab oil embargo sent the world's economies into a tail spin of inflation and unemployment for the first time since World War II. Parts 1 and 2 of this acclaimed mini-series, originally shown on Network Ten. It's a press field day as the Labor government is beset by rumours concerning Dr Jim Cairn's involvement with Junie Morosi and what was to be known as 'The Loans Scandal'. Meanwhile, on the other side of the floor in the Liberal-National opposition, Malcolm Fraser and leader Bill Snedden jostle for power. Cast includes Robin Nevin, Stewart Faichney, Peter Sumner,Ruth Cracknell, Ed Devereaux and narrated by Peter Carroll."
