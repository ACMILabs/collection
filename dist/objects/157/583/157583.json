        "It would be easy to discard a worthless, old locket found on the beach but, out of respect for a serviceman in a black and white photo, an old man embarks on a journey to return the memento to its original owner. He travels a long way from his lonely, daily routine and unearths respect for himself and a fallen solider. 'The Locket' is a snapshot of a life we don't know we're in until something \u2013 or someone \u2013 snaps you out of it. Cast Includes: John Murphy, Iris Whitakker, David Jellie, Victoria Upward, Gomer Jones and Nadine Crichton. Under the category 'Secondary Live Action', this independent entry by Blake Borcich, Year 10, was the Screen It 2011 winner."
