    "description": [
        "A selection of films from the Australian War Memorial providing a brief glimpse of the life of our armed forces at home and abroad during the last one hundred years. The Australian War Memorial houses a vast record of Australians at war and the activities of the armed forces during peacetime with over  70,000 hours of moving image, over 800,000 photographs and over 8,000 hours of sound recordings.  These works show detailed accounts of Australians at war, captured by amateur footage, newsreels and television programs, providing a rich history spanning three major wars - World War I (the Great War), World War II and the Vietnam War."
