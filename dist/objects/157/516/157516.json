        "Screened on the Ten Network, 'The Dismissal' dramatised the unprecedented events surrounding the 1975 sacking of the Whitlam Government. Parts five and six of the acclaimed mini-series."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Great Australian drama based on actual events, produced less than a decade after they took place. On 11 November 1975, the Labor Prime Minister was dismissed by the Queen's representative in Australia, the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. 'The Dismissal' brings to life the events leading up to this extraordinary event that shook the nation. The drama is played out in the Federal Parliament, the back rooms and the ministers' offices, while the world of those now far off times is drawn through archival images and a fine narration to establish the point in history when the Arab oil embargo sent the world's economies into a tail spin of inflation and unemployment for the first time since the Second World War.  In parts 5 and 6 of this acclaimed mini-series, the stalemate between the Australian federal government and opposition reaches crisis point, putting pressure on the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, to take action to resolve the issue."
