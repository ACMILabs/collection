        "Screened on the Ten Network, 'The Dismissal' dramatised the unprecedented events surrounding the 1975 sacking of the Whitlam Government. Parts three and four of the acclaimed mini-series."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Great Australian drama based on actual events, produced less than a decade after they took place. On 11 November 1975, the Labor Prime Minister was dismissed by the Queen's representative in Australia, the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. 'The Dismissal' brings to life the events leading up to this extraordinary event that shook the nation. The drama is played out in the Federal Parliament, the back rooms and the ministers' offices, while the world of those now far off times is drawn through archival images and a fine narration to establish the point in history when the Arab oil embargo sent the world's economies into a tail spin of inflation and unemployment for the first time since the Second World War.   In parts three and four of this acclaimed mini-series, the embattled Labor government, led by Gough Whitlam, is further rocked to the core by 'The Loans Affair'. The opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, take advantage of the situation to step up pressure, deferring the supply bill in the Senate in the hope of forcing an early election."
