        "This is the second part of a two-part documentary recording the International Biomedical Expedition to the Antarctic. The purpose of the expedition was to measure the effects of the Antarctic environment on both the human body and mind, including the extreme cold climate, isolation and separation from family and home. Shows the physiological and psychological pressures and physical limits the Expedition set for themselves. Some coped, some didn't - but the ordeal had a lasting effect on all of them. Narrated by W. Francis Bell."
