        "Highlights the attempts of government bodies to overcome some of the problems that have plagued the high-rise housing estates in Victoria, in the past and still do today (focusing on Park Towers and 229 Hoddle Street in Melbourne). Shows how Housing Commission tenants are becoming involved in the decision-making processes that determine the environment in which they live including better security, vandal-proof walls and different designs for new flats. Also profiles the range and extent of families who live in public housing with one-third single parents, 20% elderly, low income two parents large families, immigrants and homeless youth. There is a 2.1/2 to 3 year waiting list with 43,000 families living in public housing in Victoria. Discusses why these high-rise buildings were built and the political reasoning of both the Liberal and Labor parties for encouraging private ownership. Includes excellent aerial footage of Melbourne (1984). Suitable for upper secondary levels."
