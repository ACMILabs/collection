        "Using revealing interviews with prominent scientists, and extraordinary newsreels from the 1940s and 1950s, \"Unstable Elements\" traces the history of nuclear Britain. Combining several stories in one film, this film also examines - through its fictional part - the way the tunnel vision of the atomic scientists is reflected in family life. A film for a wide audience."
