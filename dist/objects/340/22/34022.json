        "A painstakingly researched and brilliantly edited compendium of pro-nuclear propaganda from American newsreels, 'educational' material, military footage, advertisements, TV shows and pop songs. This was the Cold War at its most icy and all-pervasive, and no area of American popular culture seems to have escaped from its bitter ideological grip. This veritable flood of bizarre, horrifying and often ludicrously comic images is counterpointed on the soundtrack by an array of equally extraordinary songs."
