        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Barriers of the Mind\". The introduction of major psychotic drugs have meant that many schizophrenics can now lead normal lives in the community. These drugs however, can have severe side effects, and sometimes they can only limit the disease. This program looks at some typical case studies in schizophrenia and seeks out opinions on the use of drugs and other methods of treatment of this most frightening illness."
