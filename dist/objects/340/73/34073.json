        "A 4-Corners presentation examining the history of the AIDS epidemic in the United States and the spread to gay communities in the Western World including Australia. Medical authorities discuss their hopes to contain the spread of AIDS outlining symptoms and debunking myths regarding transmission of the virus. A series of frank interviews highlight the human cost of AIDS. Due to copyright restrictions, certain parts of the music soundtrack have been edited resulting in sound drop-out in sections of the program."
