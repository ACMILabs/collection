        "Episode of Series \"The wonderful world of Paddington Bear\". 1. \"Paddington in the hot seat\". Paddington has an audience ticket for the Quiz Show \"Sage of Britain\". He gets lost in the studio complex and finds himself \"on camera\" where he is interviewed by Lionel Parr. He disputes the scoring and provides his opinion on proposed changes to British Television. The viewers jam the switchboard and Paddington is announced \"Sage of Britain\". - 2. \"Paddington's puzzle\". Paddington makes a jigsaw puzzle as a present for Mr Gruber from a \"priceless\" old painting discarded by Mr Curry, some plywood and glue. - 3. \"Paddington takes a cut\". Paddington reads \"Clippings from my Hedgerow\" and dreams he is pruning Mr Currys' shrub into a peacock shape. Disaster strikes when he snips it leg off! However, awakes before discovery by Mr Curry!"
