        "This film is about the conflict between people and elephants. In the Samburu district of Kenya, herds of elephants have raided farms, trampled crops and imperilled a struggling people's way of life. Unfortunately there is no easy solution to the problem of whether to eliminate the elephants or to protect them as part of the country's unique heritage."
