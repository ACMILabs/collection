        "A delightful children's story about Cannonball, a little stray dog who escapes from a pound and wanders into a circus. Here he is befriended by the clown who is in danger of losing his job unless he smartens up his act. Cannonball saves the day and acquires a role in the circus routine. Based on the book \"Cannonball Simp\", written and illustrated by John Burningham. Minimal dialogue and features a cameo role by Joe Mantegna. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
