        "A charming puppet animation based on a Chinese folk-tale. Ma Liang, the hero, is a poor peasant boy who loves to paint. One day a fairy gives him a magic paintbrush and he discovers that anything he paints will come to life. Ma Liang happily creates many things that the peasants desperately need until, one fateful day, a wicked landlord discovers his secret."
