        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Heart of the Dragon\". This program visits Minus Eighteen Street in northern Harbin (Ha-erh-pin) to examine urban life in China, using the family of a railway policeman as an example. Also looks at institutions for those with whom the community cannot cope. Highlights how life is governed by concepts of honour, moral conduct, courtesy and respectful behaviour which are deep rooted in Chinese society."
