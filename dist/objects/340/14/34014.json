        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Barriers of the Mind\". Psychiatrists have the responsibility for deciding who should and who shouldn't be locked away, whose behaviour is merely eccentric and who is in fact, mentally ill. This program looks at the effect on people's civil liberties when they are forcibly detained and questions whether it is necessary for the mentally ill to be hospitalised at all."
