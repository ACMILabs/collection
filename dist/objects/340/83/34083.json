        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Heart of the Dragon\". This program follows the trial of Nie Chengying, accused of stealing from her neighbour, to show the legal system at work in China. The legal system not only aims to punish and protect society, but also seeks to restore the social harmony which has been disturbed by the crime. Also explores the social pressures at work in the new consumer society which may cause a person to commit a crime."
