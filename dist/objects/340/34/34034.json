        "This is a devastating account of the Aboriginal land rights battle in Queensland. It reveals white Australians at their most beer-sodden and hypocritical. O'Rourke has captured scenes showing how racism and vulgarity, are alive and thriving in the Australian heartland! The film includes interviews by Mick Miller, chairman of the Queensland Aboriginal Land Council, with Joh Bjelke-Peterson and Russ Hinze."
