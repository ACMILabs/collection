        "This is a two-part documentary about an international group of scientists who organised an expedition to the Antarctic. For three months they measured the stresses of Antarctic life on body and mind. Part 1 deals with the laboratory phase of the expedition as the scientists subject themselves to some gruelling experiments to discover the limits of their endurance. Suitable for upper secondary level."
