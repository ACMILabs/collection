        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Heart of the Dragon\". This series documents the historical and cultural traditions of China, showing how attitudes in China today are shaped not only by the doctrines of Marx and Mao but also by ancient beliefs and traditions and by the living memories of recent cataclysmic events. This program seeks to identify what it is that unifies a quarter of the world's population. Uses both original footage and archive material to give a broad overview of historic and modern China."
