        "Episode of Series \"Victoria College Special Education Films\". Hearing impairment is a common disability amongst the community and this documentary aims to make people more aware of this disability. The causes of deafness are discussed and the program stresses the importance of early detection, as language and speech development are seriously affected if help is delayed. Children and parents discuss their problems with communication. Narrated by Barry McQueen."
