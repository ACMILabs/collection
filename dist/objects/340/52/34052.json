        "Kalashs, who live in the north west province of Pakistan, are the only Kafirs, (meaning pagans in Persian), to have survived the Muslim slaughters of the 19th century. This film is an in-depth study of the life of the Kalash people and it shows how an Indo-European race adapts itself to an Asian way of life and philosophy."
