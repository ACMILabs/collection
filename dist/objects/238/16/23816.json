        "A vast stream of shipping, with millions of tons of varying cargo, moves through the canals and locks of the Great Lakes, passing through the centre of the Canadian Continent. The film shows the booming industrial life of the Great Lakes region - steel production, pulp manufacture, ship-building, grain storage, and the workings of the great lock and canal systems."
