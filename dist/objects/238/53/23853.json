        "A study of ground water; the following aspects are dealt with in detail: the funtion of water in changing the face of the earth in producing spectacular geological phenomena, and its vital importance to man; artesian systems, springs, wells, water tables, caves; such spectacular phenomena as geysers, roaring springs, hot springs, sink holes, petrification, geode fillings, and the concentration of minerals. Below the surface of the earth, often unknown to man, water works many transformations. Both animation and direct photography of well-known examples of these various phenomena, many of them famous as tourist attractions in USA are presented in this film."
