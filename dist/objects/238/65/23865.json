        "Filmed in a nursery school group of 4 and 5 year olds in the spring of 1970 during a time of crisis in the adult world. The staff provided a small sandbox with a number of small toys in order to see how young children use spontaneous play in a time of stress. The results lend themselves to discussion on many issues."
