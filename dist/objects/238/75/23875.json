        "An account of the city's growth from pre-Roman to modern times. The geology of the London basin and the potential importance of the site are considered. Shows the growth if London in Roman times and subsequent changes during Saxon, Mediaeval, Elizabethan, Restoration, Georgian, Victorian, and modern period. The later part of the film shows the rapid growth of the city in recent years and relates this to its geographical position and to the favourable position of the British Isles in a world altered by the Age of Discovery. And the Industrial Revolution."
