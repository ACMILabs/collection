        "An evocative documentary showing Greece as the background to western civilisation. The artistic treasures of antiquity are seen side by side with the life of the sturdy people today. Contains many spectacular shots of the Parthenon, the ruins of Mistra and Mycenae and the sunbaked landscape along with candid camera sequences of the Greeks of today. Independently financed, this film aroused lively critical comment in Great Britain."
