        "Celeste Holm reads selections from the poem \"Hailstones and Halibut Bones\" by Mary O'Neill. Animated drawings illustrate the poem, and show how the writer uses colour to convey feeling. White, gold, red, green and black are each described in a series of couplets. Some of the animated visuals, like the couplets themselves, are literal identifications whilst others reflect emotions and attitudes about colour. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
