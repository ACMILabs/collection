        "Shows the Backby community school complex at Vasteras, Sweden, which is famous throughout Sweden as a particularly well-planned design. It also shows how the early hopes for the school have not been attained because of certain failures of communication between the school and the community it serves. An analysis of the failure is a feature of the film"
