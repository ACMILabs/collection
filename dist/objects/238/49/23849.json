        "This film illustrates the orderly processing of a grievance though several stages of negotiation between union and management, showing how the right of a worker with a genuine grievance are protected under the union's contract. It shows the case of an unto-worker who was demoted for refusing to work inside a truck cab he considered too hot. The union registers the case as a legitimate grievance; it passes through three stages of negotiation in the plant, and eventually reaches an impartial arbitrator for the settlement."
