        "Ricky, who has recently arrived in Australia, sees his first game of Australian Rules Football when he follows the boys of his neighbourhood to the Melbourne Cricket Ground where Geelong is playing Collingwood. At first the atmosphere is strange and new, but the boy soon becomes a part of the enthusiastic crowd excited by the fast field play, high punt kicks, snap shots for goal and clever manoeuvres which comprise Australia's national sport."
