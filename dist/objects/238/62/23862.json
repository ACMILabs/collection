        "This is the story of the South East Community College Mount Gambier. Features two teachers, Bev Puckridge and Ian Winter, who narrate throughout the film. Shows how students go back to their own communities and set up and teach smaller groups in woodwork, pottery, spinning etc. Emphasis is made that art is a natural part of our world - a natural thing to do. It is not the finished product that really matters, but the thought process used to achieve it."
