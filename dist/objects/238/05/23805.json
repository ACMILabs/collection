        "This film tells of the part played by the New Zealand party, under Sir Edmund Hillary, in crossing the Antarctic continent in 1957. After wintering at Scott base the party sets out on the difficult and often frustrating trek to the Pole. The meeting with the Americans is shows with the arrival of Fuch's party at Scott base. The film concludes with the triumphal homecoming to Wellington."
