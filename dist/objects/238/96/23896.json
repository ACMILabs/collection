        "A young Haida Indian artist shapes miniature totems from argillite, a stone-like jet. Shows the island where he finds the stone, and how he carves it in the manner of his grandfather who taught him the craft. His grandmother shows delight as she polishes each new piece to a gbeautiful black gloss. Weathered monuments stand among the tall firs on Canada's Pacific coast, where the whittlers used to carve the giant totems."
