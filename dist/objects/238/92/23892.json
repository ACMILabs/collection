        "Episode of Series \"Psychology for Living\". It's a little late for tears, isn't it Barabara? Says the brutal narrator at the beginning of the film. This instructional piece, as the title suggests, is for developing good habits. At the start of the film, Barbara stands by the closed door of her bedroom, weeping pitifully. She has bad habits, and this film sends her to social hell as we flash-back to the beginning of her day. She is sloppy and unorganised, sleeps in, and is generally discourteous. All the examples of problems caused by her bad habits in this film are social blunders, which get worse as the film progresses. The narrator is unforgiving: \"How easy it is not to be invited again.\" and \"how quickly you can be left out of the crowd\". This film is more about conformity than keeping good habits."
