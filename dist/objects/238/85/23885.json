        "This film presents the early history of the Bulolo goldfields in the northwestern part of what is known today as the Territory of Papua New Guinea. The gold prospectors were the explorers of this rugged country mandated to Australia by the League of Nations. The film records primitive native life of the area as it was discovered by them - a people with unique customs living in a stone-age environment. Shows the discovery of alluvial gold in the Bulolo Valley and the construction of the first dredges, every part of which was flown in three tons at a time over the mountains from Lae in three-engined Junkers aircraft. The role of the aircraft is shown to be basic in the development of the resources of the Bulolo Valley, and the valley itself with its wealth of alluvial gold was a basic part of the economic and industrial development of pre-war New Guinea."
