        "This film gives graphic illustration of the kind of conditioning that women undergo in society, in an attempt to examine and question the whole framework of the women's role. Women from various age-groups are presented, all of them revealing in some degree their mental conditioning. Advertising media are viewed as instrumental in this process. The film raises important questions as to the depth of the problem and the possibilities of liberating women in the present social order."
