        "A classic study of man and nature in Central Sweden. It is a simple story of the eternal symmetry of nature; a mother fox preys upon a hen coop to feed her hungry cubs - the farmer preys upon the fox - the farmer's dog chases a cub. In a second sequence two young boys rescue an otter from a hunter, and care for it through the four seasons. A beautifully sensitive evocation of the interdependence of animals and man's relationship to them. Cannes Film Festival Award Winner, 1954."
