        "Episode of Series \"Personnel Management\". A case study of a grievance, to show how hearings are conducted, what their purposes are and how a willingness to compromise can settle most disputes. In the case shows, a worker out sick for several weeks, has forgotten to notify the company formally of her illness. Under the collective bargaining contract this constitutes an \"automatic quit\". Wen the worker returns she finds that her job has been filled. On the basis of her good working record, her three years' seniority , and the nature of her illness - an operation that prevented her from calling in - the Sop Steward files a grievance. A hearing is held, attended by the Committee Chairman and other members of the Union, the Manager, a Personnel Man, and Mary, the worker. The Company agrees to re-hire Mary, placing her where they can find room; the union agrees that this will not constitute a precedent."
