        "Illustrates how plants are a direct link to the energy received from the sun. Through the process of photosynthesis, green plants trap the sun's energy and transform it into food which is stored in stems, roots, seeds and fruit. Green plants living beneath the water surface function in a similar manner. Because the sea supports more plants and life than land, man should be aware of its importance as a potential future food source."
