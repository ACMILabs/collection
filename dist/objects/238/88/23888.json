        "The country in Northern Australia bordering on the Gulf of Carpentaria is a flat, dry area in which the rivers and creeks seldom run and isolated water holes keep the wild life and stock alive. At the time when gold was being mined there several townships were flourishing but these are largely abandoned. The Mitchell River Mission looks after aborigines of the district who are free to come and go as they please, and some are employed on the cattle runs in the area. At the waterholes may be seen large flocks of ibis and many other birds as well as wild pigs and crocodiles. At times the sky is darkened by flights of flying foxes."
