        "Deals with the urgent problem of smoke-abatement. The film shows how smoking coal fires not only waste fuel, but also cause dirt and corrosion, and bring about fogs and illness. Various methods of smoke-elimination in the home and industry are outlined, in particular the wider use of gas and coke; and the establishment of new smokeless zone together with extension of existing ones is advocated."
