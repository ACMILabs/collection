        "An affectionate tribute to Dr. John Grierson, father of documentary film, who founded and led the British documentary film movement in the 30's and who later established the National Film Board of Canada. Reveals the drive and dynamism of this Scottish-born pioneer who through his faith in the drama of everyday life and his concept of the \"creative interpretation of reality\" influenced many young filmmakers in his own country and abroad. Many of them appear here to talk about the Grierson they knew. Using photographs, newsreels, interviews and excerpts from Grierson's films this documentary brings into focus the personality of this visionary and committed filmmaker. (Awards: Toronto)"
