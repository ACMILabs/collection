        "A study of the development of selected activities common to growing infants. Twin boys are selected and the influence of exercise on the development of each motor function at a number of age levels is studied. During the first 22 months Johnny is kept in a crib and then between the 22 to 25 month period was given intensive exercise. The complex interdependence of practice and maturation in development is illustrated. Reel 1: Development of creeping, development of the sitting position, development of erect locomotion, development in the assumption of an erect posture. Reel 2: A lure is suspended beyond the child's reach in order to appraise his ability to manipulate pedestals so that he can climb up to obtain the object. Reel 3: in some behaviour activities not only attitude but also neuromotor performance are affected by exercise or restriction of funtion. The following are studies: Swimming behaviour and ascending inclines."
