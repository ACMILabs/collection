        "Based on the film 'Free to Move' this film shows the development of gymnastics along movement themes. It clearly demonstrates children working at floor level and the adaptation of these experiences on small and large equipment. Extremely informative for teachers who plan and teach from the 'Physical Education Curriculum Guide No. 2 Gymnastics'."
