        "Great Britain is established as an island group off the coast of Europe. The appearance of the land when the Continental Shelf was above water is shown and the probable drainage of the area. Great Britain's structure is related to the structure of Europe. The modifying effect of the North Atlantic drift and prevailing wind on Great Britain's climate is next examined. This leads to an explanation of the development of cyclones in the North Atlantic, and their drift towards these islands, Finally, the film illustrates Great Britains; position in relations to sea and air communications."
