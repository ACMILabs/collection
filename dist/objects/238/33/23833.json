        "Shows how green open space is being thoughtlessly gobbled up by the urbanising process. Demonstrates how development can take place without excessive destruction and illustrates various situations in different parts of the United States. Describes man's changing environment and fortells the consequences if this change is permitted to take place without careful planning."
