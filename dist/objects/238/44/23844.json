        "Film shot by scientists on the 1952-54 British North Greenland Expedition has been assembled to reveal some aspects of the work. The assistant glaciologist, Peter Taylor, discusses the objects of the expedition and their findings. Describes the process of measuring the depth of the ice in the centre of Greenland and the investigation of the shape of the rock bed beneath. Further proof is added to the theory that Greenland is a vast saucer filled with ice and that the surface of the land at the centre is below sea level. The scientists also investigated whether this mass of ice is increasing or decreasing."
