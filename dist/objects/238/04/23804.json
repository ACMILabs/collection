        "All machinery depends on bearings. Ball and roller bearings are made with the utmost care and precision. All this effort is wasted if lubricants in which they run to don't stand up to their work. This film illustrates how different types of grease are manufactured to meet different needs; additives being put in to adapt greases for special purposes. Tests are carried out during the manufacture of grease to ensure uniformity of quality and reliability of performance."
