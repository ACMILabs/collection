        "Episode of Series \"Guidance for the 70's\". I am the cause of my own effects. This is a difficult concept for many to accept; most people prefer to \"blame\" others or environment for what happens to them. Teenagers attending a PACE conference deal with the concept of responsibility. Their discussions highlight how 'what happens to you is under your own control to a very great extent' and that, by exercising your choice, you can 'create the effect your want to have in your life'."
