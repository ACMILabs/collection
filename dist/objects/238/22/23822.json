        "An animated spoof of the wild west movies starring the world's most wanted good guy, Santa Claus, and three hard riding, gun-toting, bad guys. As in all formula westerns, good guys win over evil, but not before robbers and robbed have romped through some incongruous, though recognizable situations. (Awards include: New York, Belgrade)"
