        "The setting of this film is a small community of farmers who make their living not only from the land but also from the forest. We see many of the complicated links in the chain that brings the products of this forest to the consumer, including transport, milling and processing., The various uses of timber are described. But forests cannot be mined, as can metal deposits. Tress are a crop like any other and must be carefully planted, tended and protected against pests, fires and indiscriminate cutting. At a timber conference, experts of the Food and Agriculture Organization seek a lasting solution to the problem of timber shortage. Unexplored areas of forest resources must be tapped; cultivated forests must be conserved. New machines and techniques will also help in processing and developing the products, Co-operation is the only real chance for world-wide progress in conservation."
