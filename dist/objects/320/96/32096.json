        "A young filmmaker, hired to make a sombre straight-forward film about the reasons employers should hire the disabled, decides instead to take an innovative, irreverent approach to what is usually a piously hush-hush subject. The film shows him screening his film to an incredulous audience and trying to convince them that his different approach is the right one. Stars Michael Keaton with cameo appearances by Martin Mull, Ed Asner, Jim Nabors and Carroll O'Connor."
