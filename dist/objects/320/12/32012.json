        "The famous French director Jean-Luc Godard is interviewed by British film theorist Peter Wollen and the editor of \"Framework\", Don Ranveaud. He talks of the developments in his work, the change in style epitomised by his most recent film \"Sauve Qui Peut\", his work with Francis Ford Coppola and the relationships between his previous films and the new one. He also discusses his radical method of scriptwriting and the critical responses to his latest film."
