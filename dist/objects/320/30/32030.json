        "After completing school, two friends are faced with the problem of finding a place in Malawian society. They are shown in an unsuccessful attempt to become middlemen, buying and smoking fish, then selling them at an inland market. Failing, they go to a city where they spend days seeking work. Unemployment, high cost of living and unfriendly people sends one of the two back to his village."
