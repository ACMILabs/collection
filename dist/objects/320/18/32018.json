        "A road tanker's daily hazardous climb up the snowbound mountainside to the village of Val d'Isere whose hotels, hospitals and homes are dependent upon its cargo for fuel. Contrasting with the upward grind of the tanker are exhilarating scenes of skiers skimming down from the slopes above Val d'Isere, breaking a new trail from the mountain tops to the village."
