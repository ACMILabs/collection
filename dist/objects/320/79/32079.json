        "Canoeing is one of Australia's popular holiday sports. Along the Mitta Mitta river and the upper reaches of the Yarra, campers spend their holidays fishing, swimming, hiking and canoeing. The most common type of canoe used is the light, manoeuvrable Canadian type. Streams after heavy rains provide adventure and a test of good judgment; some explore mountain streams; compete in canoe trials or train for Olympic events. On the coast, canoe surfing is popular, but, nonetheless hazardous."
