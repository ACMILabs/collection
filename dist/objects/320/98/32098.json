        "A look at the child abuse problem from the desperate parents' point of view. Barbara, a mother of two small children, is accused of abusive behaviour and in danger of having her baby taken from her by the courts. We see Barbara's State-assigned case worker, struggling to help the distraught mother come to grips with her problem. An adapted case history which uses scenes from an actual counselling workshop for child abuse parents."
