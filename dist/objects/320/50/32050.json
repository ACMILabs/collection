        "Stanley Burns, entrepreneur and thinker, decides to export Australiana to Japan and so, being the astute businessman he is, sets out to understand the inscrutable Japanese. This amusing comedy makes many allusions to Japanese film classics including a Samurai duel, a la Kurosawa, where the protagonists use chop-sticks instead of swords. Basically a satire on the enigma of Japanese culture as seen through western eyes. Cast: Roger Pulvers, Howard Stanley, Chong Weng Hoo, Ue Kyogo, Amanda Ma."
