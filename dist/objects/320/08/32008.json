        "Light-hearted animation describes methods of finding oil. Geologists can deduce the presence of a favourable underground formation from surface observations, and the geophysicist can then site a well, with some accuracy, by plotting the actual shape of the underground strata. Describes drilling and sampling operations which give access to the imprisoned oil."
