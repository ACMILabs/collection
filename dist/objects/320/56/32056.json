        "Arabs thoroughbred horses on a Polish stud farm: from the slow opening of horses stirring against a dawn sky, the movement of the horses speeds up in the bright sun and heat of the day followed by a quiet interlude by a river. Film ends with a peaceful shot of horses being led back to the farm. Interesting use of natural sound."
