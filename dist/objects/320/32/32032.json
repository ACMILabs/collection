        "The tourist attractions of Norfolk Island. Today tourists can fly to Norfolk Island for the scenery and the simplicity of an island holiday amongst volcanic ridges and sub-tropical vegetation where they can enjoy fishing, golfing, surfing and other sports. There are also reminders to be seen of the island's historic past: ruins of convict buildings and stables, Bloody Bridge, and St. Barnabas Chapel built by the Melanesian Mission."
