        "Archival footage and commercials provide a history of oil and oil by-products, and of the creation of the petro-chemical industry. Man has developed a frightening dependence on oil. Not only do oil by-products keep him warm and mobile, they help to feed, clean, clothe and entertain him. The film makes the point that there is yet no substitute for oil."
