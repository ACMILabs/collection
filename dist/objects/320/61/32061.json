        "This film offers a persuasive call to action and an invitation to all Canadians to take advantage of what they have so much of - the finest ski conditions in the world. How easy it is to start and the highly qualified help available are demonstrated as the film follows a family of four who discover the pleasures of skiing as a family sport."
