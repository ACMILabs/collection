        "A group of young children are approached by an older friend Jim, who offers them a choice. Disgusted with the taste and curious about why people smoke they set out in their neighbourhood and study people who smoke. They stumble across a smoking machine and examine its insides to discover what smoking does to the inside of one's body."
