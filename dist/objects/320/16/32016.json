        "An exploration of three of Canada's National Parks; Fundy, Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton Highlands, all on the Atlantic coast, where, by filmmaker's licence' boy meets girl, marries and has a family, all while enjoying the park's many other rewards for autocampers. Even the girl's little white car, which leads us to the parks at the outset, seems to run on the pure air and the anticipation of fresh adventures around the next turn."
