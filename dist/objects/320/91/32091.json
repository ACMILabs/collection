        "This film describes the animator's personal view of the universe. Abstract landscapes evolve into strange, god-like figures whose images revert into landscapes. The movements are slow and dreamy. The product of an eclectic imagination, this universe draws on historical, literary, and classical sources to illustrate man's close ties with nature. Awards: Eight including Ottawa; New York; Columbus; London; Los Angeles; Annecy."
