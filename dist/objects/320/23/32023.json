        "The life of the cowboy, filmed through the seasons on Canada's biggest cattle ranch near Kanloops, British Colombia. With musical accompaniment by American folk singer Peter Seeger and narration by Frances Hyland, 'Cattle Ranch' presents a vividly dramatic picture of the open range where a cowboy is king, where calves are born, live with the herd for a time in the splendour of mountain meadows, then join the trek to the city abattoir. Awards: Locarno; Rome; Vancouver; Montreal"
