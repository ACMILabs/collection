        "A collection of tapestries designed and sewn by the filmmaker, Bettina Matzkuhn, illustrate the lyrics of a song about a young girl's hometown. Animation is created through a combination of sewing and cinematic techniques. The needlework, done in a naive style, is well suited to the bright colours and varied textures of the work. A lively film designed to promote interest in the art of tapestry"
