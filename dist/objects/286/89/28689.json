        "This film studies the problem of building rigid brick and masonry houses on troublesome soils, such as clay soils, which swell and shrink due to seasonal wetting and drying. Soil identification gives the key to data on the physical properties and bearing capacity of various soils. These properties determine the correct foundation practice which will prevent cracking and disfiguration. The film is intended primarily for architects and engineers."
