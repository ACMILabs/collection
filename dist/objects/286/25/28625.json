        "Forest fire in mountainous British Columbia, as experienced by the men who must try to quench it from the air and at close quarters on the ground. Over half of fire outbreaks occur through carelessness, and this film affords a close, vivid view of the result: a whole mountainside turned into a searing, crackling holocaust until nothing remains but grey, desolate waste--mute reproach to all who travel or work in the forests. (Awards: Berlin; Belgrade.)"
