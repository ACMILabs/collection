        "This film shows briefly how conservation farming methods may prevent further destruction of the nation's soil and water resources. It emphasises that proper land use is the basis of conservation farming, and shows how several of the best common conservation practices are applied to land, eg contouring, terracing, strip-cropping, cover-cropping, rotation, and tree and grass planting."
