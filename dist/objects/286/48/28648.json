        "Snow has a kind of life: it changes form or \"ripens,\" its very whiteness serves a purpose. In this film you see frost crystals forming in the upper atmosphere, delicate filigree flakes that, settling on the ground, by sheer weight of numbers clog our roads and driveways. The film shows why powder snow is a favorite of skiers, and why corn snow may, in high places, warn of developing avalanches."
