        "Episode of Series \"Psychology Today\". Discusses psychological concepts applicable to the social problems arising from the school bussing of black children to previously all white schools. Interesting juxtaposition between the integrated classroom, and interviews with those who are opposed to bussing black children to all white schools. Emphasises the skill of the classroom teacher in being aware of preserving a positive self-image among the black children."
