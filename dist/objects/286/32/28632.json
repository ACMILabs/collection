        "Stressing the importance of forest products to Tasmania, this film deals with the causes of forest firest and methods of control. Shows how each township has its own volunteer Rural Fire Organisation, supplemented by the fire-fighting resources of the Forestry Department - cooperation to keep Tasmania green. The main causes of fire are smoldering cigarette butts, camp fires left unattended, and the deliberate burning of dry grass."
