        "The sparrows of Saigon of the opening song refer to the thousands of homeless and injured children of this city, who are both victims of the war or whose already miserable condition the war has worsened. Orphanages and hospitals provide some of these children with food and care. Various nurses and organisers in these places, speak about the children, their work, and children are shown as they talk, play or are treated."
