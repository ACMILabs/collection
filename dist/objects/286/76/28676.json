        "Episode of Series \"Adolescent Development\". A document on the lives of fictitious Bob and Mary, focusing on the teen years. Here, lovestruck Mary is in her \"hangout\" stage when she always has a need to be \"more sophisticated than she actually is.\" Cross to Bob where his mother discovers a crude naughty drawing in his room and narrator Lorne Greene croons: \"It became apparent that his interest in girls was getting to be more than casual.\" But happily, Mary has maintained her virginal purity: \"They knew that this time it was for keeps.\" says Greene as the two gaze at a window display of refrigerators. But the couple refuse to succumb to temptation until they're married."
