        "Sokhodoera is a rice growing village located in the state of Bihar, North Eastern India. The filmmakers of this beautifully photographed documentary arrived in the village a year after it had suffered the worst famine in its history, gaining an insight into the lifestyle of the people of Sokhodoera, revealing an India that is vastly different to the impressions offered by those who visit the cities of India. The film focuses on Mahadev, an \"untouchable\" who obtained and developed his farm with the help of a neighbouring ashram, highlighting his lifestyle and his role in his community."
