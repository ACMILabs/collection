        "An unusual safety film without spoken commentary, tracing the complete story of one particular accident involving a young cyclist. We follow the ambulance over icy roads to the accident, the return journey to the hospital where examination, x-ray and operation take place. Only when the girl's companion visits the hospital do we learn that carelessness was the cause."
