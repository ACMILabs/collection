        "A freight train becomes snowbound in the West-Morland hills in Northern England. The Motive Power, Operating and Engineering Departments of British Transport go to work with snow-ploughs to reach the trapped train. Working through the night the team dig clear, and thaw out moving parts, and finally two engines help to clear the line."
