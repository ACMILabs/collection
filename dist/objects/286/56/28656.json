        "Records the construction of a new dam and power station as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Before the building of the dam could begin, a tunnel had to be constrcuted to divert the waters of the river. Blizzards, a swollen river and sub-zero temperatures did not deter the Norwegian contractors and on 23rd April 1955, the Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, officially opened the power station and operated the switch which set the turbines in motion."
