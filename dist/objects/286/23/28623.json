        "The fun and fascination of puppetry. Based on the work of Edith Munay, who pioneered the teaching of puppetry to Australian children. The wide range of interest includes the puppets to make, their clothes, the story to be thought of, the play to be worked out, the manipulation, the gestures and voices of the characters; glove puppets, animal puppets, rod puppets and marionettes, all are shown in this introduction to puppetry."
