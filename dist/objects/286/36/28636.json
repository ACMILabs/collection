        "Examines the problem of smoking from a medical and sociological standpoint, avoiding scare tactics and preaching. Excerpts from the Surgeon-General's Report, an animated drawing of lung function and an explanation by Dr James Sherman substantiate the case against smoking. Traces smoking from its Spanish heritage, through the Middle East, to the New World and updates the course of events by analogies to the pollution problem. Presented by James Brolin."
