        "From the height of the Rockies on the rim of the western plains, the film catches and condenses the astounding spectacle of a day in the life of the sky. Photographed with many kinds of lenses and at different camera speeds, the result is a cinematographic experience of rare beauty - every changing mood of the sky is vividly registered. Film without words."
