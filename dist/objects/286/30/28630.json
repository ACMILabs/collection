        "As close to a dramatic feature as the Eameses ever got in this tribute commissioned for the 125th anniversary of the Smithsonian Institution. Dramatises the early history and development of the Smithsonian Institution, which began with the unusual bequest of Englishman James Smithson. Traces the growth of the Smithsonian from a small research centre and repository of museum collections to its modern position. In addition to the dramatic recreation, this film also uses paintings, sculpture and other works of art to recreate the period. Narrated by Alistair Cooke, prologue by Walter Cronkite, advice and counsel by John Houseman. Appearing are Ronald Long, Arnold Moss and Alan Napier."
