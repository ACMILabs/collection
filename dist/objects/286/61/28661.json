        "During one of the periodic slumps in the British Film Industry, Adrian Brunel produced several satires on \"film\" types. This one describes the trials of a film producer, the hunt for a financier, shows some of the \"technicians\" and actors (such as the great Rhubarb Vaselino), and concludes with an excerpt from the production of a harrowing drama. Other credits include: Camera artist - S.L.U. Lloyd, Electrical effects - John D'Arc, Scenario - Saimole Story."
