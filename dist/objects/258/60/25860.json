        "Demonstrates British child centred methods of teaching mathematics to children aged five to seven. The film's point is that maths includes all activities if teachers know where to look for opportunities to teach it, using experiences that interest and totally involve the children. Writer John Krish for the Nuffield Mathematics Teaching Project. Explores thematic approach to mathematics. Begins with an in-service program for infant teachers. They construct a mural and then proceed to discover maths in it. A class teacher in a school situation then adopts the same approach using the theme 'buses'."
