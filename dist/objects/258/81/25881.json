        "Mayurakshi Dam covering 3,500 acres in West Bengal utilises for irrigation and power, monsoon rain water once wasted. Government reclamation of 4,000 acres of waste land and establishment of model colonies with electricity and telephones enable relocation of displaced farmers, whose land, watered regularly, produced good harvests. West Bengal's vast agricultural region looks forward to higher yields from newly vitalised land."
