        "An analysis of some of the problems which arise during the first year of marriage. Outlines adjustments by the married couple to learn to live together: Feeling and acting as a couple rather than as individuals; learning to accept and fulfil new roles, adjusting differences in background; recognizing and accepting personality differences; perceiving and caring for the needs of one another; adjustment to become a member of a new family group; recognising one's own parents are also in-laws; assuming responsibility in financial matters and in the management of the home."
