        "A modern version of the original experiment showing the wave behaviour of the electron diffraction patterns on a fluorescent screen, making the patterns understandable in terms of wave behaviour by presenting an optical analogue showing almost identical patterns. Describes the electron diffraction experiments of Sir George Thompson and presents brief evidence for the wave behaviour of other particles, such as neutrons and helium atoms."
