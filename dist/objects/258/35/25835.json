        "In live interviews, people with differing backgrounds and attitudes examine \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" roles in society during the 1970's. In the wake of feminism as a social context of the time (1970), this film examines how the explicit boundaries dividing masculinity and femininity have become increasingly blurred. Areas looked at are work, domesticity and marriage."
