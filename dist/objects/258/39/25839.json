        "By means of mobile X-Ray units it is possible to take radiograms of large numbers of people I a relatively short time. These photographs are then examined by expert radiologists, and diagnoses made. In this film, the visit of a mobile X-Ray unit to a British factory is shown. (The film is intended for use by Medical Officers and Health and Welfare Officers when they are planning to send a mobile X-Ray unit to a place not previously visited). Also made for the prevention of tuberculosis. Narrated by Lionel Gamlin."
