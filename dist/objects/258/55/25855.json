        "Part of the record collected by a French research unit studying the effects of mernal deprivation in young children. Those studied are between one and two-and-a-half years old. All had been reared in institutions where because of impersonal care they had become seriously impaired in the capacity for human relationship. The film shows the disorders that appear and the subsequent progress of the children under psychotherapy. A study carried out by a French research unit directed by Jenny Rondinesco."
