        "In today's classrooms various new ways are being tried to put children more at ease with numbers. This film sows one of them - a system developed by a Belgian schoolmaster, Georges Cuisenaire, who made sets of coloured sticks carefully designed to help children grasp simple mathematical relationships. As his method is demonstrated in a Montreal classroom we see how children 'get the feel' of numbers right from the start and advance confidently from the concrete to the abstract mathematical concepts. With children of StGeorges School, Montreal."
