        "Using authentic locations, quotations, and re-enactments, this biography provides a background to the study of the work of Mark Twain. The variety and color of Twain's boyhood on the Mississippi are shown to be a source of his major writings; his other works, as well, are seen to reflect the rich and zestful life of this journalist, yarnspinner and humourist."
