        "Shows scenes in a rural village in Britain, thatching, cobbling, blacksmithing and a home workshop for spinning and weaving to illustrate the early use of hand tools and the domestic system. The film then describes briefly the inventions which fostered the growth of the factory system; the change-over to steam-power; the new process for refining iron ore. The film states common problems of industry today."
