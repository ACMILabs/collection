        "Episode of Series \"The Kindergarten child series\". To start the afternoon at kindergarten children here are encouraged to move about freely without adult intervention in the classroom in order to unwind and release tension. Some of the activities involve playing with hoops, bouncing balls, and hop-scotch. The teacher checks attendance by having the children select the letters of their name and form an appropriate sentence such as \"Marica is here\". Freedom of activity is encouraged in the afternoon program."
