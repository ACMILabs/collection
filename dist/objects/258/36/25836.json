        "The mounting terror of Edgar Allen Poe's classic tale has been captured in this beautiful hand painted animated short. Count Prospero has locked himself and his decadent court inside his castle as a protection against the plague which is devastating the countryside. The castle ball is interrupted by a seductive woman who entices the count further and further through the luxurious rooms of the castles. At the end, in a passionate embrace, Prospero discovers that the mysterious guest is in fact the plague. Screenplay adapted by Z. Gasparovic and B. Ranitovic."
