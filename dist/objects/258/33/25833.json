        "A look at the famed African warrior tribe, the Masai, noted for their height and lack of Negroid features. The women are viewed going about their household tasks and preparing materials for the building of a new home. The Masai now have peaceful trading relations with neighbouring tribes whereas before, when weapons were carried in the market-place there were bloody battles at trading sites."
