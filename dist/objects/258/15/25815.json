        "A film about market day in an old Nottinghamshire town. The roads leading to the town are full of traffic, for the country people are bringing their cattle, poultry, fruit and vegetables and other farm produce to market. At the market, farmers show each other sample of grain, crowd the cattle market, and sit about talking of the weather and the prices of the crops - the subject farmers everywhere talk about."
