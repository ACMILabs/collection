        "An experiment toward the interpretation of a personal vision. Opens with an unusual sequence in which various people comment on Tobey's abstract paintings on exhibition. The artist is shown in his studio and against the background of the city of Seattle. A poetic voice-over narration accompanies various images suggesting the personal vision of the artist, so that this film emphasises the inner rather than the outer life of the artist. Photographed by William Heick, with narration by Robert Gardner and Mark Tobey."
