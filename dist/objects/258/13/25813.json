        "Hal Holbrook's clever impersonation of Mark Twain is shown in this recreation of an interview with the American author. Holbrook's amazing physical resemblance to Twain and his skill in reproducing the author's mannerisms are combined with the witty and pungent dialogue which characterised Twain's writing."
