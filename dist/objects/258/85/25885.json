        "A modern French village is used to show the characteristics of the feudal system and the importance of the castle, church and pastoral lands during these times. Details of the construction of castles are used to explain the purposes served by the more important parts of the castle such as the moat, the drawbridge, the courtyard, stables for horses, wells for water, the big tower or donjon and the thick outer and inner walls. Tapestries in castles show scenes depicting hunting, chivalry, knights and nobles. The function of the church and the responsibility of abbots and bishops in caring for the land are explained. Models and sketches illustrate the organization of the feudal manor and show how traces of the feudal system are still to be found in Modern France."
