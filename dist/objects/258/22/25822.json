        "Incidents from the life of a young married couple portray the results of a treacherous imagination and a lack of faith and understanding in a marriage relationship. Stresses the importance of continuous self-appraisal and indicates that a basic change of attitude is often necessary in order to uproot a tendency to distort and dramatize insignificant conjectures."
