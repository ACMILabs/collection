        "The world's 600 million Muslims are expected to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lives. The film traces the ritual of the progress from Medina to Mecca, during which various rites are performed at the stopping places. A glimpse is given of the catering arrangements for 1,500,000 people, mostly men. The pilgrims enter the great Mosque where the sacred Ka'aba stands, centre of their devotions."
