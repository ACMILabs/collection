        "A record of Mark Twain's America, using contemporary engravings and photographs. Mark Twain as the storyteller describes the atmosphere as he saw American history during his lifetime. The narration is taken in part from the writings of Twain and his contemporaries. Originally televised in the series \"Project 20\", this is one of the longest films yet made based entirely on still photographs and prints. Credits include script by Richard Hanser, music by Robert Russell Bennett, narrated by Howard Lindsay and edited by Silvio D'Alisera."
