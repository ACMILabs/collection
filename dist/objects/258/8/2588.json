        "Shocked takes takes you on a psychological journey with Jessica and you are asked to determine her future. Jessica's perfect perfect world crumbles after the birth of her first child. The increasing pace and often chaotic nature of the interface and soundscape matches the chaotic world that Jessica inhabits. Shocked; game-like in its interactivity, is so real it makes you question your own values, and is so compelling you won't be able to stop."
