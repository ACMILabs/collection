        "Episode of Series \"College Physics\". The toothed-wheel method of Fizeau is described with the aid of a moving light beam. Modification of this method, due to Michelson, is explained by reflecting the light beam from a rotating eight-sided mirror. Motion is slow enough so that the path of light may be understood at all times."
