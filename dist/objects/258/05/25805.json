        "Looks at Marigoli, a village area of equatorial Africa, and the problems caused by a rapidly expanding population. There is reluctance by the women to use birth control, because of the expectancy of a high mortality rate amongst their children. Food was once plentiful, but is now scarce due to the rapid expansion of population and the reduction of arable land. Also looks at the expense of education for children."
