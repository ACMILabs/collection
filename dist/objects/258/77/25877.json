        "The wedding of H.R.H. Princess Margaret with Mr Antony Armstrong-Jones in Westminster Abbey on 6th May 1960. Records the enthusiasm and celebrations of the London crowds. Follows the Princess from her home at Clarence House, through the solemnity and splendour of the marriage ceremony, back with her bridegroom along the processional route to Buckingham Palace, and out from the Port of London in the Royal Yacht \"Britannia\" on the first stage of the Caribbean honeymoon. Commentary by Michael Redgrave."
