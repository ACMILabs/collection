        "This film explains the principles of measurement with light waves, the nature of light waves; the reflection and refraction of monochromatic light by a glass surface; the use of these bands in ultra-precision measurement; and their translation into millionths of an inch. The film then goes on to demonstrate the procedures in gauge block inspection, the comparison of gauge blocks for height; the meaning of circular and parallel bands on gauge surfaces; the precautions necessary in measurement with light waves; and the inspection procedures followed."
