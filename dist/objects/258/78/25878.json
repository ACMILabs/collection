        "The discoveries of archaeologists shows the high degree of civilization attained by the Maya people centuries ago. The Maya developed their own system of hieroglyphic writing and astronomers devised a calendar. A few Yucatecans still live in thatched huts, but most now live in modern cities. New industries are being researched and developed; transport systems improved; and greater emphasis placed on education. A new civilization is growing in this ancient land."
