        "Using a cathode ray tube encircled by a current carrying a loop of wire, measurements are taken which enable the demonstrator to calculate the mass of the electron with reference to the Millikan Experiment. The calculations are brought out in detail step by step. Part of a course in physics for Secondary Schools by Prof. Eric M. Rogers, Princeton University."
