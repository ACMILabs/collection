        "An experiment in film animation, visualising a well-known military march in geometric, abstract patterns of colour. Bold hues move, march, blend and separate in a dynamic pattern of mobile forms, transporting into colour and shape the sound patterns of the accompanying music. This film made by Guy Glover, without use of a camera."
