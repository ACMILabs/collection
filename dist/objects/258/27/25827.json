        "Episode of Series \"Man Alive\". The man, the woman - and the children - of broken marriages. Second-hand people? Or is it just the way everyone else treats them? What happens when a marriage is finally over? Who suffers most? And what chance of a new life is there for men and women who have been \"put asunder?\" Today more marriages than ever end in divorce courts but the bitterness does not always stop with divorce, and children sometimes become the ammunition between parted parents."
