    "description": [
        "An interactive CD-ROM produced as part of Victorian College of the Arts Interactive Media degree. 'Wedding' allows an interactive exploration of different characters at a wedding. A wide range of permuations are generated as the user selects characters to interact with each other; triggering recorded conversations and short movie pieces.  \"Wedding explores behaviours and expectations that seem to be exclusively associated with weddings. Not only from the bride, but from her friends and family as well - it seemed that weddings stil retain much of their symbolic power in people's imagination. 'Wedding' uses interactivity to give the user the chance to explore a non-linear situationwith characters that they choose and identify with or are interested in\"."
