        "Episode of Series \"Pacemakers\". Nervi is first and foremost a master craftsman, but he also has an original and revolutionary creative mind. He has an obsession for what he believes to be the supreme building material - a type of reinforced concrete. With it he has built some of the world's most famous buildings, faster and cheaper than anyone else. The buildings for the Rome Olympics, the Pirelli building in Milan, the Unesco building in Paris, have helped build Nervi's international reputation as a builder of tomorrow. Commentary written by Anthony Jay, spoken by Brian Redhead."
