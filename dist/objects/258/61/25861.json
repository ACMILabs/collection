        "Winton is an isolated town in central Queensland, whose history is associated with the writing of the song \"Waltzing Matilda\" by Banjo Patterson in 1895. Several people of the district including the postmaster, a woman on a station, a station owner and a truck driver, talk about life at Winton. The work of the mail contractor and post office are shown. Devised by Rob Gerrand for Australia Post."
