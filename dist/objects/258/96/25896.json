        "Shows several models of both bulk motion and random motion of molecules; their interconnection as the energy of bulk motion. Demonstrates random motion and how it can average out to a smooth effect. Shows model of thermal conduction. Demonstrates a model using dry ice disc and small steel balls in which bulk mechanical energy of the disc is converted to 'thermal' energy of random motion of the balls. Explains the origin of the absolute temperature scale."
