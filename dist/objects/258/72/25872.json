        "Much has been said about the predicament of the blue-collar worker in the automated world of industry. This film is about a similar threat to the white-collar worker in the business world. It portrays a situation in a company where computer methods are about to be introduced to take over much of the paperwork, consequently \"making surplus\" a number of responsible, long-time employees. The film poses the problem from the points of view of both management and of the employees concerned. Awards: New York; Antwerp; Knokke"
