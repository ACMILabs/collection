        "In Internal Tantrum, Palestine sits before the camera with a severe expression of concentration, his body tense and his fists tightly wound. He begins to slowly chant and sway, evoking a powerful sense of grief and pain. He writes that the tape provides 'a reading, like on the Richter Scale, of a certain kind of emotional internal roller coaster or earthquake. I used only one tone so the deliverance of energy becomes directly articulated in the sound.' This performance is a simple yet intense rendering of pain, and the desire to move that pain outward from the internal."
