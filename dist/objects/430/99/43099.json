        "Jeremiah Chechik's remake of the French classic, \"Les Diaboliques\" by Henri-Georges Clouzot, didn't quite receive the acclaim of the original. Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani star as Nicole and Mia, the long suffering lover and wife of the cruel and manipulative headmaster Guy (Chazz Palminteri). Nicole is angry at being taken for granted and Mia, who suffers from a heart problem, is suicidal over her husband's infidelity. Together they devise a foolproof scheme to rid their lives of Guy and all seems to have gone to plan until events occur that indicate Guy has survived. Hot on his tail is a disgruntled cop, Kathy Bates, who is sympathetic to the women's situation but also eager to discover the truth."
