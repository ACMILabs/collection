        "Cinemagazine items: 1. An introduction to \"Oil Review\" stressing the importance of oil in modern economy. 2. Main line diesel engine: the story of a new diesel locomotive which pulls the famous British train, \"Royal Scot\", on its journey from London to Glasgow. 3. Tractor transition: the story of the advantages gained by the development of tractor design to the point where many and varied farm implements become an integral part of the tractor, instead of the tractor being merely a mechanised draught animal pulling a separate implement or machine."
