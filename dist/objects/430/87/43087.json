        "Reckless Kelly is a biker, a republican, a video rental addict, a man of the 90's and the last of the great bank-robbing gang left to right the wrongs of the world. And he's doing it his way; holding up autoteller machines and re-depositing the money into the bank accounts of the poor. Good overcomes evil and justice conquers corruption, when our legendary armour-clad hero ventures from the outback of Australia and heads off to the wild world of Hollywood and Las Vegas. Backed by a hit soundtrack featuring INXS, Divinyls, Yothu Yindi and Mental as Anything. Cast includes Yahoo Serious, Melora Hardin, Alexei Sayle, Hugo Weaving, Kathleen Freeman, John Pinette, Bob Maza."
