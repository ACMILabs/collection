        "A detailed and critical analysis of the anicent group of archaic rocks known as Stonehenge near Salisbury in the south of England. In the light of latest archeological discoveries at Stonehenge, the film reconstructs the ring of stones as it must have appeared after its completion between three and four thousand years ago. It also explains the origin and method of moving the blue-stones, the boulders of the outer circle and trilithons. Models are used to illustrate the probable method of erecting the stones. Finally some idea of the purpose of the complete structure is given."
