        "This is the fifth in the series of five videos tracing the story of steam locomotives during the middle years of the 20th century. In this episode we look at the 1960's to see the end of steam locomotion on the public railway network in Great Britain. We see the last years of main line steam, the cruel blows of the Beeching \"axe\", we see many branch lines destroyed forever, and the scrapping of their trains. Main line electrification and dieselisation would make even the famous \"Duchesses\", \"Kings\" and \"Bulleid Pacifics\" redundant. However, a small gleam of light appeared on the horizon as railway preservation got underway, but after 11 August 1968 only one steam locomotive, the Flying Scotsman, was allowed to see out the decade working on the main lines. Narrated by Ken Morgan."
