        "Although he was one of the most famous public figures of this century, Richard Nixon remains a puzzle to many, his decisions and behaviour often shrouded in mystery. Without using a linear chronology, Stone presents many key events from the former leader's life ranging from his impoverished Quaker boyhood in California and his tense relationship with his hyper-critical father to his involvement in the Watergate affair that led to his eventual downfall. Stone offers an extraordinary portrait of America's controversial president, a man who desperately craved public acceptance yet never received it."
