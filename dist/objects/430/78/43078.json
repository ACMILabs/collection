        "Paul Hogan is Lightning Jack Kane, an outlaw of legendary status, a bank robber who can shoot the eye out of a needle at 50 paces, a gunfighter quicker on the draw than Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday - if only everyone else knew it! Co-starring Cuba Gooding Jnr as his mute sidekick and Beverly D'Angelo as the sultry saloon Madam, this is a comedy about two outlaws who just wanted to be wanted. This film is unique as it was the first Hollywood production to be floated on the stock market to raise the necessary production funds, with investors reaping a percentage of the profits, which unfortunately were not as much as expected."
