        "A light-hearted impression in music, words and pictures of the many different sporting activities enjoyed by young and old throughout Britain. It stresses the need for the opportunities to learn sport and its value as a character-builder. Professional sportsmen throughout the country have the same love of the game and sense of fair play which is acknowledged all over the world. Closing sequences of the film show international teams playing football, epitomising the goodwill which is promoted by sport and sportsmen between people and nations of every land."
