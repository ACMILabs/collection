        "Film report from a Canadian scientific expedition that put a plastic bubble on the floor of the Arctic Ocean to serve as workshop and rest station for scientists working below the Arctic ice. What it took, in both planning and on-the-spot improvisation, to chop through the heavy ice, and to lower and anchor the huge dome in place in the dark and cold of Resolute Bay, is fully illustrated by film and commentary. French language - no subtitles. (Award: Bordeaux.)"
