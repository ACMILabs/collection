        "Adrian, Rik, Nigel and Christopher are back with their unique brand of humor. This tape features three episodes originally screened in 1982. Including; \"Oil\"; The young ones move into their new house, a house flanked by a talking statue at the front door. The episode culminates in a worker's revolution and a benefit concert; \"Boring\"; The young ones' perception of boring is curiously warped as their day is marked by a terrorist siege, a fairytale world that appears when they sleep, Neil digging himself a grave, and Vyv chopping his finger off; \"Flood\"; While London floods, Rik plays hide and seek, Vyv sets Rik's sociology file on fire, Mike's room is filled with lions and landlord Alexei Sayle pays a visit as an axe wielding maniac. Features a performance from Madness."
