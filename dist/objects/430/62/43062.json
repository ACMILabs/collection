        "A Jewish-Russian hitman, Joshua Shapira (Tim Roth) returns to his family in Brighton Beach, New York, on a job. The town is referred to as 'Little Odessa', so called because of the influence of the Russian mob. Joshua is not a welcome presence as he disappeared in disgrace years ago for his reputation as a hitman, only his younger brother Reuben (Edward Furlong) and terminally ill mother (Vanessa Redgrave) welcome his presence. Joshua must lay low as rumours spread around of his arrival and neither Joshua or his familyn are safe from the violence that's brewing in Little Odessa. Cast also includes Maximilian Schell, Moira Kelly and Paul Guilfoyle."
