        "Through the centuries people of many diferent nations have come to Canada, and, in settling there, have added their national traditions to Canada's. Tolerance, mutual understanding and compromise between differing points of view have cemented people with diverse backgrounds into a hard-working, self-reliant, nation. Mines, farms, fisheries and industries have grown from the collective efforts of the Canadians. Includes historical footage of rural Quebec. Narrated by Rupert Caplan."
