        "Squadron Leader Peter Carter (David Niven), is caught between two worlds, reality, and the other which exists in his imagination that has been contaminated by war. As his plane travels over the English Channel in a ball of fire, he prepares to jump without a parachute. In what he believes are his final moments he shares his feelings on love and poetry with an American WAC, Kim Hunter. After he lands ashore he meets the WAC and they fall in love. All seems well, but a case of concussion causes Carter to experience hallucinations in which he finds himself on trial within his imaginary world. This film also features Raymond Massey, Roger Livesey and Richard Attenbourough. Also known as \"Stairway to heaven\". Earthbound sequences are filmed in technicolour and Heaven sequences in black and white."
