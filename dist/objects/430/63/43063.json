        "Richard Harris gives a superb performance as Yorkshire coal miner Frank Machin, who dreams of achieving public acclaim by making a name for himself on the City Rugby team. He performs with tenacity and aggressiveness and earns a place on the team as well as 1000 pounds. His desire of being well liked extends to his personal life as he seeks the approval and affections of his widowed landlady Mrs Hammond (Rachel Roberts). After initial resistance the two become lovers and it is at this physical level that their relationship remains. When Frank's friend marries, Mrs Hammond is racked with bitterness about her relationship and Frank responds in the only way he knows how, with violence. As tragedy strikes, Frank is left only with his sporting life. Also starring Colin Blakely, Alan Badel and William Hartnell and adapted by David Storey from his own novel."
