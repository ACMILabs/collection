        "Three black and white episodes of the classic BBC series about a father and son team of Junk-merchants, and bastions of bad taste, written by Alan Simpson and Ray Galton. In \"Piano\", a wealthy collector wants Harold to remove his wife's 'Joanna' from the top of a large block of flats. Any normal man would refuse. In \"Bath\", Harold invites a 'bird' for cocktails and arrives home to find his Dad eating pickles in the bath in the middle of the lounge room. A bit of a social stigma, to say the least. In \"The Holiday\", Harold decides to change their usual holiday destination from Mrs Clifford's at Bognor Regis to France, if only he can break the news to his father!"
