        "The composer who creates symphonic music must still rely on the efforts of many other musicians for a performance of his work; and the conductor of the orchestra which is to perform a symphonic work is largely responsible for the interpretation placed on the work of the composer whose work they are to play. In this film, the function of the various choirs of the orchestra is demonstrated, as Howard Barlow conducts the Columbia Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" and the Prelude to Act III of \"Lohengrin\"."
