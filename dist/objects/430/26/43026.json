        "Willy's best friend, Jesse (Jason James Richter), is working with his mentor Randolph (August Schellenberg) monitoring whales off the Pacific Northwest coast. He befriends a young boy, Max, who shares Jesse's love for whales. Max's fisherman father however possesses a mysterious secret linked to the depleting orca population and it is up to Jesse and Max to embark on a rescue mission to save the whales. An entertaining family movie that is as much about whale conservation as it is about two boys love for whales. Also starring Annie Corley, Vincent Berry and Patrick Kilpatrick."
