        "Sean Casey (Andy Garcia), a cop turned lawyer is landed the coveted position of D.A. when he wins a highly publicised case that resulted in the death of 3 police officers and the serious wounding of Casey's father, also a policeman. The case is marked by dirty cops and corruption and as Casey begins his new appointment he discovers that truth was not really the victor during the trail, but was justice and honesty served? Casey must decide on a balance between the confusing concepts of truth, honesty, justice, loyalty and morality. Based on the novel, \"Tainted evidence\" by Robert Daley. Cast also includes Ian Holm, Lena Olin and Paul Guilfoyle."
