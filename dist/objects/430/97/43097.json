        "Edward Henry Machin (Alec Guinness), Denry for short, has been determined from youth to master his own fate. He uses his powers of persuasion and deception to cajole his way to fame and fortune, but still manages to remain friends with everyone. Affectionately known as 'The Card', Denry's ultimate coup occurs when he becomes the youngest mayor of his home town of Bursley. Denry is not without female companionship, and his life is influenced by three women; a Countess, a dancing teacher, and the councillor's daughter. It is through his relationship with these women that his deceptive ways are exposed. Also starring Glynis Johns, Valerie Hobson and Petula Clark. Based on the novel by Arnold Bennett and screenplay by Eric Ambler. Also known as \"The Promoter\"."
