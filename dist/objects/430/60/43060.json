        "Demi Moore stars as Hester Prynne, a sensual, spirited young woman who arrives in a small Puritan town in New England to prepare a home for the upcoming arrival of her husband. There she meets the sensitive and appealing town minister, Rev. Dimmesdale (Gary Oldman), with whom she shares an undeniable attraction. When events soon reveal that Hester's husband has been attacked by Indians and is presumed dead, neither Hester nor Dimmesdale can suppress their feelings anymore and a forbidden affair ignites. Upon discovering Hester is pregnant, the intolerant townspeople brand her an adulteress and, when she refuses to reveal the identity of her lover, they force her to wear a scarlet letter \"A\" on her dress as a brand of shame. Loosely based on the novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne."
