        "Three comedy classics from 1975 interspersed with original news clips on the year's major events. In \"Porridge - Just desserts\" this classic episode of what is arguably the greatest British sitcom ever, Ronnie Barker stars as the cynical, prison-weary Fletcher who utters the immortal line 'there is a thief among us' as his pilfered tin of pineapple chunks goes missing. \"Sykes\" has been described as the first great BBC sitcom. This famous episode finds Eric Sykes, Hattie Jacques and Deryck Guyler on holiday in Germany with Eric still keen to remind his hosts just who won the war! \"The Two Ronnies\", for 17 years they ruled the comedy roost. This show, from their mid-1970's peak contains all the favourite ingredients."
