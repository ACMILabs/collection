        "Filmed in the predominantly anglophone, upper middle-class Montreal riding of Westmount during the months preceding Quebec's history-making election of November 15, 1976. 'I hate to lose' documents a play within a play, a brisk, natural drama that sparkles with humour. The camera follows closely behind leading political contenders George Springate, Nick Auf der Maur, and Harold 'Shorty' Fairhead, chronicling the unfolding of an election campaign on the local hustings, and gleaning retrospective insights into aglophone neglect of the Parti Quebecois's swelling popularity."
