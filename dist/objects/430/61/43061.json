        "Three episodes form the classic BBC series about students, anarchy and total political incorrectness. In \"Demolition\" fascists at the Town Hall want to demolish; why bother with Vyv around to do the business for them. \"Bomb\" sees a potentially explosive situation erupts when a bunch falls on the house... but worse, the TV licence man comes to call. In \"Sick\" there's bogeys on the blankets and snot on the sheets when Neal and the others come down with the worst colds in the history of civilization."
