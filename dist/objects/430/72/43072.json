        "By June 1941, Commonwealth forces were scattered across the Mediterranean and a German airborne invasion of Syria and Iraq threatened. Winston Churchill demanded action, and so a scratch force, including the Australian Seventh Division, was brought together under the command of John Lavarack, one of Australia's finest generals, to seize the initiative. His orders were to take Syria. Lavarack and his men would be pitted against the troops of Vichy France - once their allies on the Western Front in World War I, now their bitter enemies in this ancient land. This would be no easy campaign. This would prove to be the bloodiest five weeks of the whole war. Presented by Peter Watson."
