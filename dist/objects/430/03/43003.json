        "Just as people need layers of clothing to keep warm, so houses need layers of padding to trap warm air and keep it inside as long as possible. The Insulation Story describes how you can get ready for a more comfortable winter with insulation, the not-so-magic formula. The film shows how much of the work can be done by the home-owner at reasonable cost."
