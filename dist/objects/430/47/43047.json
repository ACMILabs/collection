        "This the second in the series of five videos tracing the story of steam locomotives during the middle of the 20th century. In this episode we look at the steam locomotive during the cold years of the depression. For the railways it was a period of austerity as they tried to meet the competition of the roads. The \"Big Four\" embarked on massive steam locomotive construction programs to replace the many different types inherited in 1923, although the Southern pursed electrification in order to eliminate steam. We visit familiar and not-so familiar locations to see steam at work, from the great main lines to the rural branches including Ireland which had 3 railways of its own and the Isle of Wight. Narrated by Ken Morgan."
