        "In John Carpenter's low-budget classic, the skeleton crew of a ghetto police station fights off a horde of street thugs who are seeking revenge against a locked-up prisoner. It's a 'Rio Bravo' for the lawless modern age; once the siege starts, the screen appears to explode in bullets and flying glass. The action is so raw it doesn't seem choreographed, so fast it doesn't seem plausible."
