        "Music by Giuseppe Verdi, libretto by Temistocle Solera after the play Nabucodonosor by Anicet-Bourgeois and Francis Cornue, Nabucco, based on the Old Testament story of Nebuchadnezzar, is a gripping tale of the Jewish people's fight for survival and of the lust for power and abuse of it by both Nabucco and his adopted daughter, Abigaille. Directed by Barrie Kosky, this is a highly inventive and modern version of the opera. With his usual ecclecticism, Kosky mixes cabaret and pantomime with modern theatre and opera, creating an energetic and powerful production. Elizabeth Connell is outstanding as the ambitious Abigail and Jonathan Summers excellent as Nabucco. There's a strong visual design by Peter Corrigan. Features singers Anson Austin (Ismaele), Rosemary Gunn (Fenena), Bruce Martin (Zaccaria), and The Australian Opera Chorus. Also features The State Orchestra of Victoria conducted by Carlo Felice Cillario. Recorded live at the State Theatre, Victorian Arts Centre on 7 May 1996 and produced for television in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Sung in Italian with English subtitles."
