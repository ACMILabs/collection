        "Episode of Series \"1914 - 1918 The Great War and the Shaping of a Century\". This is a seven part series from the BBC, looking at the Great War and the shaping of a century through the words of those who endured it. With the use of many diaries, letters and film we re-experience a war that involved the people of 5 continents. Narrated by Dame Judy Dench, we also hear voice-overs by Ian Richardson, Martin Landau, Wendy Craig, Tim Pigott-Smith, Chris Fairbanks, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, Tom Fleming, John Shrapnel, Malcolm McDowell and Imogen Stubbs reading passages from personal letters and diaries. Many historians including the series historian Dr. Jay Winter provide valuable background information relating to events and battles which occurred. Tape One-Explosion contains the first three episodes of this remarkable series. Episode 1-EXPLOSION, explores the cultural backdrop to the outbreak of war. Episode 2-STALEMATE, as the war began many experts thought technical advances in weaponry would bring a quick victory but armies resorted to trench warfare on the Western Front. Episode 3-TOTAL WAR, the battle at Gallipoli in 1915 confirmed that European conflict had expanded into the first truly global war. Many Empires and Nations would be forever changed, the social context altered and shattered, a lost generation of men and ideals. Such dramatic events that would shape and define peoples lives for the rest of the 20th Century."
