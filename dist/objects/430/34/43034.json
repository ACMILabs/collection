        "\u007fA backstage view of what it means to be a player in a celebrated theater company. Here is Canada's Stratford Company, with an all-star cast headed by William Hutt, on tour in Australia. It is a friendly, unaffected observation of what goes into a play, both on stage and behind the scenes, at rehearsals and informal social gatherings. Filmed at the Opera House in Sydney and the Festival Theatre in Adelaide, it provides a rare, behind-the-scene glimpse into the lives and times of the people in a professional theatre company. Director of photography: Ron Lowe."
