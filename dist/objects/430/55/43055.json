        "This is the fourth in the series of five videos tracing the story of steam locomotives during the middle of the 20th century. In this episode the steam locomotive was seen as an anachronism which had to be replaced by \"modern\" power. However, British Railways had over 20,000 steam engines at the beginning of the decade, to which it added a further 999 examples- the well known Standard types. We trace the last full decade of steam locomotive development by examing each of the regions of British Railways, setting the scene for steam's final years. Narrated by Ken Morgan."
