        "What if you had the chance to seek revenge for the crimes committed against you? Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver), is faced with this moral dilemma when she confronts who she believes was her tormentor; a sadistic doctor who subjected her to physical, sexual and mental abuse 15 years ago when she was held hostage by South American Government interrogators. Paulina leads a quiet and nervous lifestyle with her husband (Stuart Wilson). This shaky semblance of peace is disrupted when her husband is brought home by a good Samaritan (Ben Kingsley) when his car breaks down during a storm. Alarm bells ring when Paulina recognises the voice from her blindfolded ordeal. Her husband is not convinced he is the offender and as a lawyer is challenged by her to present a case against the conviction."
