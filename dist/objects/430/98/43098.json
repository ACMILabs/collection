        "Dirk Bogarde stars as Melville Farr, a successful lawyer in this film which caused a sensation at its original release. Farr is approached by police who are looking into the theft of money they suspect is being used as payment for blackmail by Jack Barrett (Peter McEnery). Farr initially denies knowing about Barrett because of their previous homosexual relations. Barrett eventually chooses suicide over disclosing the affair and Farr guiltily takes a personal interest in locating the blackmailer. He discovers that Barrett was not the only one being blackmailed, and Barrett must decide between exposing his homosexuality and threatening his career or challenging the legal system that decreed homosexuality a criminal offence and bringing Barrett's blackmailers to justice. Screenplay by Janet Green and John McCormick. Cast also includes Sylvia Syms, Dennis Price, Anthony Nicholls and Peter McEnery."
