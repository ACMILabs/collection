        "A combination of Mrs Brady and Murphy Brown, Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) is fiercely protective of her family, she will do anything to ensure their happiness, anything! She's an active member of the PTA, a devoted wife to her dentist husband and a great housekeeper. She is \"Super Mom\". Still waters, however, run deep and beneath the surface lies a multitude of secrets. Mom isn't all she's cracked up to be. Her son's teacher suddenly disappears after recommending therapy for the boy to deal with his obsession for gore. Her daughter's boyfriend winds up dead after he fails to call her when he said he would. The one of Dad's patients forgets to floss and pays the ultimate price."
