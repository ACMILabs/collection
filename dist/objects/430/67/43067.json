        "This documentary on Canadian stuntman Ken Carter and his obsession with jumping a car over the St Lawrence Seaway - a distance of 1 mile - is presented by Rob Sitch, Santo Cilauro and Aaron Beaucaire, \"Late Show\" stalwarts and keen amateur stuntmen. Originally shot by reporters form the National Film Board of Canada, the film spans the five years it took to achieve this absurd feat. At 16 Ken Carter joined Joey Chitwood's \"Congress of Canadian Daredevils\". At 17, he was with \"The International Hell Drivers\". Twenty years and fifty broken bones later, he decides his one last stunt will be to jump a rocket car from Canada to the USA over the St Lawrence Seaway."
