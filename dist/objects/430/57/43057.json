        "This is the first in the series of five videos tracing the story of steam locomotives during the middle years of the 20th century. In this episode we look at the great amalgamation - the grouping - of the Victorian companies in 1923 to form the \"Big Four\" railways: the Great Western, the Southern, the London, Midland and Scottish and the London & North Eastern. Using previously unseen archival film of the 1920's, we examine the stock inherited by the \"Big Four\" and then look at the first new types introduced by the \"Big Four\". Many rare scenes are shown and many locomotives shown including the Great Western \"Dukes\", the \"Lord Nelsons\", the \"Atlantics\" and the A1 \"Pacifics\". Narrated by Ken Morgan."
