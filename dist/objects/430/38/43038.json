        "Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), otherwise known as the \"Italian Stallion\" is an underdog challenged to fight the reigning heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Unperturbed and inspired by his dedicated manger Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and girlfriend Adrian (Talia Shire), Rocky has his eyes on the prize and a motivation to win. It is his one chance at fortune, self-respect, love and the world heavyweight crown. Filmed in only twenty eight days and with a screenplay written by Sylvester Stallone, \"Rocky\" won three Academy Awards including Best Picture."
