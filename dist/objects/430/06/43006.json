        "This educational kit is a collaborative effort by Victoria Police, the Office of public advocacy and Community Services Victoria. It is aimed primarily at police officers who are unaware of intellectual disability and how to treat offenders who are afflicted with this disability. It contains a video, teachers notes and overhead slides suitable for a group presentation. The video presents a number of scenarios involving intellectualy disabled people and potential outcomes."
