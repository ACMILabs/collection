        "Filmed by David Parer and Elizabeth Parer-Cook and narrated by David Attenborough, this spectacular production tells the story of the incredible struggle for survival of the dragons of the Galapagos Archipelago. The lives of these giant lizards, called land iguanas, are intimately linked with the Archipelagos most active volcano. We follow the annual migration of the land iguanas up the steep slopes of the 1,500 metre volcano and into the steaming caldera where they lay their eggs. Along the coast of the island the worlds only sea-going lizards take us into one of the most exciting marine environments on earth, a world of huge balls of baitfish and masses of seals, dolphins and penguins."
