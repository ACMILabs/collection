        "The traditional Southern values of the upstanding Hillyer family are about to be challenged. They've just hired a 19-year-old Rose (Laura Dern) as a housekeeper and nanny, unaware of the hilarious disruptions her arrival will cause. The very sweet and kind Rose has uncontrollable sexual impulses which cause her to ramble from man to man, bed to bed, leaving a trail of catastrophes in her wake."
