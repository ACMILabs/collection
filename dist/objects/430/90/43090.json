        "Shadowlands is an absorbing and moving story of true love. British writer C. S. Lewis, whose comfortable but rigid life as an Oxford don in the 1950's is shaken by his meeting with a forthright poet, American Joy Gresham. She knew him from his books and he remembered her from her letters, but when they finally met, she was unlike any-one he had ever known. Like his writings, his love for Joy is captivating and magical. A story for everyone, made with uncommon intelligence and restraint. Cast includes: Anthony Hopkins, Debra Winger and Julian Fellowes"
