        "A snapshot of the future, the year 2021. Corporations rule and the world is threatened by a new plague, NAS; Nerve Attenuation Syndrome. To protect data it must be smuggled through mnemonic carriers who carry the data through a computer chip implanted into the brain; Johnny Mnemonic (Keanu Reeves) is one such carrier. Johnny's present mission is to carry data from two scientists who have defected from one of the world's largest corporations, taking the information from Japan to America. The upload of information carried in Johnny's brain surpasses anything he has carried before and he must find the secret access code that will allow him to download the information, otherwise he will die. Also starring Dolph Lundgren, Takeshi Kitano, Ice-T and Dina Meyer."
