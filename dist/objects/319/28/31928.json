        "The film deals with the theory of the circulation of the atmosphere, The distribution of pressure and wind belts in relation to the overhead noon-day sun is established on an imaginary globe, whose surface is made of one material (thus eliminating the effects of the unequal heating of land and sea). It is shown how the great wind belts shift during the year, following the apparent movement of the sun. It is demonstrated that this seasonal shift brings certain parts of the world (the Mediterranean lands) into different wind belts at opposite times of the year."
