        "A documentary on a group of Italian families living in Australia. Shows how they continue some of their traditional customs, in particular the slaughtering and processing of a pig into salami and meat for winter. Captures the essence of traditional Italian family life; the cooperation between families, the division of labour between men and women and the camaraderie that comes from working as a team."
