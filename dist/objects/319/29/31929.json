        "A dramatisation illustrating the universal story of sin, repentance, reconciliation and peace. Ray Hendricks, driving home from a cocktail party, accidentally strikes a little girl. He tries to cover up his guilt and remorse by attempting to convince himself and others that because he was cleared by the police, he is not guilty of anything. He finally risks the confrontation and visits the little girl. She gives him sympathy because he looks hurt, and her naive assumption of this basic goodness brings him peace."
