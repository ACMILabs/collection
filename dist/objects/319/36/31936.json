        "A survey of sculpture in the Netherlands during the late Middle Ages. Although much of the sculpture of this period was destroyed in the 16th Century, sufficient remains in museums and private collections to show how the emotional quality of the early Gothic period gradually merged into the more realistic and mannered style of the later period. Statuettes are examined which express in wood and stone a series of emotions: humility, cruelty, love, pathos and humour. Narrator Gordon Jones."
