        "For may years the rubber growers of Grisek, in Johore, Malaya, have been processing their own latex, with the result that it was of poor quality. Now, however, with the assistance of the Rural and Industrial Development Authority, they pool their resources and produce rubber. A modern factory enables first-class sheet rubber to be produced in ideal conditions and at the lowest possible cost. The rubber is then sold in bulk on the Singapore market."
