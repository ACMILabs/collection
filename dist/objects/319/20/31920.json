        "The famous watercolours by S. T. Gill reflect the optimism and feeling or spirit of the goldrushes. The gold diggers' expressive faces and activities show the tremendous fever and hunger after gold in the 1850's in Victoria. The paintings are presented with a background of Australian ballads with guitar accompaniment."
