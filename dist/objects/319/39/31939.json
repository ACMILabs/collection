        "Follows child development from helpless immaturity to controlled locomotion. First the infant only kicks and wriggles, then gradually he learns to control position and posture by pivoting, creeping, standing, cruising, walking and running. A consecutive biographic series depicting thirteen different age levels enables a detailed study of comparatively rapid progress."
