        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Living Earth\".  This film illustrates what happens when any one of the vital links in the \"chain of life\" is broken. Unscientific lumbering practices, devastating forest fires, uncontrolled wind and water erosion, overworked land, and roaring floods are shown as the agents which can destroy the world unless humans begin to act to combat the havoc caused by thoughtless use of natural resources."
