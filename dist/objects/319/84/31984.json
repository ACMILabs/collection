        "Since 1847, when stamps in the USA were first used, they have developed into a gallery of events and people important to the country, they have also become a textbook of changing styles of art. The film demonstrates how stamps are produced and claims that annually 28 billion stamps are sold in the USA both for postage and to collectors."
