        "The late puppeteer Harry van Tussenbroek used to collect shells, birds' skulls and pieces of driftwood on the beach, from which he made quaint dolls and puppets. In this film he is seen in his home with his \"children\", dreaming by the fire. The dream suddenly takes on a strange twist where the dolls come to life, and in their strange dream-world they play the eternal game of good and evil, of light and darkness. Narrated by Jill Melford. This film is not recommended for showing to young children."
