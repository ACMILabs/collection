        "A survey of the Indian Railways, the story of the fulfilment of a 100-year-old dream. April 16, 1953, marked the first centenary of the Indian Railways. In 1853 the first rails were laid between Bombay and Thana. Where once only the hoof-beat of the bullock or pony could be heard, the iron horse now thunders. India now possesses the largest railway system in Asia and the third largest in the world. Commentary by Berkeley Hill."
