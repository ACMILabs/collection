        "The role of the water-buffalo in improving rice production in Malaya. Shows how a buffalo calf is trained as a farm animal. Its nostrils are pierced at six months and a ring inserted so that it can be led. At two years training is commenced, the buffalo learns how to pull, how to obey signals from his master and finally how to plough. Only patience and practice are needed to produce a thoroughly useful farm buffalo."
