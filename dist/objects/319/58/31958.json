        "The manufacture of drugs, particularly \"biologicals\" at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Since the laboratories were established in 1916 they have maintained a steady supply of vaccines and drugs which have reduced the child death rate enormously - almost eliminating many diseases [sic]. The production of Salk vaccine and penicillin is shown, the rigid series of tests on each batch of doses, and the extraction of spider venom for research on an anti-venene."
