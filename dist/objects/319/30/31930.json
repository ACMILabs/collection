        "In order to be an effective member of a community is it an individual's responsibility to keep informed? Two farmers argue the point when one of them is invited to join a group studying international affairs. He says a farmer has enough to do with his own problems, and the world's affairs can be best left to the experts. The audience is invited to carry the discussion further."
