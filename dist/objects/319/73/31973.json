        "A classic German Expressionistic film, Peter Lorre in his greatest role portrays a psychotic child molester - a pathetic vagabond figure, who experiences a frenzy at the sight of tender young school girls, and try as he may, is unable to control the fervour of his criminal inclinations. The police disregard his letters of confession to them as the work of a lunatic. Rated: M"
