        "Episode of Series \"Craft as a Livelihood\". This is a film about potter, Chris Sanders, working under the direction of an experienced master potter. After having had his own workshop for five years, Chris realised that he needed to learn more about the craft, and this could be best done under the guidance of a master potter. Both Chris and his master discuss this experience."
