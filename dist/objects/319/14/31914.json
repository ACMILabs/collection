        "Designed to increase public awareness of the nature of the South West Tasmanian wilderness and the threats facing it. Concentrates on the two main threats, namely the Hydro-Electric Commission's damming and flooding of the wild rivers of the area for power development purposes and the extensive logging of the native forests by the Forestry Commission. Explores the issues at hand by interviews with leading figures on both sides of the struggle. Narrated by Ian McGarrity."
