        "A modern dance solo based on a poem by John Malcolm Brinner describing the loneliness and agony resulting from the loss of a lover. A variety of camera effects and double exposures, combined with the dancing and reading by Valerie Bettis, produces an interesting experiment in modern dance film. Created, spoken and performed by Valerie Bettis; original music by Bernando Segall."
