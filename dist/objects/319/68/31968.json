        "An animated film by young Korean filmmaker Kim In Tae, in training in the NFB's animation division, with synthetic sound by Norman McLaren. The film was made to teach the alphabet to Korean children, but its colorful images, style of animation, and tunes produced without instruments give it a much wider appeal."
