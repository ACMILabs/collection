        "Episode of Series \"Is this your career series\". Illustrates what management is, using as an example, a well run household. A manager needs to ensure that all the activities of an organisation or business enterprise combine effectively. They have the ultimate responsibility for an entire organisation - its success or failure. Points out that most careers can lead to management but that school leavers can train in technical colleges, universities or sometimes within an industry."
