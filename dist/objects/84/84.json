        "In his New York City Landscape, Cohen finds inspiration in disturbance. Looking to life for rhythm and to architecture for state of mind, he locates simple mysteries. `Just Hold Still' is comprised of an interconnected series of short works and collaborations that explore the grey area between documentary, narrative and experimental genres. Part One concerns a personal, poetic approach to narrative while Part Two involves hybridized use of verite footage and the confrontation of documentary concerns with the music video format. The work can be considered as a whole or each piece in the project can be viewed (and rented) as a separate entity."
