        "Lauren Bacall's sizzling screen debut in \"To have and have not\" also marked her first role opposite Humphrey Bogart. The film that brought this legendary couple together is an adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway novel, set on the German controlled island of Martinique during World War II. The compelling script by Jules Furthman and William Faulkner captures the drama of the war-torn 40's and is peppered with witticisms and wisecracks. Supporting players Walter Brennan and Hoagy Carmichael keep the action brisk, but the scenes between sullen Bogie and silky Bacall exude a heat and humour that pervade the entire picture."
