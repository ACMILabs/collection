        "Episode number 23 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". In this program Teresa M. Amabile looks at inference on proportions, confidence intervals and significance tests for proportions and inference procedures for comparing proportions from two different populations, using various formulae. The examples used are unemployment statistics in U.S., the link between contaminated water and childhood leukemia and birth defects, and an exploration of the incidence of conviction for women as opposed to men in the infamous Salem witches trials."
