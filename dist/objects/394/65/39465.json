        "The six programs use archival material, case studies of products and people and comparisons with other nations to show how Australia has fallen behind other nations through not utilizing its intellectual and enterpreneurial talent. The programs are: \"Cringe dwellers\" tells how some of our world firsts were stolen by more resourceful countries. \"The Backward frontiers\" looks at rural innovations. \"Desperately seeking solutions\" compares our research and development with Japan and U.S.A. \"Ordinary people, extraordinary ideas\" looks at the future of innovation. \"Inventing the future\" a view of the new breed of entrepreneurs. \"Up the J curve\" the story of our industrial decay, pointing to the light at the end of the tunnel. Accompanied by one teacher's guide and student activities."
