        "The second and last volume of this series turns to the efforts of crimefighters such as J. Edgar Hoover to stop organized crime, and shows the extent of the gangsters' control of gambling in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Multi-million dollar gambling empires are run by criminals, despite strict supervision and laws. The video consists of two parts: \"Racket busters\" and \"Birthright of gangsters.\" Written and narrated by Martin Short."
