        "Set in the Catholic community in Derry, Ireland, at the time of the 'supergrass' trials in the wake of the abortion referendum in the Republic, this is the story of four teenage girls: Goretti (Emer McCourt); Sinead (Sinead O'Connor); Dinky (Cathy Casey) and Majella (Julie Rodgers). In particular it revolves around their attempts to come to grips with their sexuality in a confusing and oppressive culture. Things come to a head when Goretti becomes pregnant by her boyfriend Ciarin (Michael Liebman), who, meanwhile has been lifted in an army swoop. This is a tough yet wholly sympathetic view of a working class community, a view which whilst touchingly communicating the vulnerability of young people exploring their sexuality, never romanticises the attitudes of its characters toward each other."
