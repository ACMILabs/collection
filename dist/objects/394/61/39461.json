        "Robert Taylor plays Steve Raleigh, a Broadway producer who wants to put on a show called Broadway Melody. Eleanor Powell plays Sally Lee, the girl Steve loves who owns a racehorse which must win the big event to finance the show. Sensational dancing is the highlight of this musical as well as Judy Garland's very first appearance in an MGM musical performing her first big hit - 'Dear Mr. Gable (You Made Me Love You)' - a superb show-stopper."
