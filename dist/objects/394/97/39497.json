        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". This program looks at ways of analysing relationships between variables, using scatter plots, categorical variables and the least squares regression line. Theresa M. Amabile stresses the need for caution in interpreting data, and the importance of outliers and lurking variables. Examples used are the number of manatee deaths due to power boats, and the 1970, and 1971 Vietnam draft lotteries."
