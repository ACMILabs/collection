        "Episode number 24 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". In this program Teresa M. Amabile explores two-way tables, the relationships between categorical variables and the chi-square test which is able to analyse two-way tables. Using the example of analysis of the teeth two examples of prehistoric man - Australopithicus Robustus and Australopithicus Africanus and using a chi-square test, we discover that they are two completely different species. The test is also used to see if doctors unconsciously discriminate against older women in prescribing therapy and also to discover if Mendel falsified the results of his famous genetic experiments with peas, by placing indeterminate samples in such a way as to influence the results."
