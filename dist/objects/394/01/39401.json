        "Episode number 17 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". This program looks at the law of large numbers, and the myth of small numbers as illustrated by the probability or otherwise of making a shot in basketball, after having made a shot on the try before. The formulae for rules for means and variances are described, using the example of investment options, and finally we look at binomial distributions, where only two outcomes are possible, using the example of inherited sickle-cell anaemia."
