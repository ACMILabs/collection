        "A look at Australia in the 1960's through a court case against James Savage, an Aborigine, who was on trial in the United States for murder. Gives an account of the government policy which removed half-caste Aboriginal children from their natural parents and placed them with white families. Includes interviews with some of those children who are now grown up. Savage was sentenced to death in January 1990, a sentence subsequently commuted to life."
