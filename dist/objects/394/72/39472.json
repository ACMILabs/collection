        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Looks at immigration and cross cultural marriages. This program focuses on Chinese immigrants and marriages between Chinese citizens and Australians. Two Australian/Chinese couples are interviewed on aspects such as why they decided to get married, how their families felt about the marriage and how each Chinese person coped with language and monetary barriers when they first arrived in Australia. The program also looks at overseas students and why they are attracted to making Australia their permanent home. Discusses the steps Chinese spouses must take to convince the immigration department that the marriage is a 'real' one, and not one of convenience. Some interviews are conducted in Chinese. No subtitles are provided."
