        "Women are the most frequent users of the health care system, but have little say in the way it is run. This program outlines how women can deal with and what they need from the health care system. Includes interviews with sociologists, nurse educators, doctors and patients and is designed to awaken consumer and practitioner awareness of women's rights in health care."
