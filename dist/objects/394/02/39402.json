        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Top end\". Engineer Guido Zuccoli was born in Northern Italy in 1940 and migrated to Australia in 1961. The owner of a large and successful Darwin-based construction company, Guido claims \"my work is my first hobby\". But Guido has another hobby about which he is passionate - aircraft. Guido first took up flying to commute easily between far-flung engineering projects in the Territory, but he began to practice daring aerobatics and has won the Australian championship many times. Plagued in his mid-forties by the headaches which signal the end of a career in competititve aerobatics, he purchased and restored three 1947 Hawker Sea Fury fighter planes to continue the \"pure joy\" he finds in his aircraft."
