        "Scotland Yard investigates when a caddish footballer dies by poisoning during a game between Arsenal and the Trojans. This fast-moving British thriller provides authentic footage of the pre-war Arsenal team training, playing and relaxing: from goalkeeper George Swindin to legendary winger Cliff 'Boy' Bastin. Genuine footage of a 1939 Arsenal match is intercut with re-staged close-up action. Stars Leslie Banks, Greta Gynt and the players and management of Arsenal Football Club 1939. From an original story by Leonard Reginald Gribble."
