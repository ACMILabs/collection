        "Edmund, a boy of fifteen, lives with his family in the desolation of post-war Berlin, influenced by a Nazi teacher. After being convinced that only the strong should survive he perpetrates a crime in the belief that he is performing an heroic act. The final sequence of Edmund wandering amongst the ruins of devastated Berlin is one of the finest things the cinema has to offer. Photography by Robert Juillard."
