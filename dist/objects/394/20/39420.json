        "Overview Sol Garfunkel introduces us to the science of statistics and the manner in which it permeates our daily lives, from baseball to politics, to medical tests and gambling. The outcome of a single event may be unpredictable, but the outcome of many events is very predictable and this identification of patterns is what statistics is all about. He also introduces ways of collecting data, and in particular how sampling should be done."
