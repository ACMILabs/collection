        "Children of migrants are often the first to learn English and become familiar with customs. This program outlines how this may cause misunderstandings between parent and child. The issue of how a non-English speaker may break a law unconsciously because they are unfamiliar with the written word is discussed. The second episode looks at the different types of families which exist in Australia and skills that may be used to ensure that a person can get what they want when they go shopping. A degree of familiarity with spoken English is assumed."
