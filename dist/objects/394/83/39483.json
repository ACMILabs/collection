        "The first episode examines the Australian enthusiasm for sport and how this may be intimidating for a new migrant. Addresses the importance of standing up for one's rights in situations where others may take advantage of a migrant's lack of familiarity with English. The second episode outlines the importance of accepting cultural differences so as not give offence as well as examining the use of common idioms. A degree of familiarity with spoken English is assumed."
