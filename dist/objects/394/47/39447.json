        "Comic operetta in which Laurel and Hardy are mousetrap salesmen in Switzerland. They can't pay their dinner bill and wind up working in the hotel kitchen to pay expenses. Their stay coincides with the local music festival and they have to contend with a gorilla, two opera singers, a St. Bernard dog and moving a piano up a narrow mountain trail. Based on the original story by Jean Negulesco and Charles Rogers."
