        "A shyster lawyer and two incompetents save a circus from bankruptcy while a man-eating gorilla and the combined unmistakable talents of a tattooed lady and a crazy musical conductor move the plot foward at a furious pace. Blending all that is ridiculous and crazy this movie is one of the Marx Bros classics. Cast also includes Eve Arden, Margaret Dumont, Nat Pendleton, Fritz Feld."
