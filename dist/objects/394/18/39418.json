        "Gorgeous Betty Grable (voted the Armed Forces' favourite pin up girl), stars as a War Department typist, who doubles as a small-time USO entertainer desperate for a chance at the big-time. Her penchant for telling lies gets her into all sorts of trouble especially when she fibs her way into the company of war hero Tommy Dooley (John Harvey) by pretending to be a musical star. Her life gets more complicated when she is appointed secretary to the handsome war hero. Barely disguised, she manages to fool him for a time, but not when she flashes those million dollar legs! Grable turns in a wonderful performance and there are several excellent musical numbers."
