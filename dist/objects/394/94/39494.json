        "David Anderson is one of the Uk's leading animators, and in this collection his creative and technical range is given full rein. The program begins with Anderson's BAFTA Award-winning debut film \"Dreamland express\" (1982) which captures the rich fantasy life of childhood. \"Sweet disaster, dreamless sleep\" (1986) is a poignant allegory on the theme of the nuclear nightmare. \"Deadtime stories for big folk\" is the title of a collaboration between Anderson and the novelist Russell Hoban, and a documentary on this includes the full versions of the two films involved, \"Deadsy\" (1989) and \"Door\" (1990). Both have won many awards and are powerful and disturbing pieces."
