        "The Reluctant dragon Once upon a time, a village boy made friends with a dragon - a pink dragon who preferred purring to breathing fire and writing poetry to fighting. But when St. George the dragonfighter arrives with the longest, wickedest spear you ever did see, what will happen? Based on the story by Kenneth Grahame. \"The Furious flycycle\" Melvin Spitznagle is a mechanical genius. When Professor Mickimecki, the inventor, moves to town, Melvin \"borrows\" the professor's anti-gravity pellet and converts his bicycle to a flying marvel, just in time to perform an heroic rescue. Based on the story by Jan Wahl."
