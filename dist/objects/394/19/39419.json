        "Bette Davis gives her second memorable performance as Queen Elizabeth I in this swashbuckling historical drama that also features Joan Collins in an early screen performance. It is the story of the aging queen's attraction to handsome Sir Walter Raleigh (Richard Todd) and her bitter clash with a scheming, younger rival (Collins). Rich in historical detail, lavish with authentic cotumes and period decor and enlivened by thrilling swordplay, \"The Virgin Queen\" is a legendary re-creation of one of England's most fascinating eras, made all the more alluring by Davis' dynamic performance."
