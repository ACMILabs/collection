This program reviews the presentation of data analysis by showing the use of computing technology which can display many dimensions simultaneously. The environmental study of the water quality of Chesapeake Bay demonstrates the use of the tools learned so far to differentiate between the many variables, both natural and man made which influence the Bay."
