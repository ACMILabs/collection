        "This program focuses on the state of illiteracy in Australia. It examines the reasons why people may be illiterate and the ways in which they cope with illiteracy in today's society. The stigma of illiteracy (the assumption that to be illiterate is to be mentally deficient) is explored. Interviews with illiterate people from different sectors of the community are conducted and adult literacy courses are also examined. Presented by Margaret Throsby."
