        "A humorous dramatisation about the implications of declaring oneself bankrupt. Max is an ordinary family man, who is in deep financial difficulty. His debts far exceed his ability to pay. We follow Max through the steps he must take to solve his seemingly unsolvable problem. He appears to find an ideal expedient in declaring himself bankrupt, but through counselling Max learns of the likely consequences of this and that it should only ever be a last resort. Written by Donald Crombie."
