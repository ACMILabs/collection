        "Based on Canadian author Brian Moore's acclaimed novel, this is the brutal and breathtaking story of two men and their journey deep into the heart of the rugged Canadian wilderness. Struggling to survive, they face the savagery of the native Indians, the perils of their 1,500 mile trek and the hardships of the hostile land. Acclaimed director Bruce Beresford has created an ultimate adventure, a bold and brave story of courageous men journeying into a dangerous land. Stars Lothaire Bluteau and Aden Young."
