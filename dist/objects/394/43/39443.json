        "Explores Rubens' fascination with Italian painting from the artist's arrival in Venice in 1600 until his death in 1640. The rich heritage of the Renaissance and the brilliance of the Mannerist school made a profound impression on the young Rubens, who absorbed the techniques and styles of such masters as Michelangelo, Titian, Tintoretto and Caravaggio. Published to coincide with the Australian National Gallery's exhibition held 28 March to 8 June 1992."
