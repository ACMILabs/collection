        "Episode number 18 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". Theresa M. Amabile looks at the statistics behind casino profits, using sample means and the central limit theorem. The sample mean is also the keystone to quality control and the program looks at Dr. W. Edwards Deming's total quality control and statistical process control which was used to such good effect in turning Japan from a defeated nation to the economic giant it is today. The method is demonstrated through the production of potato chips."
