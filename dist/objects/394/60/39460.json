        "John Huston won Academy Awards both as director and writer of this film. Based on B. Traven's novel, it reveals the effects of greed and the lure of sudden wealth on three penniless prospectors. Humphrey Bogart, as Fred C. Dobbs, gives one of the best performances of his career. We watch him change from a likeable drifter into a man capable of killing his best friend in cold blood."
