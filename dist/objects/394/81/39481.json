        "Episode number 14 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". This program shows how to improve the accuracy of a survey by using stratified random sampling, and how to avoid sampling errors such as bias. We see how important the correct interviewing technique is, and through the example of the 1936 Gallup election poll, the concept of undercoverage and the importance of the careful use of sampling is illustrated. The program concludes by showing how to calculate variations and the margin of error."
