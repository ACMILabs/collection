        "Betty Grable abandons Broadway fame and takes off for the beautiful Canadian Rockies after she has a falling out with her leading man (John Payne). All manner of complications arise when Payne pursues her with a highly unlikely secretary (Carmen Miranda) in tow. In the Rockies, Grable meets up with a former dance partner (Cesar Romero) and decides to teach philandering Payne a lesson in the art of two-timing. The two women lead the men a merry dance in this colourful musical. Carmen Miranda proves to be a fine comedienne with her fractured English and Grable and Romero set the screen ablaze with some wonderful dance routines. Several hit songs are featured in this tuneful showcase."
