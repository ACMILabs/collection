        "Fasten your seatbelts as two of Hollywood's hottest women rev it up and take it on the road! When unhappy housewife Thelma (Geena Davis) and her wisecracking friend Louise (Susan Sarandon) decide to take a break from their lives, they embark on a trip that leads to a tragic incident at a roadside honky tonk. In an instant, their weekend \"getaway\" becomes just that as they flee across the American southwest with the police one step behind. A classic twist of the usual \"buddy-outlaw\" movie, where men are most often the unlikely heroes, this film has a charming, refreshing and triumphant outlook. Co-starring Harvey Keitel."
