        "Te Kanawa and Domingo are two names which rank amongst the most illustious in the world of opera. Both singers bring consummate skill and artistry to their individual performances, but together they form a partnership which is perfectly balanced, achieving a musical and dramatic rapport. All the exceptional musical and dramatic qualities Te Kanawa and Domingo command can be seen and heard in these magnificent performances. Selections are from; Die Fledermaus, The tales of Hoffmann, Agnes Baltsa, La faniciulladel West, Otello, Ernani, Manon Lescaut."
