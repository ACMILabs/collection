        "See how lighting is a critical part of successful design. Poorly planned or inadequate lighting results in rooms not reaching their full potential both in appearance and comfort. This video illustrates the basics of lighting residential interiors and shows how you can improve the lighting in your own home. Learn how light shapes physical space and human emotion, how bounced light changes the perception of colors, how and when to diffuse light, how the simple choice of a light bulb changes the feeling of a room, how the modern lamp shade is a surprisingly sophisticated tool of light control and much much more."
