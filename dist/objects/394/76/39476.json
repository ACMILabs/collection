        "Episode number 15 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". Probability is the language of uncertainty. The program explores the concepts of relative frequency, randomness, sample space and the rules of probability. Theresa M. Amabile shows how statistics summarises random experiences to enable decisions to be made, based on probability, and demonstrates the formulae used to calculate probability. The example of traffic control is used."
