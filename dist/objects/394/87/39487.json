        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". In this frank and uninhibited documentary parents and childcare workers talk candidly about that widely used but rarely understood term - multiculturalism. Rather than separate and draw attention to differences, the childcare experts interviewed here create an environment where cultures fuse and blend. \"The Child at the Centre\" shows us a rich slice of Australia, very much a 'hands on' approach to early childhood education that benefits all children whatever their cultural background."
