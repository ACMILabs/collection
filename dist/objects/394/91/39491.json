        "A penniless ambitious governess becomes mistress of a stately home by marrying into the wealthy family of the headstrong Steward, (Stewart Granger), who aspires to run the estate. This is a beautifully mounted period (costume) drama which sits comfortably within the genre as a fine example of a family melodrama. A wronged illegitimate cousin, an illicit love affair and a double murder all contribute to the melodramatic story. Also stars Valerie Hobson."
