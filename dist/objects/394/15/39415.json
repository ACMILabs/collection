        "When two sisters (played by Betty Grable and Carole Landis) fail to receive an expected inheritance, they decide to pool their resources with their Aunt and head for Florida, posing as an heiress, a secretary and a maid in the hopes of ensnaring a couple of millionaires. Grable is soon involved with two, Don Ameche and Robert Cummings, but all is not what it seems. Ameche is just as broke as the girls, but woos gold-digger Grable with his smooth talk and charming ways, with genuine millionaire Cummings in hot pursuit. A bright and breezy song-filled musical, as Grable turns in some fine dance routines with the Condos Brothers. Fabulous comic performances from the cast help make this film one of the best Hollywood musicals of its era."
