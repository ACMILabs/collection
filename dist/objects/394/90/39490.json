        "Voyage to Italy marked Rosellini's break with the aesthetics of neo-realism. Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders play a bored English couple who realise their marriage is falling apart while on a working holiday in Italy. The film is structured as a series of seemingly random scenes in which the disintegration of the marriage is viewed through the relationship between the characters and their external world. This deliberately \"clinical\" mise-en-scene outraged critics on the film's initial release. However for a new generation of film-makers Rosellini's work in \"Voyage to Italy\" marked the beginning of an intellectual cinema dedicated to examining the existential condition of modern Europe."
