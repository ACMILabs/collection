        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". The first of May is International Labour Day marking the struggle to achieve the eight hour working day. The Northern Territory is one of the few States still celebrating May 1st as a holiday. This program follows the preparations by community groups, trade unions and artistic directors, Neil Cameron and Jan McDonald, to revitalise the 1989 May Day celebrations in Darwin by creating a lively and colourful parade and festival where workers could have a good time and still prove unity is strength."
