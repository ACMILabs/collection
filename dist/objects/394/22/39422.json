        "Based on William Inge's Pulitzer Prize winning Broadway hit, \"Picnic\" is a revealing look into the hearts and minds of a select group of Kansas townfolk over Labor Day weekend. This simple yet poignant story stars William Holden as an itinerant drifter who swings into town, stirring up trouble and awakening the interest of Kim Novak. At first, Holden refused the role - considering himself too old for the part at 37. However, his outstanding performance proved critical to the film's success, and his love scenes with Novak are considered to be among the most sensual in cinema history. Co-starring Susan Strasberg, Rosalind Russell and Cliff Robertson, \"Picnic\" was nominated for several and also won two Academy Awards."
