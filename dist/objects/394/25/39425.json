        "The Clock family, Pod, Homily and Arietty are beginning to find living with their \"Borrower\" relatives a strain, particularly with the return of Ditchly and Ilrick, Aunt Lupy's two obnoxious and evil sons. The Clocks, and their friend Spiller, make a dangerous journey to find a new home in the model village of Little Fordham. Can they survive the cruel tricks of Ditchly and Ilrick, and manage to avoid capture by the evil Mrs. Driver? With the help of their \"giant\" friend George, and their own resourcefulness, the Borrowers experience many adventures down drains, in boats and balloons. Excellent special effects make this video a special treat for young and old."
