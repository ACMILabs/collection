        "This musical western has Doris Day as Calamity Jane and Howard Keel as Wild Bill Hickcock. Calamity Jane comes in from the 'Windy city' after finding a star attraction for the local saloon. As she is taken by the 'Deadwood Stage' to the 'Black hills of Dakota', she meets Wild Bill Hickock, her 'Secret love'. This is the Wild West in a spectacular musical."
