        "Episode of Series \"The World of Peter Rabbit and friends\". Two of Beatrix Potter's best loved tales are together in this delightful film. When Lucie discovers the loss of her pocket handkerchief yet again, she never imagines that her search will end with a kindly (but strangely prickly) washerwoman, Mrs Tiggy-winkle, or that she will meet Mr. Jeremy Fisher and be told the terrifying story of his eventful fishing trip. Features Niamh Cusack as Beatrix Potter."
