        "Episode number 16 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". This program looks at how the probability of a disaster, in this instance the Challenger 7 disaster and earthquakes in Los Angeles, can be calculated to arrive at an evaluation of risk. The multiplication rule is demonstrated, and the concepts of random variables, the mean and standard deviations are revisited in the context of these calculations."
