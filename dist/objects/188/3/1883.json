        "Using the fragments, clock leaders and strips of films found at the beginning and end of hundreds of old 16mm films, this Public Imaging work explores the visual beauty of the film's surface. Concealed among ACMI's vast film collection, these pieces of film are a testament to the aging wonder of celluloid. The play of light and colour that can be found in the interweaving of these accidents and offcuts makes for a hypnotic experience."
