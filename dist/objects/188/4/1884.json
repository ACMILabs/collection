    "description": [
        "Using archival films of the Apollo lunar missions in the late 1960s and early 70s, this 2 screen video installation contemplates humankind's first touch of the moon. Often considered a giant leap in human development, the video concentrates on the delicate and hesitant movements of the astronauts and their spaceships as they overcome the limits of outer space. With both humour and melancholy, stunning images of the moon, the earth, and the astronauts and their spacecraft, are interwoven into a wondrous contemplation of this extraordinary achievement."
