    "description": [
        "An aging astronomer invites students to his castle observatory to observe a solar eclipse. Amid the childish pranks of the novice astronomers and the wondrous vision of the eclipse, George Melies, cinema's great magician, weaves numerous amusing set pieces. Much to the astronomer's excitement, the sun and the moon flirt with each other as they come together in an astronomical courtship and the sky explodes in a dance of female stars. On earth, the astronomer falls prey to his cheeky students who rob him of his stately dignity, while the heavens smile down on him from above."
