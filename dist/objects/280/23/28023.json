        "Traces the role played by the combat photographer from World War I to Korea. Shows the photographers in action on land, in the sky, and on the sea as they use their cameras and talent as a source of historical record, military intelligence, and as an aid in training troops. In addition to showing combat scenes, other important events, such as atomic blasts, enemy surrenders, and features of large scale combat operations, are depicted."
