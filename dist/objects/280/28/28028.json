        "Five role playing scenes are shown. The activities of the leader of a Mothers' Club in setting up a role playing situation getting it started, cutting the scene and discussing it afterwards. Two problems of family living showing how insight is gained into human relations problems by demonstrating and analysing the effects of different kinds of behaviour. A community problem demonstrating the use of the commentator soliloquy and interview in role playing. A supervisory training group making use, through role playing, of an expert who communicates some of his supervisory skills to the trainees by acting them out rather than by verbal explanation."
