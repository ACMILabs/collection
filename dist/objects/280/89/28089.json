        "This film received 1st prize at the 1948 International Film Festival at Venice. It opens with an analysis of Rubens' style. Comparisons are made with other painters by using a split screen. After this contrasting of styles and compositions, the film introduces actuality shots of clouds, water and flames, superimposed over paintings showing clearly the corresponding fluidity and roundness of Rubens' general style. The second section of the film deals with Rubens' life, his family, his travels and his methods of working. Photography by Robert Gudin. Translation and narration by Charles Jarrell."
