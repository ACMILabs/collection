        "In charming animation, the film tells the story of the Japanese woodcutter who drops his luncheon rice balls in a mouse hole, then follows them down. The delightful mice show their appreciation by presenting him with costly presents to take home to his wife. A greedy hunter learns of the mice's treasure and seeks it for himself. However, he frightens the mice, gets the treasure and learns the folly of greed."
