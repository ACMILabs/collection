        "A unique record of an outstanding historical event - the arrival at Essendon on the 24th February, 1954, of Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh and their subsequent triumphal tour of the State of Victoria. Photographed by a large team of professional cameramen, in privileged positions, the film contains such exclusive scenes as the opening of State Parliament and the Royal Command Performance at the Princess Theatre. The film captures all the excitement of the great occasion and shows many interesting sidelights of the Royal progress throughout the State."
