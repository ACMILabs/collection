        "Documents the importance and extent of world trade, emphasising its significance to the United States. An American auto worker, a southern farmer, a house-wife, a British machinist, a French labourer, and a Mexican farmer give their views on world trade. Dr Riefler, an economist, uses animated models to show the effects of tariffs, and reveals how nations are planning to bring about satisfactory trade arrangements."
