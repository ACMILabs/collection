        "Docudram about two families in Puerto Rico, one a happy one in which the father and mother love each other and their children, the other one in which there are too many children, no understanding between the parents, and neglected and unhappy children, are contrasted to show the importance of well-adjusted, tolerant, loving parents in the development of happy productive children. Strong comparison made between children and trees, both of which should be planted far enough apart and in a number that can be properly cared for, thus raising questions of birth control."
