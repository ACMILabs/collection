        "Maria claims that her first day in this country in 1959 was 'magic' but that in her new life everyone had to work hard and there was no time for lighthearted things. However in 1995 she experienced a change in life that taught her \"It's never too late\". Created as part of the Racconti: La Voce del Popolo Digital Storytelling in association with The Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and their Families (FILEF)."
