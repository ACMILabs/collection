        "As the daughter of migrant parents Nella often felt \"different and isolated from the other children at school\". Her strict father did not allow her to experience some of the advantages life in Australia had to offer so Nella was determined that her own daughter would have what she couldn't. Created as part of the Racconti: La Voce del Popolo Digital Storytelling in association with The Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and their Families (FILEF)."
