        "In 1952 Emilio left his family behind in Italy to come and earn money in Australia. He didn't see them again until they came to join him 9 years later. Instead of a place to become rich and leave, Australia became his home. Created as part of the Racconti: La Voce del Popolo Digital Storytelling in association with The Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and their Families (FILEF)."
