        "The lake at Waikaremoana is one of the North Island's major sources of water for hydro-electric power. However, weakness in the bed of the lake has resulted in considerable loss of valuable water. With a full-sized movie camera fitted in his special diving helmet, a cameraman recorded how divers located and sealed these leaks in the lake bed."
