        "A survey of the continuous aluminium strip rolling mill at Rogerstone, where modern machinery, mechanical handling and efficient factory layout enable single ingots of aluminium to be rolled in continuous lengths of as much as 3,500 feet. The opening of this mill in 1950 increased Britain's aluminium sheet rolling capacity by one-third."
