        "The wedding of HRH Princess Alexandra and the Hon. Angus Ogilvy at Westminster Abbey in April 1963. Joins the waiting crowds to pick out some of the famous guests arriving, until the moment when the presence of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth indicates that the bride is on her way. A fanfare greets the arrival of Princess Alexandra, who walks (with her chief bridesmaid, HRH Princess Anne, in attendance) to join her groom at the altar, and the majestic service proceeds. The Princess and her husband leave the Abbey to drive in the famous glass coach to St James Palace."
