        "On the site of a former sheep station now stands one of Australia's most modern military colleges. Prospective cadets are expected to have had a sound secondary education, as the four year course is of University standard, and covers Engineering, Science or Arts and the theory and practice of modern warfare. Field exercises are part of the plan to develop initiative and leadership and back in the laboratories experiments are carried out on rocket propellents and explosives. Facilities for recreation are many and varied, and include a ski lodge and a fully equipped gymnasium."
