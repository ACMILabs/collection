        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Crossroads of the world: a study of North Africa and the Middle East\". Describes the western influence in North Africa and the Middle East. Technology which had halted for a thousand years, spurts ahead as new revolutionary leaders, like Bourguiba, Nasser and Kassem, reogranise feudal society and restore the pride of the people and the fertility of their soil. In the drylands of the United Arab Republic you climb great engineering works which irrigate the fields, power the machinery and give light to schools and colleges where a new generation of Egyptians prepare for modern life."
