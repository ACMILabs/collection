        "'You have touched a woman, you have struck a rock!' was the cry in 1956 when 20,000 women occupied Union Buildings, the seat of the all-white South African government, to protest against the issuing of passes to black women. The film recreates this anti-apartheid womens' campaign using a collage of rare photographs, newsreel footage and recent interviews with women involved."
