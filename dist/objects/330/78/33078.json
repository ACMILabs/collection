        "Why does vandalism occur? This film attempts to explore the psychological makeup of the vandal with special attention being paid to motivators like frustration and boredom through dramatisations: young woman on the way to a disco gets harassed; four youths take a joy ride in the hope of torching a school. Film also includes interviews and actual photographs of vandalism provided by the South Australian Police Force. Cast includes Jamie West, Rosanna Cassin, Joe Franco, Tim Glass. Written by John Dick."
