        "A dramatised film of a lecture to medical students. Professor Bruce Kerr shows the ethical dilemma in dealing with cases, of not diagnosing the medical problem correctly. Doctors should look not only at the symptoms presented by the patients but also at their social situation which may also reveal the cause. He points out that medicine is the art of insight into the human condition. (Contains footage of Northcote and University of Melbourne.)"
