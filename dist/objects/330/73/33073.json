        "In Manila, nearly one million people live in squatter settlements; living conditions vary from almost pleasant to appalling. Little by Little documents the attempt to upgrade a section of one such settlement, Barrio Escopa. The project takes all aspects of community life into account. The film examines the complex nature of urban redevelopment and the roles played by different government agencies in the project's execution."
