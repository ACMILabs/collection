        "An impressionistic survey of the arts in Britain ranging from sculptors and painters at work to a display of Mary Quant fashions and vistas of modern architecture. The theatre is represented by excerpts from three plays staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company and there is a sequence from a new ballet by Sir Frederick Ashton. Some of the work of Henry Moore is seen as well as paintings by Francis Bacon. Includes a brief appearance by a very young Googie Withers."
