        "Episode of Series \"People and Work\". Looks at the effect that modernisation of the work processes has had on the industrial relations and the experience of work and its consequences for the traditional skills of steel making. Shot entirely at the BSC Anchor Plant at Scunthorpe, the largest and most up-to-date steel works in Europe, it concentrates on the steel workers themselves. A case study for the students of the sociology of work."
