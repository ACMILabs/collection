        "In March 1981, Elisabeth Hastings, suffering from polio, and Rheinhardt Raftl, a victim of multiple sclerosis, became the first disabled people to trek across Nepal. The film shows them riding mountain ponies, through the Himalayas, travelling in rafts down one of the most violent rivers in the world, and clinging to the backs of elephants in the Chitwan jungle."
