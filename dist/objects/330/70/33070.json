        "The Caravan Stage Company is the only horse-drawn open-air theatre in the world. The film shows them on the road and in performance bringing live entertainment to communities where television is often the main diversion. In a montage of short sketches, the film shows the troupe on the road and in performance. Hard work and laughter are basic ingredients of this unconventional lifestyle."
