        "At first, young Gerald's boings, honks, beeps, toots and train whistle noises nearly drive his parents crazy - and when time and even school fail to teach him to actually talk like other children, the situation grows bleaker. Rejected by his peers, an outcast in a world of words, the friendless Gerald runs away from home. Then from a dark and dreadful snowstorm he is rescued by the owner of a radio station who needs just such a lad for his sound effects department. At last Gerald has found his niche. From the story by Dr Seuss, adapted by Bill Scott and Phil Eastman and narrated by Marvin Miller. Animation by Bill Melendez, Rudy Larriva, Pat Matthews, Willis Pyle, Frank Smith. Suitable for primary school level."
