        "Wellington's headquarters still stand in the peaceful village of Waterloo; Napoleon's army tent, swords are on display in the museum where visitors are shepherded past wax figures, paintings, firearms, and even skeletons collected from the battlefields. The camera takes in the silent brooding landscape, then turns to the painted war scenes to recreate the battle."
