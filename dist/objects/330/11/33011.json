        "This program explores the myth that there are vast tracts of arable land, capable of supporting human populations, no matter what their numbers. Looking at world politics and economics, as well as the availability of land, water and energy resources, it explores the ever-present wall of hunger that separates the \"haves\" from the \"have nots\" and studies possibilities for a more equitable distribution of present food resources."
