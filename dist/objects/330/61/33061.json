        "Examines the building of the 280 mile long narrow gauge Bangkok to Rangoon Railway during the 1940's, on which 116,000 World War II prisoners died. A number of POW's, including Dr 'Weary' Dunlop who worked on the railway and survived provide valuable reminiscences of the hardships endured, meagre food rations, lack of medical facilities, the use of a wood saw to amputate limbs and tropical ulcers. The relics of a nightmare railway line are still visible in remote reaches of Thailand's jungle. David Bilcock and his film crew retrace the steps of the soldiers who perished building the line that was to be bombed during its first week of operation. Includes footage of the Japanese attack on Malaya and Singapore and the setting up of Changi Prison. Narrated by Gerrard Kennedy. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
