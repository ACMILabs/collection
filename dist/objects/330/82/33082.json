        "This documentary focuses on Bill Underwood, an 84 year old Canadian who has developed his own brand of self defence known as 'defendo' which he teaches to police groups, college students and senior citizens. Bill's contagious energy and enthusiasm isn't limited to self defence, he freely discusses his positive attitude to life which seems to be responsible for his good health and general wellbeing."
