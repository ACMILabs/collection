        "Three magazine-type features that have been put together to make this 24 minute film. The first segment titled 'Cat and Arrest' shows the training and the initial landing of Navy Skyhawk pilots on the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne. The second 'On Target' shows the clearance of potentially explosive ordnance from the Evans Head bombing range under an Air Force program while the third item 'Rescue 036' shows the 'rescue' of a pilot after a simulated helicopter crash near the Army Aviation Centre at Oakley in Queensland."
