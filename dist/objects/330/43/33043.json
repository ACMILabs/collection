        "If you are a health food buff, this film is for you. Even if you are not, there is still enough in it to tickle your fancy, perhaps strain your credulity. The camera scans shelves stocked with all manner of natural foods to which nary an additive has been added - soya bean and sesame seed products, wild honey, even eggs from hens fed on blackstrap molasses. But the real eye-openers are in what you hear from the store's proprietor and his customers. (Award: Berlin.)"
