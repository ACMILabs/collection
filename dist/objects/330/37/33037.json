        "In 1979 Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson and Larry Newman flew a hot air balloon, the Double Eagle II, across the Atlantic from U.S.A. to France, succeeding where hundreds of others had failed for over a century. The factors that enabled these three to surmount an enormous challenge and succeed where others failed are the same as those required to achieve superlative goals in any field. Includes interviews with the three men who discuss their philosophies on setting goals, surmounting challenges, teamwork and superior performance."
