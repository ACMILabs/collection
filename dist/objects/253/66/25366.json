        "Adelaide's water supply is boosted by the 50 miles of piping from Mannum on the Murray. With the lowest rainfall of any Australian capital, heavy industry expanding each year, and a rapid increase in homes and population, the six reservoirs in the Lofty Ranges are unable to supply enough water for Adelaide's needs. An extra supply of water is pumped through 72 inch concrete pipes to dams near the city."
