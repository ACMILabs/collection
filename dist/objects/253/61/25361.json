        "Episode of Series \"March of Time\". How children grow mentally and physically has been studied during the past 35 years by a group of specialists working under the direction of Dr Arnold Gesell at the Yale University Clinic of Child Development. They have been able to establish definite standards of development for children up to six years of age. Many of these findings are illustrated in this film. Non-technical in character, the film aims at a better understanding of the young child by adults and older children."
