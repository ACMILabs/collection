        "Episode of Series \"Man builds - man destroys\". Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a book, \"The Limits to Growth\". Questions raised by that book included: Is it time to stop growing - in population, in capital investments, in material things - or is that the road to continued poverty for the poorer nations of the world? This film examines both sides of the question."
