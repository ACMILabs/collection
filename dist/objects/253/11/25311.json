        "A study of the smooth newt, tracing its development from and an egg, through to the tadpole stage, to a fully developed 3 year old newt returning to the pond in spring to breed. The male and female of this species of newt differ in size and colouring. Crested newts, axololts, and salamanders all have a similar cycle."
