        "The annual round of events in the daily lives of the local peasantry. In winter the mountains are covered with snow; when spring comes, shepherds move village animals to fresh pastures in the hills. Throughout the summer the animals roam over mountain pasture; butter and cheese making, cutting and hauling of timber and harvesting takes place in this season. The life of the village is quickened in tempo by the near approach of winter."
