        "Why does a nun cut herself off from the world in the Service of God? What are the difficulties and joys of living closely together in a Convent? How do nuns try to live a \"life of perfection\"? In this film photographed at the Roman Catholic Convent of the Sisters of the Assumption, London, and the Anglican Community of the Sisters of the Love of God, Oxford, nuns explain their attitude to their work and the world outside."
