        "The opening sequences of this film remind us that the British Isles lie in one of the storm belts of the world, where fog is also a shipping hazzard; animation shows the large number of lighthouses all round British shores. Their position is shown in relation to shipping lanes, and the traffic in these lanes, and in relation to the chief ports. The life of the lighthouse keeper, and his duties, are also dealt with in detail."
