        "Traces the course of the Nile River from Aswan north to Cairo. Within the narrow valley of the river, 15,000,000 people live - essentially an agricultural society which has been dependant on the Nile for many hundreds of years. A study is made of the daily activities of a typical Egyptian farm family; the ploughing and irrigation of the land, unaltered since ancient times; the home life of the women and school activities."
