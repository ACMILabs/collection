        "Episode of Series \"The 19th Century Novel\". Following a dramatised scene from Virginia Woolf's novel \"Life Escapes\", Professor Arnold Kettle argues that Virginia Woolf was not just telling a story but recreating an era of reality and this leads her to break with the traditional form of the novel in a way which emphasises the moment-to-moment impressions of life."
