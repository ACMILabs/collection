        "The film shows the work performed by women in a factory where food is mass-produced. Mass production applies to many other articles besides food, the principles being the same. The work is divided into simple processes, one person doing one thing, usually sitting down. Women in this type of industry may expect good pay for the work, social facilities and medical attention."
