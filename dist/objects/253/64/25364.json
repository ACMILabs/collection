        "Four true cases, where knowledge of basic first aid saves lives, are re-enacted by four teenagers who knew what to do: 2 cases of stopping fatal bleeding are shown along with mouth to mouth resuscitation, and a case of ingested bleeding. The film shows how they went about treating the victim. In addition, basic treatment for shock is demonstrated."
