        "A study of pin mould, one of the commonest of moulds, often appearing on such food as apples, porridge, bread and other moist substances. Time-lapse and microcinematography show a single spore, the germination of many spores, the spreading from this single spore of a branching mass of mould, and the appearance of heads, which contain new spores, released as the heads ripen. Photographed by Percy Smith."
