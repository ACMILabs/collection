        "A fascinating study of a lighthouse-keeper and his family, who tend one of the vital beacons in the storm-tossed waters south of Tasmania - on Maatsuyker Island. The film is outstanding for its treatment of the duties of the lighthouse-keeper, whose life is governed entirely by the light. Photography by Geoffrey Powell; music by Robert W. Hughes."
