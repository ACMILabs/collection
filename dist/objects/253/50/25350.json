        "Studies the structure and habits of the grasshopper and discusses its ability to survive. Compares the life cycle of other insects to that of the grasshopper. Shows the grasshopper's structure and relates it to its ability to survive despite the perils introduced by animals and man. The life cycle of the grasshopper provides a study of incomplete metamorphosis, in contrast with the complete metamorphosis undergone by other insects."
