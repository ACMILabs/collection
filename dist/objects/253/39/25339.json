        "A surprising peek into the hidden world of the underbrush where silent, relentless rivalry is concealed by overhanging foliage or carpets of woodland flowers. What the film brings into focus is a pyramid of life in which lower orders of fauna sustain and support the higher orders. In the plant world we see a similar struggle for supremacy."
