        "A ghetto youth journeys, via elevated train, into neighbourhoods vastly different from his own and indulges in various fantasies about what life is and might be like. The sound track consists of a musical score whose sweet, sentimental melody and lyrics make an ironic contrast to the grim realities of the boy's existence."
