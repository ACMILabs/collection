        "Discusses the problems of traffic congestion in large cities, and advocates a theory of town planning with effective decentralisation. Suggests a complex of small centres around a larger focal point. Although people naturally gravitate to cities most of their activities could be just as well performed in a more rural setting which could also allow for more freedom, individualism and fresh air."
