        "Episode of Series \"Basic Life Science\". Oysters belong to the mollusc family - two irregularly shaped shells protect the oyster's soft body. The interior of the shell is lined with smooth white mother of pearl. We see how increased demands and modern sea farming methods have greatly increased the number of oysters being harvested annually. America imports \"seed\" oysters from Japan to increase production."
