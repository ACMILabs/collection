        "A study of maize, the universal corn, from seed to harvest. Time-lapse and microcinematography combine to give a detailed analysis of this plant; the process of germination, and the action of the stomata in fine and wet weather are demonstrated. Experiments demonstrate which minerals are necessary in the soil if maize is to grow successfully."
