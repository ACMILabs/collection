        "The physical characteristics, life functions, adaptation to environment and means of reproduction of the paramecium, a one-celled animal or protozoa which performs all life functions in a single cell. Some, the volvox, live in colonies and perform special functions, making it possible for new organisms to develop and function. An understanding of the protozoa provides the basis for a better understanding of the functions of all animals."
