        "Wael's powerful, uncompromising short turns the body of its protagonist into a war zone, playing out the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Loosely based on Moroccan author Mohamed Choukri's For bread alone, a young Palestinian prostitute recalls his at times violent sexual awakening. As this all takes place during an encounter with an Israeli male client, Diary of a male whore also highlights the fraught state of the Israeli-Palestinian 'peace' process."
