        "This film was made to commemorate the first crossing of Australia by the standard gauge railway line between Sydney and Perth. It does not attempt to trace this trip, rather, it attempts to capture the spirit of the crossing, the flashes of raw colour as the bleak but beautiful Australian landscape rips past crossing the endless unbroken space of nowhere."
