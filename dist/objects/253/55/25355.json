        "This film, which includes a demonstration of land drill by the Southsea Police Lifeguard Corps (England), shows in detail the various methods needed for rescuing a docile person, a turbulent person, somebody really violent, and a tired but clear-headed swimmer. The sidestroke method of rescue, the surface dive necessary if the subject has sunk, and the use of artificial respiration are also demonstrated."
