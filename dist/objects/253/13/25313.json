        "To ensure a continuing supply of marine products, which make up to 57% of animal protein in the Japanese diet, marine resources must be conserved and protected. Surveys of fishing grounds are made; there are regulations regarding season, fish and equipment; hatcheries for salmon and the cultivation of fish, seaweed and shellfish are increasing; a fishing high school gives special training; and a high standard of automation and hygiene prevails throughout the industry."
