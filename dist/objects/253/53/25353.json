        "Life on 'Strathearn' a farm owned by the Ferguson family, near Ruffy, Victoria, where high quality merino sheep are bred. Land must be cleared, fenced, the fences constantly patrolled for breaks and rabbit holes, and fertilised to produce better pastures, silage and hay. Shows lambing season, shearing, baling the wool, drenching the sheep. Breeding is important if Australia is to maintain its high quality wool."
