        "Produced originally for inclusion in the Melbourne University Architectural Student's Revue, this witty satire denounces the conformity of modern urban society through the character of Robin Beckett, who lives in a rubbish bin and falls in line with other members of his social group. Reviews incidents of a day in his life. No credits available."
