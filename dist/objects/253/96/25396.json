        "Episode of Series \"Art in Action\". Points out that variations in the qualities of lines may be found in nature-lines or rocks, lines on the back of a tiger, and the trail lines made by a snail. Combining photography with animation, illustrates line movement and suggests to children the creative possibilities of materials such as thread, rope and wire as well as paint, chalk and crayon."
