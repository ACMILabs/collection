        "Moholy-Nagy, an exponent of modern design in architecture, painting, theatre and typography, illustrates the forms and relationships of his constructivist art. Constructions of steel, glass and wire, including the artist's light-space modulator, move, merge and dissolve to produce a world of interrelated shapes and patterns. Surface textures, spatial tensions and shadows are combined with the resources of the film cameras - super- impositions, positive-negative contrasts and trick effects to produce rhythms in light, shade, space and movement."
