        "Episode of Series \"Life Around Us\". The development of the wheel is illustrated from its invention to its use in computer machinery. Wheels of all kinds are shown and their common relation to certain laws of energy. This film highlights the problems created by wheels in the United States and other industrialised nations where there are too many, and in underdeveloped countries where there are not enough."
