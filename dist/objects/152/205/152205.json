        "The O'Brien family have served in the army since the 1800s. Noel O'Brien, himself a member of the service, delves into the military history of his family and, in particular, of his father. Francis Charles O'Brien had two regimental numbers to his name and Noel wanted to find out the reason. As a result, he discovers something of his father's personality, a larrikin who got himself into trouble, but was courageous enough to always be there for his mates."
