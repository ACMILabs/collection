        "When Les Jones heard those two magic words \"It's over\", he starting thinking about his future after the war. The middle of three generations of army men, he was part of the last major action in the Pacific part of World War II. As well as being uncertain about his future, Les also thought about those that wouldn't be returning with him. It is with the thoughts of these lost soldiers in mind, that Les considers war and whether or not there is a better way to solve conflict."
