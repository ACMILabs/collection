        "When Alf finished school, World War II had started. He signed up but was not called up for service until after he graduated from Duntroon at age 18. Alf then tells the story of his journey, through the Korean War, the Vietnam War to training in Europe and how he got to see the effects of war first-hand. A distinguised man who led an extraordinary life."
