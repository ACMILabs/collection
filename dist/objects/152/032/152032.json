        "After joining the Navy when he turned 17, one of the first lessons Warwick Johanson learnt was that if anything moved, you saluted it, if it stood still, you polished it. His home for over four years was aboard the flagship, the HMAS Australia, often a target for the formidable Japanese Kamakaze. Warwick also reflects on World War II and what it was like in Australia, when the country was actually in peril, almost unimaginable in this day and age."
