        "Bob Bloch and Frank Arndt are both war veterans with very different stories but these men have the same vibrant enthusiasm for life. Bob Bloch ran the Meeniyan Pharmacy for over fifty years while living out his boyhood dream of becoming a pilot and restoring vintage cars. Frank Arndt, while a newcomer to the town, feels he has finally found his rightful place in Meeniyan and is heavily involved in community activities such as contract bridge and table tennis."
