        "Contestants are wearing sound-proof headphones so that they can\u2019t hear each other\u2019s answers and are asked the same questions. The person with the correct answer then gets to 'pick a box\u2019 to win a prize, which could be anything from elastic bands to a new car. The compere Bob, takes the chosen box, looks at the prize written inside and then without revealing it to the contestant, offers a sum of money in place of the prize. The contestant must then decide whether to keep the prize and leave, or play a new opponent for the chance to add to their prize haul but also risk losing it. Barry Jones who became the undefeated champion went on to become a State and Federal Member of Parliament. Screened on the Seven Network. Source:  Australian Screen"
