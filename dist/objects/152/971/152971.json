        "Shirley Cornish joined the army when a friend, from the store where she worked, said she would. She joined the Australian Womens Army Service and spent most of her life in the service of the army, and tells of her times there and friends made. Army life often bled into Shirley's personal life, losing a rank in order to spend more time with her mother and, later, joining the Bentleigh War Widows and Widowed Mothers after her husband died. Shirley considers joining this association to be the best thing she ever did and even went on to become its president."
