        "Joanne Harding was sent to Rwanda as part of the Australian Defence Force medical Support Force. She focuses on the part of her experience that affected her the most, the eyes of the children. She describes their eyes as pools of nothingness as they begin to accept war as part of their everyday life. In turn, Joanne begins to question the effectiveness of her role and that of the United Nations in bringing peace to this wartorn country."
