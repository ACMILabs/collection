        "John Deighton admits that at 18, everyone believes that they are bulletproof but the adventure of war stops when people start dying. He believes that the instant replay effect and the televisation of the Vietnam War was a factor in its unpopularity. He remembers the poor treatment Vietnam vets received on their return and how unfair it was as they were just doing their job."
