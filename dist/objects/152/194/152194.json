        "Alfred Maskell just wanted to see the world. In 1941, he joined the Australian army and was sent to Malaya. By the time he got there, it was clear the Australian forces were up against it, fighting a strong enemy with weaponry from the previous World War. By the end of the year they were captured by the Japanese and forced to perform many unsavoury tasks, from burying Chinese civilians to working on the Thai-Burma railway and, finally, in Japan where he stayed till the war ended. This is a story of the brutality that many prisoners of war suffered during World War 2."
