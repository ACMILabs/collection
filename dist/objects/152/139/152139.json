        "Following the success of his children\u2019s animated film 'Blinky Bill The Mischievous Koala' (1992), animator Yoram Gross moved into television production, developing the Blinky Bill television series to great acclaim. The TV series takes up where the film leaves off, with the animals recovering from the destruction of their village and beginning again. (Source:  Australian Screen Online.) In Episode One, 'Blinky Bill's Favourite Cafe', Blinky and his friends set about getting their beloved \"Paragon Cafe\" rebuilt, despite some strong opposition from the Dingoes."
