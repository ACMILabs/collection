        "Confusion reigns as Vince (Aaron Pederson) receives his blood test results forcing him to confront his father about his background which unravels more secrets and deception. This revelation sends him on a quest to uncover his Aboriginal ancestry. Meanwhile, Vince stumbles across four homeless Aboriginal people in a local park, all of them deceased. He sends out a distress call to the police, Bill (Tony Martin) and Charlie (Alex Dimitriades) who investigate the crime scene. Tensions escalate as discrimination in the local community is heightened due to the recent Aboriginal deaths which have now been linked to a batch of home brew laced with rat poison."
