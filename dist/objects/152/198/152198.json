        "As a Victorian war veteran, Cliff Richards encapsulates his experiences during the war through the various sounds that assailed him. Sounds of helicopters, loud noises and, the one he feared the most, the sound of silence. He considers what the different sounds signify both for him and others and the way the everyday sounds of today can echo the horrors of the past."
