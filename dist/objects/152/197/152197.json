    "description": [
        "Valda Maskell, with the assistance of her husband Alfred, gives a touching account of how their love for each other survived World War 2. Valda met Alfred in Bendigo and they managed to get engaged just before Alfred was despatched to Malaya to fight the Japanese. The story is mostly told from Valda's perspective, how she joined the RAAF and worked there as a cook and how she spent three years working there, all the while knowing nothing of Alfred's fate. On his return, Valda promptly went AWOL, married Alfred and shares with us the ups and downs of her life with a returned soldier, who was also a prisoner of war."
