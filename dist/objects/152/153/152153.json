    "description": [
        "The first screening of film in Australia took place in a shop at 148 Pitt St, Sydney. The public paid a shilling to view images of an American circus and vaudeville performers on the Edison Kinetoscope. Unlike the later movie projection of the Lumiere Brothers, the Kinetoscope was a box containing a 50-foot loop of film watched through an eyepiece by a single viewer. 25,000 people paid to watch the Kinetoscope in the first month of exhibition.  This footage contains images seen at Sydney's Kinetoscope Parlour on opening day, 30 November 1894: Comical Barbershop Scene March 1894; Annabelle's Skirt Dance March 1894; Bar room Scene July 1894. Also shows images of Edison at work in his chemical laboratory April 1897."
