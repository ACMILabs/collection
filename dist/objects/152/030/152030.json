        "Some say the happiest day in New Orleans is Shrove Tuesday. And it is a day that stands for the entire carnival season with its Mardi Gras carnival parade. In this film the theme of the procession is \"Toys\" and every float is a variation on that theme. the people of the Algiers stage their parade on the broad waters of the Mississippi. Completely planned, financed and executed with thirty or more secret organisations - a great deal of the activities are directed by tradition."
