    "description": [
        "Catching mumps just before his 18th birthday prevented Kevin Coughlin from joining the RAAF during the second World War. But thanks to his connections, he was able to get work as a Wireless Telegraphist. In the end, Kevin ended up with skills that made him unique. Naturally left handed, he was forced to tap out morse code with his right hand. This afforded him a dexterity that meant he could do morse code with his right hand and write with his left which made him invaluable. He tells of his time in Darwin and, later, on Peron Island in the Timor Sea."
