        "A colonial Australian western TV series set in the 1860s, which was produced specifically for the international market. A man's farm is burned down by a land-hungry man who trades on people's fears by terrorising their families and ruining their property in an attempt to buy land at a low price. Cobb (Peter Graves) undertakes a hazardous crossing of an Aboriginal burial ground in an effort to assist the terrorised farmer.  Screened on the Seven Network."
