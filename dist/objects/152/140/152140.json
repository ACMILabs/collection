        "Following the success of his children\u2019s animated film 'Blinky Bill The Mischievous Koala' (1992), animator Yoram Gross moved into television production, developing the Blinky Bill television series to great acclaim. The TV series takes up where the film leaves off, with the animals recovering from the destruction of their village and beginning again. (Source: Australian Screen Online) In Episode Two, 'Blinky Bill's Fire Brigade', Blinky and his friends set about starting a fire brigade to protect their town. Unfortunately, the gang seem to be making more problems rather than solving them."
