        "A psychological portrait of a man who's life has been marred by the horrors of war, as seen by his son. The English family were aware that when George English came back to Australia after the war he was a changed man but it wasn't until son Robert volunteered to go to Vietnam that feelings George couldn't disguise any longer came to the fore. In telling his story of his voyage back to Australia and their detour through Java. it became clear that George had been hiding the profound sense of guilt about surviving the war when many of his colleagues didn't."
