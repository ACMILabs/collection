        "Paul was taught from an early age to fear the spread of communism. Then the opportunity came to fight it when he was conscripted in the army during the Vietnam war. Initially, it was a lark travelling around Vietnam, visiting villages, but things got serious soon enough. A priest was flown in and soldiers either clung on to their beliefs, or questioned them. Paul's involvement in the war put him at odds with his father but, having experienced war first-hand, Paul begins to understand why his father felt the way he did."
