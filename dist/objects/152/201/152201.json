    "description": [
        "When Major John Balsillie was first posted to Malaya during World War II, he became interested in World War II research and military history. It soon developed into a passion and he shipped off over 20 crates of war relics to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. He talks of his subsequent visits during the 1960s and the second time he served, in Vietnam. This interest became a lifelong passion for John, for which he was recently awarded an MBE for services to the Australian War Memorial. John sees his role as providing a record of the brave soldiers who gave their lives for Australia."
