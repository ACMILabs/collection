        "Harry Barkla was part of the 39th Battalion, made up mostly of Chocolate (Chocco) soldiers. They were called this because it was thought that they would melt in the sun, that they wouldn't know how to fight. In Kokoda, they soon proved themselves and Harry talks about some of the horrific experiences he went through that were typical of this war. These are some of his memories that he has tried to forget but never can. Even if you didn't know someone's name in the 39th Battalion, you still called them mate and you never forget your mates."
