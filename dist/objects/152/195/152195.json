        "Even though Arthur Harridge believes each service being as important as the other, he was primarily an airforce man. He tells of leaving his home and loved ones aboard the Mariposa, bound for the United States and then Europe, where he experienced the horrors of war first hand. An emotional account of the horrors of war, the things that kept the soldiers going returning home and trying to forget."
