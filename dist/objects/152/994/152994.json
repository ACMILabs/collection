        "When he signed up as a conscript, Bill Goodes was given the number V160777 and the label Choco. He knew it was given to the conscripts that, like him, fought in New Guinea, but he had no idea what it meant, though he did sense the connotation was negative. He reflects on how he fought like any other soldier, for three years without a break. In New Guinea, he was just like everyone else. But when he returned to Australia to take up life as a dairy farmer, he soon realised that some people just saw him as a Choco. For Bill, none of this has detracted from his contribution to the war effort."
