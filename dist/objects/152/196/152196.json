        "A recent visit to Darwin with his son reminded Bill Hosking of the time that war came to Australia. As one of the men who defended Darwin during that time, he was instructed to keep the details of the attack secret. In 1942, Bill Hosking joined up and was shipped up to train in the Northern Territory. It was during this time that the air raids on Darwin took place. Bill shares his experiences because he believes that not many people today know the story of how Australia came under attack."
