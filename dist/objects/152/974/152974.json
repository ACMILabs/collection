        "When he was 13, Stan Guilfoyle was in an accident in which he nearly died. From then on he believed in seizing every moment. This enthusiasm for life took him to the Royal Australian Air Force, where he became proficient at flying, using only the instruments in his cockpit to navigate. He tells of his time in Indonesia during World War II and passionately shares his views on war."
