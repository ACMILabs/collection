        "Doss Jenkins' driving instructor was not fond of female drivers and was strict but she passed and soon became part of a long convoy transporting American goods over Australia. The journey was a gruelling and hot 108 weeks on the road, travelling at 50km an hour. Doss reflects on the things that kept her going, the games she played and the friends she made. This group of ladies still have an annual reunion due to the strong bond created by the journey."
