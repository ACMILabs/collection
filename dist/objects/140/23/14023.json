        "Fade in, fade out. The present moment never lasts.  Everything you see and feel right now will leave you.... The five vignettes are all shot during one train journey through the Madhya Pradesh state of India. The camera lense lingers briefly, in slow motion, on the passing landscapes and inhabitants - capturing the mood and movements of the outside world. Soundtrack recorded and produced by Sami Ramir."
