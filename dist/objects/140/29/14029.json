Starring Charles \"Bud Tingwell \" as a time travelling scientist, BTTP sends students back in time to historical Melbourne using archival footage, animation and green screen technology.

In the program Students become actors in a sci-fi time travel film story during a blue-screen workshop that allows them to place themselves in a historical Melbourne setting, engage with a screening program featuring historical Melbourne footage and participate in a related discussion learn some simple editing skills while they create a digital 'Melbourne travelogue' Back to the Past aims to develop students' understanding of ways in which film-makers create screen texts to target particular audiences.
