        "A rich and haunting collection of early works from an artist who paints with fragments of image and sound from New York street life. Dogs, passing cars, the homeless, drugged and alienated people drift through these works, in the rhythms of their own time. Simple mysteries are uncovered through a window, in half deserted streets, and in wind blown garbage. Voices become confessions, shadows become cinematic and we are absorbed and compiled into a world of wonder, in which people inevitably leave traces - and lists."
