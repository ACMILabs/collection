        "In this  story the ACMI Screen Pit becomes a Sunridge High classroom. Oscar from Short Cuts is auditioning for roles in his latest film 'Super Geek 2'. He tries to get the Short Cuts kids to do it but has no luck, so he turns to the 'new class' for help.  Produced in Melbourne and screened on the Seven Network, Short Cuts is a terrific local TV series set in a Year 9 Media Studies class. Short Cuts' stories explore how the video camera can be a tool of expression, exploration and communication - and also of manipulation, secrecy and lies. Slowly, the characters find ways of using the camera and in the process, find out more about themselves, each other, their friends, their families and the world."
