        "A searing vision of a Sydney rarely seen by tourists but one that is just below the surface. A cult hit in the past, this film has been described by Philip Adams as one of the ten best made in this country. It is the story of four young women on the town the night before one of them is travelling to New York. Their adolescence, their group, their future is breaking up. Starring Tracy Mann and David Argue."
