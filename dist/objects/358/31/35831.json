        "Norman Kaye won the AFI's best actor award for this stunning portrayal of Charles Bremer, a strange and sensitive man, whose sensual appreciation of all things beautiful led to his bizarre and erotic relationship with a young bi-sexual named Lisa. \"Man of Flowers\" is both erotic and richly amusing with a tragic after glow."
