        "Taketoki Washizu is a general serving-hand and Tsuzuki, the master of Cobweb Castle. Prompted by his wife, Washizu murders Tsuzuki and takes command of Cobweb Castle. He is killed in battle when the son of a rival warlord, one of his victims, attacks the castle. Kurosawa's visually atmospheric version of Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" stars Toshiro Mifune."
