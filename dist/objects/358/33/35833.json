        "This adaptation of Nene Gare's novel about contemporary life among Australian aborigines shows them as outcasts in their own country, despised by the whites, disinclined to work at the menial jobs they can get, and with a big partiality to alcohol. The Comeaway family is persuaded by their 15 year old daughter Trilby to move from the shanty town to a new estate. She is determined not to fall into the same overbreeding, underachieving trap as the women around her, but finds that events conspire against her."
