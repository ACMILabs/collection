        "Vincent Van Gogh died, a pauper, on 29 July 1880 at the age of 37. In less than ten years he had produced some 1,800 works, only one of which had been sold. This film is a meditation on the actual paintings and drawings of Van Gogh, and the influences upon him. The script is made up entirely of letters the artist wrote over 18 years to his beloved brother Theo and these are read by British actor, John Hurt."
