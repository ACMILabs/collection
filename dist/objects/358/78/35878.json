        "Although the plot is quite close to that of Bram Stoker's Dracula the emotional and intellectual emphases are different. The figure of Count Orlok resembling an animated corpse is far from Stoker's well-groomed, demonic vampire Nosferatu exhibits none of the shadow play of Caligari. Murnau showed how the fantastic film could gain from the use of real settings and the imaginative treatment of space. This feeling of landscape became a central element of the classic vampire film."
