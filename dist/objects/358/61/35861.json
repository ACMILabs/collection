        "A small band of men and women survive the sinking of an Allied freighter by a German U-boat, only to find themselves dependent upon a Nazi they rescue from the sea into their lifeboat. With the help of a John Steinbeck script and bravura performances from a cast that includes Tallulah Bankhead, Walter Slezak and Hume Cronyn, Hitchcock transforms the cramped confines of the lifeboat into a bigger-than-life battlefield of good and evil. \"Lifeboat\" is a tour de force only the Master of Suspense - Alfred Hitchcock could have created."
