        "Hilarious Japanese comedy about two truckdrivers, Goro (a noodle connoisseur) and Gun, who stop at a non-de-script noodle restaurant where they encounter its proprietor, Tampopo, and her bullying admirer Pisken. Goro is beaten up by Pisken and his associates and he awakens on the floor of Tampopo's restaurant. She asks him to help her save her restaurant and so the search for the perfect noodle is begun, with the help of an odd assortment of characters, food, wine and a touch of sex."
