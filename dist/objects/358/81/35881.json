        "Born Alexander Archibald Leech in Bristol, England 1904, the son of working class parents. Always interested in acting and the theatre, Cary rose to fame after being discovered by Mae West. Her confidence in the young man she befriended paid off when Cary overcame his humble beginnings to become a favourite Hollywood icon, whose resume of films include 'Bringing Up Baby', 'An Affair to Remember', 'His Girl Friday' and 'North by Northwest'. This documentary highlights the highs and lows of his career and uses family photos, archival footage and clips from his films to show the many faces of one of Hollywood's most admired male actors. Includes interviews with friends and colleagues including: Leslie Caron; Douglas Fairbanks Jr; Deborah Kerr; Eva Marie Saint; Ralph Bellamy; Stanley Donen; Richard Brooks and Stanley Kramer."
