        "Evading taxes is a popular pastime in \"The Land of the Rising Yen\", especially among the predatory real estate tycoons who, in collusion with politicians, gangsters and large \"straight\" business combines, have made Japan's land prices the highest in the world. To combat this pandemic \"lawlessness\" there is a national tax police, who, with their almost storm trooper tactics, make America's much maligned IRS inspectors seem almost helpful. In Japanese with English subtitles."
