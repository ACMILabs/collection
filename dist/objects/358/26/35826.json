        "The story of a man who believed in a dream and the woman who stood by his side. The story continues today in the outback, in the rodeo arenas of the west, the frontier towns, the highway truck stops, the aboriginal tribal lands of the Red Centre and the largest concert halls in Australia. Every year they wait for him; from Alice Springs to Sydney, from Kunnamulla to Gundagai. The call him \"the man with his hat turned down in front\" - the man who is Australia - Slim Dusty."
