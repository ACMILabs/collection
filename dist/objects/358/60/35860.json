        "A brilliant construction of the momentous events of 1917, when revolutionary soldiers, sailors and factory workers overthrew the provisional Government of Russia, bringing Lenin and the Bolsheviks to power. Made by Sergei Eisenstein just ten years after the revolution. The vitality of his imagination, the symbols and metaphors with which he illuminates history, the fantastic spectacle, the sheer erudition have survived six decades undiminished."
