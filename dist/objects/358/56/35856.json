        "Johnny O'Keefe, the man who almost single-handedly created the Australian rock`n'roll industry. The man who challenged the Americans and broke all the rules, and whose reward was the devotion of millions of fans for a generation. This is the true story - all the triumphs and all the tears that drove the man forward and ultimately to his tragic, untimely death in 1978. A must for everyone who was there."
