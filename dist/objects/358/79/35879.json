        "Ingrid Bergman, winner of three Academy Awards, was one of Hollywood's and the world's most beloved and respected stars. Whatever her role, be it barmaid or Joan of Arc, to millions she embodied all that was decent and wholesome in womanhood...until she dared to follow her own heart. Narrated by John Gielgud."
