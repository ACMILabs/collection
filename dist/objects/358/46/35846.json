        "Join in the singing, the flag-waving, the dancing, the scandal and the fights that made the roaring twenties such an exciting and memorable time for Australia. Undercover catches the glitter and madness of those times and follows one typical Australian whose imagination, drive and energy turned his impossible dream into reality. Stars Genevieve Picot."
