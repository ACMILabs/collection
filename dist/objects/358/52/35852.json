        "The cinema classic features the legendary Lon Chaney in one of his finest performances. The famed unmasking sequence is still powerful after all these years, and the final scene of the Phantom restraining the mobs of Paris to protect his true love will linger in the memory. Colour-tinted version with music accompaniment provided by the City of Prague Philharmonic."
