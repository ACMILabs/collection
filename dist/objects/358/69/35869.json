        "Maureen O'Hara is a beautiful damsel in distress who must contend with the madness of the evil Squire Pengallon, the chief of a band of cut throats who lures ships onto the rocks in Victorian times. The opening of the film sets the tone: a \"Jamaica Inn\" sign half in gloom buffeted by wind and rain. Charles Laughton is memorable as the evil Squire. Rated: PG"
