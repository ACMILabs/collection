        "Heidi, a high spirited Swiss orphan, is taken to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps where she lives in harmony with her surroundings and becomes friends with Peter, a young goatherd. Her Aunt arrives unexpectedly and forces her to leave the mountains and the grandfather she adores. She is taken to live with a city family and although she becomes close to Clara, her young companion who is doomed to spend her life in a wheelchair, Heidi is terribly homesick and wonders if she will ever return to the mountains to see her grandfather again."
