        "The high walls of a prison. Two running shadows in the night, a parked Volvo car whose engine is running. Suddenly, the shrieking sound of an alarm hooter. Both men get hastily inside the car which starts immediately. A well directed drama about a retired gangster (Yves Montand) forced into an antagonistic relationship with a young punk. (Gerard Depardieu)."
