        "For almost a year the world's most famous working steam locomotive, The Flying Scotsman 4472 from Britain, thrilled Australian steam enthusiasts from coast to coast. During 1988/89 4472 visited five Australian States and the Northern Territory. Its spectacular parallel runs, double-heading and solo trips have been brilliantly recorded by camera crews from ABCTV, from the air, trackside and on board."
