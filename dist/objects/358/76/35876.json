        "Take three of the world's best stunt skiers - cliff-jumper Scot Schmidt, extreme skier - Bad boy Glen Plake, and precision skier Mike Hattrup ... transport them to the finest steep terrain in the world - from Switzerland to France's Chamonix Valley to California's awe inspiring Squaw Valley ... engage some slick cameramen ... set the results to an original soundtrack ranging from hot rap to Euro-funk, including Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Propaganda and ACT ... and what do you have? \"The Blizzard of AAHHH's\" - a vividly photographed, tightly edited rock video movie. Ever bolder jumps, twists, straight shots through chutes, games of chicken with crevasses and other activities designed to make insurance company rate-setters squeal with delight! Rated: G"
