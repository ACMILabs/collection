        "Based on Edmond Rostand's classic play this film version has Jose Ferrer in an Academy Award winning performance as the long nosed Cyrano. Famous for his skill with words Cyrano mocks pompous noblemen, protects the poor and displays unmatched bravery but he nurses a secret love for his beautiful cousin Roxanne, who is also loved by a handsome but inarticulate soldier, who seeks Cyrano's help in wooing her. Also stars Mala Powers and William Prince."
