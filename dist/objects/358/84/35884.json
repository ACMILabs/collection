        "Orlando is forced to flee to the forest to escape the evil plots of his jealous brother, Oliver. Rosalind incurs her uncle's wrath and also flees to the forest, accompanied by Celia and Touchstone the clown. Disguised as a youth known as Ganymede, Rosalind meets Orlando who confides his love for Rosalind to Ganymede (Rosalind). Oliver arrives in the forest and is saved from certain death by Orlando and the two brothers are reconciled. Oliver woos Celia, Touchstone woos the dullwitted Audrey, Silvius (a shepherd) woos Phoebe and Phoebe woos the disguised Rosalind who finally reveals her identity to Orlando. The four pairs of lovers are united in the feast of Hymen."
