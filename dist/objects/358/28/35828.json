        "Jean Renoir's classic study of men in war. The German victor and his captive officers in the close proximity of the prison camp become strangely impacted by the ironic contradictions of their situations. A deep respect develops between the German commander and his captive French officer, inter- woven with each other's obligations to country and fellow-man. Cast includes Erich von Stroheim and Jean Gabin."
