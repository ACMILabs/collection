        "Dusty is a film that will captivate with its value of love, loyalty and the quest for freedom. Based on the classic Australian book by Frank Dalby Davison, this is the story of an ill-fated bond between an old man and his dog. Tom Lincoln, an ageing drover, buys Dusty in a hotel, unaware that the dog is part kelpie and part dingo. He trains Dusty into a champion sheep dog and becomes aware his dog has the killer in his blood. Finally he returns to the bush, set apart from the world by his love for his dog."
