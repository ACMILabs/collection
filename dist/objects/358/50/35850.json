        "In 16th century Japan a primitive village, dreading the annual raid of bandits who carry off the harvest and the village girls, decides to hire Samurai to help defend themselves. With his help, six others are recruited. Overcoming the villagers' fears, the Samurai begin to organise their defence. After a long period of waiting, the bandits attack. A series of violent battles follows, which ends at last in victory for the Samurai and the villagers. Stars Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura. Also available on DVD [319261]."
