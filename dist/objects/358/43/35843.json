        "Considered Eisenstein's greatest achievement, a successful experiment in stylisation drawing upon other arts - Wagnerian opera, Marinsky ballet and Japanese Kabuki theatre - which he had begun in \"Alexander Nevsky\". The striking, complex and tragically contradictory personality of Ivan attracted Eisenstein and he delved deeply into the man's character. In his earlier films he showed himself an unsurpassed portrayer of mass behaviour, but the most compelling aspect of Ivan is the psychological analysis of the dramatic struggle between Ivan and his enemies. Cast includes Nikolai Cherkasov and Ludmila Tselikovskaya."
