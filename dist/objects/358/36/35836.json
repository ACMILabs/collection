        "Harvey Denton (Colin Friels) is movie cameraman who is plunged into a bewildering series of events when, one night, his flat is viciously ransacked. Someone is after something, but what? Now Trebilcock of ASIO, Australia's secret service, contacts Harvey with strange news. The body of his father, a documentary filmmaker, missing since Harvey was a boy, has been found in the desert outback, buried inside a thirty year old plane wreck and the wreck is discovered to be radioactive."
