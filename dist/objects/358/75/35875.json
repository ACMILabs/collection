        "Steam Locomotives are seen alive and well in the vast expanses of the Indian subcontinent where these engines are still a key component in modern Indian commerce. This film focuses on two locomotive personalities from the history of steam: the 4472 \"Flying Scotsman\" on its last non-stop London to Edinburgh run, and an impressive 1/8th scale model of the largest steam locomotive ever built, the Union Pacific \"Big Boy\". Rated: G"
