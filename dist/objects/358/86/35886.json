        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". Central to this story is the love of Helena, orphaned daughter of a celebrated physician, for Bertram, son of Countess Rousilon in whose house she has been brought up. Through the Countess' skill the King allows Helena to marry Bertram but he, considering this an unfair alliance after pledging his vows, rejects Helena and leaves for Florence stipulating seemingly impossible tasks for her to fulfil for him to return. Through a daring plot Helena fulfils his conditions, saves Bertram from arrest and is reunited in marital harmony."
