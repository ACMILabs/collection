        "The sights and sounds of a people at war, told without commentary or dialogue - the roar of tanks and planes, the voices of children, the multi lingual radio commentators, Commonwealth soldiers, Flanagan and Allen singing \"Underneath the Arches\", Myra Hess playing a Mozart concerto, a military brass band counterpointed with genius and affection to scenes in streets and factories and country places. This film is considered one of the most successful of the documentary films of Humphrey Jennings."
