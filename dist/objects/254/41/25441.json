        "From the story by American children's author, Charles Tazewell. A series of animated sketches are used to illustrate the well-known story of the littlest angel in Paradise who gave a simple wooden box containing a stone, a dog-collar and a pressed butterfly as his offering to celebrate the birth of the Christ-child. His gift is transformed by God into the Star of Bethlehem."
