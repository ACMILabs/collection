        "This film shows the inspiration, often related to belief in the supernatural, behind Inuit sculpture. The Inuit's approach to the work is to release the image he sees imprisoned in the rough stone. The film centres on an old legend about the carving of the image of a sea spirit to bring food to a hungry camp. Photographed at Cape Dorset, Boffin Island with Inuit stone carvers of Kingait and Kangiyak. Award winning documentary."
