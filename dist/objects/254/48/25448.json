        "Can a murderer become rehabilitated while he sits in death row for nine years awaiting electrocution? If he can, should his sentence be commuted to life? A young Chicago attorney answers \"yes\" to both questions. He then undergoes the agony and elation of a successful plea to the parole board with famed Louis Nizer at his side. Filmed with hand-held camera and sound recorder."
