        "Lack of proper care during the handling of cargo is the cause of frequent accidents on the docks. Safety regulations, safe equipment, and marked safe working loads help, but safe working men are the most important. Stresses teamwork, building proper stacks, and breaking them down correctly, using mechanical equipment with care and realising the risks involved around the hold where uneven footing leads to falls and foot injuries."
