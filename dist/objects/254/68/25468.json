        "Cinemagazine items: Nearly everywhere today a major concern is cutting back on waste to help preserve resources. This film spots a few obvious, and a few very strange areas where intriguing new ways are being developed for reducing waste. Domestic waste; agricultural waste; transport waste; waste television space; cattle-feed research to improve milk production are shown."
