        "Cinemagazine items: Coal and oil for fuel will one day run out, even the fuel for conventional nuclear reactors is in short supply. Yet every day the sun pumps massive amounts of energy into the earth and its atmosphere. Looks at some of the proposed new methods for harnessing the enormous natural flow of renewable energy: heat from the sun; power from the wind; photosynthesis; hydrogen; solar cells."
