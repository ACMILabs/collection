        "From the Royal Doulton potteries in Burslem in England have come, during the past years, more than two thousand individual figure creations in fine china; each figure the product of creative imagination, patient craftsmanship and technical skill; each a work of art. Shows the complete ceramic process from a preliminary sketch to the finished figurine. A selection of pottery wares - characters from Dickens and Shakespear, from history and folklore - are shown."
