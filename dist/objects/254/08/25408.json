        "Twenty-four hours in the operation of the British Railways cross-channel ferry services, which join the roads and railways of Britain with those of Europe. The SS Lord Warden is seen carrying between Dover and Boulogne as many as 130 cars and a thousand passengers. A freight train ferry plies between Zeebrugge and Harwich loaded with fruit from the Mediterranean. A third example is that of the Night Train Ferry which takes its sleeping passengers direct from London to Paris."
