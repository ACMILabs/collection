        "Peter McDonald's Harvey takes the notion of 'finding your other half' to its logical and very gory conclusion. In stark black and white, a woman is spied on by an unseen man who lives in the apartment across from her. When the woman falls in the shower and is knocked unconscious, the man takes this opportunity to finally reveal his true, mangled self. Cast features Nicholas Hope as Harvey and Lisa Angove as Lily."
