        "Cinemagazine items: \"Speedaway\" is a fast travelling walkway system which could soon be speeding pedestrians across our cities; a new extrusion process puts new tread on old tyres, moulding liquid rubber direct on to the casing; the Neo-Natometer is a simple but effective means for measuring a baby's length; out of one suitcase come the basic modules which assemble into an armchair - these modules can easily be cut into new shapes and anything from a wardrobe to a dining table can be constructed from them."
