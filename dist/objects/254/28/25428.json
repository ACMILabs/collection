        "Modern science continues to wage its war on pests of all type. But even science makes little progress against that contemptible pest - the litterbug. Who but Donald Duck should be better suited to portray this scourge of the cities beaches and mountains. With great skill, daring and deep dedication to his task, he methodically deposits his litter for all to see, happy in the realisation that no likely spot has been overlooked."
