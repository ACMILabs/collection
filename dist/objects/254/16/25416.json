        "At times the whole world listens for much is at stake. Many sounds compete for our attention the louder ones are often missed. Listening is essential to true communication and although 70% of our time is estimated to be spent in communication and listening takes up the bulk of that time it is often done badly. In personal relations or at work or at school, we should listen not merely for information, but also for understanding. Real listening is not passive, in the end it saves time and sometimes money."
