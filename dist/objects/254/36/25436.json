        "Isle of the Dead, by the 19th Century painter Arnold Boecklin, is the subject of this McLaren experimental film. The spectral island wakes to mysterious life, flickers in candlelight and fades again into the dark - the whole effect heightened by an interpretive musical score. Music, Louis Applebaum. (Award: Salerno.)"
