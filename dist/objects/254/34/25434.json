        "An animated film which dramatises the plight of today's urban dweller. Shows the city's relentless assault on the health of its inhabitants. The `little man' lives in a typical urban centre where poor planning, haphazard design and inadequate health controls have depleted him - emotionally and physically. The film urges united action to make cities healthy and enjoyable places in which to live."
