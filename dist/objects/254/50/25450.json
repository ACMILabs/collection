        "Recommends precautions against bush fires in outer-suburban and rural areas. Common fire hazards on suburban properties include undergrowth and scrub on fences, overhanging trees, cluttered spoutings, absence of fly wire on doors and windows to prevent entry of sparks; absence of incinerators and compost heaps to dispose of rubbish. In rural areas the responsibility of the inidividual is greater. The film shows examples of bad fire hazards; crops growing close to buildings; absence of fire breaks; litter strewn over properties. Stresses the need to check spark arrestors on machinery and to maintain fire fighting gear in working condition. In one year, bush fires cost the country fourteen million pounds, a loss which could have been avoided by people being wise before the event. Photography by Frank Bagnall."
