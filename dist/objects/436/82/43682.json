        "Prepare to meet some nuns like you've never met before. Junkie nightclub singer Yolanda Bell (Christina S Pascual), takes refuge with the religious order 'the humble redeemers', after her boyfriend overdoses on heroin and Yolanda's on the run from the police. 'The humble redeemers' are a good hearted group, trying to save girls from leading a wild life. They do however have a dark side to their operations; dealing drugs, dabbling in pornography and active chain smoking admirers of Cecil Barton. Together they are planning a party to celebrate Mother Superior's name day; it will be a party to end all parties. Described as an evil twin of films such as 'Sister act' and 'The Sound of music', this film is Almodovar at his devilish and controversial best. Cast includes Julieta Serrano, Julia Marisa Paredes and Mary Carrillo. In Spanish with English subtitles."
