        "After his girl friend mysteriously disappears at a petrol station, Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) begins a year long quest to find her. Not even a new love (Nancy Travis), can distract him, and after much secrecy he is forced to bring her in on his quest. Unknown to Jeff, he himself is being stalked by the calculating psychopath (Jeff Bridges), responsible for kidnapping his girlfriend in the first place. Jeff and his new girlfriend are led on a chilling reenactment of the fate that occurred a year ago. Cast includes Kiefer Sutherland, Sandra Bullock, Nancy Travis, Park Overall and Maggie Linderman. This is a remake of director Sluizer's 1988 Dutch version (302156)."
