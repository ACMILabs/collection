        "Hester (Pamela Rabe) is a lonely woman who has spent all her life on her father's farm in outback NSW. Katherine (Miranda Otto), is a young woman alone in the world until she comes to live with Hester as her housemaid. The two form a happy friendship, until one night it all falls apart when Katherine runs over and kills a man. The haunting cinematography and strong acting performances produce a powerful tale of rural isolation and trust betrayed. Cinematography by Mandy Walker."
