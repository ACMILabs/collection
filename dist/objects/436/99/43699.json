        "The badly beaten, gang-raped corpse of a 15 year old girl is discovered on a deserted stretch of beach after an all-night beach party, celebrating the return of local surfing legend, Ricko, goes out of control. The working class Australian coastal community of Blackrock goes into an uproar, and is promptly splintered by shame, deceit and mistrust. 17 year old Jared (who organised Ricko's party at the local surf club), is left with the wrenching decision whether or not to rat on his mates. Cast includes Laurence Breuls, Linda Cropper, Simon Lyndon, Chris Haywood, Rebecca Smart, Essie Davis and Jessica Napier."
