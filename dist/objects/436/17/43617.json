        "This interactive CD-ROM takes the viewer on a tour of the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Russia. The museum was built during the 18th century to house the private art collection of the Tsars, today it houses more than 3,000,000 artefacts from Prehistory to Modern Day. You can take your pick of video clips about Rembrandt, French, Roman and Italian Art; look at music and the arts, in particular Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky; take guided tours of Russian, Western European and Oriental Art, the Golden Chamber, architecture, art of classical antiquity; as well as looking through maps and essays written by museum experts."
