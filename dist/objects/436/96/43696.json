        "In 1917 two English girls, Elise Wright and Frances Griffiths photographed fairies in their garden. These photographs became known as the Cottingley photographs, eponymous from the village where the girls lived. This led to the often asked question, \"do fairies exist?\". This event led to a nation wide search for the truth, led by two personalities of the day, Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel), and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole). Although this film is based on a true event; the existence of the photographs, the film's ending does differ from the truth that eventuated much later. A magical tale that will enchant viewers of all ages. Cast includes Florence Hoath, Elizabeth Earl, Paul McGann and Phoebe Nicholls."
