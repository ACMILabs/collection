        "Comical farce about descendants of Frankenstein's creator returning to the town of Mucklefugger to live at their unclaimed estate. Aunt Tillie helps the wayward women of the town save their home; the Cradle, rebelling also against unscrupulous and incompetent town officials who endeavour to take over their estate. Accompanied by two lusty side-kicks, the film barely holds together with plot, digressing into many directions at times. Be warned, this is a silly movie. Cast includes Donald Pleasance, Yvonne Furneaux, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Miguel Angel Fuentes. WARNING: THE PICTURE JUMPS AT THE BEGINNING AND THERE IS SOME DROPOUT."
