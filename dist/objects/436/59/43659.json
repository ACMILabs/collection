        "Openly gay, the Bronskis became cover darlings of the British music press in 1984 after the U.K. success of their first two singles, \"Why\" and \"Smalltown Boy\" (the latter producing one of the best music videos of all time). A synth-pop trio from London, everything that made Bronski Beat interesting, and at times compelling, came primarily from the larynx of Glasgow-born vocalist Jimmy Somerville. This tape is comprised of mainly music videos."
