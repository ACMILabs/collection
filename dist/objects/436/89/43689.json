        "In \"A Wayne in a manger\", Wayne, his family, and his father's toilet collection have just moved to a real dump of a house. To make matters worse they have arrived well ahead of their furniture, and just in time for Christmas. It looks like it's going to be the worst Christmas on record. In \"The Alien\", after surviving puberty and his hellish neighbours, Wayne is convinced he's an alien, and he's not the only one that thinks so. He enlists the help of his friends Squaka and Violet and their alien detector to get to the truth of the matter. Cast includes Jeffrey Walker (Wayne), Jah'shua McAvoy, Tracey-Louise Smith and Brooke Harman."
