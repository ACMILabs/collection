        "Director Paul Thomas Anderson's second feature is a sprawling, kinetic tribute to the excesses of the 70's porn industry.\"Boogie Nights\" follows the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), a porn superstar known for his enormous 'talent' and loosely based on real life porn actor John Holmes. The film imagines the porn scene as your average dysfuntional family, headed by patriarch Burt Reynolds, an adult film director with lofty ambitions to make quality entertainment. \"Boogie Nights\" apparent nostalgia for a long gone era is realised via the death of the 16mm porn film, which was replaced by video, a cheaper, mass produced format that changed the industry forever. All this jammed in between one endless party after another, which comes to a sad, abrupt holt once it reaches the 80's. The excellent ensemble cast includes Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg."
