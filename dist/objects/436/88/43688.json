        "Ian McKellen reprises his earlier role as the charismatic but machiavellian Richard of Gloucester, who uses any means necessary to assume the role of King. Director Loncraine provides a contemporary setting of the 1930's fascist era, providing Shakespear's traditional tale with a powerfully symbolic and decadent background. Cast includes Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey Junior, Nigel Hawthorne, Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith and John Wood."
