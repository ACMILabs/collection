        "A French-Canadian folk tale about the fantastic exploits of a mysterious little boy who one day rides into a winter logging camp on a big white horse. Ti-Jean's feats dwarf those of even the hardiest lumberjack as he fells timber, cuts, carries and piles heavy logs and comes out the victor in every contest. The film portrays typical life and work in a Canadian logging camp."
