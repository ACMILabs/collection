        "Great A'Tuin is a giant turtle, floating through space, and on his back stand four elephants, on their backs, there rests the Discworld. This is the setting for Terry Pratchett's adventure, the 'Discworld'. There is a new and addictive music on the disc! When Imp Y Celyn, a young harpist (who looks a bit elvish) arrives in Anhk Morpock, the town will never be the same again. He forms 'The Band With Rocks In' with his friends Lias and Glod and changes his name to Buddy. Meanwhile Susan St Helit has a problem, her Grandfather is Death, and he's missing."
