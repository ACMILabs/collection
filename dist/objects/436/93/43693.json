        "In 'This guy Dellafield', Wayne's first day at school does not look like it's going to be a good one, especially when he has school bullies and a tyrannical teacher to deal with. In the second episode 'A slave to fashion', Wayne is convinced that he hasn't made any new friends at school; apart from Rosie, the young girl next door. In an effort to rectify the situation, Wayne blows his chance as making it as a triangle player in Squaka's band. Cast includes Jeffrey Walker (Wayne), Jah'shua McAvoy, Tracey-Louise Smith and Brooke Harman."
