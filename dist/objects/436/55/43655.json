        "The last of the pagan religions, the Kalash, reside in the Hindu Kush mountains in North West Pakistan. Once great in number, they have now depleted to 2,000 because of the encroachment of civilization and pressure from religion such as Islam. This program looks at their attitude toward life, death, marriage, maturity, women, nature and sacrifice. It also suggests that the Kalash are direct descendants of Alexander the Great, whose soldiers occupied the region where the remaining Kalash live, during an invasion in the 4th century. Narrated by Brian Harrison."
