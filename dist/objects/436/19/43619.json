        "Abbas Kiarostami's `Taste of Cherry', the 1997 Palme d'or winner at the Cannes Film Festival, follows his usual style of fiction bordering on documentary. A weary middle-aged man drives his car around looking for someone to bury him after he kills himself. He meets different people - Afghans, Kurds, a soldier, a cleric, a museum employee - all of whom try to dissuade him from his intent. This film presents a minimalist meditation on life and death, deliberately avoiding emotions or judgements. The ending is cut short due to a state prohibition on the depiction of suicide."
