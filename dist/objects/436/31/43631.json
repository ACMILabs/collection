        "A private detective, Edward Mercer (Richard Todd) is hired by a French insurance company to help locate an Italian they wish to reward for the role he played in the rescue of an Allied airman shot down in Venice during the war. On his mission Mercer discovers mysterious secret exits in the houses of the city, all leading to a maze of canals and alleyways. To complicate matters he is implicated as a murderer and it looks like he has been set up by the man he is seeking. Mercer's quest culminates in a chase across the rooftops of Venice. Cast includes Richard Todd, Eva Bartok, John Gregson, George Coulouris and Sidney James."
