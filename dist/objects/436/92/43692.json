        "A massive all star cast brings to life this full text version of William Shakespeare's Hamlet. With his usual brash exuberance and strong visual style Kenneth Branagh works hard to keep the pace rolling, integrating the acting styles of experienced Shakespearian theatre actors such as Judi Dench, Richard Briers and Derek Jacobi with an international movie star cast, including Gerard Depardieu, Charleton Heston, Richard Attenborough and Julie Christie. With an introductory 'behind the scenes' look at the making of the film, including an interview with Branagh."
