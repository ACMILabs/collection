        "Jack and Tom are cellmates with a tenuous friendship. Their fragile bond begins to unravel when Jack develops dementia, and Tom, unable to understand Jack's condition forces them into a physical confrontation which challenges the nature of their relationship. Utilising only one shot and a series of dissolves and jump cuts, this powerful short film examines the relationship between two men who share a single gaol cell. When the subject of the lack of the female object emerges, the tiny space they inhabit erupts into violence and frustrated desire."
