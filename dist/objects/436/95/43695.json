        "After the shocking loss of her mother in a car crash, 14 year old Amy (Anna Paquin), reluctantly moves from New Zealand to Canada to live with her estranged father (Jeff Daniels). Amy's feelings of isolation are heightened by her father's aloofness and preoccupation with his own inventions. Amy's grief is allayed when she befriends a batch of goose eggs whose survival is threatened by the destruction of their natural habitat by developers. Amy becomes surrogate mother to the eggs, nursing them through to hatching. A problem develops when their surrogate mother must teach them how to fly south for the winter as part of their natural migration. The only solution seems to be for Amy to fly an ultralight plane, masquerading as the mother goose, to teach her 'children' to fly. Cast includes Anna Paquin, Jeff Daniels and Dana Delaney. Inspired by the true story of Bill Lishman who successfully found and raised a clutch of Canadian geese."
