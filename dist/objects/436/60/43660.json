        "In most organisations there are people who would benefit from training. This recognition, that improving employees performance is not a one off process, but one that should be continually developed, is crucial. This video provides managers and supervisors with the skills needed to become successful instructors, or coaches, in the workplace. The video follows a middle level manager in a typically structured organisation, who has recognised that a number of staff could benefit from coaching to improve their performance. Ten key skills of successful coaches are illustrated with practical examples. Pause breaks are included on the tape to allow for integration with the training guide."
