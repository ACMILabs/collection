        "In 1968, petty criminal Wally Melish (Colin Friels), earns himself the reputation of folk hero when he finds himself embroiled in an eight day siege with his girlfriend Beryl (Jacqueline McKenzie), after the police mistakenly think he has taken her hostage. The siege is marked by a marriage (between Wally and Beryl), and the media circus which captures the days events on national television. Based on a real event, cast includes Geoff Merrell, Neil Fitzpatrick, Lisa Hensley, Barry Otto and Paul Sonkkila."
