        "Three epsiodes of the adventures of the boy robot Astro created by Osamu Tezuka. The titles include: \"Robio and Robiette\"; Robio and Robiette are star crossed lovers as their families, the Globes and the Chariots are sworn enemies; \"The Return of Queen Cleopatra\"; Astro is entrusted with the royal staff of Queen Cleopatra by a modern Caesar; \"The Death balloon\"; Astro is incorrectly blamed for an army of floating bombs that look exactly like him and threaten to destroy the city."
