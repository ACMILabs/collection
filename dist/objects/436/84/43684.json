        "Almodovar has taken the setting of Madrid as the centrepoint for this labyrinth of love, lust and passion. Sexilla the sex fiend is in love with Riza Niro, heir to a fallen Arab empire. Riza's preoccupations are men and cosmetics. Set against a city of music, persecution, obsession and uncertain futures. Cast includes Antonio Banderas, Ceilia Roth, Imanol Arias and Fernando Vivanco. In Spanish with English subtitles."
