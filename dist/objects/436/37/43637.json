        "Several lives are forever altered by a single gun shot. Wealthy heiress and drug addict Helena (Francesca Neri), is awaiting her drug dealer when she accidentally allows in her apartment Victor (Liberto Rabal), to whom she vaguely promised a date. In the confusion that ensues, two cops, David (Javier Bardem) and Sancho (Jose Sancho) arrive and a gun goes off. Four years later, Victor comes out of jail and goes looking for Helena who is now married to paraplegic David and runs a children's shelter. Victor's desire for vengeance is temporarily sidetracked when he meets Clara (Angela Molina), an attractive, unhappily married older woman, keen to assist Victor in his other ultimate goal in life - to become the world's best lover! Departing from his usual camp style Almodovar's foray into film noir weaves a web of guilty pleasures, unbridled passions and not-so-sweet revenge mixed with subtle references to Bunuel. Adapted from \"Live Flesh\" by Ruth Rendell. In Spanish with English sub-titles."
