        "George Segal stars as British intelligence agent Quiller. His mission is to investigate a Neo Nazi organisation located in Berlin and headed by a ruthless fanatic, Oktober (Max von Sydow). It is mission fraught with danger, as Quiller is informed by his boss Pol (Alec Guinness), that two other agents have already lost their lives. It is for this reason that Pol does not send the protection of agents Weng (Robert Helpmann) and Hengel (Peter Carsten), and Quiller quickly finds himself the prisoner of Oktober. With no-one to help him, Quiller must place his trust in a beautiful school teacher Inge (Senta Berger), and utilise all the skills he has been taught if he is to escape. Based on the novel \"The Berlin memorandum\" by Adam Hall (Elleston Trevor). Screenplay by Harold Pinter."
