        "Based on Emily Bronte's 1847 novel, this production professes to differ from other adaptations by covering the complete story and adhering closely to the spirit of the original text. This includes an emphasis on supernatural forces which contribute to the demise of the characters. Cast includes Robert Cavanah, Orla Brady and Peter Davison."
