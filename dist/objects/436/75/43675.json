        "Set in a Tehran courtroom before Judge Deldar, this documentary by British documentary filmmaker Longinotto follows the plight of three women who must provide a convincing argument to grant them a divorce. An insightful look which shatters the myth that Muslim women are passive, especially when their happiness is at stake."
