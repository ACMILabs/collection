        "Steven Spielberg filters J.M. Barrie's 'Peter Pan' through a distinctly 90's sensibility in 'Hook', a film of lost opportunities. Peter Pan has become Peter Banning (Robin Williams), a 40 year old lawyer with a permanent scowl on his face. Banning has lost all memory of being Peter Pan, and he is also in danger of losing his wife and children. When Peter and his family travel to London to visit Granny Wendy, Peter's children are kidnapped by Captain Hook. As Peter recalls who he is and re-discovers his happy thoughts, he transforms into the Peter Pan of the past and goes to rescue his children. Cast includes Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts, Bob Hoskins and Maggie Smith."
