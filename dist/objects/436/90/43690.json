        "Claudia Karvan stars in the true story of Janine Shepherd, a star athlete and Olympic contender whose dreams were shattered when she became a paraplegic following a tragic car accident. Her recovery will be the biggest challenge to date, far surpassing any athletic feats she has achieved. She is greatly assisted in her recovery by her loving and devoted parents Max (Michael Caton), Shirley (Diane Craig), 'uncle' Darryl (John Howard), and surgeon Dr Adrian Cohen (Robert Mammone). From adversity comes joy however, as Janine meets her husband to be, aerobatics pilot Tim Blake (Malcolm Kennard), who shows her the freedom of flight, and eventually Janine not only flies, but learns to walk again too."
