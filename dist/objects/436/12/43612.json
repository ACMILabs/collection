        "Episode of Series \"The Century of cinema\". 'Nagisa Oshima's 100 Years of Japanese Cinema' is a fascinating personal journey through the history of Japanese film-making which moves from the end of the 19th century through to the mid-90s. A rare chance to see stills and excerpts from classic films made in Japan. Oshima comments on his own films as well as the Japanese film industry and its relationship to the country's political and social changes. Films by great Japanese directors from Muzoguchi, Ozu, Kurosawa, 'Beat' Takeshi Kitano, Manga films and Japanese documentary makers are all discussed. 'The Cinema On The Road' is a wonderful documentary which uses the road movie genre as a device to explore the history and current contexts of Korean Cinema. With interesting footage of the Korean landscape and cities, as well as interviews with directors and excerpts and stills from films, this is a fascinating insight into a national cinema which is rarely seen. Both documentaries are in English with interviews and film excerpts in Japanese and Korean with English subtitles."
