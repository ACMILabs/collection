        "An unlikely romance develops when two single parents share babysitting for a day. Melanie (Michelle Pfeiffer), is a single mother with a busy career as an architect. Jack (George Clooney), is a commitment-shy newspaper columnist who has access to his daughter on the weekends, although his ex-wife's sudden elopement has Jack looking after his daughter during the week. When their children miss the boat for a class field trip, Jack and Melanie agree to share babysitting shifts, leading to a day of interesting and romantic developments as they struggle with their day to day work, the children, and the feelings that are developing between them. Cast includes Michelle Pfeiffer, George Clooney, Mae Whitman and Charles Durning."
