        "A mesmerising tale of magic, power struggles and betrayal. Margaret, Linda and Susan are three housewives using witchcraft to further the careers of their husbands. When Margaret's husband Joshua jeers at her claims that her magic has enhanced his life, she decides to teach him a lesson by removing her spells and renouncing her \"hobby\". Soon after, Joshua experiences an amazing run of bad luck, heightened by the evil intentions of Linda and Susan, who have their own reasons for eliminating him. Margaret's only hope seems to be the head witch, Vivian, played by screen veteran Lana Turner, but does she want to help, or does she have an ulterior motive? Filmed as a black comedy send up of the British film, \"Burn, Witch, Burn\" (1962), and adapted from Fritz Leiber's novel, \"Conjure Wife\"."
