        "Great A'Tuin is a giant turtle, floating through space, and on his back stand four elephants, on their backs, there rests the Discworld. This is the setting for Terry Pratchett's adventure, the 'Discworld'. This tape contains episodes one to three. In these epsiodes witch Granny Weatherwax finds a baby like no other. There is also stately matters afoot, and with the assistance of her companions Magrat and Nanny Ogg, they go to extreme lengths to deliver the recognition that the King, who has been ousted by the wretched Duke, deserves."
