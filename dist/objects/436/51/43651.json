        "Dramatises the life of the French artist, Toulouse Lautrec. His paintings and sketches are used to portray his youth, background, adult life, physical handicaps and the world of Paris cafes, nightclubs and theatres in which he lived. Lautrec recorded the Paris scene in pitiless detail in his sketches, paintings, and lithographed posters; Sarah Bernhardt at the Comedi Francaise; La Goulou, dancing the can-can; scenes in the midnight clubs - the seamier side of Paris; the ruined absinthe drinkers; the prostitutes and the midinettes."
