        "This moving documentary provides a personal journey through one of the most significant events in Australia's history; the construction of the Thai-Burma railway. The railway was built by Australian prisoners of war and other allied and Asian laboueres during World War 2. The video uses personal accounts, forensic and historical footage, most of which hasn't been seen in America, Australia or Japan. Features artwork by Ronald Searle, Jack Chalker, Ray Parkin and Fred Ransom-Smith."
