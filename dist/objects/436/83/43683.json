        "Trevor Nunn's faithful adaptation of Shakespeare's tale of love, deception and gender stars Ben Kingley, Helena Bonham Carter, Nigel Hawthorn, Richard E Grant, Imogen Stubbs, Mel Smith, Imelda Staunton and Toby Stephens. A brother and sister are separated in a shipwreck and land on the shore of Illyria. The sister Viola (Stubbs) disguises herself as a man and takes service with Duke Orsino (Stephens) who has fallen passionately in love with Lady Olivia (Bonham Carter). Viola is entrusted to plead on her master's behalf and finds that Olivia has fallen madly in love with her. Thus begins the comedy of deception which has delighted audiences for centuries."
