        "This live action Australian adventure follows an adorable pup on a cross-country search for the dingoes who comprise his doggy roots. Though the cocky young puppy's real name is Muffin, he prefers to think of himself as Napoleon, a conquering warrior. Napoleon gets more than he bargained for when he is carried aloft in a makeshift air balloon into unknown territory. Embarking on a journey that will turn any pup into a warrior, he dares to go where no pup has gone before; discovering unknown lands and meeting some real friends along the way."
