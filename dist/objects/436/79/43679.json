        "This documentary provides a candid look behind the 1996 election campaign of the Victorian Opposition Labor Party, headed by John Brumby. He has a number of factors working against him in a seemingly unwinnable campaign; a drastically low budget, poor public perception, and healthy support for the Coalition. This documentary focuses on John Brumby as an individual who is honest and frank in his opinions, as well as illustrating how the media is capable of shaping public opinion and in turn dictating the creation of the images of modern politics."
