        "In July 1976 a new undersea communications link was completed between Papua New Guinea, Australia and the rest of the world. Complicated cable laying techniques are shown, and in the background is the exotic and beautiful Papua New Guinea scenery. By plugging in to the international community, the indigenous people will feel greater pressure to surrender their traditions and customs, and to develop towards a more cosmopolitan way of life. Suitable for upper secondary level."
