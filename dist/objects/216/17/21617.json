        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Child\". By the age of four the child is curious about the world around him. To find out, he is asking thousands of questions. He is also learning not to be afraid. This film shows children in learning situations: on a nature hike; handling animals and other creatures; dealing with their peers. One particularly interesting example is that of Ingrid and Helen, twins who look alike but act differently."
