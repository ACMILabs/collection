        "The shadow-play is one of the most popular Chinese folk-arts; it appeared in China during the 10th century A.D. this film presents a shortened version of the traditional tale of the White Snake Lady, one of the most popular of all Chinese fairy tales. The figures are made from translucent parchment, (in China, from donkey skin) which is painted in delicate colors, and to which wires for manipulation are attached. The drama is performed by manipulating the figures behind an illuminated screen, to the accompaniment of Chinese drums, gongs, and cymbals; the melodramatic dialogue is spoken from behind the screen by the manipulators. Animation and demonstration by Pauline Benton. Narrated by Arvo Wirta."
