        "One of the major activities of the Hakuho Foundation is the Children's Storytelling Caravan Bus. The Caravan Bus travels to places where children gather, to provide a collection of books to children who are beginning to read. Co-operation exists among the caravan bus staff, made up of the storytellers, the rhythm game leaders, the artists who create the pictures and music and writers who provide the stories and rading matter. Special emphasis is also placed on travelling to those areas where the mothers do not recognise the importance of reading to children and thus not only providing enjoyment to the children but also influencing the mothers through these children. In Japanese with English subtitles."
