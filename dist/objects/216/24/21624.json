        "Episode of Series \"Tomorrows World\". In rebuilding outdated cities, and slums, architects have designed buildings for adults and playgrounds for children from five to fifteen. However, in studies shown here, children show a marked preference for \"adventure playgrounds\" which present them with risks and challenges, and the opportunity to play with children of all ages.
