        "Episode of Series \"The Human Body\". Nutrient molecules in food are too large to be absorbed into the body. Through the chemical processes of digestion, these nutrients are split into small, component molecules that can be absorbed. Animation, X-ray footage and laboratory demonstrations illustrate the major steps in the digestion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins."
