        "This is a study of children as they go about absorbed in their own affairs, learning in their own way. As children grow, they learn both by experience and by imitation; parents and teachers have to decide when it is better to interfere and when it is better to let children find out for themselves in their own way. This film presents a number of situations in which children and their learning processes raise problems which parents and teachers encounter from day to day, and suggestions are made as to how these problems can be solved. This is one of a series of films which includes \"Your children and you\", \"Your children's sleep\", \"Your children's meals\" and \"Children growing up with other people\"."
