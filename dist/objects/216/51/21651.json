        "To children all fantasies, useful or destructive, are very real. This film explains some of the causes of children's fantasies and shows how they may affect a child's development. It discusses such common problems as fear of the dark, imaginary friends, and the interpretation of Santa Claus. Suggests ways of making fantasies an impetus to creative living rather than an escape from reality."
