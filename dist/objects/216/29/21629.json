        "A portrait of the city from the predawn mists of the East River to the nighttime jazz of Broadway, a series of unique images is created from the familiar streets and sights of effects as floating buildings, horns that seem to undulate to the rhythm of their music, and cars and buses that stretch and weave. A kind of multiplication theme dominates in the film and shots rhythmically flow and change in a dance-like structure. Thompson says he \"wanted to make fun of the ridiculousness of the life of a New Yorker.\" He did, but his film goes further and describes the city's diversity and its beauty as well. Music by Gene Forrell."
