        "An intensive look at Israel's communal approach to raising children, shot at Kibbutz Bet Alpha. Looks at four age groups within Bet Alpha - infants, three year olds, seven year olds and twelve year olds. The camera records the children's behaviour and the film describes in detail Bet Alpha's approach to collective education which in many ways preceded other modern approaches to education."
