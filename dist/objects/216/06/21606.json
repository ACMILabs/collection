        "A surrealistic film using symbolic objects and settings designed by Salvador Dali. The film was a collaboration between Bunuel and Dali over 3 days and shot in 2 weeks. A series of seemingly unrelated images are unified by their power to shock. The famed opening sequence was left out some releases by censors. Enthusiastically received by Paris surrealists, the film saw Bunuel and Dali being recognised by their peers, and it still enjoys its innovative arthouse status. Censorship restriction: Suitable only for adults."
