        "A study of an experimental nursery school for children between the ages of 2 and 7 years. The nursery school was founded during the war, when many parents were working and therefore unable to give their children the care the needed. It proved such a success that the school was continued after the war. The children were encouraged in those activities which helped to develop their self-reliance and independence. In close contact with nature, under conditions, as primitive as was consistent with safety, they learned how to live together, to develop self-discipline, to use their creative instincts in ways which yielded them satisfaction. The film relates the activities of this nursery school with more general techniques of progressive educational theory, and emphasises the potential value of such nursery-schools. Commentary written by Munro Leaf; narrated by Lloyd Gough."
