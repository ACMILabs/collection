        "The children of the mountain-dwellers of Switzerland must learn to adapt themselves to the reality of their environment. They have their own task; the boys help their fathers, learning crafts for later life, the girls help their mothers inside the home, and trudging to the village on errands. Apart from school they enjoy skiing, playing a game like hockey, and riding on a sleigh."
