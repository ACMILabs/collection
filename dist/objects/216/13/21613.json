        "Underlines the importance of co-operation by parents and teachers in reaching understanding of children's problems. In a dramatised example (based on an actual case), Martha causes concern to her teacher when she withdraws from school work and school contacts. The teacher discovers that Martha is throwing away the lunch cut by her grandmother, who also figures oddly in Martha's free expression art work. Discussion with the parents and the headmistress clears the way for Martha's readjustment to school life."
