        "The staff of a high school newspaper decide to do an issue on the drug problem, by dividing into two groups to research the pros and cons of drug taking. Projects the message that before a choice is made in favour of the non-medical use of drugs one should be fully aware of the dangers to mental and physical health inherent in such a choice. Intended mainly for school children. NOTE: Restricted to tertiary institutions, teaching hospitals, police and customs departments."
