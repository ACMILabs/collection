        "Narrator Neil Leroy drops in at the Child Adjustment Services center for the study and treatment of the emotionally disturbed child set up by the Toronto Board of Education. Here, psychologists, social workers and psychiatrists, with the cooperation of parents and teachers, are learning how to deal with children's emotional problems and to help them develop into healthy, happy adults. Through the story of young Nick, we see how early diagnosis and treatment of a child's maladjustment can change him into a normal, outgoing youngster."
