        "Presents impressions of youth in Czechoslovakia: the life of those born since 1948, with scenes of children in day nurseries and schools, and in more detail the daily life, employment and recreation of young workers. Discusses their behaviour and attitudes and shows that although most public activities are officially controlled, there is much personal independence, indifference to politics and interest in Western popular music and fashions. This is contrasted with the former popular support of the regime and identification with it expressed in the moribund Volunteer Youth Brigades. Written and narrated by Robert Kee."
