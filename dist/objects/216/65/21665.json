        "A relatively small part of Chile is suitable for farming but in this part are large farm estates, many owned by the descendants of the Spaniards who originally settled there. Employing as many as 1,000 employees, each hacienda will have its own shopping centre, school, and hospital. The employees give some of their time in payment for housing etc and also receive wages. The products are wheat, fruit, cattle, potatoes, and similar farm products. Amusements include dancing and rodeos. The haciendas are the core of the farming system of an agricultural nation."
