        "An appraisal of Chopin's life and work. By original photographs and engravings we follow the composer's tumultuous experiences in Poland, France, England and Scotland at a time of revolution and change. The selection of works played in this film by the Polish pianist Malcuzynski demonstrates the composer's influence on the development of pianoforte technique; an influence which has given him a permanent place in history. Commentary by Pierre Gascan and spoken by Peter Coke."
