        "Would you pick up a baby when he cries for attention, or let him yell out his little lungs? This cartoon film for parents poses many such questions that confront a mother during the course of her day. Made with the counsel of child specialists, it provides a perceptive guide to understanding what motivates both good and problem behavior in children from infancy to adolescence, and how to draw out the best."
