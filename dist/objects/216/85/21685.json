        "Very explicitly the film explains the causes, symptoms, possible effects and treatment of gonorrhea and syphilis, and how it differs between men and women. Suggestions are made on precautions to take, and it is pointed out that unlike most other diseases the contracting of these is absolutely up to the individual and early VD can be cured quite simply."
