        "A dramatic story (which shows incidentally some of the root causes of delinquency) showing the progress of a boy and, in less detail, a girl who are sent to an Approved School in Britain. The film gives an insight into the problems of the staff of these schools, and the difficulties which the children encounter at the school, in their efforts to make social adjustments; and finally, the life they face when their period at the school is finished."
