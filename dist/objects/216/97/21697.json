        "Children's crayon drawings, and the voice of a little girl telling what the pictures are about, create a charming study of life at Christmas time in Moose Factory, an old settlement, mainly of Indian families, on the shore of James Bay. Incidents big and small are illustrated and described with childish candor, conveying to the viewer a strong sense of being there. Suitable for primary school level."
