        "Illustrates the value of audio-visual instruction in primary schools. Children learn naturally about a subject such as the owl through visual presentation. Filmstrips help bring the world into the class-room. Various techniques for their use are suggested; silent run through for review, or a few frames at a time can be shown followed by discussion. Exercises, compositions and projects can be set afterwards to help reinforce what the children have learned."
