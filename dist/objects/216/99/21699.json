        "A seasonal pleasantry consisting of three animation segments, employing tricks in movie magic by NFB artists and animators, and with specially arranged music. Three scenarios are presented: a rendition of Jingle Bells in which paper cut-out figures dance; a dime-store rodeo of tin toys; and a story of decorating the perfect Christmas tree. Film without words. (Seven awards, including Rome; Naarden; Oscar nomination, Hollywood.)"
