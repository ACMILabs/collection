        "Compares two chimpanzees that have been in complete darkness from birth to 18 months with normally reared infants. The experimental chimpanzees show a lack of visual fixations, absence of object recognition, and failure to discriminate familiar from strange persons. The chimpanzees present nystagmus of the blind and slowness of visual learning, with inaccuracies in reaching movements and dependence on tactual and kinesthetic cues, in contrast to the dependence on visual cues in normal infants. Silent film with English subtext."
