        "This compelling film of interest to opera lovers features Australian stars Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge. We are taken behind the Sydney Opera House curtain to explore many of the preparations required to stage such an opera as \"Lakme\". With shooting undertaken in Sydney and New York, the film leaves a lively impression of the problems of running an opera. Features the Australian Opera, the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra and the Dance Company of New South Wales. Script by Caroline Jones and Damien Parer as Unit Manager."
