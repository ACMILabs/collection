        "Instructional film concerning water pollution and prevention. Appreciation for our water resources is stimulated first by tranquil scenes of nature as it was before the coming of man, then by exciting scenes featuring the many forms of water recreation man enjoys today. In stark contrast.. the diastrous effects of pollution. In the laboratories of a water resources commission the complexity of the problem is discussed and the procedures of water management agencies are described. The film ends with a dramatic abstract sequence where the choice between pure or polluted water is again presented, thus encouraging serious discussion of this vital part of our environment."
