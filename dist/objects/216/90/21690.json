        "Based on the texts by Henry A. Bowman, this instructional piece, for young women, is about choosing the right lifemate. The film focuses on Eve, a college student, attractive and full of life but mysteriously single. Flash-backs follow and show why. Eve's failure, according to this film is due to the fact that her choices never match up to her criteria: \"Is he right for me?\" But with the help of her friend Mary, she learns that: \"You can't make over a man like you do a room.\" But she still ends up without a boyfriend. Unintentionally hilarious."
