        "Episode of Series \"Peach's Australia\". Anti-Chinese riots on the goldfields caused many Chinese to shift to the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. Chinatowns sprung up and became the centres of their business and social life, cultural and racial ghettos, where the people lived and worked together for mutual help and protection. The film looks at Sydney's Dixon Street where, over half a century ago, two-thirds of Sydney's Chinese population lived."
