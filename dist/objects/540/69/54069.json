        "The superb lyre bird (Menura Novae Hollandiae) is one of the nest attractive and elusive of Australian wildfowl. It is shy in habit and has a unique ability to mimic bird, animal and human sounds. Shows the male bird giving a display on a dancing mound; details of nesting; the emergence of the fledgling from the nest; and its later song rehearsals."
