        "The Roman empire covered a huge area from northern England to the Middle East. This program looks at the great engineering works and buildings they created, many of which are still in use today. A vast network of roads linked the empire's cities which were richly embellished to celebrate the Romans' conquests. These buildings, archaeological finds, models and maps are used to illustrate many aspects of life in the Roman Empire, to demonstrate their military organisation, to review their practical achievements and to show the grandeur and prosperity brought by the Pax Romana."
