        "Episode of Series \"PSSC physics\". Part of the \"Physical science study committee series\" presents experimental evidence that the work done on a body, measured as the area under the force-distance curve, is a measure of the transfer of kinetic energy to the body calculated from its mass and velocity. Dorothy Montgomery demonstrates the relationships using mechanical devices."
