        "This film, made as a tribute to both Sir Ian Clunies Ross and the study of science, illustrates the intangible attitude of the scientist, and shows the place of observation, creative reasoning, assumptions and experimental verification. It also shows the hard grind and disappointments. Suitable for mid-upper Secondary School students. No other credits available."
