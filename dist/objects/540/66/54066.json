        "Roger Climpson narrates this concise and interesting film on Melbourne. A brief history is outlined at the beginning noting some of the key figures who moved Melbourne from a settlement to a city, including John Batman and John Fawker. An incredible amount of material is fitted into the film's short duration, including the outer central business locations like Albert Park, Flemington, St Kilda and Northland Shopping Centre, Preston. The newer multi-story buildings in the city are attractively shot. Opening shot of the infamous (now demolished) Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria building in its early stages of construction."
