    "description": [
        "The National Film and Sound Archive in conjunction with an Australian Research Council grant to the University of Melbourne, have worked together to profile a range of women across the audio visual industries. In this selection of material learn about the women and watch shows and documentaries they have contributed to. Discover footage of the first female movie star Lottie Lyell in the early twentieth century. Admire the pioneering work of the Mcdonagh sisters from the 1930s in documentaries like 'How I Play Cricket' featuring Don Bradman. See work by Gillian Armstrong before her feature film success with 'Smokes and Lollies'. Relive childhood memories with 'The Bunyip', the wonderful character created by animator Anne Jolliffe and learn about the trials and triumphs of Patricia Lovell who had an early television career as Miss Pat and a later acclaimed career as a producer. Enjoy the quirky episodes of 'Round the Twist' produced by the celebrated Patricia Edgar and recall the trailblazing career of Maggie Tabberer in an episode of 'This is Your Life'."
