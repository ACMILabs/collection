        "This footage covers the historic opening of Luna Park in Melbourne and captures the new Scenic Railway rollercoaster from the perspective of someone simultaneously riding and filming the journey from the carriage. In 2012, one hundred years on, we might call it  'Rollercoastercam', however the technology and equipment at the time would have been crude and no doubt presented a challenge! Provides an overview of the iconic rides, activities and other breathtaking entertainment of this famous amusement park."
