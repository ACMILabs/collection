        "On its journey from Melbourne to Sydney the V-2 rocket bomb on its special trailer was displayed out side Parliament House, Canberra. No lectures on the bomb's construction were given, but placards were hung about the missile, explaining its composition. Sections of the tail assembly had been cut away for exhibition purposes and the vital mechanism for propulsion painted in various colours to illustrate the source of the power. Estimates put the crowd who came to view the missile during the day at between two and six thousand, many coming from outlying districts."
