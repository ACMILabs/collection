        "Presenting the winners of the nine categories for ACMI's 2012 'Screen It' competition."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "ACMI's annual 'Screen It' competition invites primary and secondary students from all over Australia to produce a short film or game, centred around a particular theme. In 2012, the theme, 'Belonging', attracted around 400 entries.  Nine winning entries were selected across the categories of live action, animation, computer game and a special section, titled \"Bullying: no way\". While some films are about fitting in, many of them advocate embracing your unique identity and subsequently being accepted by others."
