        "At the age of 16, Cyril Sayles, not wanting to continue his manual labour in the mines, decided to join the army. Having lied about his age, he had a special made uniform and was off to fight the Germans in World War II. Cyril humorously shares his story of strength and courage, through his battle and imprisonment during the war."
