        "How Six People Spend Saturday: \"It is Saturday in Britain, the day divided between work and rest. In the morning six people, representative of various types, are seen at work in the industrial areas, on the farms and in the cities. They are a craftsman from the Midlands, a typist in a big Manchester office, a tug captain on the River Thames, a farmer from the Lowlands of Scotland, a woman doctor from Cardiff and a small boy who lives in a suburb. At midday the people crowd out of offices, factories and schools, all going home to prepare for the half-holiday. Saturday afternoon is set aside for enjoyment. Out they go to their games and amusements, to play football and hockey, rugby and running, to work in the garden, to walk in the woods. At the end of the afternoon they go out to various places of amusement, or they return home to read and play or to make clothes or model aeroplanes.\" (Source: Films of Britain - British Council Film Department Catalogue - 1940)"
