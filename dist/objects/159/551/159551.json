        "'Night Beat' was produced by Grace Gibson Productions, a Sydney company founded by American born Grace Gibson in 1944. Gibson bought American radio scripts and her company then adapted and produced Australian versions that were syndicated to radio stations across Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Hong Kong and the West Indies. Many serials were so popular that they were still produced for up to 14 years after the original American scripts ran out, employing local writers to take over. The original version of this episode was broadcast in the USA on April 10, 1950 and the Australian version was recorded in the studios of the Australian Record Company in Sydney on 11th December, 1950. Minor adjustments to the original American scripts of 'Night Beat' were made to remove particular landmarks that were too closely connected to the location for the original American series, Chicago. The 'Night Beat' reporter is portrayed in this episode by Australian actor Alan Stone."
