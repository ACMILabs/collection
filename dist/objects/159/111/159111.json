        "Meet local artists Maureen Hearn, Denise Ellison, Thea Day, Sandra Buchan and Sam Anderson, and learn about their inspirations and artistic practice. Moved by the magic of Eldorado, in northern Victoria, these artists are never short of inspiration. Day, Ellison and Buchan make time each week to get together and share their passion for painting and line drawing. Hearn works out of her studio that showcases her love of the river and obsession with chickens. Anderson is a metal sculptor who works on his family farm creating large scale works, such as his 'Gorilla', which must be seen to be believed."
