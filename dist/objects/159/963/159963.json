    "description": [
        "Young married couple 'Jack' and 'Jill' feature in this silent cinema ad promoting Prime Minister Stanley Melbourne Bruce's Nationalist Party - Country Party coalition government. Jack argues about the importance of keeping Bruce in power by voting for him as Jill \"womanlike - had different plans - vacation in the mountains\". As well as pushing the conservative Nationalist anti-union and pro-export agenda, important issues of this period between the wars are mentioned \u2013 unemployment, working hours, pensions, roads and public housing. Bruce is also lauded for removing the entertainment tax from the movies. Following the 1917 revolution in Russia, Australians were divided between support for, or fear of, communists (also known as Reds, Bolsheviks or Bolshies). Bruce was determinedly anti-Communist and pro-British. The ad disparages Mr Garden - an ex-Labor party unionist who ran as a Communist in the seat of Sydney in 1925. Bruce won the 1925 election but lost to the Australian Labor Party in 1929."
