    "description": [
        "The plot in the two sections of this episode are almost self-contained. The first is the story of a young girl and a human skull, while the second is about mistaken identity. Both parts of the story are comic and surreal and the lead actors seem almost to parody their usual detective roles, maintaining a deadpan gravity in the face of increasingly strange developments. Regular Norman Yemm, who plays Detective Jim Patterson is joined in this unusual episode by his real-life twin Gordon."
