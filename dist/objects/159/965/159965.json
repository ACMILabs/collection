        "This Liberal Party cinema advertisement for the 1949 federal election presents a choice between the 'socialist' and 'free democratic' ways of life, as offered by the ALP and Liberal Party respectively."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Using dramatic cinematic tropes and strong rhetoric, this ad attacks the ruling Chifley Labor government as 'a Canberra dictatorship' and 'irresponsible socialists'. It played to increasing concerns about Communism, heightened in 1949 by the victory of Chinese communists and nationally by Communist party involvement in the coalminers strike. The ad uses a number of techniques common in Hollywood noir films of the era - including combining zooming headlines over spinning images and starkly lit close-ups. The voiceover rises to a feverish pitch over sequences that associate the ALP with disruption and oppression. The Liberal Party is then presented as the positive alternative with images of Opposition leader Robert Menzies inspecting industrious workplaces and a family enjoying middle-class suburban life. The Liberal party won the election by a landslide. However, the Menzies government referendum of 1951, seeking to have the power to ban the Communist Party, was narrowly rejected."
