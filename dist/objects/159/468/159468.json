        "John Miles recalls the 29th of September 1965 as the date that he commenced his National Service. While he was away, the political climate changed dramatically in Australia. Miles remembers his experience of the Vietnam War and his struggles once home in Australia. Miles' treatment on return to Australia initially made left him feeling bitter, but a trip back to Vietnam was crucial to his personal transformation and healing."
