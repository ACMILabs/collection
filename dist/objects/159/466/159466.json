        "In war, you are discouraged from keeping records or taking photographs. However, soldiers broke those rules in order to help remember. Born on a small soldier's settlement farm, Ben Witham grew up hearing stories about the war. Having a father who served in Gallipoli, to his own service in World War II, Witham recalls the camaraderie and the lighter side of war. He emphasises the bonds of fellow servicemen and the celebration of this during commemorations for ANZACs."
