        "Through the main protagonist Dave, we hear and see what it is like to be in love and have those feelings trapped inside. As we are let into Dave's world, we see him and a group of friends as they leave school and embark on their journey home. The film flicks between two worlds of fantasy and real-life as the journey progresses. As the narrative comes to an end, we watch the three friends depart and Dave is left alone. His love unknown, unsaid but only understood by the viewer."
