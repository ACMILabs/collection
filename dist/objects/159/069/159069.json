    "description": [
        "'Unshaded' is a stop-motion animation made from plasticine. It explores the notion that no matter who you are, there is always a place of belonging for you. The animation is initially shot in a black and white world, reflecting the character's thoughts of loneliness and insecurity. The character is confronted by unfamiliar creatures who seek to gain their colour back by signalling to him to tap them on the head. He does this and in return his world is restored to colour. The character realises that together they can bring happiness to each other and ultimately belong even though they may have evident differences.  Under the category 'Secondary Animation', Hayley Warnock, Benalla, Victoria, was the Screen It 2012 winner."
