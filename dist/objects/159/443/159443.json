        "On Saturday morning, 15 November 1969, approximately 400 people gathered on the parade ground in front of the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, in protest at Australia's participation in Vietnam. Names of about 320 Australian Servicemen who died in Vietnam were read out. As each name was called a demonstrator moved from the west side of the parade ground to the east side in an individual silent protest. The demonstration was quiet and orderly with demonstrators dispersing after the name reading sequence. This was the first anti-war demonstration to be held in the vicinity of the Australian War Memorial grounds. Identified are Mr W.R. Lancaster Director of the AWM and Mr A.J. Sweeting the Assistant Director facing right overlooking the parade ground. Also of interest are members of the neo-Nazi organisation the Nationalist Socialist Party of Australia (NSPA) holding pro-war banners."
