    "description": [
        "The 1972 'It's Time' election campaign is credited with getting the Australian Labor Party over the line after 23 years of being out of government. The television advertisement features contemporary celebrities including Jack Thompson, Jackie Weaver, Graham Kennedy, Bobby Limb, Col Joye, Little Pattie, Judy Stone and Bert Newton. Led by pop singer Alison McCallum, they sing the catchy 'It's Time' anthem written by campaign and creative director Paul Jones. Driven by market research, the whole package was designed to target women and young people and to 'humanise' Gough Whitlam who was seen as 'cold' and 'distant'. Family photos of Gough as a boy, rowing, with world leaders and constituents and with his wife Margaret Whitlam are intercut with the studio footage. The upbeat, Presidential-style ad successfully captured the mood of the nation and the Labor Party won the election. The lovely colour film on which it was shot was lost to Australian viewers at the time, as colour TV wasn't introduced until 1975."
