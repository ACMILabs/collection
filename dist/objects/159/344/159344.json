    "description": [
        "This newsreel was used to inform the Australian public of the official opening of Parliament House in Canberra in May 1927. Immediately after the ceremony, the negative was flown to Sydney for processing so that it could be screened in cinemas within the week. While the newsreel is silent, much of the day's proceedings reached an audience of one million people via radio broadcast. Highlights of the ceremony included speeches by the Duke of York and Prime Minister Stanley Bruce and a rendition of 'God Save the Queen' by Dame Nellie Melba, who later complained that she was drowned out by the planes flying overhead. Planning for the event was meticulous, right down to the number of hair pins that should be kept on hand should the Duchess and her ladies require them. The presence of the Duke and Duchess and the unveiling of a statue of King George V in the new building's foyer reflect the depth of Australia's allegiance to Britain and the Crown in this era.
