        "At 17 Greg joined the air force and his role would be to give the aircraft the best chance of surviving a crash. Two years after joining up, Greg was sent to Thailand and one particular aircraft rescue would change his outlook on life forever. Called out to an aircraft crash to help the Americans contain a huge fire, the Aussies were unaware where the aircraft had come from. After the flames were put out, Greg would realise this was a Thai plane that he had flown on many times. The memory of this day would stay with him all his life."
