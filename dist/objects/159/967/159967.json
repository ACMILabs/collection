        "In an unusually long ad for 1974, this Liberal Party ad targets opposition leader Snedden's electorate of Bruce. Snedden is seen on the job and in a range of eye-catching shirts. He explains his party's policies while demonstrating the slogan 'Bill Snedden cares....'"

    "description": [
        "When the ALP came to power in 1972, the outgoing Liberal Prime Minister William McMahon was replaced by his Deputy, Bill Snedden. As opposition leader, Snedden forced an early election by using his Senate numbers to hold up Labor's supply bills, starving the Government of funds.\u00a0 As a result, Australians faced a Federal election, only 17 months after the last one.\u00a0Critics noted that Snedden was uncomfortable in the leadership role. This ad supports that idea with Snedden's wooden performance to camera at odds with the cheery '70s music.  There also seems little overt appeal to women voters with Snedden appearing at home with his dog rather than his family, in his car and drinking in a bar with a group of men. The Whitlam Labor government campaign directly attacked Snedden, mocking his economic policies. Labor won the election, and Snedden later lost the party leadership to Malcolm Fraser."
