    ], 
    "description": [
        "The small country town of Swifts Creek has had a bush nursing service since 1918 when staff were originally travelling on horseback. These days the bush nurse Sue Carroll visits patients in a 4WD and understands the importance of providing medical care to locals that are often isolated and unable to travel to the Omeo Hospital. Whether it's farmers in need of wound management, children with the measles or victims of car accidents, Carroll is usually the first person on the scene.  Part nurse, part social worker, all legend; Carroll and the staff at the Swifts Creek Bush Nursing Centre provide a vital 24/7 service to not only the local community but the wider surrounding regional area."
