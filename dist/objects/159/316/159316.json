        "Edward Dunstan served in the Australian Navy for 20 years, spending a significant part of that time in Singapore. While he enjoyed his time there, Dunstan also has some bad memories, not least of all was how he was received by his fellow Australians on his return. However, these experiences have encouraged him to help others through his work at the RSL."
