    "description": [
        "The Riverside Police investigate a payroll robbery at a mill and quickly set their sights on Kingston's employee Rod Conway (Stephen Bisley), a mechanic with a criminal record, without realising that a romantic drama playing out between other staff could affect the investigation. Kingston and his foreman Peter Lang (Mel Gibson) are both vying for the attentions of payroll clerk Maureen Hamilton (Joanne Samuel). Meanwhile, the police are dealing with personal dramas of their own. (Part 1) This episode is notable for the guest appearances of Mel Gibson, Stephen Bisley and Joanne Samuel. All three of whom would later appear in the first 'Mad Max' movie."
