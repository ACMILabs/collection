        "Meet the Cook family and spend time with three generations as they muster and milk cows. Robert and Patricia are the proud parents of five grown up sons and 22 grandchildren. Brothers, Ross and Steve Cook have returned to share-farm with their mum and dad and there is no other place they would rather be. Surrounded by rolling hills and the winery county of the King Valley in northern Victoria, the Cook family have worked hard to keep and grow their dairy farm."
