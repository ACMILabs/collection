        "Members of the Lakes Entrance Life Saving Club discuss why the club plays such an important role within their lives and their community. Founded in 1956, the Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club in 2013 has over 400 members and patrols the beach from November through to Easter. The Club not only provides a vital service to locals and tourists alike, but is also a fantastic way for the young people of Lake's Entrance to gain life skills, practical knowledge and build confidence."
