        "This is a story about an Italian-Australian family made unique by three generations of winemakers and master chefs. Meet Natalie, Alfred, Arnold, Katrina, Carla and matriarch Rosetta Pizzini, hear about the four brothers that immigrated to Australia and started farming tobacco, eventually diversifying to growing Italian variety grapes. The Pizzini's make their own wine, run a cooking school and manage a boutique hotel in Whitfield, but still the most important part of their day is when they sit together and share a meal, a glass of wine and a laugh."
