    "description": [
        "To mark Canberra's Centenary in 2013, the National Film and Sound Archive has assembled this collection of films, which offer unique perspectives on life in our nation's capital within the past one hundred years. In this selection, you can witness Canberra's founding moment in a ceremony conducted on a dusty plain in 1913, see the long-anticipated and lavish opening of Federal Parliament in 1927, or be seduced by the Commonwealth's Film Unit's inviting depiction of Canberra in the 1950s. You can also marvel at the remarkable efforts of city planners and engineers to bring Lake Burley Griffin to fruition in the spring of 1964, explore the tide of social change of the 1970s with early films by two highly regarded Australian directors, or relive the emotion and gravitas of the Australian Parliament's historic apology to the Stolen Generations."
