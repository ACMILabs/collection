        "Join music gaming legend, artist and auteur, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, as he plays some of his seminal games and speaks about his signatory sound and visual fusion.  Famed for his pioneering application of music and visuals, Mizuguchi uses music not just as an accompaniment to a game, but as an integral part of its gameplay. Including traditional videogames, such as the hugely successful 'Sega Rally Championship', Mizuguchi has worked on some of the most original and unconventional music-fusion titles, including 'Space Channel 5', 'Lumines', 'Rez' and his latest opus, 'Child of Eden'.  During this hosted conversation Mizuguchi explores how his vision has evolved over his career and demonstrates his pioneering application of music and visuals through live gameplay."
