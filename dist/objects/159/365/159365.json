        "Join a group of passionate volunteers as they describe the trials, tribulations and joys of building and running a paddle steamer. From the initial planning in 2002, a group of Orbost locals built the PS Curlip II as part of a community project. After 16,000 hours of voluntary labour the paddle steamer was launched and continues in 2013 to transport tourists in and around the various waterways of East Gippsland. Members of the PS Curlip Committee talk about the history, their involvement and the future of the much-loved paddle steamer."
