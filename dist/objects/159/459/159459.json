        "Trained as a radar operator, Knox McKenzie saw himself posted around Australia throughout World War II, and eventually on Melville Island. It was an isolating job, waiting for signal \"blips\" to pick up planes coming in. A big blip was a friend and a small blip was a foe. McKenzie's innate independance helped him to see the entire experience as an education and one to remember for the rest of his life."
