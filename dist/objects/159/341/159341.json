        "Produced by the Commonwealth Film Unit in 1958, 'Guide to Canberra' was initially intended to inform public servants transferring to Canberra about the lifestyle that they could expect to find in our nation's growing capital. The glowing report that ensues takes the viewer on a tour of the city's significant sites, its relaxed shopping districts and new suburban homes, offering a snapshot of Canberra at a time when its population was just 40,000 strong. With its planned transport network, new schools, established retailers and infant caf\u00e9 culture, Canberra is depicted as a modern and prosperous city, all the more appealing for the sense of balance afforded by its graceful bushland setting. Whether you view our nation's capital with affection, indifference or antipathy, this upbeat film leaves little room for doubt that Canberra is unlike any other city in Australia."
