        "In the digital age it's all well and good for those who are connected via high speed internet, but in some rural towns it is the good old fashioned newsletter that keeps locals in the know. The Bunyip Newsletter is hand-delivered across the wider Greta area by six committed volunteers. We meet Noeleen Lloyd and Allan Porker as well as local historian Joan Ellis and hear about the importance of having a local newsletter. 'The Bunyip' was born out of a demand from the locals to be better informed and more connected to their community and surrounds. Over 300 newsletters are distributed every two months containing articles of historical, sporting and community importance."
