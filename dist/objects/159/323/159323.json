        "When Gwynneth Cole joined the army in 1944, roles for women were limited. While Cole didn't get to serve on the front line, she was posted to different bases in Australia as a nurse and faced many hardships and the realities of war. Cole greatly values her time in the army and reflects on the opportunities for women and the independent streak she has passed on to her four daughters."
