        "Prehistoric Pet Shop is about a caveman whose alarm clock stops working. But not just any alarm clock - the clock was a bird with an unfortunate heart problem. The caveman goes to the pet shop to complain about his faulty alarm clock. A homage to Monty Python's parrot sketch, this hilarious short reveals that complaining can get you more than just a new alarm clock."
