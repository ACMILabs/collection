    "description": [
        "Director Warwick Freeman had an established career in television when he embarked on 'Demonstrator' his first and only feature film. Shot largely in Canberra, the production was financed by ACT business investors and had the support of Prime Minister John Gorton, which afforded Freeman the use of an RAAF aircraft, a RAFF Guard of Honour, the Duntroon Military Band and off-duty police officers as cast extras. Hundreds of students from the Australian National University also appeared in the film. Drawing on the contemporary climate of anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, the drama turns on intergenerational conflict without clearly making a case for either the establishment or the youthful protestors who oppose its decisions. Publicity for Demonstrator's 1971 release stressed Freeman's desire to make a serious contemporary picture capable of re-vitalising the Australian film industry. Despite enjoying some local success, the film fell well short of this mark both critically and commercially."
