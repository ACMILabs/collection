    "description": [
        "The apology to the 'Stolen Generations' by the Australian Parliament on 13th February 2008 was a powerful and memorable moment in our nation's history. Many Australian's will have seen the footage of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivering the apology itself. However this film, which was developed for Reconciliation Australia, goes beyond the momentous three and a half minutes of Rudd's speech, to encompass the growing sense of anticipation both in Canberra and around the country in the lead up to this historic event. Whether it be the mood of the crowds gathered at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, the atmosphere as the Australian Parliament was opened by a Welcome to Country ceremony for the first time, or the emotional outpouring etched on the faces of those present or watching on as the apology was read, this film sensitively captures the personal and collective significance of the apology for members of the 'Stolen Generations' and their families, as well as its importance to the wider Australian community."
