        "A documentary film made by Robert Nugent using footage taken in Iraq 2006 as the Australian War Memorial's Official Cinematographer. Shot in a style with no voice-over narration, Nugent's camera reveals the location and situations the men find themselves in as part of active duty. Interviews with soldiers, their point of view from armoured tanks, the gym in the palace of the defeated dictator and daily life away from action, all serve to provide insight for the viewer into the life of a soldier."
