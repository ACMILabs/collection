        "In this scene from the independently produced feature film 'The Green Cockatoo', the protagonist Johnny (director Franz Hohenberger) takes his date Kitty (Grete Glattau) to the \"Prater\", Vienna's Luna Park which was established in 1766. The sequence captures \u2013 in almost documentary fashion \u2013 some of the sideshows and attractions dating back to the late 19th century. It also speaks of the significance of the Luna Park for the working class in the early 20th century.
