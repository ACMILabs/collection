        "Everyone knows Ned Kelly but what about other bushrangers? Andrew George Scott (1842-1880) aka Captain Moonlite is depicted here as a well-spoken scoundrel and con artist, but in contemporary Australia there has been interest in his close, possible sexual relationship with fellow gang member James Nesbitt. In fact, to fulfil his last wishes, Captain Moonlite's remains were exhumed from the Rookwood Cemetery in 1995 and placed near those of Nesbitt at Gundagai. This radio drama was part of the series 'Rogues Gallery', which aimed to depict the \"shameful lives of famous scoundrels\". It was produced by Dorothy Crawford sometime between 1945 and 1950. Robert Burnard - who here portrays Captain Moonlite - was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, performed on the stages of the West End in London and spent time in Hollywood where he was assistant director to the famous director Erich von Stroheim. He moved to Australia in 1935 and took up acting in radio dramas produced in Australia."
