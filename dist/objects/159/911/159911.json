        "Jude remembers her childhood and realises so much of her young life involved war and trauma. Visiting her father in the repatriation hospital she saw first-hand the effects of WWII on those that returned. Most of the men in her family went to WWII and she recalls how the family never recovered from the loss of one cousin at the hands of the Japanese as a POW."
