        "Pegg Utting was one of the first women to join the newly formed WAAAF in 1941. Her son would later join up to serve in Vietnam aged 17. Like so many others he struggled to fit in when he returned. After many years, he was finally invited to March with the RSL and it was Peg's loving support that got him through this."
