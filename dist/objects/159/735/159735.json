        "From an opening sequence strongly reminiscent of Easy Rider (1969) to a rollicking country car chase, this is a bumper first episode. 'Matlock Police' takes advantage of its setting to explore a series of oppositions: country versus city, age versus youth, conservatism and tradition versus new ideas and local community versus outsiders. The central police characters remain detached and professional, adopting a familiar, often friendly attitude towards suspects and victims alike and in keeping with their country policing style."
