        "At 18, Oswald enlisted in the Army through the Scotch College Cadet Force. He served in Darwin for two and a half years, surviving 76 raids, before training for inventory and being sent to Borneo to engage the Japanese. He can only recall the experience with \"fear, fright and exhilaration\". Declared unfit for military service, he took some time to feel better again before marrying in 1950."
