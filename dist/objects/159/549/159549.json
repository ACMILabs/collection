        "In 1945, siblings Hector and Dorothy Crawford established a radio production company in Melbourne. The crime series \u2018D24\u2019 began in 1951 and was based on files from the Victorian Police Force, who sponsored the first two years of production costs. \u2018D24\u2019 had high ratings and was later transformed into the successful television series 'Homicide'. Crawford Productions used various studios located in the Melbourne CBD to record radio programs, including the studios of radio station 3DB in the basement of the Herald and Weekly Times Building in Flinders Street, as well as those of AWA in Queen Street and BEA in Market Street. The narrator, Roland Strong, states that \u201conly names, place names and dates have been altered in this true story\u201d. A search of the Argus newspaper has revealed that the \u2018Taxi Murder\u2019 story was based on a double murder which took place on the 23rd of November, 1944. Series producer, Dorothy Crawford, was also a pioneer in the production of Australian television drama."
