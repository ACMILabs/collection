        "Since opening in 1912, Luna Park has been a popular amusement park and feature of St Kilda's foreshore for over 100 years."

    "description": [
        "The Luna Park concept was based on the first one built, opening on Coney Island, New York in 1903. Developed by American showman and entrepreneur J.D. Williams, along with the Phillips brothers, who later brought the idea to Australia. In contrast to the sophisticated theme parks that we thrill in today, this collection of films illustrate Luna Parks not only from Melbourne, but Sydney and Austria as well, and highlight a time when riding the Ferris Wheel or the Scenic Railway were incredulous new experiences. Closed in 1916 due to WW1, Luna Park Melbourne reopened in 1923 with new and improved attractions but by the late 1970's newer, more modern mechanical rides, replaced some of the earlier original historic attractions. Of the four Luna Parks built in Australia, only Melbourne and Luna Park Sydney are currently in operation."
