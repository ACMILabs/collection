    ], 
    "description": [
        "Local painter, Deirdre Jack, is passionate about her local environment. The rolling hills and golden fields that surround her Swifts Creek bush studio inevitably make their way into her vibrant oil paintings and pastel sketches. Fruit, however, is the main subject of her exhibition at the Great Alpine Gallery, a small exhibition space that sits in the heart of Swifts Creek and run voluntarily by a group of fellow artists. The gallery has been a vital place for local artists since 1989 despite the challenges of running an art space in a small rural town."
