        "When Sunday went to live with her grandmother she didn't have any friends to play with. One day a stray dog walked down the lane behind her house. It was missing a tail and an ear. Nobody wanted it. Sunday made friends with the dog but it was taken away to the pound. Weeks passed. Dogs were adopted and other dogs were led away to a big blue door. Finally, Sunday found the dog at the pound and adopted him. When they got home, Sunday made him a special hat with two ears and a tail for him to wag.
