    "description": [
        "The area surrounding Greta, in north-eastern Victoria, used to be a swamp, home to indigenous wildlife and the mythical Bunyip creature. The swamp was drained as part of a government employment project in the 1890s, leaving behind rich fertile land ideal for grazing, however it also created a complete change in the area around Greta, especially in the hill country, causing environmental damage. One hundred years on and local Land Care members Anthony and David Griffiths, along with 2012 Land Care President Phil Gottschling, have dedicated their time and energy to try and reverse the effects of the dredging and are revegetating their land to restore balance to the environment."
