    "abstract": [
        "A classic piece of negative campaigning, this 1996 Liberal Party ad features Prime Minister Paul Keating and other members of the ALP, but no Liberal party candidates. Sarcastically named 'Lucky Country', this punchy ad was one of a series from the 'Enough is enough' campaign."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Opening with a shot of Prime Minister Keating dancing with ex-Victorian Premier Joan Kirner, this ad intercuts shots of ALP politicians at a social function with bleak shots of disadvantaged people. Over the top of the black and white footage pink boxes show statistics supporting the voice-over's litany of economic and social policy failure. This ad falls into the attack ad category of campaigning, as it focuses exclusively on the negative aspects of the opposition. This form of advertising can be particularly effective through being memorable and activating voters fears. It also has the advantage of making the opposition party and Leader John Howard a 'small target', as it gives no comparable information on the Liberal's record and policies. It cleverly uses a line of Paul Keating to work against him. Others ads in the series used Keating's infamous \"go get a job\" remark. The Liberal Party won the 1996 election and John Howard went on to be Prime Minister for 12 consecutive years."
