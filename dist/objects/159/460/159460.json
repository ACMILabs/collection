        "Margaret Morton's first time in the navy was short lived, as she contracted pneumonia which further developed into tuberculosis, just six months after joining. This meant Margaret spent an extended period of time hospitalised and in isolation, an experience she found frustrating and lonely. Morton describes the memories she still holds dear from her short time in service."
