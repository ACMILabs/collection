    "description": [
        "This footage offers a unique insight into the life and achievements of Patricia Lovell AM MBE. Lovell's career began working as a broadcaster on popular radio programs such as 'The Argonauts Club' and 'The Muddle-Headed Wombat'. Soon after, Patricia began working in television on programs such as 'Beauty and the Beast' and early morning breakfast program 'Sydney Today'. Patricia is also fondly remembered by the many Australians who grew up watching her as \"Miss Pat\" on 'Mr Squiggle and Friends'. Later in her career, Lovell produced feature films such as 'Picnic at Hanging Rock', 'Summerfield' and 'Gallipoli'. In this footage, interviewer Brendan Horgan asks Lovell to recall important moments of her life in Australian radio, television and film. Highlights of the interview include Lovell describing her first job, how she got her foot in the door at the ABC, the challenges of being a woman in Australian television, what it's like to be remembered as Mr Squiggle's sidekick \"Miss Pat\", and her career as a film producer."
