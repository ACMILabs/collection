    "description": [
        "Prime Minister Bob Hawke's campaign in 1987 built on his success in at the 1983 and 1984 elections. This 1987 ad theme is 'Australians together \u2013 let's see it through'. It reflects Hawke's personal style, promoting consensus, competitiveness in the global economy and policies aimed at appealing to middle Australia. It also features testimonials from 'ordinary people' promoting  Hawke's achievements and expressing  their unhappiness with the coalition. Particular reference is made to Joh Bjelke-Peterson, the Queensland National Party leader and Premier. He had announced his campaign to move into Federal politics, 'Joh for PM', in January of 1987. Based on a far right agenda and a proposal for a flat 25% income tax for all Australians, Bjelke-Peterson's push failed. However his actions, which split the federal coalition, destroyed John Howard's chances in his first bid for PM. Bob Hawke remains the ALP's longest serving PM. He lost the party leadership to Paul Keating in December 1991."
