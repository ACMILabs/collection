    "description": [
        "Between 1976 and 1983 Argentina was under a military regime that launched a campaign of terror (now known as the 'Dirty War') in which 30,000 people 'disappeared'. Among them were children and pregnant women. An estimated 500 babies were born in concentration camps. Whilst the mothers were killed, the children were adopted out, in many cases to military families. For over 30 years, the 'Las Abuelas de Plaza de la Mayo' ('Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo') have been campaigning to recover these lost grandchildren. Since 2011 over 100 have been found and regained their true identities. The Abuelas continue to search for the rest."
