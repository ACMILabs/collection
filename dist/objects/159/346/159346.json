        "Phillip Noyce is now one of Australia's most celebrated international directors. Early in his career, he made this innovative split-screen film about the Aquarius Festival, held on Canberra's Australian National University campus in 1971."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "The Aquarius Festival saw thousands of young people descend on Canberra for a celebration of rock-and-roll, dance and alternative lifestyle. Having set up camp in the showgrounds to the north of the city, the festival-goers travelled to the University Campus each day for a line-up that included Daddy Cool and Spectrum. The film depicts the tensions between the organisers, the revellers, and the police as Canberra strained under the presence of such a large and lively crowd. 'Good Afternoon' is significant not only as an important cultural record of this event, but also because it reveals Phillip Noyce's natural skill as a filmmaker and sharp eye for storytelling. His novel use of two simultaneously-running screens brilliantly captures the energy and activity of the festival. Originally, this was screened from two separate projectors \u2013 a lengthy document had to accompany the film prints so that the projectionist could accurately synchronise the screens!"
