        "On the way home from enrolling in the Women's Australian Auxiliary Air Force (WAAAF) in 1941, Maude Coates learnt that the Japanese forces had just bombed Darwin. For almost 4 years, Coates worked hard and built a great sense of companionship with the other women she lived and worked with.  Serving time in the Women's Forces out of duty, Maude feels proud to have served her country and been part of history."
