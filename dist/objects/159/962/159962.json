        "A selection of Federal election ads held by the NFSA, documenting the changing political, social, cultural & media landscape of Australia."

    "description": [
        "In terms of the local political issues they address, this survey of eight decades of Federal election ads seem to say 'the more things change, the more things stay the same'. Perennial campaign favourites are the economy, employment, social welfare, farming, industry, trade and national identity. However, these ads also trace the major events of the time \u2013 the World and Cold Wars, Depression and recession, and global change. They also reveal shifts in attitudes to gender, immigration, social expectations and dress codes. Finally, they are a microcosm of broader trends in advertising and production. As time goes by, the advertisements get progressively shorter and the primary point of delivery moves from the cinema to television then to online."
