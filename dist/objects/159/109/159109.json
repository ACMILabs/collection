    "description": [
        "Women come from great distances bringing their knitting needles, sewing machines and a good yarn to the weekly Greta Craft Group. The group was started by Kath White in the early 1990s when, as a young mum and new to the area, she reached out to other mums for some companionship. The group grew from there and became so popular they needed a waiting list for those interested to join - as Winifred Suffield suggests \"craft is just an excuse to meet\". 2012 President Helen Bird and long time members Nola Jones and Julie White, speak about the support and friendship that the group has provided over decades. We hear the sounds of laughter and chatter as the ladies make all sorts of beautiful crafts which they provide to charities, both locally and internationally."
