        "Jeff Cooper is a guardian of all things great about Omeo and its chequered history. His role within the community is not only as a custodian of the local records but also as a passionate tour guide of the Omeo Historic Park and local gold fields. The Park contains 5 heritage-listed buildings that are believed to be some of the most intact and original in Australia. Jeff believes Omeo is the last bastion of self-funded retirement and despite losing his home and livestock in the 2003 bushfires, wouldn't live anywhere else in the world."
