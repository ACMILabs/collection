    "description": [
        "Founded by Hector Crawford and his sister Dorothy, Crawford Productions first achieved success in 1945 in radio production. With the introduction of TV in 1956, Crawford Productions became a prolific producer of Australian made TV programs that were hugely popular, especially crime dramas. Homicide (first broadcast 20 October 1964), was a phenomenal success, running for 510 episodes over 12 years and not only competed against, but won timeslots against US cop shows airing at the time. Their programs were a fixture on Australian TV, dominating ratings for years. Crawford Productions remains today Australia's most enduring and successful producer of Australian drama, comedy and children's TV. Crawford Productions also served as a training ground for many well-known actors, producers, directors and writers. This package includes episodes of 'Homicide', 'Division Four', 'Matlock Police' and 'Cop Shop', broadcast on Australian TV from 1964 to 1983."
