    "description": [
        "John Kelso appears to be a shambling, confused old man however the terrified reactions of those around him make us suspect he is planning something terrible. The story becomes a striking, disturbing portrayal of the cruelty of a community seizing the opportunity to terrorise the man who once terrorised them.  This hour of drama was 'Division 4's most awarded individual episode, winning a Penguin Award, an AWGIE Award and a Logie for guest star John Fegan. Fegan was one of Australia's first on-screen detectives as Inspector Connolly in Homicide (1964-75)."
