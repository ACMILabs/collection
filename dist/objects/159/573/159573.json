        "The 2009 film 'Bright Star' (directed by Jane Campion)tells the story of the romance between the English poet John Keats (1795 - 1821)and Fanny Brawne. In this interview, 'Bright Star' producer Jan Chapman and costume designer Janet Patterson discuss the creative process behind costume design, and the design choices that went into making one of the costumes for the character Fanny Brawne (played in the film by Abbie Cornish). The character's crimson gown costume was on display during the ACMI Melbourne Winter Masterpieces 'Hollywood Costume' exhibition (2013). Clips from 'Bright Star' (2009) courtesy of Hopscotch Films."
