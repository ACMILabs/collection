        "This cinema ad for the 1946 federal election encourages Australians to stay with the Labor Party, which has successfully led the country through the end of the Second World War."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Ben Chifley became Prime Minister on 13 July 1945 after the death of John Curtin, at the end of World War II. Chifley managed Australia's transition into a post-war period of stability and growth, without the steep inflation or depression that plagued other nations. Still, this 1946 election ad emphasises his role as the heir to Curtin who led the country successfully through 'the storm' of war. It positions Chifley as the helmsman now guiding the ship of state. The ad features footage of troops, industry, manufacturing and Australians at  the beach and football. Edited in a sophisticated way reminiscent of newsreels and documentaries of the time, it uses dissolves, pans and fades. When Chifley speaks direct to camera, his broad Australian accent is a surprising contrast to the plummy voice-over. At the 1946 poll the Australian Labor Party roundly defeated Robert Menzies's newly formed Liberal Party and its coalition partner the Australian Country Party."
