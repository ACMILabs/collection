    "description": [
        "The name of Australia's brand new capital was kept secret until this ceremony, held on Capital Hill in March 1913. More than 3000 spectators travelled to the site of the future capital to attend this historic occasion. The ceremony began with the laying of three foundation stones (which remain outside Parliament House today) by the Governor General Lord Thomas Denman; the Prime Minister Andrew Fisher; and the Minister for Home Affairs King O'Malley, who was responsible for choosing the site of the new city. Then, the moment the crowd had been waiting for \u2013 Lady Denman announced the name of the Capital to be Canberra \u2013 edging out other suggestions that included Shakespeare, Austral City and Cookaburra. The name Canberra derived from the local property of Canberry, which is thought to come from the Ngambri people's word for \"meeting place\". This silent footage was directed by Raymond Longford, the celebrated Australian director of 'The Sentimental Bloke' (1919). Conservators at the National Film and Sound Archive have painstakingly cleaned each frame, restoring it to almost its original quality."
