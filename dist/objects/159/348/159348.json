        "In this interview, Warwick talks about his early days in Alice Springs and getting his start in radio before moving on to films. Warwick also discusses the reoccurring theme of the matriarch in his works and the freedom and joy he finds in installation art.  \u2018Mother Courage\u2019 is a film and sculptural installation by the internationally acclaimed artist and filmmaker Warwick Thornton. Co-commissioned by ACMI and dOCUMENTA (13) as part of the ACMI Commissions Series, 'Warwick Thornton: Mother Courage' was a free exhibition in Gallery Two at ACMI 2013. As one of the most exciting filmmakers working in Australia today, Warwick Thornton is best known for 'Samson & Delilah', winner of the 2009 Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His work, 'Mother Courage' (2012), is a dynamic, multi-screen art installation that features a dilapidated campervan as its centrepiece. Audiences will peer into the van's grimy windows and through its rear doors, to view the provocative and poignant video contained within."
