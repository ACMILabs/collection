        "By staying true to your own ideals you will find a group of unique individuals where everyone belongs. A man is shipwrecked on a distant island. He must search the island for a tribe to live in by avoiding obstacles and collecting gems along the way. These tribes will take you in but on the condition you behave like them. You decline their offer saying you have a right to be yourself. You are then banished and must avoid members of these tribes as you continue your search. They attempt to catch you as you dont belong. Finally you come across a tribe that accepts you for who you are. They are all individuals and make you feel like you belong.  Under the category 'Primary Videogames', Liam Blake, Hope Valley, SA, was the Screen It 2012 winner."
