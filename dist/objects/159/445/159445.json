        "This partial coverage of the Anzac Day ceremony, held at the Australian War Memorial on Sunday April 25 1948, features the famous English actors Sir Laurence Olivier and Lady Olivier (Vivien Leigh), laying a wreath at the ceremony. The Oliviers were in Canberra as special ambassadors, making a British Council sponsored, six month tour of Australia and New Zealand. They were also performing plays in capital cities to raise money for England's famous Old Vic Theatre. The ceremony was also attended by the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, the Australian Governor-General, His Excellency Mr McKell and Mrs McKell, and various representatives of foreign countries, service and civilian bodies and a (then) record attendance of public onlookers."
