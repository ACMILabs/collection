        "Joan Peck served in the WAAAF as a radio telephone operator at Number one fighter sector in Preston. Their main role was to connect the army, navy and airforce in one central control to help protect and defend the Victorian coastline. Peck used state of the art technology at work, yet didn't even have a telephone at home. Her highly secretive and crucial work at the centre was often interspersed with a spot of knitting."
