    "description": [
        "This snappy ad aims to arrest attention by substituting the voices of Liberal Prime Minister John Howard and ALP Opposition Leader Kim Beazley with the sound of a little dog and a big dog barking. This characterisation of the leaders of Australia's major political players reflects the diminishing respect in which politicians are held. Popular Democrat Natasha Stott Despoja then calmly faces the camera and lays out the points of difference of her party of 'common sense, compassion and a fair go for all'. The tag line 'Change politics' refers both to its policies and the Democrats status as a minority party. By holding the balance of power it had been able to pursue a green agenda and to keep the major parties 'honest'. Stott Despoja rose to be party leader earlier in 2001 and retained her Senate seat at the election. She resigned before the 2007 election, the year in which the Democrats ceased to be represented in Parliament."
