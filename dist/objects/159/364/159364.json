        "Learn about the town of Orbost through a diverse range of locals as they talk about why they love their town, their community and the surrounding environment. Meet Mick Colling, the publican of the Orbost Club Hotel, who is heavily involved in fundraising within his local community and in particular for Ronald McDonald House. Lachie Macalister, a 'true' local and over eighty years old, has lived and farmed in Orbost all his life, growing everything from potatoes to pumpkins and working the land with pigs and cattle. Heather Terrell is many things: a passionate gardener, volunteer and member of the local historical society. Liz Mitchell, a tree changer and small business owner who decided to move to Orbost because she loved the environment and wanted to raise her family in a rural region. Finally, there's Sam Mitchell, an 18-year-old student known around town for the extraordinary machines he builds and rides."
