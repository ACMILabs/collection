    "description": [
        "Gorewitz describes U.S. Sweat as a 'cathartic reaction to social and personal upheavals', he transforms images of the familiar American landscape into a nightmarish, ghostly vision. Recording throughout the South and in New York, he amassed footage that reflects the American experience. Country roads, gravestones and small-town main streets seen from a car window gradually give way to an ominous vision -- saturated by Gorewitz's signature image-processing techniques and lurid, fluorescent colors -- of an America dominated by industry and the military. Called a tour-de-force by The New York Times, this is a propulsive, kinetic work of rich visual and aural textures."
