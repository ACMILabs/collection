        "The story of Swiss handkerchief embroidery is woven into scenes of local life. Although machines are now used, this old traditional art is still carried on in Alpine homes. In a Swiss home on Christmas eve, Uncle makes a handkerchief disappear. He conjures up scenes of where it may travel; to a Paris salon; a NeweYork nightclub; a garden in Spain; or even at the home of a geisha in Japan. Focuses on the Appenzell region of Switzerland in the vicinity of Zurich."
