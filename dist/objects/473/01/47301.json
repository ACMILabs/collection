        "This film lets us drop in on an African American family, noisily and gregariously living in the Shaw area of Washington, D.C. It's a bittersweet encounter that leaves one saddened by the oppressiveness of the physical situation but elated by the seemingly limitless potential of the human spirit to transcend its environment."
