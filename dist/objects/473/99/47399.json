        "The shaping of a small boat known as a pirogue, from a cypress tree trunk; an intriguing record of a fast-dying art by descendents of the Acadians who left Nova Scotia in 1755. Flaherty's films \"Louisiana story\" led to the tracing of one of the few remaining pirogue makers, Hebron Allemand whose work was recorded with Acadian folk songs giving local background."
