        "A. C. B. Lovell (professor of radio astronomy, University of Manchester) is interviewed about the new giant radio telescope at Jodrell Bank. This historic film was shot in the early years of radio astronomy and the Jodrell Bank telescope was one of the most advanced of its kind. Lovell would later play a key figure in the space race over the next few years, aiding the Soviet Union in tracking cosmonaughtical space programs."
