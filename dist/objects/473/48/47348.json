        "Focuses attention on the problem of vandalism and the need for respect for other people's property. The film tells the story of three boys who caused damage to a schoolroom because they failed to think about the possible consequences of their actions. The roles of each of the three boys involved in the incident are discussed and the point made that the prank would not have happened if each boy had acted on his own conscience."
