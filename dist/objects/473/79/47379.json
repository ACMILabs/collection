        "An account of what the discovery of oil has done to the tiny sheikdom of Abu Dhabi whose population of 200,000 were still living a simple life. The film shows the continuity of old customs and the incursion of new pressures brought about by foreign salesmen wanting to sell their goods and expertise in return for the oil-fed dollars. Also shows 20th century medicine trying to battle TB, eye diseases and the traditionalism of the people. Written and narrated by David Holden."
