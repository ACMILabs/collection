        "Three classic silent shorts from Laurel and Hardy with musical soundtrack. \"The Chimp\" (24 mins. 1932) Laid off by a bankrupt circus, Stan and Ollie are paid with assets by the ringmaster. Stan gets the flea circus, Ollie a trained chimp. Problems arise when they try to smuggle the pets into their apartment. In \"That's my wife\" (17 mins. 1929), Ollie's rich uncle visits assuming that he is happily married, but Ollie's wife leaves him and Stan must masquerade as \"the little woman\". \"Flying elephants\" (17 mins. 1927) sees Stan and Ollie play two cave men in this parody of ancient times where courtship procedures were handled with a club instead of a ring."
