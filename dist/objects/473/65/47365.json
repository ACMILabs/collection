        "Professional gangster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) returns to his old hometown of Newcastle to attend the funeral of his brother. Refusing to accept that his death was suicide, he seeks out his brother's underworld contacts who are less than helpful and suggest he returns to London. His determination to pursue his brother's killers leads him on a trail through the corrupt and seedy local underworld of prostitution, pornography and crime boss rivalries, as attempts are made on his life. A landmark performance by Michael Caine as a calculating and vicious criminal bent on revenge, who shows his victims no mercy. This grim and violent British film noir thriller is set in the bleak landscape of a wintry Northern industrial city and is the debut film from director Mike Hodges. Based on the Ted Lewis novel \"Jack returns\", the cast also includes Ian Hendry, John Osborne and Britt Ekland. Additional features include an international trailer, introduction to the film by Michael Caine, and footage of Roy Budd playing the haunting opening theme."
