        "Northern Nigeria has joined the modern world, yet in the process, the nomadic Fulani tribes have kept their pastoral way of life, the Hausaman his role as a trader. Kano the ancient walled capital is still keeper of the Moslem faith of its people who continue in their traditional crafts - tannery, indigo dyeing, silverware and sword-making while today also giving far more abundantly the raw material of western leather goods."
