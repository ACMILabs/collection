        "Three classic comic shorts from Laurel and Hardy. In \"Wrong again\" (20 mins. 1929), a comedy with a surrealistic edge, stable-hands Stan and Ollie respond to a millionaire's offer of a reward for 'Blue Boy', a missing painting, by delivering 'Blue Boy' a horse. They find an instruction to leave 'Blue Boy' on the piano. In \"Angora love\" (20 mins. 1929) Stan and Ollie are adopted by a runaway goat. In \"They go boom\" (20 mins. 1927) the boys try to cure Stan's mysterious illness and throw the landlord into distress when the cure escalates into a disaster."
