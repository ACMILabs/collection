        "In 1969 the Rolling Stones were arguably the most popular and the most seductive band in the world. Originally begun as a documentary of their American tour, 'Gimme Shelter' turned into something quite different when at the end of the tour the Stones organised a free concert at Altamont in California. Hundreds of thousands of young people on hallucinogenic drugs turned up, the local Hell's Angels were hired as bouncers and security, and before the end of the night, four people were dead, including a young black teenager whose murder by the Hell's Angels is horrifically caught on film. In hindsight, the Altamont free concert came to be seen as the death of \"the summer of love\", that innocent time in popular culture where it was believed that rock music, drugs, and youth culture would usher in a new age of peace and non-violence in American culture. The Maysles brothers took their raw footage and then had the Stones watching the events in the editing studio. What we as an audience then become witness to is a group of young men coming to terms with the full horror and limitation of their status as \"rock gods\". Although 'Gimme Shelter' ultimately enters history as a document detailing the bitter come-down of rock and roll, it also captures the exciting and erotic magic of the young Rolling Stones on stage, as well as footage of Tina Turner, Grace Slick and a host of psychedelic bands from the late sixties. The intimacy the directors had with the band can be gauged by the wonderful footage the Maysles brothers were able to take of the Stones at their worst as well as their best, including a mesmerizing sequence in the recording studio where they listen to their work on the \"Sticky Fingers\" sessions."
