        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". BBC adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Troilus and Cressida', without doubt his most shockingly modern play. The Trojan war has been raging for seven years. Few care any more about its first cause, the abduction of Helen. Each side is consumed by its own in-fighting - in saving face and destroying others. What keeps them there is their love of honour and of violence. A tragically mismanaged sideshow to this squalid war, the love of Troilus and Cressida, becomes a pattern for all relationships destroyed by circumstance, misunderstanding and deceit. Cast includes Charles Gray, Anton Lesser, Tony Steedman and Suzanne Burden."
