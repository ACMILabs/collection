        "Four classic silent shorts from Laurel and Hardy with musical soundtrack. In \"Save the ship\" (9 min. 1923), Stan is a hen-pecked husband living with his wife and her parents on a raft in the ocean. Catching his dinner proves to be a struggle that ends explosively. 'White wings' (9 mins. 1923) is a bizarre comedy that sees Stan as a street cleaner who accidentally walks off with a baby carriage instead of his cleaning carriage and is chased by a policeman. He returns as a resourceful butler in the 1925 comedy, \"Eve's love letter\" (19 mins.) In \"A man about town\" (10 mins. 1923), Stan carries a single farce element to new heights of absurdity when he is told by a street-car conductor to \"follow that girl\" for his stop."
