        "This modern fable is an allegory for a multitude of problem solving situations, ranging from substance abuse to social issues. It tells of a small village situated at the foot of \"the Mountain\" immersed in controversy through a rash of problems related to the mountain. The citizens frantically attempt a series of simplistic and ineffectual programs but these hasty measures only aggravate the problems and further divide the community. Finally reason prevails and the villagers calmly address their mountain related problems by seeking positive solutions."
