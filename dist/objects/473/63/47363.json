        "Bruno Stroszek is a contemporary equivalent of Kaspar Hauser. The story was actually inspired by the life of Bruno S. who plays Stroszek. Bruno and his two friends form an oddly assorted trio who escape from Berlin's low-life to Wisconsin in search of an 'American dream' which quickly turns sour. What begins as a low-life melodrama with a realistic edge becomes an absurdist road movie then a metaphysical quest. Bruno's isolation is lent an underlying perverse logic by Herzog's favourite circle motif recalling Bruno's early remark that 'it (life) all goes round in circles'. Cast includes Bruno S., Eva Mattes, Clemens Scheitz. In German with English subtitles."
