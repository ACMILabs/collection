        "'Century Obsession' is a documentary that explores the evolution of body worship over the last 100 years. It questions the notion of how body worship has changed from the worship of each other to the worship of ourselves and how fashion, fitness, culture and even politics have taken an integral part of this transformation. The viewer is taken through a montage of images including beauty in the 1920's, 'Muscle Beach', villages in Africa, Hitler's Youth Party, fashions of the 60's and 70's, Mary Quant, Levi jeans, communist fashion enforced by Chairman Mao, exercise inspired franchises led by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jane Fonda plus much more. Narrated by Tom Baker."
