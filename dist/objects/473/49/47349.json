        "A boy discovers a conflict between statements of \"authorities\" on a certain subject, and begins to make inquiries in order to evaluate the two statements. He considers the internal evidence on each \"authority\", the experience from which each speaks, and the evidence of his own experience, in order to decide which, if either, \"authority\" is to be believed."
