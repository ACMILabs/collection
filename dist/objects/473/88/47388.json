        "Part of a silent series called \"George Washington: his life and times\" this historic re-enactment is interspersed with titles explaining each segment. This episode focuses on Washington in his younger years including his school years. Tells of the influence Lord Fairfax had on Washington, and describes the occupation of the east coast by the British and Washington's endeavour to drive the French out of Ohio to the west. Concludes with an oration read by Washington at the funeral of General Braddock."
