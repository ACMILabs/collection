        "Shows what has happened to the land of the first Australians after the Europeans found it and settled it less than 200 years ago. It deliberates on the present state of the Aborigines who have no rights to land and whose culture is overshadowed by the white man's. Includes readings from Kath Walker's \"We are going\", archival drawings of early European settlement, historical newsreel footage (Vietnam moratorium marches, mining and minerals boom, technological and industrial development etc.) Also emphasises the devastation to the animal world through man's continual development of the natural environment for commercial gain. Photography by Douglass Baglin, narrated by Tim Elliott."
