        "Deals with the way people react to themselves by telling a story in animation about a man who reacts to his shadow in many ways, from avoidance to aggression, until he discovers light, a tool with which he can control his shadow. Compares this to the tool of understanding, used to control emotional shadows. No commentary, music and sound effects only."
