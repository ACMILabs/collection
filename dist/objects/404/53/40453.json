        "Episode of Series \"The Best of Lateline\". The High Court's Mabo decision late in 1992 was probably the most significant legal decision ever made by an Australian Court. Sadly, it led to widespread scaremongering by sections of the community, the emergence of the 'Mabo Myths' and put Aboriginal spokespeople firmly on the back foot. Lateline carefully examines the myths related to the security of various types of land title in Australia and as one observor said, admirably clarifies the decision and its meaning for all Australians."
