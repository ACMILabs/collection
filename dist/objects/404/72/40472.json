        "James Cagney plays Tom Powers, the son of a Chicago policeman, growing up in the city slums where, as a boy, he naturally turns to petty crime as a way of life. As an adult he becomes a successful big-time liquor racketeer. Tom Power has no socially redeemimg traits. He takes pleasure in even the most petty of physical insults, such as grinding half a grapefruit into the startled face of Mae Clark. Cagney's raw ferocious portrayal of a vicious criminal is masterful and the film is a classic in its genre. Also stars Jean Harlow and Joan Blondell."
