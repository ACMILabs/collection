        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". At the Coburg Community Health Centre, Anne Marie Power, textile artist, talks about groups of women that were linked together through a textile project. The common theme revolved around their houses and lives, and the women were able to develop skills which had previously been undervalued. The aim was to increase the self-awareness and self-esteem of the participants thus resulting in better health. The women with well-developed skills taught the others so a sense of group was developed."
