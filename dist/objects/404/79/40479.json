        "The Mellops encounter black holes, compressed suns and the anti-matter paperbag. An encounter with an anti-universe has everyone feeling not quite themselves. The Grubs continue on their gluttonous path, eating a now toffeeized Opera House model and making preparations to come to earth for a party at the plant nursery."
