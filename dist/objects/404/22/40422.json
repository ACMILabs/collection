        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Video tech\". This episode focuses on the camera crew - who's who and how they do their jobs. The size of the video crew depends on the size of the story to be presented, but there are three essential crew members - the presenter, the sound recordist and the camera operator. The role of each of these in the production of a video story is thoroughly examined."
