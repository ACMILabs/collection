        "Barbara Stanwyck gives one of her best performances as a social-climbing mother from the wrong side of the tracks. Born a mill-hand's daughter with no social graces, an ill-fated marriage leaves Stella single-handedly raising her daughter Laurel (Anne Shirley). Stella dreams of a new life for her daughter until she realises that what stands between Laurel and her dreams is Stella herself. This is a memorable and heartbreaking tale of a mother's love and ultimate sacrifice - with one of Hollywood's greatest finales. Don't watch this film without a box of tissues. Also stars John Boles, Barbara O'Neil and Alan Hale. Based upon the novel by Olive Higgins Prouty."
