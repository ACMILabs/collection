        "This popular 1987 film presents an interesting mix of genres: the 1980s teen movie with vampires. Michael and Sam are two brothers who have moved with their mother to Santa Carla, \"murder capitol of the world\", unaware of the vampires residing in this fictional Californian Coastal town (the film was shot in Santa Barbara, and includes spectacular footage of the Boardwalk and beach-side amusement park). Michael is charmed by a girl named Star, and immediately falls in with a tough young gang led by David. It's peer pressure in the extreme as Michael is tricked into drinking blood. He is turned into an unwilling vampire, and Sam looks to a pair of comic book vendors who are well versed in the dealings with vampires, to help save Michael. The insecurities and frustrations of youth are amplified and satirised by this exciting and funny MTV-generation thriller. Cast includes: Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Dianne Wiest, Kiefer Sutherland and Corey Feldman."
