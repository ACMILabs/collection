        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Video tech\". This program presents a structured look at the practice and technique of video story telling. It looks at the sequencing of shots and how they work to advance a story, the planning of shots, the shooting of a sequence and the placement of the camera when shooting. It focusses on continuity and the factors to watch when editing so that shots will flow from one to the other and not seem illogical in the finished product."
