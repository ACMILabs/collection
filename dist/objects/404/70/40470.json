        "This is a contracted video version of Riefenstahl's film of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. This program begins with a stylised glorification of ancient Greece, the carrying of the Olympic torch to Berlin and the opening ceremony. The action then follows the athletes performing events. Events covered include swimming, and diving, athletics, gymnastics, riding, rowing, cycling, yachting, shooting, hockey, polo and soccer. Unlike the film version which was intended as a glorification of the Nazi regime, this version shows all the athletes who won medals in the various sports, not simply focusing on the West German athletes."
