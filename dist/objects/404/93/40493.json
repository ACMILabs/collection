        "Lucy Muir (Gene Tierney) a beautiful widow and her daughter (Natalie Wood) rent a house by the ocean, and refuse to be frightened by the former owner's ghost, a dashing sea captain (Rex Harrison). When her income suddenly stops, he suggests that they collaborate on a book about his life and the unlikely pair fall deeply in love. Then Lucy's affection is challenged by a live man (George Sanders), leaving the broken-hearted captain to choose another course. Acclaimed for its heartwarming screenplay and Oscar-nominated cinematography, this film is a moving, sentimental Hollywood classic."
