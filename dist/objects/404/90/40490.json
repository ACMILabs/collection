        "Acclaimed British actors Juliet Stevenson and Alan Rickman star in this wonderfully moving story of love, loss and letting go. Nina lives in her rat-infested flat where she spends most of her time grieving for her dead lover, Jamie. As if in answer to her dreams, Jamie re-enters her life but Nina discovers that living in the past could mean a life without a future."
