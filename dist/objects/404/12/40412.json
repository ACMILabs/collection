        "Episode number 26 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". Does life exist elsewhere in the universe? The search for life begins by looking for the chemicals of life - hydrogen and helium, which emanate from the stars. The atoms which make up our body, come directly from the stars, when supernovae exploded and dispersed their atoms into the molecular clouds around them. This chemical cocktail is the beginning of life. Astronomers are searching the heavens for this chemical cocktail and for signals from distant galaxies similar to our own. Ultimately this may show, that in all probability, we are not alone."
