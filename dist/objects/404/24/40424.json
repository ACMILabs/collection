        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Video tech\". Focuses on basic editing principles - making the decision about what to include in a video story and what to omit. Investigates the reasons it is essential to edit - to eliminate unwanted footage, to compress time and to ultimately make a program more interesting. It also looks at the needs of in-camera editing such as planning a shoot, shooting in sequence and shot duration. It also covers the needs of editing between camcorder and VCR, setting up at home and crash editing."
