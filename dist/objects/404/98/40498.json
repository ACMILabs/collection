        "Released in the United States as \"Tune in tomorrow\", this is John Amiel's screen version of Mario Vargas Llosa's acclaimed novel \"Aunt Julia and the scriptwriter\". Aunt Julia (Barbara Hershey), a double divorcee, returns to New Orleans at age 36 to find a wealthy third husband. Instead, she finds her 21-year-old nephew by marriage (Keanu Reeves), a local radio station newswriter, who falls in love with her. She succumbs to his advances, incurring her family's anger. The plot is overlaid with the more complicated story of a dishevelled writer, Falk, who is new in town. Falk manipulates the nephew-aunt relationship in his radio soap opera which is laced with incest and anti-Albanian sentiment. This is a clever and witty romantic comedy that features an amazing supporting cast including John Laroquette, Elizabeth McGovern, Dennis Quaid and others."
