        "Using the Intergalatic phone book, the Mellops use the WOOP to go to Planet Peaceful where the Grubs have caused havoc. Sam and Mike get WOOPed aboard the Grub Spaceship where they try to unsuccessfully gain access to the WOOP manual. The grubs try to eat Dump but he tastes so awful that they let him go. The return to Earth is not a pleasant experience and Dump makes it back in his underpants."
