        "Jill Clayburgh and Alan Bates star in this excellent production depicting the reconstruction of a life, as Clayburgh struggles to find herself after her husband leaves her for another woman. Torn between conflicting forces, her lovers and her daughter, Clayburgh learns to take control of her life. This film became a beacon for the Women's Movement in the 1970's."
