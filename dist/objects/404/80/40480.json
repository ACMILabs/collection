        "Dump wants to use the compressed sun to make money while the Mellops try and think of a way to dissaude the Grubs from visiting Earth. Dump is using the WOOPS and the compressed sun to tan everyone in London. The countdown begins for the Grubs visit. Sam and Michael WOOP themselves aboard the spaceship only to be toffeed and the Grubs ignore her's and Michael's speeches. Eventually some order is restored. The Grubs prepare to join their cocoons and grow up, while on earth, the re-opening of the plant nursery means the party can begin."
