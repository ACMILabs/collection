        "Westworld combines solid entertainment and chilling topicality with a futuristic, suspenseful plot written by Michael Chrichton. Set in the not too distant future, this is a vision of what may occur if man becomes too reliant on the infallibility of machines. Westworld is one of three giant theme parks built in what is left of America's great outdoors where for $1,000 a day, tourists may indulge their highest and lowest appetites. Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are among the visitors to the futuristic theme park where the gun-hands and dance-hall girls are robots programmed to serve the guest's whims and fantasises until something malfunctions in their circuitry. Yul Brynner delivers a remarkably eerie performance as a robot cowboy who develops a taste for the kill."
