        "Cast adrift during wartime in the Indian Ocean after a bombing raid on their ship, an RAF officer (Richard Burton) and a nun (Joan Collins) in civilian clothing find themselves attracted to each other. Fighting off attacks by sharks and surviving in the harsh sun, the couple are forced together to brave the elements. The nun gives the officer no encouragement, but he falls madly in love with her and vows to find her again when they return to civilisation. Will she keep her vocation a secret or will she give in to her desires? Based on the novel 'Sea-Wyf' by J.M. Sott."
