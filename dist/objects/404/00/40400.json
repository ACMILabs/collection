        "Episode number 14 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". For centuries, stargazers and early scientists saw the Earth as the centre of the universe. Eventually it became evident that our planet was part of a solar system located on an outer arm of a spiral galaxy called \"The Milky Way.\" Our own galaxy, seen in the night sky as a haze, has offered scientists an opportunity to examine some important questions such as \"How big is our galaxy?\" and \"How did it form?\""
