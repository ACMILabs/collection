        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Women and spirituality\". This beautifully crafted documentary is an in-depth look at the witch persecutions that swept through Europe just a few hundred years ago. False accusations and trials led to extensive torture and burnings at the stake, and ultimatley to the destruction of a way of life that had endured for thousands of years. Of those killed, 85% were women and widespread violence against women, still prevalent today, can be traced back to those times. It investigates the role of the Catholic Church in the crimes and explores the process whereby the old pagan communities, founded on spirituality and cooperation, were transformed into the misogynist capitalist societies of our own century."
