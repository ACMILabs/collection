        "Michael Williams (Nicholas Cage) is an ex-marine, down on his luck and desperate for work. When he stumbles into the dusty desert town of Red Rock, he is mistakenly identified by the local saloon owner (J.T. Walsh) as the hired gun commissioned to kill his unfaithful wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn-Boyle). Taking the money but choosing instead to warn her, Michael is faced with another indecent proposal when Suzanne doubles the offer - to kill her husband! Again, Michael accepts the \"job\" and tries to leave town before his luck changes but on the road leaving Red Rock, he discovers it already has - the real killer has just arrived!"
