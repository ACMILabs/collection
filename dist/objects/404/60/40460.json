        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Women and spirituality\". This is a stirring documentary that awakens memories of ancestral roots that connect us to each other and to all living things. It is a journey that looks at some of the manifestations of the modern women's spirituality movement in the western world. Through contmporary spirituality, whether from Wicca, pagan or indigenous peoples we see people communing with each other or alone. Rituals become gateways that lead to an inner place where twentieth century notions of domination over the earth are replaced with a sense of awe."
