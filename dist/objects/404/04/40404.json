        "Episode number 18 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". Philosophers and scientists have pondered not only our beginning, but also our end. Will the universe end in \"fire or ice\"? As the universe expands, galaxies move away from each other. If this happens infinitely, eventually there would be an expanse of dark and little or no light. The forces of gravity however also operate, eventually pulling galaxies closer together. The key to the fate of the universe lies in the study of Dark Matter, the seemingly empty space between bright objects. Astronomers put forward many theories about the composition and purpose of the Dark Matter. Discusses the concepts of the Closed Universe and the Open Universe."
