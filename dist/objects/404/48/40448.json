        "Illustrates the harsh reality of life in a coal mining town using documentary and fictional techniques. Made in Ammanford, Wales, the film recounts the life of Daffyd Rhys employed as a caretaker for the local school following a coal mine explosion. The story is related by one of the school's former pupils and covers Daffyd's early life in the coal mines, his courtship and marriage, his work as a poet, the death of his son, and his life at the school. Most of the roles are performed by the people of Ammanford resulting in a realistic portrayal of life in the Welsh coal mining community. The film was presented as Wales contribution to the Festival of Britain."
