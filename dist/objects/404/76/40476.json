        "James Cagney shines in a virtuoso, verbal machine-gun fire perfomance as an American executive trying to sell Coca Cola to the Russians while preventing his boss's daughter from marrying an East-German communist. How the would-be groom is converted into a capitalist before her parents arrive is part of this first-class farce."
