        "Episode number 15 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". Howlar Shapley hypothesised that the Milky Way was the entire universe. Edwin Hubble finally determined that this was incorrect, and that the Milky Way was just one galaxy among many. Since this discovery, much has been learned about galaxies. Galaxies come in three shapes: elliptical which is the most common, spiral like our own Milky Way and irregular. They form local groups, clusters and super-clusters and interact and collide, thus changing the face of the universe. By studying the behaviour of galaxies, scientists are trying to determine the shape of the universe."
