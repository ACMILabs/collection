        "Episode number 16 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". This episode discusses a peculiar type of galaxy called a Quasar. Quasars looked liked stars but did not have the same size, shape or spectrum as stars. They were extremely luminous and expanding away from us. Quasars are believed to be the cause of galaxies. Astronomers believe that the structure of a Quasar is an extremely bright nucleus of a galaxy and a central Black Hole which over time evolves into a \"normal\" galaxy."
