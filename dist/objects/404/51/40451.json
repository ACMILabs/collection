        "Using the innovative technique of clay painting, artist and filmmaker Joan Gratz takes the viewer on an entertaining and colourful journey through the development of Modern Art. Starting with the brilliant landscapes and haunting self-portraits of impressionism, \"Mona Lisa descending a staircase\" moves through cubism and surrealism, then finishes with vibrant images of contemporary pop art and hyper-realism. Featuring some 55 paintings and 35 artists from Van Gogh to Warhol, the video shifts seamlessly from image to image to make this artistic presentation as emotionally gripping as it is visually fascinating."
