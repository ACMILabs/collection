        "Episode number 21 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". This two part episode looks at the planet Mercury which is closest to our Sun, and the Moon, our nearest celestial neighbour. Both these heavenly bodies are similar and size and appearance. They appear desolate and marked with craters, but are different in important ways. Mercury has a magnetic field and large solid iron core but the Moon does not. Mercury, despite its closeness to the sun, has Polar Ice Caps due to its orbit. This program also looks at the exploration of the Moon by astronauts in the 1970's and includes footage of Apollo 11's historic landing in 1969."
