        "Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford star in one of Hollywood's legendary love stories. Redford is the boy who sets out to become the top film writer in Hollywood and Streisand is the outspoken activist. Their love binds them together, but their beliefs put them on a collision course which ultimately tears them apart. Redford is charming as the all-American WASP boy, while Streisands performance as the \"blue-stocking\" Jewish activist is moving, as she vacillates between fragility and passionate committment to her causes. Although uneven and at times unashamedly sentimental, the film is a classic of its genre. Marvin Hamlisch's score and the title song earned Oscars for the film."
