        "Episode number 17 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". Once Hubble's Law was accepted; that is the Law of an Expanding Universe, two theories about the creation of the universe were put forward. The Big Bang Theory stated that an initial tiny volume of matter exploded outwards, thus creating the beginnings of the universe. The Steady State Theory put forward by Sir Fred Hoyle, proposed that the universe never had a beginning but that matter was created as the universe expanded. The latter theory was abandoned by scientists, however the quest to determine the age and origin of the cosmos is still of vital importance for astronomers."
