        "On June 4th 1989, the world watched as the tanks rolled into Tianamen Square, dispersing the students who had carried out their non-violent protest for democratic reform in China. After Tianamen, China would never be the same. Paradoxically, along with the tightening of security, the increased presence of surveillence and miltary forces, there has been a rise in consumerism, entrepreneurship and commercialism as China takes it place in the global marketplace. This program looks at the aftermath of Tianamen, examining issues such as the state's control of the arts, the expression of dissent, particularly reflected in the growing interest in religion, and the economic and social changes which are changing the face of China."
