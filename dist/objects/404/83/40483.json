        "The independant US band The Lemonheads first received mainstream attention when their album \"It's A Shame About Ray\" broke through into the Top 40. We casually follow the band around Australia during the 1992 tour to promote the album. Utilising cinema verite techniques this program includes interviews with the band and live performances of many of their songs. It also features the promotional videos to a number of songs including: \"It's a Shame about Ray\", \"Confetti\", \"My Drug Buddy\" and their unique version of Simon & Garfunkle's \"Mrs Robinson\"."
