        "Episode number 19 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". The Solar system formed from a cloud of gas and dust from which our Sun and the planets emerged. As the cloud collapsed, and rotated faster, it formed into a disk, with a central bulge. The combination of this accelerated rotation, and gravity meant that the tiny dust particles formed into structures known as planetessimals, which eventually evolved into planets. Solar wind cleared the dusts and gases of this cloud after the planets formed. Astronomers study newly formed stars in order to locate possible formation of solar systems and planets."
