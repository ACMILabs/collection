        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Women and spirituality\". This stunning and poetic documentary is a salute to 35,000 years of pre-history, to the solid values of ancestors only recently remembered, and to our ancient goddess-worshipping religions. Archaeologists and anthropologists are beginning to discover evidence of a widespread early civilisation based primarily on human co-operation. This epsiode reveals these forgotten cultures - taking us from ancient caves in France to the sun-drenched palaces at Delphi and Crete. There is also a discussion among well-known scholars such as Merlin Stone and Jean Bolen, who propose a return to a belief in an interconnected life system, with respect for the earth and the female."
