        "A sweeping, breathtaking epic covering the life of T. E. Lawrence. Throughout his two years in Arabia during the First World War, he succeeded in uniting the Arab tribes against the Turks and became a legend in his own time, the great Lawrence of Arabia. Starring Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer and Anthony Quayle, Lean's breathtaking film won seven Oscars in 1962, despite suffering some major cuts, with loss of footage for thirty years. Those dramatic scenes have been restored in this Director's Cut."
