        "Episode number 20 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". From the tempest and chaos of the early beginnings of our solar system, the planets were born. It is believed that from a collision of smaller bodies orbiting the sun, bigger objects were formed into the planets. The Earth underwent a severe heating and cooling which accounts for its structure. This episode examines the Earth from a planetary perspective. Unique in our solar system, the planet contains large bodies of water and an oxygen, rather than carbon dioxide based atmosphere; optimum conditions for the formation of organic life. In terms of the Earth's geological age, the presence of life happened relatively late in the Earths' life cycle."
