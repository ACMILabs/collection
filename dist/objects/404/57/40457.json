        "2000 years after Icarus and 200 years since the first flight of an air balloon, a young man finds himself afloat in the atmosphere, sitting in an ordinary garden chair and boyed by a collection of weather balloons. This humurous and endearing Australian short recounts the true story of a man, living somewhere west of Shepparton, who after sinking a few drinks and smoking a few joints at a party, finds himself a passenger in a makeshift aircraft. Bizarre and entertaining, \"Higher than High\" also portrays the unique sounds and textures of Australian rural life."
