        "Episode number 23 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, and unlike Earth is a gaseous rather than terrestial planet, largely composed of hydrogen and helium. An enormous planet, Jupiter spins very fast and has a strong magnetic field. Its famous red spot is in fact a huge storm travelling across the planet's surface. Jupiter's moons, in particular Io, Europa and Gannymede are examined in this program. Scientists were amazed to find, that like Saturn, Jupiter had rings. Saturn, with its famous rings, is very similar in composition to Jupiter. It's rings, seen by early astronomers, are largely made of ice and number into the thousands. Saturn's moons such as Titan, are also highlighted in this program because of their diversity."
