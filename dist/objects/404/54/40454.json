        "This is the inspiring story of a group of Filipino women and their efforts to acquire land of their own in the post-Marcos era. It looks at the plight of a group of women on the outskirts of Cebu, the second largest city in the Phillipines, who make their living as sidewalk sellers. Their story unfolds in the political arena of the Aquino Government, whose promises for land reform have never materialised. Interweaved with their struggle is the story of the evergrowing population of streetkids who beg and their struggle to survive. This is a powerful example of women and children, traditionally viewed as powerless, taking the future into their own hands."
