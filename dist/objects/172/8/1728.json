        "A documentary about the filmmaker's grandparents who were both survivors of the Nazi Holocaust against the European Jews. Tsipa and Wolf met, married and started a new family together built on the sadness of what they left behind in Europe. With the advent of Alzheimer's, this union is finally falling apart. This warm, sad, funny and ultimately humane documentary is also a loving testimonial to the importance of family life."
