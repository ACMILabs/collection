        "A film for teachers, describing the use of the \"discovery method\" in teaching. All it needs is a teacher whose encouragement is natural and unobtrusive. The film shows a free environment where even the furniture can be arranged to meet the needs of a particular inquiry. Film loops and other visual media are shown being used to advantage in this method of teaching."
