        "An interpretation of the work of Henry Moore, made in close collaboration with him. The work of the artist is revealed in a series of striking visual studies, with a simplicity and directness that may surprise people who feel that abstract art is unrelated to humanity and the world generally. Commentary by Sir Ralph Richardson and music is based on electronic instruments and the use of special effects."
