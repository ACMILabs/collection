        "As a training exercise for their apprentice cameramen, British Transport Films used scrap lengths of film to record the varied daily lives of their neighbours as seen from the roof of their building in London's Marylebone. A film without commentary featuring the music of Vaughan Williams. Nominated for a BAFTA award in 1974."
