        "The film shows that the fur seals have returned to Macquarie Island after having been virtually wiped out by the earlier sealers. The elephant seals were never exploited to the same extent and each year return to the Island in increasing numbers to breed and rear their pups. The film describes in detail the yearly cycle of the elephant seals on Macquarie Island."
