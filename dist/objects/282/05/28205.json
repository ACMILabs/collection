        "A satire on non-conformity and artistic pretentiousness. A director is ridiculed at a script conference and humiliated in a street chase. Suddenly he becomes a clever, and therefore, famous dog. But despite initial celebration he soon incurs public displeasure, is chased through the streets and meets final indignities of the dog-catchers net and van."
