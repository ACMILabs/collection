        "Presents the major work by Australian sculptor Ian Bow: the bronze cycle \"The Attitudes and Passions of Man\". Comprising 23 pieces of sculpture, the cycle aims to typify the depths and shallows of human experience. The first part of the film illustrates the whole process - two-dimensional studies, small models, full-size models, casting and finishing - by which such sculpture is realised. Narrated by Eric Westbrook."
