        "A powerful emotional plea by the United Nation's Children Fund, appealing for support from affluent nations using experimental film techniques combining found and improvised footage. The film intercuts footage of American children during their Halloween 'Trick or Treat' rounds collecting money for UNICEF with footage of international child hunger. Deals convincingly with the realities of children's lives in less affluent countries. Music by Peggy Glanville-Hicks."
