        "Illustrates the methods by which geologists forecast the areas where deposits of oil are likely to be found. Set mainly in the jungles of Indonesia the film shows how map making, geological and gravimetric survey, seismic exploration and fossil interpretation are used to build up a picture of the underground rock formations. On the basis of this information the location of the first test well is decided."
