        "An underwater look at the inhabitants of the Red Sea. These creatures appear to be from another world yet they are a very real part of the Sea's ecosystem. Imaginative music and sound effects heighten the beautiful underwater photography. This film is a comment upon the fragile web of life. Film without narration."
