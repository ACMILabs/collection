        "Two young louts grab a model aeroplane from a young school boy. His classmates steal out of classes, surround the offenders and retrieve the plane, returning to class undetected. This is Cornwall's third award winning film and shows careful and detailed work at the scripting stage; precision, and undisciplined cutting away of the inessential, and imaginative use of the camera."
