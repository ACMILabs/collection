        "The sea, and not the continents, is the dominant force on this planet. Its secrets, hidden by the vastness of the oceans, are slowly being unravelled by scientists engaged in oceanographic research. This science documentary, designed to promote a better understanding of this great resource, takes us aboard the C.S.S. Hudson, a Canadian oceanographic vessel, to explore the sea."
