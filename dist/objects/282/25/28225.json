        "Episode of Series \"Artists at Work\". Five contemporary artists at work in Paris: Dewasne, working in pure colours, primaries dominating, the work somewhere between music and architecture; Di Teana, at work in steel, winner of the Prix de Saint Goba, 1962; Fruhtrunk - bands orange to black, the colours play as a Bach fugue; Weisbuch - continues the Daumier tradition - and winner of the Prix de la Critique for the best show in Paris, 1961; and Hartung - one of the most important influences on abstract, and prize winner at the Venice Biennale, 1960."
