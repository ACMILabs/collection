        "Motion Picture actors are seen in their homes, conducting important business of their craft through Screen Actors Guild and meeting the problems of everyday living the same as other citizens. The film is concerned mainly with presenting film actors as ordinary people. Reginald Denny is an aeronautical engineer; Esther Williams a successful business woman; Clark Gable as a keen rancher; Lionel Barrymore a talented artist."
