        "The development of the pleuteus larva of the sea urchin is shown in actual photographs assisted by explanatory animated diagrams. The feeding and growth of the four, six and eight-armed stages are seen. The young urchin is contrasted with the larval form and its growth into a mature adult explained. Emphasis is made on the methods of feeding during the different stages of the life history."
