        "Episode of Series \"Russian Education\". Examines the present school system in the Soviet Union. Demonstrates the style of Soviet teaching which is fairly rigid and formal, with the emphasis on teacher dominated instruction and passive pupils, responding only when instructed to do so. A more flexible teaching style was introduced some years ago but was later abandoned. Photographer, Dean Semler; script, Roger Milliss; editor, Martyn Down; sound, George Hart, Howard Spry; commentator, Margaret Throsby."
