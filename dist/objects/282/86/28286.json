        "A study of the processes through which animals pass in their early development from the egg. The structure of the male and female sea urchin is compared and microphotography shows in detail the eggs, sperm, the process of fertilisation and the formation of the fertilisation membrane. This film is complete in itself as a basic study of embryology."
