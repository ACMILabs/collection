        "The groundbreaking, multiple award-winning drama series 'Love My Way' was one of the first Australian productions made exclusively for subscription television (Foxtel). This enabled Foxtel to allow the producers 'absolute creative freedom...to carve out a piece of TV drama that was edgy, daring, provocative' (Foxtel's Brian Walsh).  Revolving around the untidy lives and complicated loves of a contemporary Australian blended family and their friends, 'Love My Way' was both critically acclaimed and highly successful, with a further two seasons produced following the initial ten episodes of Series 1.  Series 1, Episode 4 first aired on Foxtel on 6th December 2004."
