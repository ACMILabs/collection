        "Angela Towney's passion in life is for martial arts, for which she has competed around Australia and, she hopes, internationally. However, she acknowledges and pays homage to the influences that gave her the strength to achieve, her family and community in Wiradjuri country. Despite her father's earlier troubles, his reform instilled a sense of pride and inner strength which allowed Angel to move beyond the community that she loved to follow her passion. Despite the difficulty of traversing two cultures, the introspection of the East and the Indigenous sense of community, her firey ambition and her innate love of her community and land, Angel recognises that she is enriched and embraced by both."
