        "T'Kido Titasey dedicates this story to his grandmother. Born a Torres Strait Islander, she never received a formal education but was taught about survival. After World War II, she set up a ukulele band with her two sisters. It became popular and The Mill Sisters travelled around the world and landed a recording deal. Gran's resourcefulness and eagerness to try new things took her and her sisters on an amazing adventure and has been an immense inspiration to T'Kido."
