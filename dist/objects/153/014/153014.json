        "Dot Peters' father was 39 when he joined World War II. He fought in the Middle East and was later captured in Java and sent to a Prisoner of War camp in Japan. He died there, leaving a grieving family wondering what he went through. Simultaneously, they witnessed the injustices inflicted on fellow Indigenous servicemen who had experienced equality overseas, only to find it stripped away on their return. This inspired Dot to dedicate the rest of her life to fighting for Indigenous rights, eventually collaborating with the Shrine of Remembrance to recognise the contribution made by Indigenous people during the war. This fight has helped her to bring her father's spirit home, to bestow upon his memory a sense of belonging, recognition and honour."
