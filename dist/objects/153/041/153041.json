        "For Jean Williamson, her time at the Women's Auxiliary Australian Airforce was new and exciting and, much to her disappointment, short. She joined a few months shy of the end of the war. Still, as she looks back through an album of memories, she reflects fondly on friends made, good times and meeting her husband Noel. She also considers how at that time she wasn't aware she was an Indigenous Australian. When she found out, she responded by becoming heavily involved in the Indigenous community. Despite her pale complexion, Jean Williamson proudly declares her black heart."
