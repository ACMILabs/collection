        "Six young Indigenous Australians look back and reflect on the things, events and people that have inspired, encouraged and, ultimately, shaped them into the youth leaders they have become. While telling different stories, they all have some common themes, of family, connection to their land and culture and spirituality. The stories brim with optimism and uplift and inspire in much the same way that these young people were inspired by the stories of their ancestors."
