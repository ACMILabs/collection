        "Ayesha Lai came from a big family from many different cultures. But one thing her family shared is their love for Australian Rules football. Ayesha tells of how she developed her passion for the game, through her brothers and reading about the great Indigenous footballers who played for Essendon. Eventually she threw her support behind the club, which culminated in meeting and talking with Kevin Sheedy."
