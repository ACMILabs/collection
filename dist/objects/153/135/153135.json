        "When Phillip Martinovski had to go to Copperfield's senior campus, he was incredibly nervous, so much so that on the first day he spent a lot of time standing outside the gates, debating whether to 'wag'. In the end, he threw himself him and talks about his time at Copperfield College Senior School, in the hope that he can students like him overcome their fears."
