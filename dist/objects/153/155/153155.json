        "Walter Bird recalls a time when he was asked \"Where are you from?\", and answered by describing where his house was situated in the neighbourhood. Growing up, he started to learn the implications of that question. He realised that he was ethnically different from other Australian-born children. Being the child of immigrants, Walter weighs up the positives and negatives of being a first generation Australian and shares his experiences when he finally travelled to his parents' countries."
