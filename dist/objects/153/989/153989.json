        "This film highlights the excitement and celebration of the official opening of 'Tim Burton: the exhibition'. A night filled with colour and sound. Amongst the fire eaters, stilt walkers and burlesque performers were the Tim Burton fans waiting to get a glimpse of their idol. The festivities start with the red carpet for VIPs that ran along the Flinders Street entrance and eventually inside ACMI\u2019s Lightwell the official opening speeches were delivered."
