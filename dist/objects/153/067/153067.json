        "One of Robbie Palm's favourite things is fishing at the creek of his nan's property. Even though he goes to boarding school in Brisbane, he returns during school holidays to fish. He has been taught by his family the techniques and it is this, and when he plays the Didgeridoo that Robbie feels most connected to his culture. When he plays, he feels proud and watched by his family, both current and past."
