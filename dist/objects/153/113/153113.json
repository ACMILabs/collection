        "This mini-documentary takes us behind the scenes of the 'One past eight futures' Digital Storytelling workshop at ACMI. The participants of this particular workshop are eight young indigenous people who are part of the Indigenous Youth Leadership program. They discuss their stories, their participation in the workshop and what they have gained from the experience. The results are a social and cultural snapshot of Australia's Indigenous youth, through their stories, their ties to the past and, mostly, their hopes for the future."
