        "Brook Tesfaye was born with one complicaton - his left foot was bent. Since his parents couldn't afford surgery in Switzerland, Brook wore plastic correcting shoes for seven years, until he finally got his foot straight. He talks about the ongoing complications of the bent foot, of the pain, discomfit and subsequent complicatons on his knee and ankle, and how he has lived his life regardless. Despite the pain, Brook is determined to continue playing soccer, a passion he can never give up. He figures that's how life is - and everyone has their complications."
