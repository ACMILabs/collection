        "Sarah Vincent looks at 2008, a year of immense ups and downs, and, in particular, when she was diagnosed with cancer. Rather than dwelling on the treatment and anxiety, Sarah chooses to focus on the amazing support she received from her community of family, friends, the school and neighbours. Through their support, Sarah learned to count her blessings and credits cancer with changing her outlook on life."
