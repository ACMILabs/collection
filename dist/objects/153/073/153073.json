        "Gerald Phineasa loves his family and small community of Bamaga in far North Queensland. His large family have plenty of animals and are starting to race horses and he looks forward to returning from his school break in Brisbane to days of riding and fishing. His town is small but somehow has everything Gerald would want. A loving tribute and a snapshot of a small rural community."
