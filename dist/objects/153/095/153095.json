    "description": [
        "In July 2008, the ACMI Content Development crew spent four days in Lockington and produced five short documentary films. The premier screening of these short films took place on the 15th of January 2009, on a hot and humid Thursday evening in the Lockington & District Community Centre. Over 200 locals joined Tony Sweeney and Kim Montgomery, from ACMI, and Louise Ross, a local and chief community organiser, to showcase the films and celebrate the stories that make Lockington a thriving and unique regional town. This film of the premiere screenings captures the excitement of the locals with a red carpet arrival for all the guests, the handing out of DVDs to all individuals that were involved in the project and finally vox pops from the audience members as they share with us their appreciation and pride for the films."
