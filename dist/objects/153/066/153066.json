        "A growth spurt sent Joel Hagan into the arena of sports. Finding out he was natuarally good at Australian rules, Joel has travelled around Australia, playing football and, later, rugby. Joel's coaches taught him to be quick off the mark and not to wait for the ball, to go out and get it. These words have inspired Joel, not only in sports but in all aspects of his life and have given him the ambition to pursue a career in journalism in the future."
