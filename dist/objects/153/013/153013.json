    "description": [
        "He would whittle away at scraps of wood for hours, lost in the quiet moments of himself, perhaps trying to make sense of the war, we'll never know. A son's reflection on the life of his father, a veteran from World War I, who returned both psychologically and physically scarred but would never share these scars with the rest of his family, choosing to spend his later years in quiet and solitary contemplation. Jim Willox and his family can only guess at the trauma that bellies the whittling his dad so regularly engaged in. A tribute to a war veteran by his son, who will never fully comprehend all he went through."
