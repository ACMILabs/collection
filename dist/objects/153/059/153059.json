        "Jenny He (Curatorial Assistant, Department of Film) and Ron Magliozzi (Assistant Curator, Department of Film) are co-organizers of the Tim Burton exhibition, from MoMa (The Museum of Modern Art) in New York. Here they are interviewed by Kate Warren, ACMI\u2019s Assistant Curator, about their work on 'Tim Burton: The Exhibition'. They take us through the process, from inception, through to collaborating with Tim Burton, of Burton's work and the curatorial process. As well as viewing Tim Burton's work from an artistic perspective, we also gain insight into the art of the curator and curatorial perspective."
