        "Ken Saunders reflects on the silence reverie of his father, a returned soldier. He never spoke about the war and, when Ken tried to broach the subject, told Ken to let sleeping dogs lie. This left Ken wondering about the demons that his dad confronts alone and the war that took his brother Harry. Spurred by the belief that all warriors need to come home, Ken initiates his own research to find out all he can about Harry and, eventually, return his brother's spirit home."
