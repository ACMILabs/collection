        "Jack McMahon wanted to be a pilot for as long as he can remember. When war was declared, he signed up as soon as he could and, unsurprisingly, joined the Air Force. He warmly talks about his time during World War II, the friendships and bonds created and the crucial moments during the war where he needed to step up and take a chance. Despite being told by his instructor that he was going to kill himself, Jack McMahon returned to Australia and was honoured for his services during the Anzac Day football match in 2008."
