        "Tori Towney came from an encouraging and supportive family. Growing up, she resisted the urge to join her friends drinking and instead listened to the stories of her father, of his harsh and poor upbringing. When her mum encouraged her to move to Sydney and take up a scholarship at St Catherine's, she grabbed this opportunity with both hands. Tori candidly shares what it was like to be away from home with no support network and how she overcame that and adapted to her new and exciting environment."
