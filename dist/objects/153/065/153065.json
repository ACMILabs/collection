        "Dancing is a way of life, culture and part of our identity. Haryne Uta, a young Torres Strait Islander, started dancing from a very young age. He tells of his journey to not taking it very seriously to realising, under the guidance of his elders, how crucial dancing is to Haryne's spiritual awakening. The stories of the dance awoke in Haryne a sense of pride and connection to the spiritual world, people and the land."
