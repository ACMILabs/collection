        "The attack on the World Trade Centre in September 2001 resonated with veterans like Graham Atkinson, reminding him of his time in Vietnam during the 1960s and 1970s. Graham tells of how being in the army taught him strength, respect and a sense of dignity for all. Vietnam was a turning point for this Indigenous Australian. He returned highly politicised and railed against violence in his community but left with decades of unresolved memories."
