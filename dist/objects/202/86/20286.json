        "Episode of Series \"The American Short Story\". Parker Adderson is a captured Yankee spy whose facile philosophy and flippant concern for life arouse a Confederate general's instinct for sham. The harsh reality of his impending execution brings abrupt character changes in Adderson, and a vicious battle in the general's tent ensues."
