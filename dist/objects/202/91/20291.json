        "Traces America's snowballing history as an affluent society and looks at the dilemma which abundance brings. A land of abounding factory production and consumption, where success is measured by material standards. America underwent a revolution from an agricultural to an manufacturing society. Now a second revolution looms, to an automated society. What will this mean to the nation, and how individuals will accept a society in which a minority of people can manage the nation's work, is discussed."
