        "A surreal fairy tale about a little girl in search of a pair of angel's wings. The story is set in a background of London scenes, South Kensington, Earl's Court, the Albert Memorial and Rotten Row. In the course of her search she visits a junk shop down the road, a jumble stall and finally tracks down a perfect pair of wings in a crazy artist's studio. An interesting contrast is provided between the high-quality location photography and the surreal intrusions by a collection of fairy-tale characters. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
