        "The playtpus is one of nature's shy creatures. Only twice has a playtpus bred in captivity. Because they are found only in Australia, and will not breed in zoos, most people know very little about the playtpus. This exceptional film shows the playtpus on dry land, underwater and by means of a carefully sectioned burrow , we even follow him into his home."
