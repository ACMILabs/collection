        "This film has no dialogue, however it's evocative soundtrack and beautiful visuals are extremely touching. A young boy runs along the beach on Stradbroke Island off Queensland, absorbed by the shimmering, rhythmic waves, and the textures, shadows and patterns of all he sees on the sand - the footprints of tiny creatures, the undulating sand shapes sculptured by the ocean currents, the shells and seaweed and the shadowy fish trapped in a pool. Music: Nancy Tow. No other credits available."
