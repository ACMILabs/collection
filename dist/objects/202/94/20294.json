        "This factual treatment of the American past balances the unintentional sexism of most US history as now taught. Names like Sarah and Angelina Grimke, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, and Carrie Chapman Catt will now become familiar through vivid, often humorous, sometimes deeply moving historical dramatizations. This film is an introduction to the American women's movement. Narrated by Mary Tyler Moore. Associate Producer: Lois Bianchi."
