        "Abstract animation by Jordon Belson. Intended to express \"the subliminal rhythms of the inner cosmos\", this experimental film portrays an hallucinogenic voyage into outer space. It consists of sequences featuring interplay of dots, lines, planes, intricate kaleidoscopic designs, circles, grids, rhythms, textures, intensities and variations of focus. The images themselves often suggest the infinity of outer space or of subatomic particles, the snappy impersonality of computers or the undulation of romantic coloured clouds, provide filmed contrasts and tensions complemented by a musical soundtrack which itself acts as a counterpoint."
