        "A satirical cartoon describing the life of a typical modern man from childhood to old age, in six epochs. Between each epoch the individual has to wind himself up enough to see himself through the next phase of his life, but eventually the human \"spring\" can take no more. No commentary is used, simple music sets the scene."
