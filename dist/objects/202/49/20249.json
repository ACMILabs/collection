        "This interesting vignette from the Movietone News programs compares a motor vehicle driver to an all-round cricketer. Most cricketers specialise in one aspect of the game, but an all-rounder can prove a most valuable asset to a team, as Richie Benaud did for the Australian team in the test series. Drivers, too need all-round skills; reckless driving and a lack of concentration are fatal on both the oval and the road! No other credits available."
