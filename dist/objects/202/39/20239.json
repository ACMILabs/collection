        "Illustrates the uses that meetings and conferences can be made to serve, if guided by a trained and competent leader. Shows how the behaviour of people attending meetings is basically affected by the personal concerns they bring with them. Points out that the conference leader can deal successfully with the problem on the table only if he understands how to deal with the people around it. Dramatizes the pitfalls that can beset any meeting and the steps to take in order to avoid them."
