        "Looks at the \"musical explosion\" by tracing the roots of popular music or jazz in American history. Studies the African and European roots in New Orleans jazz and gospel songs in hillbilly folk songs and dances, showing many of the actual oletime as well as recent performers who gave American popular music its first expression, and developed it into the internationally recognised jazz of today."
