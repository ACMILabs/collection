        "An amusing and energetic romp through the letters of the alphabet, wittily animated by Elliot Noyes Junior. Each letter has its own objects, animals or actions to suggest words it begins - A for Apple, Z for Zebra. None, however, retains the expected form for long, fading, changing at the artist's whimsy. For anyone at the reading-readiness stage, young or old, this is a language film to sharpen words and humour."
