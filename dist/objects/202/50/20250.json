        "Describes the processes employed in a large British foundry. Begins in the pattern makers shop and then shows making of sand moulds. After pouring, the moulds are allowed to cool and then broken to remove castings. Moulding sand is collected for re-use. Shock blasting is employed to clean castings after which they are machined and annealed. Castings manufactured by the firm include parts for tractors, fork lifting trucks, cranes, excavators and internal combustion engines."
