        "Told in the idiom of an African folk story, this film attempts to encourage native women to seek medical assistance from the local health clinics instead of from witch doctors. Points out that African women are learning the value of modern medicine, but one, Foriwa, was a sceptic and only her child's death convinced her that the medicine man and the fetish priest, from whom she sought help, had neither the power nor the knowledge to cure her baby. Stresses the importance of practising modern methods of feeding and sanitation as a preventative measure for illness."
