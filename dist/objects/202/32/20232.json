        "Alice Springs is viewed here in its natural environment of desert landscape, ringed by distant ranges and Ayers Rock and as a busy township with its regular services, activities and recreations. From varied shots of its people and activities the camera frequently returns to the countryside around and shows close-up shots of its plant life. No spoken commentary."
