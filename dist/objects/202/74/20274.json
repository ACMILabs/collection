        "During the 15th Century the burghers of Krakow commissioned Wit Stwocz, master wood-carver and sculptor, to create a monumental altar-piece for St. Mary's church, Krakow, the former capital of Poland. This film describes the altar-piece and its setting in medieval Krakow. It shows how the history of that period, its people, clothes and customs has been woven by Wit Stwocz into the story told in the altar's carving."
