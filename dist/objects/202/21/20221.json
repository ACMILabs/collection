        "Alcoholics suffer from one of the most destructive diseases in our society. Their problems and the possibility of their cure are considered in this film which introduces several people who are or have been alcoholics. An authority on the disease and its treatment, Dr. Alfred Byrne, distinguishes between the true alcoholic and the heavy drinker, and describes the course of compulsive drinking using the \"pattern of progression\" designed by the World Health Organization. Explains the physical effects of alcohol and the enormous amount of help offered by Alcoholics Anonymous to people who suffer from the disease."
