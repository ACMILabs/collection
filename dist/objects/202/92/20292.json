        "Surveys the life of American Indians in the United States today. Home for most Indians is on a reservation, where they may be engaged in farming or cattle raising. Some tribes have found it difficult to adapt themselves after centuries of semi-nomadic life. Other tribes have advanced to local self-government. Includes scenes of life on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona, the Sioux in South Dakota, the Seneca in New York."
