        "This film is directed to teachers and instructors rather than boy boxers. It shows a three-round bout between two boys considering the match from the viewpoint of the officials. Demonstrates the work of the referee, the timekeeper and in greater detail, methods used by the referee for controlling the bout, and the methods of the judges for assessing the merits of the boxers. Shows, also, the value of a boxer's seconds. Demonstrates how boxing can encourage sportsmanship."
