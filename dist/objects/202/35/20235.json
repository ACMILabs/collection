        "Clearly, no one knows about twelve-year-old Bobby Ramirez, although each person questioned has their own opinion and impression of the boy. All of those impressions, and others are voice over film clips which show him going about his regular activities and refuting right and left views of the people who think they know him. A stimulating film which leads to an investigation into what and who each of us is."
