        "Episode number 7 of Series \"The Crossroads of the world: a study of North Africa and the Middle East\". Indicative of the direction and strength of Muslim revolt against European colonisers was the struggle for Algerian independence. This film recapitulates Algeria's history up to the signing of the French-Algerian agreement and the last-ditch stand of the secret, outlaw European army. Figures of the Algerian resistance emerge on the screen as the film follows the Algerian resistance army to their mountain stronghold and takes a look at the peace conferences in France. Narrated by James Beveridge. Edited by Dennis Sawyer."
