        "Scenes from an average middle-class family illustrate what they do to unwind- martinis, smoking, chatting, pills. The film asks, \"When does a drug that changes the way a person feels become harmful or dangerous?\". Emphasises that all people have good and bad feelings, and suggests how people learn to cope with them. Explores alternatives to coping with bad feelings without recourse to drugs."
