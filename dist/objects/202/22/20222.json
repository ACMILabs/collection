        "An allegory in which the emotions in a alcoholic's mind are portrayed as characters interacting with each other and with maturity. They fall under the influence of immaturity and end up unable to deal with their drinking problems. In the film a number of characters begin to use alcohol to escape or avoid their problems & to see that the only way to cope is to grow up & to understand each other. However a difficult path lies ahead as there is always a drink on offer."
