        "Shows examples of how Work Study has been applied in the reorganization of departments in three different firms. In the packing department of a large pharmaceutical works the flow of work was improved, the individual jobs made easier by the use of simple cheap apparatus made for the purpose. Unnecessary movement of personnel was eliminated in the making-up department of a hosiery firm by adoption of a new layout involving the use of conveyor belts. In the sheet metal shop of an electronic instrument firm, Work Study was used to relieve the shortage of skilled operatives."
