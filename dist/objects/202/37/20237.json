        "Dr Heinz Haber uses a specially created cartoon character, Homo-Sapiens-Extrater-Restrialis, to explain the hazards of survival in the strange environment of outer space. Man must become conditioned to living in a state of weightlessness for long periods. Eating presents some new and surprising problems; sleeping will be a unique experience. We do not know how man's subconscious mind will react to prolonged journeying through space. An excerpt from \"Man in space\"."
