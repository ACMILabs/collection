        "The story of electrical power in Victoria from generating stations to consumer. Shows the prompt action taken with mobile radio-controlled teams, when break downs in supply are reported; causes of breakdowns such as lightning. Power generated from power stations at Eildon- Rubicon, the Snowy Mountains, and the Latrobe Valley is directed by engineers at the main control centre near Melbourne to main terminal stations, and on to the consumer. Electricity is distributed at high voltage over long distances, this means danger but skilled linesmen trained in safe techniques patrol existing lines and erect new ones supplying over 90 per cent of Victoria's industrial power."
