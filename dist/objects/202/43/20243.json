        "The capacity, scope, problems and future of Australia's six State and one Commonwealth railway systems. We accompany a railway worker from Cairns to Perth, by rail, and then visit workshops to see carriages and locomotives being made, and modern methods of mechanised track laying. Specially designed rolling stock is used for stock transport, bulk wheat and sugar moving, transporting cars and semi-trailers, and for moving timber. No other credits available."
