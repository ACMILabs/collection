        "A series of incidents demonstrating the need for accident prevention. People on dangerous jobs are aware of the risks and keep their minds on their work, but passers-by and workers who are worried or inclined to day-dream, need to remember that nearly all accidents happen through thinking of something else. A quarter of all accidents happen through the job being done the wrong way; untidily, without safety devices or too fast. Film closes by re-emphasising the need to be constantly alert."
