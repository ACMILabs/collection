        "The ever-increasing output of Algeria's oilfields demanded a new pipeline outlet to the Mediterranean. The sponsors were awarded a 25 million pound contract to design and construct a complete pipeline installation within the short time of 18 months. This film describes how a 500-mile pipeline was constructed from the Sahara across the Atlas Mountains to Arzew. The building of pump stations, departure and arrival terminals, submarine loading lines, ancillary works and the training of Algerian personnel are also covered."
