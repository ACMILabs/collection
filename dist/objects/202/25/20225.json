        "One of a series of short extracts from feature films intended for study of cinema technique. During the 13th century, Russia was endangered by the invasion of Teutonic Knights, the founders of Prussia. Under the leadership of Prince Alexander Nevsky, the Russians unite and counter the German onslaught on the ice of Lake Peipus and defeat them. The commencement of the battle is the subject of the excerpt. At first Nevsky and his aides are seen on a high rock - the camera intercutting faces on the waiting soldiers and the preparation of the enemy camp. The Germans begin to advance, gathering speed. Battle is joined."
