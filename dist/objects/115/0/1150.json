        "'Orchestra of rust' is an installation based interactive that allows the user to create soundscapes and musical pieces via the medium of an entropic industrial environment. The user can explore a zone of decay within an old factory that contains a selection of obsolete machinery. Operating these machines creates particular sounds and corresponding animated sequences. Complex sound structures can be built up from turning on several machines at once. This provides access to other zones of the factory where remixes of the musical creations exist. Also included is extensive interactive information on the background of the machines and sounds, historical sources and concept rationale/hypothesis."
