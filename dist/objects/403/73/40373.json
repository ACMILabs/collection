        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Testament: The Bible and history\". This episode explores the writing of the New Testament looking at the identity of Jesus Christ and his followers, his persecutors and his biographers, the Gospel writers. Also discussed is the gradual spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire which escalated once the Gospels became written accounts rather than spread by word of mouth."
