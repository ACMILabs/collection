        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Testament: The Bible and history\". Virtually the sole source of learning in the western Dark Ages, the Bible's character's and stories were used to justify the social order and to offer its citizens security in this world and the next. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Christianity was nurtured in small settlements places like Ireland and Scotland. From these monastries came the most beautiful illuminated manuscripts of Bible text. Charlemagne restored Christianity to its glory and feudal society mirrored that of the Bible with its emphasis on order and place. Also features a close look at the ancient Byzantine church of Haiga Sophia in Istanbul."
