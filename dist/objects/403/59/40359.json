        "Episode number 25 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Examines human responses to the destructive forces of natural phenomena such as earthquakes. In particular, the San Francisco quake of 1989 is highlighted. Geologists, scientists, engineers and civic planners studied the earthquake and its effects to determine how to better manage a crisis situation given that San Francisco rests on the San Andreas fault line. Although earthquake predicting technology is in its early protype stages, the aim of developing this area will be beneficial in lessening the impact of one natural disaster."
