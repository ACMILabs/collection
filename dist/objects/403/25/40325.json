        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: biology\". Homeostasis explores the internal systems of balance and regulation in animals. With the assistance of computer animation, sequences illustrate how the body deals with stress and copes with changing conditions such as high and low temperatures, and how the shortage or excess of fluids is adjusted and regulated. Six 10 minute episodes present students at secondary and post secondary levels with a comprehensible definition of homeostasis with examples of how it works, and how this on-going balancing of internal conditions to external changes and stimuli is triggered and monitored. Includes: 1. \"Coping with change\", 2. \"The Sea within\", 3. \"Osmoregulation\", 4. \" The Feedback cycle\", 5. \"Biochemical balances\", 6. \"Hormonal control.\""
