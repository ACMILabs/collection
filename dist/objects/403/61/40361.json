        "Based on the critically acclaimed account of the lives of three Chinese women spanning three generations. The book \"Wild Swans\" has been a best seller world-wide except in China where a Government ban prevents its publication or distribution. The book was conceived when Jung Chang's mother visited Britain in 1990 and provided her with a detailed account of the family history. The film recreates this period of discussion and recollection between mother and daughter, interwoven with archival and contemporary Chinese film and photographs and readings by the author from her book. \"Wild Swans\" conveys both the extraordinary personal qualities of the author and how ordinary lives are shaped by historical forces."
