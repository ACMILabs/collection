        "Episode number 18 of Series \"Earth revealed\". The process of metamorphism changes the structure and composition of rocks; an atomic shuffling which results in change. Metamorphism for example is responsible for changing limestone into marble. There are two types of metamorphism; contact metamorphism resulting from a cooling process and regional metamorphism which is the result of tectonic activity. As a consequence of this process, many rare minerals can be formed."
