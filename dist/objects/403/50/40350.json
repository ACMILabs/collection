        "Episode number 16 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Mass wasting is the continual chain of processes that move earth, rocks and debris from the top of landmasses to the bottom. Tectonic activity and gravity assist the process which can result in gradual creeps and slumps to more damaging landslides and avalanches. The effects of mass wasting are important to geologists as they assist engineers in the design and construction of structures on potentially unstable landforms."
