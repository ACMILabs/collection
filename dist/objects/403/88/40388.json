        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". Ancient skywatchers observed the passing phases of the moon and movements of the sun, planets and stars to determine direction, time and the seasonal cyclical rhythms. Structures like Stonehenge were seasonal calendars based on astronomical observations and although different cultures saw formations of stars differently, the use of constellations to determine directions and seasons was commonplace. The Greeks were the first race to apply mathematical principles to their astronomical observations."
