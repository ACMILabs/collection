        "Episode number 23 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Presents the properties of glaciers and assesses their importance in sculpting Earth's surface. The study of glacial movement is important in determining the impact of the Greenhouse Effect. By studying the cyclic nature of Ice Ages, geologists can assist scientists in predicting rising sea levels. There are two types of glaciers; valley glaciers which move from mountains down to valleys and continental glaciers which are single giant ice sheets which accumulate in doems on the surface of the planet."
