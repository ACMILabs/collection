        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Testament: The Bible and history\". Christianity becomes the religion of the Roman Empire and Palestine becomes a sacred landscape. The Bible and church rituals are decorated with the trappings of Imperial power. The Emperor Constantine becomes the first Christian Emperor of Rome and the division between secular and temporal authority is made more apparent when the concept of the Holy Trinity is adopted in the Nicean Creed. Saint Jerome's translation of the Bible into Latin from Greek makes it a more accessible text."
