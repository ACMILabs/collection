        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". Questions about our universe have intrigued the human race since time began. What is the universe made of? How did it come to be? How big is it? Even though astronomers concern themselves with these questions on a scientific level, what remains is a sense of wonder. Even using relative comparisons, the vastness of the universe is still a mystery. Stars, supernova, pulsars and black holes are just some of the phenomenon used to determine the scale of the universe."
