        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: physics\". Traces the development of the various theories advanced to explain the behaviour of light, from the concepts of the ancient Greeks to current proven models. The contributions of Isaac Newtown, Christian Huygens, Thomas Young, Jean Foucault, Albert Einstein and others are outlined as are the reasons for the gradual acceptance of both particle and wave models and their eventual combination. The six 10 minute episodes are: 1. \"The Particle model\" 2. \"The Wave model\" 3. \"The Electromagnetic model\" 4. \"The Quantum idea\" 5. \"Photons\" 6. \"Matter waves.\""
