        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: chemistry\". These episodes examine the theory of steady state, dynamic equilibrium, kinetic molecular theory, reaction tendencies and the equilibrium constant. Illustrates forward and reverse reactions of various chemical changes including the production of hydrogen iodide, hydrogen chloride and ammonia. Finally, through demonstrations of Le Chatlier's principle and the Haber process, students gain a better understanding of the importance of chemical equilibrium. The episodes are \"Unsteady steadiness\", \"Dynamic equilibrium\", Reaction kinetics\", \"The Equilibrium constant\" mand \"The Haber process"
