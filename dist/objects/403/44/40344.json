        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Geological time runs on a different time scale to that which can be measured in years or by clocks. In the 1700's, James Harvey, a Scot, was the pioneer of measuring geological time and sparked a controversy as his observations about uplift and erosion which occured in various layers of rock, was in direct conflict with the supporters of The Bible and Genesis belief in Creation. Faunal succession, the analysis of different species of fossils preserved in layers of sediments, and the use of radiocarbon dating are used to give a more exact picture of the age of the planet."
