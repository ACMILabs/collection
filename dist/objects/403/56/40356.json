        "Episode number 22 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Geologists classify deserts as areas with infrequent precipitation so a diversity of formations from Antartica to the Sahara exist as desert landscapes. Movement of the earth and the sun and the roles of wind and rain shadow in the increasing desertification of the planet is examined. Movement of features such as sand dunes has seen an increase in the vastness of deserts and their movement across the surface of the planet."
