        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Volcanoes are often found where the continental plates converge or diverge, or in designated \"hot spots\" in the middle of plates such as can be found in the Hawaiian region. A handful of special volcanoes formed along rift zones, can also be found. The study of volcanoes and their activities, casts new light on the internal structure of the earth and their impact on other phenomena such as the weather."
