        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". This program examines the death of a star, in particular focusing on the death of our own star, the sun. Once the sun becomes a Red Giant, i.e. when the core compresses but the outer layer expands, the Earth will become uninhabitable. As a Red Giant, the sun will expand into the solar system, swallowing up the inner circle of planets. A star ends its life as a planetary nebulae and evolves into a White Dwarf. Some stars explode, particularly binary stars which results in the creation of supernovae."
