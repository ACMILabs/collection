        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Geologists, in their examination of the Earth's structure, have made important discoveries which have cast new light on the process of evolution. Collecting fossil evidence of microscopic organisms and larger, more complex organisms such as moulds, Scientists can determine when life began on the planet. The extinction of such species such as dinosaurs, or the changes in a species such as that of a horse, can be examined using geological evidence found in rock formations."
