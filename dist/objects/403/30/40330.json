        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: chemistry\". The purpose of these six episodes is to show the importance of the electron to chemical compunds. Illustrates the development of the atomic model by scientists such as Bohr, Rutherford and Planch, and relates their contributions to an understanding of the function of electrons. Highlights various aspects of energy levels, orbitals, charges, relative mass, bonding and electron configuration. Includes: 1. \"Introduction to the players\", 2. \"The Rutherford-Bohr atom\", 3. \"Electron arrangement\", 4. \"How atoms bond\", 5. \"Molecular substance and covalent crystals\", 6. \"Metals and ionic solids.\""
