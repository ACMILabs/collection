        "Episode number 15 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Weathering of the earth's surface is important to geologists as they examine the impact of this process. There are two types: mechanical and chemical weathering. Mechanical weathering involves the disintegration and break-up of fragments of rock at the earth's surface naturally. The composition of the rock doesn't change at all. In chemical weathering, water and air decompose the rock and change its composition such as iron ore can become oxidised into rust in the presence of water. Acid raid formation is affected by the chemical weathering of the earth's surface as is soil composition and productivity."
