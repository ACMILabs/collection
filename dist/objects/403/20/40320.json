        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: physics\". Shows step-by-step, how an interest in cathode rays led scientists to discover X-rays, then alpha, beta and gamma radiation, and finally explore the conversion of matter into energy. Vivid computer animation clarifies concepts such as nuclear fission and fusion, shows how a nuclear reactor works and the difficulties in the disposal of radioactive wastes. There six ten minute episodes are: 1. \"The Discovery of radioactivity\" 2. \"Properties of Becquerel rays\" 3. \"Natural transmutations\" 4. \"Energy from the nucleus\" 5. \"Electrical energy from fission\" 6. \"Nuclear by-products.\""
