        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Earth revealed\". The sea-floor is the focus of submarine geologists. Water covers 70% of the planet's surface and contains many of tye minerals and elements which sustain life itself. The sea-floor is largely basaltic, while continental landmasses are largely granitic. Like the landmass on the planet surface, the sea-floor has a volcanic structure, which gives rise to its varying seascapes mid-oceanic ridges, ocean trenches and fracture zones. The use of deep sea robots have enabled submarine geologists to understand how old the sea floor is."
