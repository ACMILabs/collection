        "Phyllis Calvert, Patricia Roc and Flora Robson star in this vivid document of 1944: a time when women were finding a new independence, and women stars and audience were taken seriously by British cinema. This intense story of a prisoner of warcamp in occupied france, takes the classic formulas common to male prison camp drama and transforms them. The women stand up to the enemy, outwit their jailers, help inmates to escape without tears or hysteria. They are mutually supportive in the face of their privations and their story is told through a woman's eyes rather than from the male perspective"
