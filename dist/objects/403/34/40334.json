        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: chemistry\". The mole is the ultimate standard container for directly comparing large numbers of atoms and opens the way to understanding chemical reactions at the molecular level. Exercises in reasoning, using such theories as Gay-Lussac's law of combining gas volumes and Avogadro's hypothesis encourage class discussion. The six episodes are: 1. \"Relative mass\", 2. \"Gas volumes\", 3. \"Combining gas volumes\", 4. \"Avogadro's hypothesis\", 5. \"Relative atomic mass\" and 6. \"The Mole\"."
