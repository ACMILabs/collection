        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". The Greeks considered the Earth to be the centre of the universe. Ptolemy's model of the universe lasted until Copernicus began to postulate that it was the Earth which moved around the sun. Due to his allegiance to the Church, Copernicus did not pursue his theories, but Galileo, was able, with the invention of the telescope, to support the Copernican model of the universe. His ideas were considered heretical by the Counter-Reformation Church, however they sowed the seeds for future observation and theories. The work of Kepler followed, and it is this work, supporting Copernicus and Galileo which bridged the gap between ancient and modern astronomy."
