        "Episode number 14 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Unveils the rock-forming processing of magmas that do not reach earth's surface but solidfy. Igneous rocks are classed as plutonic and volcanic; the differences are determined by the way the magma cools and hardens. Not all minerals are formed at the same time, and the crystalisation process results in different minerals being formed. Igneous activity is related also to Plate tectonics, while the moon is largely made up of igneous material rarely found on the surface of the earth."
