        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". Aristotle and Galileo were pioneers in the study of motion. From the Greek concept of natural and violent motion, came Galileo's ideas about impetus and inertia. Scientists like Keppler further developed these ideas. However, Issac Newton, with his Laws on Motion and Universal Gravitation, altered the study of physics and astronomy forever. Newton was able to mathematically work out the effects of gravity, however he was unable to identify a cause. It was Albert Einstein with his theories of Relativity and Curved Space/Time dimensions which changed the way scientists perceived the Laws of Gravity and space travel. This episode examines these pioneers and their ideas."
