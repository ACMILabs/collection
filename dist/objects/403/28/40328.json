        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: biology\". Biology students will quickly grasp the importance of proteins as the basic building blocks of life and the fundamental role that protein synthesis plays in all living things from these six 10 minute episodes. Each episode explores one aspect of the process, from the manufacture of DNA to the roles of the messenger and transfer RNA. Computer animation provides clear demonstrations that make this complex subject easily understood. The programs include: 1. \"Protein: the stuff of life\" 2. \"DNA: the molecule of heredity messenger\" 3. \"DNA: Replication: the repeating formula\" 4. \"RNA Synthesis: the genetic messenger maker\" 5. Transfer RNA: the genetic\" 6. \"Ribosomal RNA: the protein."
