        "Episode number 26 of Series \"Earth revealed\". The Industrial Revolution changed the way humans exploited the geological richness of the earth and its resources. With problems of global warming and resource depletion, geologists will play a vital role in assisting scientists in harnessing new energy supplies such as geo-thermal energy. The final message of the series is to not only value the earth for its geological history and structure but to safegaurd it for the future."
