        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Although a relatively new accepted field in Geology, the theory of Plate Tectonics, has enabled geologists to understand the ways in which the Earth's plates move and interact. Three types of plate movements have been analysed and involve convergence of two plates, the divergence of plates and in the case of geological phenomena like the San Andreas Fault, Transformation Faults whereby the continental plates are continually slipping past each other."
