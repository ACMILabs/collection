        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Addresses some controversial geological theories including the theories of Continental Drift and Plate Tectonics. It was only in the middle of the 20th Century that scientists accepted that the major continents were once joined and then drifted apart due to the geological activity occuring on and beneath the Earth's surface. The study of the ocean floor provided valuable evidence which enabled the theory to eventually gain popular support."
