        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". The use of spectroscopy and spectrum analysis have been vital when astronomers study the stars. The continous, emission and dark-line spectra have enabled scientists to determine the composition of stars and to modify the original classification of stars. Atoms of elements have their own unique \"fingerprint' spectrum which can be determined by studying the behaviour of photons and electrons. With the advances in fibre optics, spectographs can now measure many stars instead on one, and thus determine the nature of a group of celestial bodies within a galaxy."
