        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". The night sky is deceptive. The black spaces between the stars are not empty. This interstella medium, filled with dust and gases, is in fact the nursery of young stars. From these dusty clouds of chemicals, stars are born, triggered by an event that turns cold and dense clumps of matter and molecules into a celestial body like our sun. This episode looks at the amazing phenomenon of stellar formation and the importance of interstellar medium and nebulae."
