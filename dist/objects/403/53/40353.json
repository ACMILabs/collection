        "Episode number 19 of Series \"Earth revealed\". What do rivers do? The power or velocity of river flow is responsible for some of the most unique sculpting of landforms on the planet. Running water transports sediments and deposits it at river mouths and deltas as well as abrasively smoothing and wearing away bedrock on its course. Geologists study the ways rivers flow and meander in order to solve problems of flooding and silting as well as assiting engineers in the construction of dams and dykes in order to improve flow of water."
