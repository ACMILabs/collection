        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: biology\". Exciting 3-D computer animations show the dynamic process of photosynthesis at the molecular level. Starting with the historic discoveries of Joseph Priestley, Jan Ingenhousz and Jean Senebier, these six 10 minute episodes examine the absorption of light by plants, and follows the energy pathways to the production of carbohydrates and other organic materials. Programs also develop the Calvin cycle, as it functions in Carbon 3 and Carbon 4 plants, and the remarkable fluid transport system that delivers water and nutrients throughout the plant structure. The programs include: 1. \"Seeing the light\" 2. \"Absorbing the light\" 3. \"The Light reaction\" 4. \"The Dark reaction\" 5. \"C3 and C4 plants\" 6. \"The Fluid transport system.\""
