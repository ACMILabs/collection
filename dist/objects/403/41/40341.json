        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Mountains are evidence which enable geologists to study not only the movements of the Earth's plates, but the composition of the interior structure of the Mantle. The Rock cycle whereby material from and below the crust is metamorphosed is also explained which enables geologists to determined how land masses are created and fused together into larger parts, eventually becoming mountain ranges. Fossil evidence and magnetic forces enable the geologist to determine the age and structure of terrain."
