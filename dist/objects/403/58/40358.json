        "Episode number 24 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Looks at the motion of water particles in a passing wave and how waves are generated by wind. The power of waves shape coastal areas such as bays and headlands. Problems with dredging and the building of sea walls are discussed as well as the creation and effect of devastating seismic waves which result from earthquakes under the sea and on the land."
