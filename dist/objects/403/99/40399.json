        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". Overviews the existence of a number of stellar phenomena. Supernovae were observed by the Chinese over 1,000 years ago and provide important evidence about the life and death of stars. Neutron stars are heavenly bodies which are very dense. Pulsars, when first discovered, were thought to be signals from aliens, yet the existence of these stars have provided an insight into binary stars and nebulae. Black Holes, it is theorised, are stars which are so dense and small that they suck matter into themselves. Whilst, the existence of Black Holes cannot be conclusively proven, such a phenomenon correlates with scientific theory. Black Holes are believed to occur at the end of a star's life cycle."
