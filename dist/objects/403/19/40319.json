        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: physics\". These programs explore the history and development of the model of the atom, from the hypothesis of early Greek philosophers to the wave-mechanical model of modern atomic physicists. Experiments by pioneer atomic scientists such as Bohr, Faraday, de Broglie and Rutherford are recreated through animation and their implications are discussed. The six 10 minute episodes are: 1. \"The Earliest models\" 2. \"Smaller than smallest\" 3. \"The Rutherford Model\" 4. \"The Bohr Model\" 5. \"Spectra\" 6.\"The Wave-mechanic Model.\""
