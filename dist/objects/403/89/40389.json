        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". This episode examines the influence that the Moon and its orbit has on the earth and the phenomena of lunar and solar eclipses. By observing the phases of the moon, early astronomers were able to divide the calendar into months, and the Earth's rotation around the sun was responsible for the measurement of time into seasons. The Moon's two types of orbit, Siberial and Sinotic are explained. Outlines how the Moon affects tides by the gravitational pull it exerts. Although readily explained scientifically, the solar and lunar eclipses still fascinate astronomers, professional and amateur alike, with their beauty and wonder."
