        "The third in the Apu trilogy, the scene opens in Calcutta, where Apu, now a jobless ex-student, dreams of becoming a writer. Extracted from this insular environment, Apu's life changes when he visits a village and exchanges himself for the mad bridegroom. After his wife's death during childbirth, Apu leaves Calcutta. His life becomes one filled with indifference. Apu's journey back to the world is painful but ultimately fulfilling. This is a moving film, considered to be one of Ray's best, perhaps because the theme is so profound: that without death there cannot be life. The music by Ravi Shankar adds to the film's power. Based on the text by Bibhutibhusan Banerji."
