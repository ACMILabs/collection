        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". The sun is the most familiar star to us in our galaxy. It provides us with energy, light and heat and sustains life on the planet. Even though the possibility of reaching the sun seems in the realms of science fiction, astronomers know a great deal about the sun and can apply that knowledge to the study of other celestial bodies. This episode looks at the composition of the sun, phenomenon such as sunspots and solar flares and the internal structure of this medium sized yet most important star."
