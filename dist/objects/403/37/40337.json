        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Seismic waves, earthquakes and close study of rocks can give insight into the structure of the Earth. This episode looks at the field of geophysics in order to determine what the three composite parts which make up the Earth's structure, i.e. the crust, mantle and core, are like. Measuring the magnetism in the Earth and its magnetic fields, looking at heat flow and measuring the Earth's gravity are discussed. Geophysical research links the study of gravity, magnetism and seismology in order to fully comprehend the complexity of our planet."
