        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". A star is a heavenly body which retains its shape and radiates energy. This energy comes from nuclear reactions taking part in the star as it forms. Direct or close observation of the workings of a star is impossible so models have to be constructed to determine how they function. Neutrinos, sub-atomic particles created in the core of the sun, provide the answer to understanding the birth of stars. Explains how the luminosity of a star and its mass are closely related and looks at types of stars including the brown dwarf and red giant."
