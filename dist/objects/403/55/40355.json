        "Episode number 21 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Groundwater is the accumulation of water which seeps through cracks, fissures and faults into the earth and collects in a large quantity beneath the surface. Many continents have large water tables which are accessed through wells and bores. Groundwater seeping through limestone helps form stalectites and stalecmites in caves. Groundwater contamination presents serious health risks therefore geologists who study the movement of water play an important role in assessing potential risks."
