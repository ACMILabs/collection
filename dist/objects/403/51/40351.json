        "Episode number 17 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Illustrates the importance of sedimentary rocks in understanding earth's history. Sediment is the result of chemical and mechanical weathering assisted by erosion, water, ice and biological activities such as movement of dunes. Sedimentary rocks hold much of the fossil evidence which provide insight into the evolution of life on earth. The building up of sedimentary layers results in the formation of structures such as reefs and formations like limestone caves."
