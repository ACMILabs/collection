        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse\". This episode attempts to answer some of the questions about stars which have puzzled astronomers for centuries. With the advent of computer and improved space technology, it is easier for scientists to determine the relative distance of stars using trigonmetric calculations such as the Principle of Triangulation. The science of spectroscopy has enabled us to quantify the luminosity and magnitude of stars in order to determine their hotness. This has led to a reclassification of stars along the Sain Sequence classification scale. The discovery of Binary stars has allowed scientists to determine the relationship between mass and luminosity."
