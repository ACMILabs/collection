        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Minerals are the raw materials of rocks. Although there are over 2,000 minerals, only about 200 of them are common. Quartz, diamonds, graphite, are just some of the basic minerals found in the earth's crust. It is the way in which the atoms are arranged that determine the composition and structure of minerals, as well as their physical properties. It is the correlation between these elements which geologists analyse."
