        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Earthquakes are evidence of the heat energy that powers movement in the Tectonic Plates. Although they cause destruction, the upheaval of the landscape to produce different elevations is ultimately benficial to the Earth. Without this variance, the power of erosion would turn the surface of the Earth into a vast desert plain. Geologists are fascinated by the measurement of earth movements and this episode examines some of these including the Richter Scale and the use of seismic waves to locate and identify the location and source of earthquakes."
