        "Episode of Series \"Concepts in science: physics\". The historical discovery of the magnetic properties of lodestone led to a scientific understanding of Earth's magnetic field. Six ten minute computer-animated episodes explore this mysterious force from early experiments to the concepts of electromagnetic induction, the motor principle, generators, and transformers. It also looks at fascinating modern theories about the role of the Earth's magnetic field in the extinction of species and at the ways that animals use it for navigation. The programs include: 1. Earth's magnetic field 4. The Motor principle 2. Magnetism and electron flow 5. Electromagnetic induction 3. Domain theory 6. Life in the field"
