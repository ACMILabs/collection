        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Geographical features like mountains are evidence of the tremendous forces that occur within the Earth such as the movement of the Tectonic Plates. The faults and folds of rocks, caused by this movement often results in vertical motion which causes rises and layering in the landscape. This episode looks at the crustal stresses, the principle of Original Horizontality, the formation of resources such as petrol and the measurement of de-formation of land structures."
