        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Testament: The Bible and history\". In the last century the Bible has lost its central role as the scientific and moral arbiter. This programme describes this fall from sacredness and some of the visionaries who alternately attacked or protected the Bible's word. The impact of men such as Martin Luther, Petrach, Walter Tindale who was the originator of the King James Bible, and Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution are seen as integral players in the history of the Bible."
