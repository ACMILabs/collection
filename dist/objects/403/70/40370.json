        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Testament: The Bible and history\". Part one examines the literal truth of the Old Testament, in particular Genesis,by looking at archaelogical evidence found near the ancient sites of Mesopotamia. These ancient cultures with their parallel \"biblical\" stories are also discussed. In Part two, the story of Exodus is examined by looking at the historical evidence found in Egypt and how the concept of \"God\" changed from this time."
