        "Episode number 20 of Series \"Earth revealed\". Recognizes the roles human activity can play in itensifying or reducing flood danger. Looks at how rivers cut into landscapes to produce wonders like the Grand Canyon and the formation of deltas and lakes where water and sediment is collected. This episode also looks at how geologists and engineers are tackling the problem of accumulation of silt and sediment in the Mississippi River where three rivers in the delta region are converging."
