        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Testament: The Bible and history\". The written word became of immense importance to the Jews. During the time of the Babylonian exile to the destruction of Solomon's temple, the final format of the Old Testament was created. The influence of the Greeks and Romans on Israel is discussed and in particular the role of King Herod the Great who tried to act as a liason between his people and the roman invaders. The Old Testament was finally gathered together in 70 AD however the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls raises issues about the authorship and history of the Old Teastament."
