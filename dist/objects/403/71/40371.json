        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Testament: The Bible and history\". John Romer explores the archaelogical evidence which accompany the Old Testament books of Kings David and Solomon. The oldest fragment of Bible text, a silver plaque, is dated from this time. The Babylonian conquest of Assyria who had conquered Israel, saw the best part of the Old Testament as we know it, transcribed for posterity."
