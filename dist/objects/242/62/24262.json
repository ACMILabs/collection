        "A demonstration of igloo-building in Canada's far North, showing how the site is selected and how blocks of snow are used to make a snug shelter against the Arctic cold. Two Eskimos staying overnight at a trading post construct an igloo in only an hour and a half. As the camera follows each stage in the process, the commentary explains why the snow must be so carefully chosen, why the blocks are built up in a spiral, and how the completed igloo is ventilated. Editing, Neil Harris. Script, Doug Wilkinson. Cinematography, Chester C. Kissick."
