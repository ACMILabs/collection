        "Warning signals of heart disease show up in eight major areas of physical health. These danger signals are dramatised by documenting the lifestyles of five apparently healthy middle-aged men who are candidates for heart attacks. Each man's doctor prescribes a change of living pattern that will greatly reduce the risk, and the extent to which the five accept their individual lifesaving prescriptions is shown. Narrated by Robert Young."
