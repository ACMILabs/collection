        "Follows the activities of a youth gang, showing how aggression is used to assert dominance and territoriality; is provoked by frustration; and is displaced onto others. The frustration-aggression hypothesis is discussed and demonstrated in a laboratory experiment. Modifications to the hypothesis point to frustration as a key element in provoking aggression. Considers the importance of the psychological training of police who intervene in aggressive disputes."
