        "Multiple Xposure is an interactive journey that explores the human mind through the use of film, dance, photography and soundscape. The CD Rom follows the life of a character named Stanley with Multiple Personality Disorder. As a photographer he is able to express himself through the images and with constant flashback to his abusive childhood affect his daily life immensely.  The idea is based on an individual's perception when confronted with visual images. Our interpretation differs depending on our culture, personal background, experiences, personality, gender, psychological makeup, knowledge, interests, intentions and expectations. What a photographer captures on film depends on the above factors.  The body movement of dances fascinates the artist therefore he used this medium to provoke the audience's state of mind and also soundscape was the inspiration of the series of photographic images."
