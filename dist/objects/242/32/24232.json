        "Shows the variety of aesthetic educational qualities in the environment - sounds, shapes, patterns, colours and textures. Children are seen exploring and discovering such areas as body movement, shapes, points of view, characterisation and dramatic plot. In the final minutes of the film, a class of primary school children create a dramatic plot about a young boy with a violin named the \"Rainbow King\". Suitable for primary school level."
