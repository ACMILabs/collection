        "Analyses the problems and practices of architects responsible for the design of new towns and \"neighbourhoods\" in Britain. A lecturer on town and country planning discusses the problem of density, illustrated by views of old, over-crowded tenements and newer, insufficiently compact buildings. An architect suggests how houses may be designed to conform to the character of the environment, how variety may be obtained in shapes, and useful and aesthetically pleasing spaces created. His points are made with the aid of models and actual scenes."
