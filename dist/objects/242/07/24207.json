        "The story of a girl who finds a wallet outside an old house and takes it inside, but the house is deserted and untidy except for one room with presents in it. She hears a bridal couple and their friends arriving and rushes down to give the wallet to them, but they brush past her. She walks sadly outside and places the wallet where she found it, but picks up the bride's posy in return and skips away with it in her hair."
