        "Shows the Nyiragongo Volcano in the Republic of Zaire, Africa. The visuals, set against the music of J.S. Bach, fill the screen with spectacular scenes of cracked earth, rivers of dried and molten lava, and gas explosions. Cauldrons of bubbling lava and geyser-like plumes of liquid rock shoot skywards from a smoking landscape."
