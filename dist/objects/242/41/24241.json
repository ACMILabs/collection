        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Kindergarten child series\". Children are presented with a variety of materials through which to learn mathematical concepts. The teacher invites several children to group small toy cars into various sets and endeavours to lead them to the abstract notion of members of a set. From here the film then moves around the class and observes the activities of other children with the material offered them."
