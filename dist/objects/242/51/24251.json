        "Episode of Series \"E.F.V.A. Primary Botany\". The structure of flowers is explained with close-ups to show the male and female parts, stamens and stigma. Insects are seen visiting many different flowers, both wild and cultivated. Close-ups illustrate very clearly the relationship between the shapes of flowers and the shapes of the insects which pollinate them. Wind pollinated flowers are also shown, and their pollen grains, much magnified, are compared with those of the insect-pollinated flowers. An animated diagram makes clear the process of fertilisation which follows pollination."
