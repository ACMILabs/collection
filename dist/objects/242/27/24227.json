        "A legend from India, interpreted on film by a film-maker from India. It is a story of gods and men, of suns and moons and earth, interpreted with an animation style and a richness of colour and design as arresting to the eye as the story and the music are to the ear. Sometimes the illustrations are painted on cells, sometimes the figures are cut-outs moving across shining grounds, but always the pace is gentle, inevitable."
