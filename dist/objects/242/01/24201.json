        "The first of a certain thread of films by Charles and Ray Eames that used still images in a very filmic way. The still camera offered a freedom and flexibility that allowed Charles and Ray to capture lyrical images of their house, its garden and its decor and to provide a lasting impression of the house during their life there. The house is a classic of post-war American architecture which the Eameses designed and built in 1949 as part of the Case Study House Program. Music composed by Elmer Bernstein. Performed by Martin Ruderman (flute), Dorothy Remsen (harp), Armand Kaproff (cello) and Elmer Bernstein (piano)."
