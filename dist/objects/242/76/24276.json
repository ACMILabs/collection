        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Manager and the Organization\". Rules, procedures and good manners are essential, but flexibility is needed. No organisation can operate solely \"by the book\". Accomplishment should be the aim, not solely promotion. Outside interests should be developed as a buffer against possible disappointments in the later stages of one's career. Narrated by Peter Drucker."
