        "Animals protect themselves from attacks by various means: some depend on their speed and agility, others rely on thick shells or hides, or on sharp claws, teeth, and beaks; others again use camouflage and mimicry. As their environment or their enemies change, so by adaptation do animals' defence mechanisms evolve."
