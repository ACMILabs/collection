        "The Eameses were very sceptical of attempts to limit the definition of creativity to \"art.\" 'The House of Science' articulates a vision of the history of science as a human creative endeavour. Originally produced as a multi-screen introduction to the United States Science Exhibit at the Seattle World's Fair in 1962, this single screen version shows the role of scientists, their work, and their laboratories. Animated prologued by Glen Fleck, music by Elmer Bernstein, narrated by Laurence Harvey."
