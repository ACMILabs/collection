        "An explanation of the basic principles of television, including the principles of the television camera in photography and in broadcasting images. Illustrates how the lens puts the picture on to the end of a special vacuum tube, how the picture is changed into electrical impulses and how electron beams spray the mosaic. The transmitting aerial and family scenes before the home television set complete the cycle of transmission."
