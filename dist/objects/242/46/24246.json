        "Uses time lapse and close-up photography to study the processes involved in the reproduction of pine trees - the opening mechanism of pine cones, the fertilization of seed-producing cones by wind-borne pollen from male cones, the dissemination of seeds, and the germination of seeds. Stresses the importance of continuing research to conserve and improve the quality of the pine forests of North America."
