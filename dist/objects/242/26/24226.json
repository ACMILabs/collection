        "Iceland is a country of great contrasts. Under glaciers and close by ice-capped peaks are many examples of thermal activity. In the volcanic belt which stretches across the island there are high temperature zones with bubbling mud pools. These springs are used for swimming pools, hot houses for growing vegetables and flowers and for heating homes."
