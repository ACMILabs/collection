        "The life cycle of this common but extremely dangerous house-hold pest is presented in detail; the egg, larvae, pupa and adult fly are illustrated; a vivid illustration of how dangerous the fly is as a carrier of disease germs is given. The most satisfactory methods of getting rid of flies are shown, with emphasis being laid on the fact that community effort is much more effective than isolated individual attempts to get rid of flies."
