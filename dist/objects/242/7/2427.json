        "Silent Passages is based around photographs taken of the World War 2 tunnels under the Darwin and inspired by the kind of fantasy storytelling used in games such as Riven and Myst. In the words of the artist \"We find a man alone at the entrance to a tunnel. He enters. The labyrinth before him, a reminder of a past long gone. Eerie sounds are triggered as he passes from chamber to chamber and nothing appears as it seems. His story is hidden beneath a mask of time and decay. Silent Passages is a legend within a story. Two parallel journeys fused by a lover, and torn apart by the betrayal of war.\" Soundtrack is \"Music for Guitar and Shakuhachi\" by Andrew MacGregor and Marion Schaap."
