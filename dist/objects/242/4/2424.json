        "Writer's block was developed as a character-driven interactive that gives the user the opportunity to view characters involved in the creative process of writing; including having trouble with muses and getting distracted by too many coffee breaks. The CDROM also contains practical information for would be authors ranging from getting started as a writer through to organising a poetry reading."
