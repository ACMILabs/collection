        "Mr Donald Duck, an average citizen, avoids numerous hazards on his way home from work, only to find that instead of being safe at home he is surrounded by all sorts of modern conveniences for accidents. Littered stairways, overloaded electric circuits, loose rugs, cleaning fluid and gas stoves combined with his own carelessness result in a series of vioolent explosions and other mishaps."
