        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Basis for Decision\". Unlike the other films in the series, the Operational Research scientists here look at two studies in which the central problems were human ones. One study was to find how to reduce labour wastage at collieries, the other studied a hospital with high staff turnover and which kept patients longer. Also looks to future potential - in advertising and human relations in industry; in town planning and local government; in transport policy and economic planning in central government."
