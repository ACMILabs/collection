        "The film opens showing a class of six-year-old boys and girls working out, through drawing and clay models, their ideas of how a baby grows inside its mother. Each child holds up their drawing and explains to the others what it means to them. The film indicates that all the children have a sound basic idea about human growth and the value of discussion with caring adults."
