        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". Surgeons today perform operations which would have seemed miraculous only a few years ago; but even now, a century after Joseph Lister published the first accounts of his revolutionary technique of antiseptic surgery, infection after operations is a menace, probably costing the Health Service six million pounds a year. Investigates both the techniques used to prevent infection during an actual operation and research into the causes of infection which still trouble British hospitals. Reporter: Christopher Chataway."
