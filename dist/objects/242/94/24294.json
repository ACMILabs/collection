        "The four cases that make up this film deal with an important management activity: the interview. They have been designed to permit investigation of basic interviewing principles and techniques for appraising employee performance. Specifically, they serve as a springboard for analysing four goals of both interviewer and interviewee: understanding, agreement, action and learning. Methods for dealing with interview problems. The four cases are: 1. More than paperwork. 2. Give and take. 3. Means to an end. 4. The way ahead."
