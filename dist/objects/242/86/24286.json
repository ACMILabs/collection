        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Manager and the Organization\". Peter Drucker hosts this film which shows how friction, lack of understanding and poor teamwork among managers is largely a matter of poor relationships, rather than poor communication. Managers do not try to understand the different objectives of each section."
