        "The problems of the teenager caught in the crossfire of adult opinion and youthful enthusiasms. Howard, just out of school, was intending to be a chemist, but wanted first to make a footloose tour of Canada with a school pal during his summer vacation. His wish is strongly resisted by his socially conforming parents. Howard's resultant confusion, to which the film gives shape, illustrates some of the inner conflicts that arise in teenagers when every fresh impulse is rationalised out of existence."
