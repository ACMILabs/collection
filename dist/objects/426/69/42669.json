        "This made for TV movie is based on the book by Walt Morey. A young boy comes across a dog who has just survived a plane crash. The dog, Kavik, is part wolf and raised to be a tough and mean champion. As the young boy nurses him back to health the dog experiences love and kindness. Problems arise when the real owner wants Kavik back and Kavik begins a 2000 mile trek across Alaska to find the boy who saved his life and gave him love. Starring Ronny Cox, Linda Sorensen, Andrew Ian McMillar, John Ireland and John Candy."
