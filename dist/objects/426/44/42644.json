        "A whimsical sketch of a photographer in a small community, whose livelihood comes from understanding, and flattering, people's vanities. As it presents a sampling of one day's appointments, the film pokes gentle fun at the parade of human nature that passes before a photographer's lens. Writen by Norman Klenman, photographed by Lorne C. Batchelor, narrated by William Hutt."
