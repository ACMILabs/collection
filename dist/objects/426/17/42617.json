        "Every Sunday retired master chef Chu (Sihung Lung) prepares a lavish Chinese banquet for his three daughters in their large old-fashioned house in Taipei. Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei Yang) is a chemistry teacher with an angel's voice. Jia-Chien (Chien-lien Wu) is an airline executive who must choose between her ties to her family and an opportunity to work in Europe. Finally, Jia-Ning, the youngest daughter has a crush on her best friends boyfriend. Over chef Chu's sumptuous dishes the family slowly reveals its secrets. Taiwanese director Ang Lee creates a marvelous mix of mouth watering Chinese cuisine, the anxieties of family life and the search for love. With great performances from the whole cast. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
