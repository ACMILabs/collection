        "Lucille Ball adds her own brand of zaniness to a fast-paced comedy starring some of the great names from the Golden Age of radio. Fibber McGee is the center of a lot of commotion when he tries to lure an aircraft factory into the vicinity of Wistful Vista. True to his style however, he does so through a series of hair-brained schemes. Fibber manages to enlist the likes of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his wise-cracking sidekick Charlie McCarthy to help complete the factory deal, with assistance from a certain red-headed sectretary."
