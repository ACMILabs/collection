        "A funny, haunting love story, this film tells the story of two lost souls, Harry and Kate who fall in love against the odds and find the hope and strength in each other to accomplish the impossible. Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch star as two people with psychological problems who must also overcome many obstacles on the path to happiness, not the least of which is the pre-conceived notions of other people. Full of humour, compassion and hope this is a testament to the power of love; a roller coaster journey to the magical fringes of the human psyche."
