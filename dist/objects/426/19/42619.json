        "When a cryptic letter from musical genius, Beethoven, turned up shortly after his death, it started one of history's most compelling romantic mysteries. An enduring riddle that remains unsolved to this day. Who, among the scores of women that Beethoven seduced, was his \"Immortal Beloved\"? Gary Oldman and Isabella Rossellini share a love as hypnotic as the music Beethoven created, in this enthralling film based on the celebrated life of one of the greatest composers that ever lived."
