        "The Iron Curtain countries were not known for their joie de vivre, but between the cracks of stark socialist realism, there somehow appeared a few films that offered their audiences escape, hope and hit songs. With lots of colourful clips from singing pig farmers, dancing sailors, happy housewives, socialist summer vacations, the cinderella factory girl and of course the singing tractor-drivers, this moving, hilarious and courageous story is thoughtfully told by the filmmakers and actors themselves."
