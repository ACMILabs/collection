        "Land and freedom traces the life of unemployed Liverpool lad David (Ian Hart) who, sick of English pessimism, leaves his home to fight in the Spanish Civil War. The story opens in 1994 as Dave is having a fatal heart attack in his Liverpool council flat. Later, his granddaughter is going through his possessions when she discovers a suitcase filled with clippings and mementos from the Spanish conflict. Included are letters from the front, and strangely, a faded red handkerchief filled with soil. The story jumps back to 1936, when young Dave, a communist, decides he will fight the fascists in Spain. When he joins the Republican workers fighting fascist soldiers in the Barcelona foothills, he finds not only a new purpose in life, but also first love, and eventually political disillusionment. Mainly in English, with sections in Spanish, German, French with sub-titles. Multi-award wining film (Cannes, Euopean Film of the Year) directed by Ken Loach."
