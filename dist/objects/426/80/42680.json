        "Bastian (Jonathan Brandis), the reluctant hero of \"The Neverending story\" is unhappy away from Fantasia. His dad seems to have forgotten about his deceased mother and is dating someone Bastian doesn't like, and Bastian didn't make the swim team because he was afraid of heights and couldn't jump off the diving board. He is drawn back to Fantasia to the friends he made; the Childlike Empress, Atreyu, Falkor, and Rock Biter. There are also fantastic new creatures to meet like Mudwart, Lavaman, Windbride, Instrument Spinster, Tri-Face, the Wamboes and Nimbly. There is a job to be done in Fanstasia however, as the sorceress Xayide and Smerg the evil dragon have unscrupulous plans for Fantasia. It's up to Bastian and his friends to once again save Fantasia and prevent a disaster. Also starring Alexandra Johnes, Kenny Morrison, Clarissa Burt and John Wesley Shipp. This video also features a cartoon preview, \"Box office bunny\", the first Bugs Bunny theatrical cartoon in 26 years."
