        "Lewis (Ben Mendelsohn) is a uni drop-out who takes a last-ditch job in an asylum working with patients who are interested in the dramatic arts. He thinks his work will involve staging a small variety show with the group, until long-term patient, Roy, insists that the production be nothing less than a grand staging of Mozart's opera Cosi Fan Tutte. It's an ambitious thought to say the least. After all, none of the patients can speak Italian nor sing and the cast is made up of aging nymphomaniacs, obsessives and pyromaniacs who really have other things on their minds. Funny, warm and wonderfully mad, this is one production that's definitely all there, even if the cast isn't."
