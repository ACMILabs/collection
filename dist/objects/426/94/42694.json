        "Possibly Fassbinder's most exquisite film, this is the story of a seventeen year old girl stifled in a loveless marriage, too naive to understand that her liaison with one of her husband's friends risks bringing disaster on both of them. Using carefully stylised visuals and performances, Fassbinder produces not a conventional literary adaptation but a searching study of the ways that people can unwittingly conspire in their own downfall. From the novel by Theodor Fontane. In German with English subtitles."
