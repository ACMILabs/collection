        "This gory shlock-horror film (Coppola's first commercial feature) follows the plight of a greedy woman, Louise Haloran (Luana Anders), whose husband dies of a heart attack. Ms Haloran's plan is to pretend her husband is still alive to keep the fortune he's soon to inherit from his crazed, dying mother (Ethne Dunn). What follows is a series of bizarre and grisly murders. Written and directed by Coppola and made with a budget of a mere $22,000."
