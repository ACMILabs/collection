        "In December 1976, 16,000 people converged at the Cotter River in Canberra for the \"Down to earth\" festival; a conference on alternative lifestyles. In attendance were Reverend George Davies, Dr. Jim Cairns, Dr. Jim Falk as well as thousands of counter culture followers. This documentary explores the festival and the themes of politics and social change. The Philisophy of Ex Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. Jim Cairns is particularly focussed on with its emphasis on how a nation state creates a 'bad society' and how communal life and a counter culture lifestyle forms the only radicalism against society."
