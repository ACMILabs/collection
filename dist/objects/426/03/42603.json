        "With two US Emmy Awards, \"Shakespeare - Animated tales\" has won a vast new audience with its skilful, 30 minute adaptations. This can be used as a companion piece to the study of \"Macbeth\", however it is far too succinct a precis to be a useful study piece for serious students of the Bard."
