        "Designed for students and teachers of travel, tourism and leisure, this kit covers a wide range of themes in international tourism. The package is grouped into five units; Unit 1: From travel to tourism- looks at a historical view of tourism trends; Unit 2: Visitor attractions- looks at the venues that appeal to tourists ; Unit 3: The Business of tourism- looks at customer needs analysis and service, marketing and organisational structures; Unit 4: Conservation and access- looks at social and environmental challenges raised by tourism; and Unit 5: Interpretation- looks at the different ways in which information on tourist attractions is provided and presented in the marketplace. The kit uses excerpts from BBC programs such as 'Pride and Prejudice', 'The Tourist', and 'Chronicle' to illustrate key concepts. A guide accompanies the video."
