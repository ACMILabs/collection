        "Lady Reading, head of the Women's Voluntary Service, interviewed at her Surrey country home and at W.V.S. in London. She discusses welfare work with the old and the young, Civil Defence Service, providing clothes for refugees throughout the world, meals on wheels, and the motto of W.V.S. - \"Not why we can't, but how we can\". In the words of Lady Reading, the true measure of service is \"service without measure\"."
