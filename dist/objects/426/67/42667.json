        "Adapted from the first series of the popular children's program screened on the BBC in the 1980's. For Form 1 Alpha at Grange Hill, their first year at high school will be an exciting and challenging one but with the help of the staff at Grange Hill, they'll probably make it. Trisha tries to exercise her creativity by brightening up the school uniform, Benny has to put in some hard work to qualify for the football team, Judy is threatened by the school bullies and Tucker has too many encounters to mention. Starring Michael Percival, Denys Hawthorne, Dorothea Phillips and Carole Nimmons."
