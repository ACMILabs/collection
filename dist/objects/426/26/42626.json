        "This hard-hitting, action packed thriller from acclaimed director Luc Besson, is filmed with sharp execution and cunning force, and delivers exceptional drama right from the start. Gary Oldman plays a drug-dealing Drug enforcement Agency officer whose maniacal greed leads to murder on the streets of New York. A deadly game of cat and mouse ensues when he crosses paths with a lone hitman named Leon (masterfully played by Jean Reno). Caught in the middle is an orphaned 12-year-old girl, who can't forget or forgive the man who killed her family. Cast also includes: Natalie Portman, Danny Aiello"
