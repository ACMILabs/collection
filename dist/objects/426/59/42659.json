        "When Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) is sent by a tabloid newspaper to investigate the appearance of an angel in a sleepy town in rural Iowa, he and his co-workers Huey Driscoll(Robert Pastorelli) and Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) are surprised to find a chain smoking overweight beerdrinking battle-axe. But as Micheal (John Travolta) explains, he's not that kind of angel. Soon the three reporters are off on a road trip with the archangel Micheal as they attempt to get him back to Chicago and grab the story of a lifetime. Nora Ephron directs this sweet romance, with Travolta utilising his screen charisma to create an engaging angel."
