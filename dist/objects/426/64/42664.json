        "Episode of Series \"Teacher Education\". This film is a continuation of the case study of Ada Adams: her teacher develops a plan for remedial action. This is a good film showing some of the specific remedial techniques which can be used with many types of maladjustments; it does a good job in showing how a child's interest in art can be used to improve her self confidence and interest in school."
