        "Tropical Beat is a celebration of some of the richest musical cultures in the world - a fabulous musical journey through many of the exotic regions straddling the Equator. David Fanshawe, ethno-music collector, travels to Torres Strait Islands, Lao, Thailand, India, Zanzibar, Tanzania, Senegal, Cuba, Bolivia and Fiji, exploring this amazing \"library\" of music, songs, dances and instruments. Tropical beat is a one hour special which gives a thumb sketech of the way the indigenous and/or traditional music has developed in each country. The effect of climate, geography and raw materials on musical instruments and the impact of war, trade, colonialism and missionaries on the music of traditonal cultures is shown."
