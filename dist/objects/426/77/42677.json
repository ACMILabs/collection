        "Charcoal drawings depict the bleak world of the worker. Pastel drawings illustrate his dreams. Oftentimes, they are dreams created by the media. Are they tailored to his real needs? Or his pocket book? This film comments indirectly on the impact of publicity and its power to develop appetites that cannot be satisfied. An animation film without words."
