        "Shows how premature babies in the intensive care unit of a large hospital are kept alive. Most have underdeveloped lungs and have resulting breathing and feeding problems. This raises the issue of the tremendous costs involved and the fact that many babies develop handicaps as a direct result of the intensive care they are given. These can include deafness, blindness, cerebral palsy and mental retardation. Both parents and doctors express opinions on these issues."
