        "Cocteau's updating of the Orpheus legend which haunted his own life takes the poet (Jean Marais), from contemporary Paris to a mysterious chateau ruled by an imperious Princess (Maria Casares), who first claims a younger poet, then Orpheus' wife, Eurydice. With its unforgettable imagery of leather-clad motorcyclists, the eerie ruins of the Zone and messages from another world received by car radio, this has had a profound influence on both Hollywood and the avant-garde. Cast also includes Francois Perier, Juliette Greco. In French with English subtitles."
