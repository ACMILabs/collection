        "The setting for this inspired piece of Marx mayhem is the fabulous Hotel Casablanca in North Africa, where the hotel managers are dropping like flies. Each one is being murdered as he innocently blunders onto the stolen jewels and art treasures hidden in the hotel by a gang of escaped Nazis. Enter Groucho as the new manager, with Chico as his self-appointed bodyguard, aided and abetted by Harpo, the mischevious valetto villainous gang leader, Sig Rumann, and pandemonium quickly ensues. In their last important film together, the Marx Brothers are pulled into one crazy situation after another. The many plot twists put the boys through their hilarious paces, building the action to a sustained frenzy, and culminating in an outrageous chase scene complete with airplane acrobatics."
