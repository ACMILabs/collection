        "Even if you're not a fan of the Beach Boys, \"I Wasn't Made for These Times\" is a fascinating documentary for anyone interested in popular music and songwriting. Filmed in black and white, the film focuses on the life of Brian Wilson and on his contributions as a composer rather than on the turbulent history of the Beach Boys. Intercutting present day footage of Wilson performing in the studio with interviews with his family and himself, Brian Wilson's life makes compelling viewing. Interviews with musicians such as Tom Petty, Lindsay Buckingham, Linda Ronsdtadt, John Cale, David Crosby and Graham Nash demonstrate the far reaching influence that Brian Wilson had on rock music."
