        "Nikki (Frances O'Connor) and Al (Matt Day) are lovers and small time scammers. When a routine job leaves a man dead in a hotel room, they decide to head west across the barren Nullarbor Plain carrying a video showing football hero Zipper Doyle (Barry Langrishe), in an intimate moment. With the cops (Chris Haywood and Andrew S. Gilbert) on their tail, they stay overnight at a motel. Next morning the motel owner (Max Cullen) is dead; murdered. Fleeing further into the desert, the two suspects are given shelter by an eccentric couple at their isolated shack. By morning, they too are murdered. Nikki and Al begin to suspect each other of the multiple killings and start learning things about each other they wished they never knew. Meanwhile, with the assistance of an Aboriginal tracker, the cops are closing in."
