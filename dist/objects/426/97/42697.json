        "Noura (Selim Boughedir) lives in Halfaouine, a popular quarter of the old city of Tunis. Like many adolescent boys he wants to know more about women and he increases his knowledge through his trips to the local bathhouse with his mother. The interaction between Noura, his mother, and other women in the bathhouse makes for comic moments as well as a sharp insight into relations between the sexes in the Arab community. Cast includes Mohamed Driss, Mustafa Aduenie and Rabia Ben Abdallah. Included as part of Africa 95, a nationwide season of the arts of Africa, screened throughout the United Kingdom in 1995."
