        "After Martha Heyer's tyrannical father dies suddenly during their holiday in Italy, she meets and is proposed to by engineer Helmut Salomon, who sweeps her off her feet with a disturbing mixture of romance and intimidation. After their marriage Helmut's behaviour becomes increasingly oppressive and Martha's ever more fearful and desperate to please, as the film builds to a truly horrific climax. Whether taken as a psychological horror movie or as the blackest of black comedies, this is undoubtedly the most extreme and alarming of all of Fassbinder's visions of married life. In German with English subtitles."
