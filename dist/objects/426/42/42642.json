        "The death of his mother triggers a flashback for Jimmy O'Leary and life in Northern Ireland in the 1950's. For Jimmy, life was a carnival with friends to play with and comics to read. His father, Arthur (Colin Lane) carries a painful grudge from the past when he fought in the Irish civil war. When Jimmy steals money from his neighbour, Josie (Niall O'Brien) during a church service, the conflict of the past resurfaces, including the revelation that Josie and Arthur fought against each other for the love of Catherine (Marian Quinn), who is now Arthur's wife. Civil instability is rekindled in the feud that occurs between neighbours. Also starring Darren McHugh."
