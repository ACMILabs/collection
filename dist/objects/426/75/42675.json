        "Filmed over a ten-month period throughout Australia, this probing documentary examines the political controversy surrounding Native Title and the Australian Federal Governments proposed amendments to the Native Title Act, 1993. It follows the Indigenous representatives in their attempt to fight the amendments in the media, in the bush, and in the halls of Parliament House, Canberra. This video is ideally suited to students of history, politics and Aboriginal studies. NOTE: There are no discussion notes included with this title."
