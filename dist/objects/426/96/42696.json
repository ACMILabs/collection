        "Forty years after Lillian Singer had been locked up in a mental institution by her father, she begins a new life. Equipped with a room of her own, an allowance, a strong sense of destiny and the words of Shakespeare, she sets out to live her new life on the streets, buses and taxis of Sydney. This is the extraordinary tale of one woman's struggle to be free from her past and reclaim the love that was denied her. For Lillian it is never too late to change or discover happiness. Life, for her, is an experience where \"everything matters\". Starring Ruth Cracknell and Toni Collette. Adapted from the novel by Kate Grenville. In widescreen format."
