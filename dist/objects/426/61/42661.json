Few remain on the station, and the Doctor suspects the Cybermen are somehow connected. Nearby the station is planet Voga, where there are expensive gold mines. Gold is a deadly metal to the Cybermen so their ultimate plan is one of destruction. However the waring factions on Voga are at civil unrest. Who will have the upper hand? Will the Doctor ouththink the Cybermen? And who will survive? Starring Tom Baker (Doctor Who), Elisabeth Sladen (Sarah Jane Smith) and Ian Marten (Harry Sullivan)."
