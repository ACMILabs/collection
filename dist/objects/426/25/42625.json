        "Starring Patrick Macnee, Gareth Hunt and Joanna Lumley, these two complete unedited episodes were aired in 1976. \"The Midas touch\": there is 750,000 pounds worth of gold dust in Hong Kong Harry's ample \"belly\", all nicely packed in sacks - a discovery which leads Steed, Gambit and Purdey to the deadly secret of Profeccor Turner, a man with a lust for gold. His secret is a formula which can kill people in a grotesque way by a mere touch... the Midas Touch. In \"House of cards\", the world believes him dead, but foreign agent Perov has infiltrated 13 agents into the country during the last 20 years and now he intends to reactivate them by putting his \"House of Cards\" operation into practice. Each card is marked with his code to kill, and the stakes are life and death."
