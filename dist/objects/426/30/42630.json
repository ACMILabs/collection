        "In this imaginatively erotic surrealist film a young man (Bobby Kendall) escapes the confines of the real world through the personas of a slave, bullfighter, wood nymph and harem boy; all shot in a glorious sequence of pink hued fantasies. One of the most infamous gay films produced, it played to a sold out crowd at the 1984 New York Gay Film Festival. Shot on 8mm by Anonymous (James Bidgood has been credited as director since 1984), the final edit of this video was completed by Martin Jay Sadoff who included the musical track and sound effects."
