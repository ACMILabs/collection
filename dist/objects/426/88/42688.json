        "Fassbinder originally wrote this as a play for the stage and he filmed it less than one year after its theatrical debut. The film remains entirely set in Petra von Kant's room and remains divided into five 'acts', in each of which Petra wears a different wig. Accompanied by the music of Verdi, The Platters and The Walker Brothers, dressed in an incredible melange of glitter and Cecil B. de Mille, imprisoned in a florid set dominated by fleshy nudes and ghastly white mannequins, three women act out a super-charged melodrama of sado-masochistic passion."
