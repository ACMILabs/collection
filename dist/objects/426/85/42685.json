        "One of Hollywood's greatest comedy duos, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin star in this screwball comedy about romance, friendship and the military. Martin plays a dejected Romeo, experiencing girlfriend problems and his pal Lewis tries valiantly, but often with comic results, to help out in the love department. Based on the play of the same name by James B Allardice. Also starring Polly Bergen and Mike Kellin."
