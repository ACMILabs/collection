        "Things are not looking good for rich self-made businessman El Hadj Abdoukader Beye in his third marriage. For starters, there is a huge age difference between him and his wife, whose younger than El Hadj's daughter. Secondly, he is stricken by a xala, a curse which renders him impotent, on his wedding night. It is through his attempts to cure his condition that writer-director Sembene Ousmane conveys a vivid and satirical image of life in post independence Senegal, and the gap between rich and poor and modernity and tradition. Included as part of Africa95, a nationwide season of the arts of Africa, screened throughout the United Kingdom in 1995. In Wolof and French with English subtitles."
