        "A spectacular video using a combination of many animation forms as well as live-action. Three imaginary kingdoms, a blue, red and yellow kingdom, meet and fight a battle for colour supremacy. Finally, amazed by the variety of colours and beauty that had been created, the three kingdoms agreed to coexist in peace."
