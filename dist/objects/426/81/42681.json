        "Based on an event that occurred in the township of Guyra, NSW, in 1960, this video is dedicated to the volunteers involved in the search for four year old Stephen Walls. Stephen disappeared whilst watching his father sheep herding. Initially it's the police and local farmers who begin the search, but as night falls and it becomes evident Stephen may not be found, hundreds of locals join in. By the third day volunteers have spilled beyond the confines of the local community as interstate army brigades and other services are supplied. Stephen is eventually found after four days and three nights, in good health. This film highlight the dedication of the volunteers and the faith of Jacko and Dorrie Walls that their son would return to them safely. Starring John Hargreaves, Lorna Lesley, Tony Elliot and Nathan Dawes as Stephen Walls. Adapted from a storyline by John Powell and Suzanne Turner."
