        "What would you do if your new roommate mysteriously dies, leaving an open suitcase full of money? This is the situation that faces three young professionals (Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston and Ewan McGregor) when they take in a new border after stringently screening for a successful applicant. It seems an easy choice to make but when they decide to keep the money it changes their lives and relationships between each other irrevocably. Produced by the creators of \"Trainspotting\" this black comedy won best acting awards for the three lead performers at the British International Film Festival."
