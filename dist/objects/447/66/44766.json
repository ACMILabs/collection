        "In this exploration of justice and revenge inspired by brotherly love, Henry Fonda reprises his role as Jesse James' brother, Frank, in Fritz Lang's sequel to 'Jesse James'. The film is notable for the screen debut of Gene Tierney, as well as being Lang's first western and his first film in colour. After his brother, Jesse, is shot and killed by the Ford brothers, Frank takes the law into his own hands when the brothers are pardoned. Franks journey alienates him from family and friends, as well as endangering the lives of those close to him. He has only two people to help his lonely and determined plight, teenage friend Clem (Jackie Cooper), and a newspaper owner's beautiful daughter (Gene Tierney). Cast includes Henry Fonda, Gene Tierney, Jackie Cooper, Henry Hull and John Carradine."
