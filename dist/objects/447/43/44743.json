        "Episode of Series \"Great train journeys of Australia\". On the Express Passenger Train- Australia's fastest train, travel from Brisbane in subtropical Queensland to cosmopolitan Sydney in the heart of New South Wales. Cross the rugged Macpherson ranges, tour Australia's economic heartland and visit the country's pristine beaches. The XPT even cruises through some alternative villages and through Australia's spectacular rainforests. As the train pulls into one of its 21 stops, Coff's Harbour, view the vast plantations of bananas as well as the gaudy \"Big Banana\" tourist park, which symbolizes the recent tourism boom. Finally, the XPT reaches Sydney. Hugging the shores of a magnificent harbor and accented by its elegant bridge, Sydney is the quintessential icon of the Australian experience."
