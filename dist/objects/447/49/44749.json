        "This tape contains two programs explaining how crude oil is turned into usable products by the refining process. 'Physical separation': tells the story of physical separation, the distillation process used throughout the refinery to separate molecules. The process is shown and explained in some detail, both in live action and animation. 'Chemical conversion': physical separation provides only a certain amount of product. Further reactions like catalytic cracking and reforming continue the process. This portion of the tape includes footage of the Shell Hycon plant in the Netherlands."
