        "Housewife Rhonda Stample (Exene Cervenka) - married to biker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen), has recently taken to donating her husband's hard earned wages to Reverend Edward Randall (Stephen McHattie). Randall is a young, good looking, yet sexually repressed pastor on the ministry of the air. Rhonda's attempts to bring the message of God to to the youth of America, and her new found connection with the Reverend have repercussions for the rest of her family. Her beautiful and promiscuous sister Lenore (Dominique Davalos) sets out to cure the reverend of his repression. She is driven by her brother-in-law, Jerome, a man determined to reap the benefits of the evangelist's wealth when he resorts to blackmailing the man of cloth. A quirky parody of electronic evangelism set to an energetic soundtrack."
