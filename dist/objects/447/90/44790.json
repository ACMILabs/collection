        "This film depicts the timber industry in Aalska in its early stages. Also shows salmon fishing during the short Summer season when 100s of millions of pounds of fish are netted under government supervision. Within the two months of the fishing and canning season many millions of dollars are made from this production. Gold mining is also carried out using cannon jets of water. During the short Summer season a variety of products are produced on the farms."
