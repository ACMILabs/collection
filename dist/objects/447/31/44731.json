        "There will always be discussion about the maintenance of oil supplies in an energy consumptive world, and the need for alternative energy sources. 'Time for energy' looks at some of these alternatives in 18 locations across 5 countries. Solar energy: power from the sun features prominently in the video, along with the conversion of waste wood into high energy industrial and domestic fuel. Large scale experiments generate power from the wind, the waves and tides. Nuclear power, new processes based on coal, fermented alcohol from sugar cane to run motor cars and other forms of biomass sourced energy are also dealt with. Even the tapping of heat and power from the geothermal hot rocks under the earth's surface is part of the message. The video makes no predictions: it simply examines and reports on the current state of research for tomorrow's alternative energy. It does point out that time is not on our side."
