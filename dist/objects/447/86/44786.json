        "2 cars arrive at a desolate cotton property. One car carries two feuding white teenagers Amy (Nathalie Roy) and Mick (Tristan Bancks)- the other 2 aboriginal youths Leroy (Clayton Munro) and Vance (Wayne Munro) and an elderly aboriginal woman called Ruby (Peta Binge). Under the fast moving clouds a storm is brewing, and when racism reaches a head and the dust storm finally erupts, the 5 find themselves confined in a car where they can no longer flee the tragedy of the past. Nominated for three AFI awards, Ivan Sen's final film received a special commendation at the Clermonth Ferrand Short Film Festival."
