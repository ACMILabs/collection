        "This video aims to increase awareness of the soil and its importance to mankind. It describes the development of soil science, and the history of the American Prairie and the Russian Steppe. Soil science owes much to Vasilii Dokuchaev, a professor of mineralogy at the University of St Petersburg who, in the 1880's, became intrigued by the idea of soil as a living medium. 'A Stake in soil' follows Dokuchaev's work, travelling to America where awareness was sharpened by the 'dustbowl' events in the 1930's. The program also briefly covers the natural forces which impact on soil; wind and water erosion and drought, and the farming techniques that have contributed to this burden, such as the removal of fences and trees as windbreaks, deep ploughing and excessive animal grazing."
