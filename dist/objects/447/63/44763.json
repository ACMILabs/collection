        "A family's life is changed irrevocably when their son Olivier mysteriously disappears while riding his bicycle. The Police search for weeks but to no avail, the lives of Olivier's parents, and older sister Nadine begins to fall apart. His mother never gives up hope, and his father, frustrated by his wife's changing moods, leaves for a while. Six years later a young juvenile is arrested in Paris who looks exactly like Olivier and knows things that only he could know. Olivier is reunited with the family, although Nadine remains suspicious. Slowly they begin to rebuild their lives together until the truth is revealed and threatens to change their lives again. In French with English subtitles. Cast includes Frederic Quiring, Faye Gatteau, Emmanuel Morozof, Brigitte Rouan and Francois Cluzet."
