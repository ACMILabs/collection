        "Episode of Series \"Great train journeys of Australia\". Journey out to the last frontier on three separate trains. First on the Gulflander, described as \"heroic,\" even \"eccentric,\" traversing Australia's most isolated savannah country. Meet the characters who operate it, those who travel the line and the locals who depend on \"one of the great little railroads of the world.\" Then, travel to the heartland of Queensland from Brisbane to Longreach, the birthplace of the oldest and safest operating airline in the English speaking world. Hear stories of how the Spirit of the Outback has affected the lives of drovers, bush poets and swaggies. Finally, discover a train without a schedule, the Savannah Lander. Journey to the tropical outback and see old gold fields and the largest lava tube system on Earth, Undara."
