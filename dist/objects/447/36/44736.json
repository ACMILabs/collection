        "This program tracks the journey of Western Australia's natural gas from the North Rankin \"A\" Gas and Condensate production platform, through its 134 km journey to the Burrup Peninsula and through the liquefication process, concluding with delivery to Japan. The video explains various elements of the LNG plant including the sulfinol column, dehydration unit, scrub column, heat exchanger, storage tanks and control room. The program concludes with details of the LNG ships and their delivery of LNG to Japanese power utilities."
