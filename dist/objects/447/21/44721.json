        "This unusual twist on Robert Louis Stevenson's often filmed Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde also incorporates the Jack the Ripper mythology into it's narrative. This time around the 'good' doctor Jekyll (Ralph Bates) is experimenting with female hormones in his quest for the elixir of youth, when things start to go horribly wrong. His experiment transforms him not into a hideous monster but a beautiful woman (Martine Beswick), giving the film an unexpected gender-bending twist. Of course the doctor spends much of his time in front of the mirror admiring his new breasts, while the upkeep of his new persona sends him into a grisly killing spree. Cast includes Gerald Sim, Lewis Fiander, Susan Broderick, Dorothy Alison."
