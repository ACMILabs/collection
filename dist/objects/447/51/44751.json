        "This tape contains four short films by Australian directors. \"Hear no evil\" (produced by Fiona Hergstrom, directed by Kate Hampel): a young woman attempts to make her mark as a band manager in a particularly challenging environment, death metal. We watch as she overcomes barriers and prejudices and reaches towards her goal of managing the band full time. \"Babes on boards\" (produced by Deborah Rohde, directed by Adrian Holmes): follows the journey of three young women with a passion for surfing as they travel along the coast, surfing, arguing and enjoying themselves. One of them meets the challange of a competition - her ultimate goal. \"Festivals\" (produced by Caroline Waters, directed by Caroline Waters and Matthew Rooke): examines the culture of Australian music festivals. People who are involved in the festivals- participating and watching, are asked how they feel the festival contributes to society and youth culture. \"Neurodancer\" (produced by Simon Hay, directed by Chris Zwar): goes inside the Rave culture, a prominent youth culture within Australia. It probes the minds and attitudes of dancers, DJ's, artists, musicians and outsiders."
