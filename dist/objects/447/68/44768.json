        "Through a succession of mini-portraits, this documentary portrays a woman of rural India whose life, shaped by tradition and ritual, still follows a pre-determined course. Images of great visual beauty illustrate the various stages of her evolution, from childhood to old age. Her marriage to a young man of her parents' choice is a turning point in her life. She must leave her family to become a member of her husband's family. The woman of rural India moves through life with grace and dignity, regardless of the tasks she must perform. Voice and narration: Kelly Ricard."
