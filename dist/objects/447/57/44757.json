        "Documentary from 1936 about the visit of the Australian Olympic team to the Bayer Works, manufacturers of Bayer Aspirins and APC powders, at Leverkusen, near Cologne, Germany before travelling to Berlin for the Olympic Games. The Australian Olympic team are shown arriving in Cologne, Germany, and being met by representatives of the Bayer works. They move on to a casino where they have breakfast. The team's chaperone, Mrs. Ferguson talks to long distance runner, Daryl Backhouse. At the Bayer Works factory team members Alf Watson and Pat Norton look at a machine which fills and caps vials. The team moves on and looks at a machine which makes Bayer aspirins. At a dock on the Rhine river, where raw materials for the factory are unloaded, team members L. Cook, Duncan Gray and Bill Dixson are shown standing around and chatting. After a visit to the factory the team are shown sight seeing around Cologne. Shots of a booklet signing are followed by shots of Berlin. As the Australian team disembark from their train on their arrival at a railway station in Berlin, the German Navy are shown playing 'God save the King' on the station's platform. Words of the sound film are spoken by Mr. Alderson, manager of the Australian Olympic team."
