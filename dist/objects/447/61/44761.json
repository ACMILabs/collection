        "Everyone knows that oil won't last forever. The search for new forms of renewable energy is increasing. This film looks at some of the ways that are being used to explore the options available. In Indonesia and the Phillipines photo voltaics provide electricity for homes. In Sweden, biomass and hydroelectricity play an increasing role, and in other parts of the world, wind and wave power are playing their part. The costs of these systems are as yet untested in a harsh fiscal world but, in the next thirty years, some of these fledgling technologies will come more and more to the fore."
