        "A portrait of Hamilton, the Pittsburgh or Birmingham of Canada. This is a rich and colorful subject that encourages imaginative treatment on the screen. The heart of the city is the immense complex of furnaces and rolling mills, but nearby are the lake, the mountain, and the rich fruit farms. How the work of the steel mills touches the city and its surroundings is shown in many views during both day and night."
