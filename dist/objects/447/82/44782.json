        "This film was shot in New York City in 1975 and 1976...and is not intended as a definitive statement on feminism, the women, or the movement, but rather a documentary exploring the experiences, feelings and philosophies of some American feminists. It contains a series of interviews, interspersed with newsreel footage, placing the American feminist movement in a historical perspective. Six of the women who gave impetus to the movement, Betty Friedan (author), Kate Millett (author and sculptor), Rita Mae Brown (author and poet), Lila Karp (writer and professor of women's studies), Ti-Grace Atkinson (feminist theorist and activist) and Margo Jefferson (writer and critic), discuss those issues that most concern them, and which are still being debated. Interviewer: Luce Guilbeault."
