        "An emotional commentary, written and spoken by Quentin Reynolds, one of WWII's best reporters, on the eve of his departure back to America, with a film report on how British people were celebrating their first Christmas under blitz conditions in 1940. Shows them in shelters, on watch in fields, in the city and at their posts proving to the world that the people of Britain are equal to their testing, unbeaten, unconquered and unafraid. Carols sung by the choir of Kings College Chapel, Cambridge."
