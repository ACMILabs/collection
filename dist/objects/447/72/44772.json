        "This documentary follows the story of 5 Jacaranda Queen candidates in the country town of Grafton, NSW, before and after the crowning. It examines all the trials and tribulations of preparing for the ceremony and coping with not only losing, but winning. Their candid experience is reflected against the background of Grafton, a town living through tough economic times, the community expectation of the events, and the impact or relevance it has on their lives. Produced with assistance from the Australian Film Finance Corporation."
