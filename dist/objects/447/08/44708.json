        "A game in an old haunted house is suddenly shattered by uncontrollable violence. As merriment turns to vulnerability, the party-goers try and halt the roller-coaster descent towards madness and the tragic, terrifying climax. Only those with nerves strong enough to witness the psychotic happenings in this House of Horrors, will know what lies waiting in the dark."
