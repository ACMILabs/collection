        "This video, presented in four distinct sections, is a general introduction to work in the oil industry. It shows the story of oil and gas from their origins to uses. The sections include- origin and search: shows how oil and gas originated millions of years ago and how modern scientists discover the unlikely whereabouts of underground reservoirs. Drilling: shows how an exploration well is drilled on land, and contrasts this with modern offshore developments. Refining: shows how crude oil is converted into a host of useful products through the refinery process. Distribution and use: shows how these products are distributed all over the world, and used in an endless variety of ways."
