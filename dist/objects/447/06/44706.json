        "Molly, it's only a mannequin - but is it? 2 guys and 3 girls, a broken down car in a deserted backwater, and some weirdo in overalls, a ten gallon hat and rifle in hand, smells like trouble to me. It all begins with one of the guys, rolling his punctured tyre down the road to a petrol station, it seems deserted. Searching for an attendant, he becomes trapped inside a room, with a laughing mannequin in a bed, one smashing through a window, and another swaying back and forth, laughing. Quite a typical horror story, however the mannequins and their eerie qualities make this film very watchable to the bitter end."
