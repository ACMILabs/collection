        "From the director of \"Goldeneye\" comes this swashbuckling action-packed blockbuster starring Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones. Zorro -legendary name conjures up images of masks, sword fights and one man's fight for justice. Or is it just one man? Set in California when it's still controlled from Spain by the Mexican authorities, one man (Anthony Hopkins) fights against injustice for the ordinary man in the only way he can - as a masked phantom. What happens when his world is turned upside down? Does the legend continue and how is this possible? These questions and others are answered as the story unfolds."
