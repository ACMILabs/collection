        "Episode of Series \"Great train journeys of Australia\". Traverse the full distance between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, from Sydney to Perth, in a 2,700 mile odyssey. One of the world's great long distance trains, the Indian Pacific, rolls across Australia like a miniature city on wheels, illuminating the colorful and quirky history, cultures and countryside of Australia as it goes. The heart of the Outback emerges in the Nullarbor Plain, offering a glimpse into the oldest continuing culture on earth. We stop several times along the way and meet the people who have made the remote outback their home. The three day journey on Australia's crown jewel of rail lines promises all that the country itself has to offer - vivid landscapes, exotic creatures, mystical destinations, and unforgettable characters. Presented in two parts: Sydney to Adelaide and Adelaide to Perth."
