        "A lively short film about the relationship between Rachel (Sophie Heathcote) and Nick (Marcus Graham), perhaps a metaphor for all men and women. Despite their creativity and independence, they cannot seem escape the basic differences between the sexes. The film gets lively when Rachel decides she's had enough and has an axe the grind. Their Gulf War is about to reach a climax."
