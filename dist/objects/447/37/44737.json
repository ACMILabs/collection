        "Environmentally responsible high yield plantations are one approach taken by the Shell company to relieve the pressure on natural forests. This program looks at the fundamental structure of the forest ecology and soils, and shows how this has led to the failure of many plans for their alternative use, particularly when environmental considerations are not given enough importance in economic terms. Finally, the program shows examples of economic and environmentally sound management projects. It advocates for recognition of the inestimable value of the rich and varied resources of natural forests, and argues that the preservation of those that remain must become a global responsibility and not another burden on those nations least able to afford it."
