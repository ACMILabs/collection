        "The Beach is part of Australia's cultural landscape, the surf lifesavers the guardians of this beautiful, but potentially dangerous terrain. Saving lives is not all these lifesavers do, at the end of every summer the Australian National Surf Lifesaving Titles (affectionately referred to as the \"Aussies\" by lifesaving aficionados) are held in April on the Gold Coast. Featuring over 6,000 competitors, this prestigious event is the second largest sporting event in number of athletes only to the Olympics. 'Bronzed Aussie Gods' follows three groups of men and women in training as lifesavers, performing real life rescues, enjoying their work, and vying for title glory. Interspersed with their plight is a trip down memory lane courtesy of archival footage capturing the changing customs and costumes that celebrate Australia's unique relationship with the beach. This results in a film which celebrates Australian beach culture and maps the evolution of a strong aspect of Australian identity."
