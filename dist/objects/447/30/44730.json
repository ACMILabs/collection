        "'Search for oil' explains some of the work involved in oil exploration prior to drilling wells. The technology is becoming increasingly complex as the search becomes more difficult, but the story is told in a simple way using interesting images from around the world with basic non-technical animated drawings. It incorporates examples of the latest advances in the field of seismic exploration."
