        "A decision (and ensuing conviction that all murderers are subject to capital punishment) to sentence a woman to death for a crime of passion comes back to haunt jury foreman Edward Weldon (O.P. Heggie), when he has a personal stake in a capital punishment trial. Weldon's daughter, Stella (Sidney Fox) kills a former lover who betrayed her, challenging her father's assumption that all murderers deserve the ultimate punishment, and all on the eve of the execution of the woman he helped sway the jury to send to the electric chair. Humphrey Bogart plays a brief but memorable role as one of the murder victims. Cast also includes Granville Bates and Helen Flint."
