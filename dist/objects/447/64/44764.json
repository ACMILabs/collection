        "DCI Tennison (Helen Mirren) has made it in a man's world and secured the position of a high ranking policewoman. In this third instalment of Lynda La Plante's series Tennison is given the assignment of cleaning up the murky world of prostitutes, or \"rent boys\", due to public pressure about the standard of morality in Soho- Operation Contract. The nature of her assignment quickly changes tack when one of the boys perishes in a suspicious fire. Strange details begin to emerge, such as forensic evidence that the victim was unconscious when the fire started and someone called an ambulance to the flat that night The suspects soon mount- the sleazy pimp, the head of a centre for troubled boys, and a respected police official. Tennison's personal life is not without upheaval during the investigation as an old flame enters the scene, causing her to question life's decisions. As Tennison leads her investigative team into an underworld populated by paedophiles, pornographic photography, transvestites and abuse, the shocking truth is revealed and Helen must make an important decision. Cast includes Vera Reynolds, David Thewlis, Danny Dyer, Tom Bell and Ciaran Hinds."
