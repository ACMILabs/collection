        "The pilot project conducted in the Yass River Valley, to investigate the difference between the current methods of land use and the agricultural potential of the area. Describes the work of the extension officers of the Department of Agriculture in bridging the gap between the knowledge gained by research scientists and its practical application by farmers to the problems of increasing production. Investigations into soil fertility, water supply, farm economics and other factors have made much valuable information available to Yass Valley farmers."
