        "Featuring top-notch karate action, this film about a kick-off competition between two opposing martial arts coaches offers all the fight scenes any lover of the genre could want. A martial arts champion (James Ryan) is lured to a desert fortress and what he thought would be an Olympic-style contest turns out to be a fight for survival against an army of martial arts gladiators."
