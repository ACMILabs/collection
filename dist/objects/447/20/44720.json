        "A family learn the grisly cost of their inheritance when the mansion they take possession of proves to be the house from hell. By day they are harassed by a vigilante street gang, by night they are visited by the ghostly apparition of a dead actor. It's a choice between two evils when both night and day present equally horrific forms of evil. Cast includes Tom Breznahan, Jill Whitlow, Jonathan Chapin and Christopher Burgard."
