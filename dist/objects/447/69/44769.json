        "A period of history brought to life as student recruits re-enact a British regimental drill that took place regularly in the old colonial city of St. John's, Newfoundland, in the mid-19th century. This film follows some of the training, then describes the colorful military display on Signal Hill overlooking the city, as the smartly uniformed soldiers go through the maneuvers to the sound of bugles, drums, cannon and musket fire."
