        "Episode of Series \"Great train journeys of Australia\". On the Express Passenger Train, experience the fastest form of land transport between Australia's two major capital cities, Melbourne and Sydney. Reaching speeds up to 70 miles per hour, the XPT travels across rolling plains and through the country's Great Dividing Range. See rural areas rich with the history of early settlers who continued the struggles they imported from England and Ireland, including the outlaw, Ned Kelly. Visit the border town of Albury and find out about Australia's unique railroad history. The town of Goulburn, home to the largest jail in the Southern Hemisphere, offers an insight into modern Aboriginal history. The view out the window of this train reveals a hundred fascinating observations about Australia and it's people."
