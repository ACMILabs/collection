        "The culture of Middle eastern belly dancing in Australia is a prolific one, with belly dancers in Australia outnumbering dancers in other countries. The director gleans anecdotes about the history of this sensual womens' dance and interviews Australian dancers about their dance, their lives and their culture. It also discusses the importance of traditional cultural dance in women's lives."
