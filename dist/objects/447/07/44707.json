        "Australian music came of age in the summer of 1987 when the cream of Oz rock swept the continent for the most ambitious series of open air concerts ever staged beneath the Southern Cross. Almost 140,000 fans in six cities were entertained with a diverse array of potent and imaginative rock - from understated avant-garde to tempestuous thunder from Down Under. The dynamic performances and behind-the-scenes activity of the tour has generated an exciting, fast paced and imaginative feature film. Includes performances by: INXS ; Jimmy Barnes ; The Triffids ; I'm Talking ; The Saints ; The Divinyls and The Models."
