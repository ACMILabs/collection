        "Episode of Series \"Great train journeys of Australia\". When you leave Brisbane on the Queenslander, you find yourself on an adventure that seems larger than life. It's a glorious luxury holiday train, reminiscent of the exotic rail journeys of last century. And there's plenty of time to be drawn into it. The journey takes the better part of two days, travelling over 1,000 miles up the tropical coast to Cairns in the far north of Queensland. Pass through lush forests, unusual peaks and tiny towns, pineapple and banana plantations, grazing cattle and miles of sugarcane. Meet travellers from all over the world, including young backpackers, families on holiday and wealthy tourists, each with their own perspective on the Australian experience."
