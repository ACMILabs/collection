        "Melbourne has proven to be a mecca of sorts for musicians, with virtually any style of music being performed in clubs and halls across the city at any one time. 'Beating the drum' showcases some of these extraordinary performers who have migrated to Australia- some retain their traditional style, others have blended it in collaboration with other musicians. Both methods reflect the bigger issue of the cultural appropriation of music- whether there is such a thing, is there a right and wrong way to do it, how does Aboriginal music fit into this notion, and what we mean by world music? Musicians, academics, broadcasters and World Music aficionados take up this discussion through words and music. Musicians include: Xylouris Ensemble, Kavisha Mazzella and La Voce Della Luna, George Telek, Rembetika Compania, Terrasphere, Tom E. Lewis, Inka Marka, Taksim, Thula Sana, Adzohu, Fronteras, Vladimir Kocibelli, Petrunka, Tsicaderis Ensemble and Ta'Esh Fa'Esh."
