        "It had been a hard journey for immigrants Jan Laluckey and his family. But on arrival in Quebec, the New World, all their hopes for a new and better life were dampened when immigration officials refused to allow Kasia, Jan's daughter, to remain. During a routine medical examination it was found that Kasia had contracted an infectious eye disease. In the end she was separated from her family and sent back to Europe alone. Cast: George Popovich, Elaine Reade, Maruska Stankova, Vlasta Vrana."
