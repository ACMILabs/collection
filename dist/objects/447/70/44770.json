        "Alone on the open sea! Two Canadians, Bob Lush and Mike Birch, took cameras aboard their yachts during the 1980 Observer Singlehanded Transatlantic Race. The result is more than a record of this prestigious international sailing event. The sport of ocean racing becomes the starting point for an epic of challenge and determination."
