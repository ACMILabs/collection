        "Three bluefin fishermen going about their daily routine find a luxury yacht, 'Medusa' drifting on the sea and decide to board her. Finding a dead body and no one else there, shipmates Marty, Kick and Joe see dollar signs appearing before their eyes and agree to salvage it. On dry land the F.B.I and coast guard are intrigued by the mysterious vessel. Marty and co. are allowed to keep the yacht on one condition- that they are used as fish bait to catch the owner of the vessel, a man believed to be a wealthy criminal involved in narcotics. The bait is taken and the drama begins. With corny humour and some bad acting, one could think the film may not stay afloat, however the well paced story line seems to keep the movie moving along enjoyably. Cast includes Chris Warfield, Sally Fraser and Richard Foote."
