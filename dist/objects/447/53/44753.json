        "Episode of Series \"Lessons in Living II\". Youngsters learn the pitfalls of trying things before they are prepared in this episode from Dumbo. Timothy Mouse pricks Dumbo with a pin to make him perform, despite the fact that Dumbo feels uncertain about his act. The result is a crashing failure that literally brings down the house. A charmingly anarchic affray, rendered with all the wide-eyed wonder of the Disney studio halcyon era."
