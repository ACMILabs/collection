        "Prospects for the development of new materials are almost limitless as scientists understand how the properties of materials relate to their internal structures, and can thus design materials to meet specific requirements. This program outlines the classification of materials into categories of metals, ceramics, polymers and composites. The general properties of each, as related to their different atomic or molecular bonding is also discussed. The way their atoms or electrons are arranged and the subsequent characteristics of each type of material is also covered."
