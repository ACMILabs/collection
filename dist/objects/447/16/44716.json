        "George Fulfit, retired, illustrates with humor and optimism the delicate craft of putting ships into bottles. The film documents the construction of the largest ship he has ever built. More than a \"how-to\" film, this short documentary shows the very real contribution a craft can make to anyone's life, whether a child, or a working or retired person. (Awards: Toronto; New York; Columbus; Yorkton; Carbondale; Toulon.)"
