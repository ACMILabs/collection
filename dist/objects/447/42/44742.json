        "Episode of Series \"Great train journeys of Australia\". The legendary Ghan was named after the Afghans who with their camels opened the supply line through Australia's interior. On this rich and fascinating journey from Adelaide to the Red Centre of Australia, traverse some of the world's most ancient and inhospitable terrain, exploring the history of this great train line. At the remote town of Pimba, attend a rock concert in the middle of the Australian desert, arranged by the world music organisation WOMAD. Later, when the Ghan pulls into Alice Springs, visit Uluru, the largest free standing rock in the world. Uluru is a sacred aboriginal dreaming site that was returned to it's original owners in 1985 and is now one of Australia's most celebrated tourist attractions."
