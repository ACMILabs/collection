        "A self-selected \"family of 13\" buys a house in a large western city and shares responsibilities. Originally, four adults held the mortgage. Since the film was made, two of the original members have moved and new arrangements have been made to share equitably with other people who have joined the group. This is a continuing experiment with alternatives to the prevailing nuclear family."
