        "An educational documentary in three parts, 'Last Paradise' examines the contrasts between contemporary and traditional lifestyles in Papua New Guinea through the lives of flight crew members working for the country's national airline, Air Niugini. While they enjoy the privileged lifestyles of international travellers, these men and women return each year to the villages and tribes to which they belong. The film makers contrast the work and leisure activities of the flight crew personnel abroad with the traditional culture, lore, and tribal values that continue to be the mainstay of the villages they come from to comment on the changes that are facing the inhabitants of Papua New Guinea and its surrounding islands at the end of the twentieth century."
