        "When natural gas is cooled to minus 161 degrees centigrade it becomes a liquid: liquified natural gas, or LNG. In 1959, Shell participated in the first ocean crossing of a cargo of LNG, marking the genesis of the modern LNG industry. In this video, projects in Brunei, Japan, Malaysia and Australia illustrate Shell's history in the LNG business across management, finance, shipping and supply."
