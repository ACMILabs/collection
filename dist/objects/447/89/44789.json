        "The windwheel is a short animated story of a girl and her father at a fun park. It was drawn entirely under the camera by Susan Stamp using charcoal as the primary drawing medium. The story follows the father and his daughter as they share the sights, sounds and rides of the fun park. When she is given a small windwheel, the girl is delighted and plays happily until her father is accidentally knocked in the eye by it."
