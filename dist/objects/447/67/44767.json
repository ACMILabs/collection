        "In 1870 white men and Indians are still fighting bitterly. One man, Tom Jeffords (James Stewart), is the lonely voice of conscience on the frontier, and strongly believes the Apaches are being treated unfairly. He befriends their leader Cochise (Jeff Chandler), and the two become friends as they forge negotiations to reach a truce. During this process Jeffords is called upon by a U.S. Army general to negotiate a government peace treaty, which he does successfully. The treaty comes at a high price however, when Jeffords, his Indian wife, and friend Cochise become targets of a renegade ambush. Based on the novel \"Blood brother\" by Elliott Arnold. Cast includes James Stewart, Jeff Chandler, Debra Paget and Basil Ruysdael."
