        "A young Montrealer explores Toronto for the first time. Despite some ready-made notions, the visitor is eager to look and learn, and before long is caught by the excitement of the Queen City. Although some of his prior convictions are confirmed, he finds, somewhat to his surprise, that the city has much to offer, including a French bookstore. Features songs \"The Times I've Had\" and \"The Crow On The Cradle\" sung by American folk singer Carloyn Hester. At the end of the film, footage of Carolyn Hester performing the song \"This Life I'm Living in\" is also featured; as the narrator explains \"in the semi-religious darkness...\" of a coffee house at night."
