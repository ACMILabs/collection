        "Time is running out for Lola (Franka Potente). She's just received a frantic phone call from her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), who's lost a small fortune in cash belonging to his Mob boss. Now she has to run for his life, to try and come up with the money before Manni pays the ultimate price for his mistake. Using a destiny device, the story begins anew with different outcomes. Other cinematic techniques which add to the breakneck pace and excitement of this innovative thriller include jump cuts, whip pans, slow and fast motion, split-screen, intercut colour and black and white, segment titles and animation. In German with English subtitles."
