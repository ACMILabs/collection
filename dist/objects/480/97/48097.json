        "John Murdock, principal of the Indian Affairs at Rupert House, James Bay, and his wife Gerti, have initiated a curriculum development project using local people and resources. The teaching materials are drawn from Cree folklore, are mainly in Cree, and make use of old photographs, artifacts and books that are written and printed in the community. The school year is organised so that pupils have time to go hunting and fishing with their families. This innovative approach makes local control of education a reality in native communities."
