        "There are many factors which have influenced the changes that have taken place in the world of paid work for women, these include: access to higher education; Equal Opportunity laws; the availability of child care; the impact of domestic and work-related technology; and, family leave for fathers. This video is based on interviews with three Australian women, each representing a different generation. Lynne McLennan, a 37 year old senior public servant, Rosemary West, a well known 53 year old journalist with a perspective on working in the 1960s and Marcella Pearce, a 74 year old retired secretary who began working in the 1930s. The video is presented in five segments: Career Decisions; Pregnancy and child care; Changes in the workplace; Issues in the workplace and Personal values. Teachers notes are included."
