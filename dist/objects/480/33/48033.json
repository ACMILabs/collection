        "Presented by Eric Wiley, this short program with an energetic soundtrack shows beginners and advanced riders enjoying their ScooterZ - a mode of transport originating in Asia that has taken the world by storm. Everything from young boys getting about town, Razer Pro Team Riders, Go-PED Pro Team Riders and professional rollerbladers, in line skaters and other extreme forms of \"board\" sports. NB: This is not an instructional video, and not all riders wear helmets and knee pads. Rather it shows the possibilities of ScooterZ and the progression from skate boards to in line skating to ScooterZ and beyond."
