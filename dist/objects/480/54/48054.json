        "Episode of Series \"Commonwealth Teleview\". Sir John Cockcroft, Director of Britain's Atomic Research Establishment, answers question, put to him by Robert McKenzie, about construction and operation of the Calder Hall nuclear power station and the establishment of the Canadian Atomic Research Center at Chalk River. He talks about the far-reaching effects of Britain's atomic power program on the everyday life of Britain and the Commonwealth whilst also making it clear that nuclear power is always more expensive - up to 10 times more - than fossil fuels. Closes with live footage of the Queen's opening speech at Calder Hall."
