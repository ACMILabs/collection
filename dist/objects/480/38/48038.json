        "Narrated by Kenneth Brannagh and using the computer graphic and animatronic techniques created by the team behind the amazing \"Walking with Dinosaurs\" series, this program resurrects Big Al, an Allosaurus who lived 145 million years ago. The first program is the recreated story of his 15-year life, a constant battle against formidable prey and voracious predators. The second program is a scientific detective story which traces the evidence of Big Al. Using the same graphic effects, we follow Big Al as he roams museums and archaeological dig sites where we see passionate scientists explaining the research behind his tale."
