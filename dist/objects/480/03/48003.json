        "Cat and Canary were good friends. After their master left for the day, Cat would let Canary out of her cage, and they would have breakfast together and then go out onto the roof, where Cat would watch Canary flying about, wishing he could fly too. One day, Cat finds a kite snagged on the television antenna, and while trying to free it, becomes entangled in it himself. A gust of wind blows the kite high into the air, and Cat realises he is flying! Canary struggles to keep up, but the kite is going too fast. Suddenly, storm clouds appear in the sky, and Cat begins to feel afraid. As snow starts falling, Canary and a posse of birds come to Cat's rescue, dragging the kite back to the roof of the house just as their master is returning home for the night. Despite the day's drama, Cat is eager to take the kite up again tomorrow to journey to \"the land beyond the river\" with Canary and the birds. An iconographic film with limited animation, based on the children's book by Michael Foreman."
