        "To create a successful video story it is essential that the correct type of sound is used for each shot. This video describes the situations in which both sync sound and non-sync sound should be used. It also discusses the issues surrounding different types of microphones (handheld, gun, personal), Mono and stereo soundtracks, recording non-sync sound (tape recorders, video camera recorder, commercial sound effects recordings), sound levels and distortion (under- and over-modulation) and mixing sounds using equalisers to control relative volumes, tone and the positioning of sound."
