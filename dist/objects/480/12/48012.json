        "4 year old Peter wakes one morning to discover the city he lives in covered in a blanket of fresh, white snow. Outside, he sees a wonderland of snowmen, snow angels and snowballs. Before going inside to get warm, he makes a snowball and puts it in his pocket for safe keeping. Before going to bed that night he checks his pockets and discovers that it has melted. That night he dreams that all the snow has melted away, only to wake up and find fresh snow falling. Based on the book by Ezra Jack Keats and narrated by Jane Harvey. Winner of the Caldecott Medal in 1976 for the most distinguished picture book for children."
