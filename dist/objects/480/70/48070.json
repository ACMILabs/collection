Cover areas such as; the French Indo-China war, the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, formation of the NLF and Viet Cong, the overthrow of South Vietnam President Ngo Dinn Diem, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, opposition in America towards President Johnson and the national draft, the Tet Offensive, and the mass migration of Vietnamese following 30 years of fighting. A program guide accompanies the video."
