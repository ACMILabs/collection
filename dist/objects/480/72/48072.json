        "Episode of Series \"Treasures of the world\". The world's most famous painting, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa disappeared from The Louvre in 1911. It would be another two years before she was safely recovered. This program traces the suspects and conspiracy theories, as well as the environment in which the world's most famous Renaissance man painted. It covers public reaction to the theft, techniques and innovations used in the painting, motivation behind the theft and the repercussions to the art world and society as a whole once she was found. Narrated by Krisha Fairchild."
