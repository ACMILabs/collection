        "This video describes the most important factors to be taken into consideration when using a video camera to record a story. The main areas covered include: focus; aperture; shutter speed; white balance; zoom; movement and framing. Also emphasised is the point that autofocus is not able to adjust correctly for all situations, so it is important to be aware of using the correct lighting for each shot."
