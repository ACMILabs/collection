        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Film Australia's Australia\". Film and video segments relevant to this topic have been selected with original footage accompanied by original soundtracks. This program represents aspects of Aboriginal culture in Australia, and focuses on Aboriginal identity. The program uses the unifying symbols found in what is now known as the Aboriginal flag. The three colours in the flag symbolise the Aboriginal way of perceiving: red (land and politics), black (identity and self determination), and yellow (art and spirituality). These three interlinked themes are explored in the film with a focus on stimulating deeper understanding by white Australia on Aboriginality, the attitudes of white Australians towards Aboriginal people, racism in Australia, both individual and institutional and the changes needed in attitude and action to achieve justice. Teacher's Guide included. Presented by Annette Shun Wah. Suitable for upper secondary level."
