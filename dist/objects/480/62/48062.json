        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Hornblower\". Spithead, Portsmouth, England, 1794. A storm is raging and a small shoreboat is being violently tossed about by the rain. Huddled at the stern is pale-faced 17 year old Horatio Hornblower, a midshipman about to begin his career in the Royal Navy. Soaked to the skin he steps aboard his first ship and becomes violently seasick. Despite this unpromising start, he is destined to become one of the most gallant and formidable figures in naval history. Plunged into battle, he proves himself to be courageous, resourceful and decisive against the perils of the high sea. Starring Ioan Gruffudd and Robert Lindsay this is a dramatisation of C. S. Forester's classic maritime adventure."
