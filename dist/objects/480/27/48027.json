        "Journey back to a magical time when the skies were filled with dragons in this feature-length animated version of Peter Dickinson's acclaimed book. The tale is of the sinister Red Wizard Ommadon (James Earl Jones), who threatens to destroy nature. The world's only hope is a man of science and magic from the future named Peter (John Ritter), snatched from the 20th century by the Green Wizard Carolinus (Harry Morgan) to capture Ommadon's Red crown and thus take away his powers. Peter, accompanied by a fire-breathing dragon, an outlaw elf and a noble knight, applies modern-day logic to battling ancient evil."
