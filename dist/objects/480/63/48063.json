        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Hornblower\". Promoted to Acting Lieutenant, Hornblower's ship \"The Indefatigable\" puts into Gilbraltar where three survivors from a wrecked brig are rescued, one of whom is Captain Dawson, whom Hornblower comes to admire. Supplies are dangerously low so Hornblower leads a mission to Algiers to replenish them. The crew finds itself in quarantine when exposed to plague but Hornblower uses the time to study for his pending Lieutenant's exam. Back in Gibraltar, he sits his exam but fails to impress his Commanding Officers until an alarm is raised when a Spanish attack looms. Starring Ioan Gruffudd and Robert Lindsay this is a dramatisation of C. S. Forester's classic maritime adventure."
