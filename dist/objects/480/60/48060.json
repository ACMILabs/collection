        "Rose Troche's (\"Go Fish\") second feature film is a gentle and amusing study into the nuances of sexual preference, dating and masculinity. Using Leo's (Kevin McKidd) 30th birthday bash as a basis, the film traces Leo's relationship to the guests; gay room mate Darren (Tom Hollander) and his real estate agent boyfriend (Hugo Weaving) with a penchant for using the bedrooms of the houses he's selling for their trysts; straight and single friend Angie (Julie Graham); new Age guru and leader of Leo's men's group, Keith (Simon Callow); Leo's previous boyfriend, Brendan (James Purefoy) and Brendan's current girlfriend, Sally (Jennifer Ehle), who also happens to be Leo's high school sweetheart. Central to the film are the gatherings of the men's group for masculine assertiveness and when Leo admits his attraction to seemingly straight, Irishman Brendan, it opens the floodgates for other members of the group with surprising results. (Awards: Winner Audience Award, London Film Festival, 1998)"
