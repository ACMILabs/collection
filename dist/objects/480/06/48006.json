        "This is the story of the Tomten, a magical being of Swedish legend, which lives in the corner of a hayloft on a lonely old farm. The Tomten creeps around the farm, speaking Tomten, \"a silent little language\", that animals can understand, while lamenting the fact that the people are asleep and cannot talk to him. Based on a poem by Victor Rydberg, adapted by Astrid Lindgren, illustrated by Harold Wiberg."
