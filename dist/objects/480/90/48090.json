        "Intelligent methods of preventing fire and of fighting it should it break out. Simple home fire rules are suggested, and types of fire extinguishers suitable for the home are displayed. We see how a family that is well-organised and keeps cool escapes from a burning house and manages to save the building and most of its contents. The graphic story of a man caught in a strange hotel room with both exits barred by flames, shows how even in this desperate predicament knowledge and cool-headedness can avert final disaster.
