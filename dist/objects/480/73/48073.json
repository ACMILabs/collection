        "Episode of Series \"Treasures of the world\". A detailed documentary focussing on one of the most recogniseable monuments in the world, the Taj Mahal. Built during the mogul period when outrageous opulence became symbolic of one's power, the Taj Mahal was created by the distraught emperor Shahjahan as a tribute to his beloved consort Arjumand Banu, better known as Mumtaz Mahal, after she died of complications from the birth of her fourteenth child. Using materials sourced from every corner of the globe, the Taj Mahal - which took over twenty years to build - features a stunning array of architectural forms, the origins of which are discussed in detail. The historical, artistic, and religious significance of the Taj Mahal are also examined, utilising archival material and the expertise of art historians Milo Beach and Shabita Punja."
