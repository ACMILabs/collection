        "Three friends, a rabbit (Tom), a duck (Doris) and a frog (Arthur) walk to school together every morning. Every morning and afternoon they wake up their snoozy, good-natured, easy-going alligator friend, Monty, to get a ride across the wide river in their way. They are somewhat ill-mannered and unappreciative of his help. One day Monty is not there, and finding they have no way to cross the river, they try 4 turtles, a catapult see-saw, balancing on Arthur. All attempts fail. \"We need Monty\" they cry, and Monty responds, carrying them on his back once more. Finally they appreciate, admire and thank him as bad manners are converted to good. Based on the book of the same name by James Stevenson. Suitable for children aged 4-8."
