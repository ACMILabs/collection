        "Episode of Series \"SEC Documentary films from the period 1950-1993\". This tape is a compilation of 4 programs: \"The Briquette story\": Explains the formation of brown coal and its processing into briquettes at the Yallourn open cut. Using the vehicle of a young couple selecting appropriate heating for their new home. The program outlines the convenience and versatility of briquettes for heating, cooking and hot water generation. The value of briquettes in commercial and industrial usage is also explained. \"Valley of power\" (prod. writer, Shan Benson): Looks at the importance of the Latrobe Valley, site of the world's largest single brown coal field, to Victoria. Outlines the economic and lifestyle benefits that the power industry and its supporting infrastructure has brought to the towns of Yallourn, Traralgon, Moe and Morwell. Includes commentary from local identities Willis Connolly, Les Haine, Campbell Husten and Mrs Thompson. \"Power makers\" (dir. Lee Robinson): Looks at a typical day in the life of four \"power makers\" - workers at the Yallourn power station. We are shown the important work performed by dredger crews, train drivers, boiler hands, turbine attendants and other tradesmen. Features workers George Fisher, Jack Morris, Rowley Paul and Frank Robertson. \"Behind the switch\": Every switch is a demand for instant electricity. The Latrobe Valley brown coal provides four-fifths of electricity. Shows work at Yallourn and Morwell and progress on the new Hazelwood power station. Use of electricity in industry, at home, for transport, and entertainment. Increasing demands are a measure of the State's growth and rate of development. Emphasis on ability to meet future demands."
