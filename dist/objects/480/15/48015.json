        "A traditional folk tale retold. When the little girl, Red Riding Hood, is sent on an errand of taking food to her ill and beloved grandmother, her mother warns \"Do not tarry, do not speak to strangers\". Going through the deep, dark wood she meets an evil wolf, but seeing as he has such nice manners she ignores her mothers warning. The wolf, realising he can eat both the girl and her granny, races ahead and gobbles up Granny, \"without even chewing!\". He disguises himself as Granny to lure the child close enough to eat, but when Red Riding Hood arrives (\"here comes dessert!\"), she is suspicious. Crisis arrives with, \"what big teeth you have\", and the ensuing response, \"all the better to eat you with my dear\" as he gobbles her up too. A passing hunter kills the wolf rescuing them both. The message, don't talk to strangers, no matter how charming or nice their 'manners' are is reinforced by the ending: Red Riding Hood sets off again, meets a charming stranger, but does the right thing this time. Based on the book of the same name by James Marshall, published in 1987. Suitable for children ages 5-8."
