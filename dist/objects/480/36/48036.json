        "Through events in the life of 10 year-old Mikisoq, an eskimo boy living with his family in a remote Greenland settlement, we see how a new Greenland is emerging with the involvement of Denmark. The heavy decrease in seal catches imposes poverty and hardship and the film shows how Mikisoq and his family eventually find a different life and future in a southern town. Grandfather prefers to stay behind."
