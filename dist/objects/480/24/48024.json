Demonstrates that the causes of this illness are imbedded personality difficulties often relating back to the early formative years of the victim's childhood. The film discusses different forms of alcoholism and the different treatment required for each type. The role of Alcoholics Anonymous is covered and a plea made for increased public facilities for the treatment of alcoholics."
