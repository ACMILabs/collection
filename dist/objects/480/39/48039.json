        "The film outlines briefly the three aims of controlled irrigation: to supply the water requirements of the growing crop; to use water efficiently; to avoid soil damage. It stresses that the achievement of these amis should be the constant endeavour of every irrigation farmer so as to maintain soil fertility, and to obtain the maximum return for their labour."
