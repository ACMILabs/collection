        "Editors needs to follow the rules of how people percieve what they are watching - a logical sequence of events - so that the story being told makes sense. Successful editing can enhance the power with which a story can be told by establishing the scene of the story, creating visual interest, following the dramatic focus, controlling timing and emphasis and selecting the best material. This video describes the factors which should be taken into consideration when editing a video sequence."
