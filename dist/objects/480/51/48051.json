        "Episode of Series \"SEC Documentary films from the period 1950-1993\". This tape is a compilation of 4 programs: \"Brown coals to briquettes\": Classroom film showing the manufacture of briquettes at Yallourn and Morwell, Victoria. Includes demonstration by models of processes; operation of coal dredges at open cut; crushing and drying of coal; pressing of fine powder into briquettes; transport of finished product to other parts of Victoria. \"Brown coal to kilowatts\": Classroom film describing the processes by which wet, raw brown coal from the Yallourn open cut is burned in specially designed boilers to produce steam for use in turbines for the generation of electric power. Laboratory demonstration, models, and diagrams explain the principles of operation of plant seen in use at Yallourn. \"Romance of brown coal\": Illustrates how brown coal has been formed in the Latrobe Valley. Also shows the mining of brown coal and the conveyance of the coal from the open cut to the power house and briquetting plant. \"Pageant of power\": Looks at open-cut mining and processing of brown coal at Yallourn, both for power generation and briquette production. Creation of Yallourn as an exemplary company town, plus references to early hydro-electric power stations located in north eastern Victoria."
