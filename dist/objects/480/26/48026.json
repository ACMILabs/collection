        "Successful fishing is dependent on good bait and beach worms are one of the finest bait around. Professional wormer, Dan Fuller, meets presenter John Stewart on the Gold Coast and gives him the low down on day and night worming, covering aspects such as locating pippies for the berley, the mechanics of how to pull worms from the sand, place it on the hook, what sort of fish your likely to find on the end of the line, storage, legal limits and the dangers of night worming. Bloopers follow the final credits."
