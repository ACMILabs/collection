        "A Hitchcock movie with a difference, a romantic comedy. Successful New York couple David and Anne Smith live happily by mutually agreed rules, that is until their secrecy is shattered by a visit from the civil celebrant who married them some years earlier in Anne's home town. He has arrived to tell them that due to a state boundary dispute at the time of their wedding, they are not legally married. Social conventions of the time require them to take up separate residences immediately as they reconsider whether they really wish to be married or whether their futures lie better apart."
