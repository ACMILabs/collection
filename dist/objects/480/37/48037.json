        "'Brain Story' is a series of six programs exploring the latest research on brain function. Professor Susan Greenfield CBE, presenter of the series, uses current scientific technology to help answer a number of philosophical questions about who we are as people and what makes you 'you' and the brain's role in this. Episode 1: \"All in the mind\" introduces the series and addresses broadly the range of functions that the brain is responsible for from spirituality to the very nature of conscious experience. Episode 2: \"In the heat of the moment\" explores what makes life worth living and asks whilst looking at the range of human emotions 'How does the brain create intense feelings of love, fear, anger and joy?'. Episode 3: \"The Mind's Eye\" explores how the brain generates vision. Movement, shape, colour and size are all constructed in our mind. The brain processes very little of what we see because our eyes are slaves to our attention system. \"The Mind's eye\" concerns itself with illusion and reality and how our brain interprets and influences our perception."
