        "Episode of Series \"Treasures of the world\". It was in 1885 that Alexander III approached Peter Carl Faberge to make an Easter gift for his wife - an ornate egg with a surprise inside that would begin a tradition that lasted until the end of the Romanov Empire. Commissioned by the Tsar, Faberge became the royal supplier for Alexander III and continued to supply them to his son, Nicholas, after the death of Alexander in 1894. Through this lucrative connection Faberge received international attention and made his way into many households as the form of a royal gift. Many of the 50 + eggs are discussed in detail as well as put into the context of imperial privilege. Particular emphasis is placed on the relationship between the eggs and the Romanov dynasty, with the fall of the Romanov empire ceasing production of the Faberge eggs, causing Faberge to flee the country and the fate of the precious eggs to be scattered across the world."
