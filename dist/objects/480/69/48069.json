        "Structured as a mystery novel in itself, this documentary presented by Agatha Christie biographer, Janet Morgan, attempts to unravel the appeal and inspiration behind the Queen of crime. The program includes interviews with fellow crime writer P.D. James (who is not necessarily a big fan of the writer but can appreciate the \"fairy tale\" aspect to the work), editors, performers, critics and an international vox pop. The program looks at the tenets of Christie's novels and provides solid biographical details to ascertain why she was compelled to write what she did so prolifically. Narrated by Melvyn Bragg."
