        "A classic early SF story of a dehumanised futuristic society in which the workers toil below the ground for the benefit of an elite who live above. Fascinating sequences are woven into the sentimental story of the romance between the son of the city's ruler and a saintly girl from below ground. This version features a new musical soundtrack from 1998 by Peter Osborne."
