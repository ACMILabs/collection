        "When the red carpet is rolled out at the Hotel Bellevue in preparation for the arrival of the Duke of Sultana, it just keeps on rolling. Happy, lively music, continuous action, and a humorous, rhyming text keeps pace with the carpet as it criss-crosses the town and finally arrives at the ferry, just in time for the Duke's arrival. Good for language development. Based on the book of the sane name by Rex Parkin, published in 1948. Suitable for children aged 4-8."
