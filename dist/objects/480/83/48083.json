        "Inspired by an historical figure, \"Wing Chun\" is a martial arts film with an unusual feminist sway. It is 19th Century China, and a group of bandits attacks a remote Chinese village in an attempt to kidnap a beautiful young widow, Charmy. Their plans are disrupted, however, by Yim Wing Chun, a local bean-curd shop owner who also happens to be a master fighter. She defeats the bandits single-handedly, thus infuriating their leader who comes back to the town with a vengeance. The plot thickens with the return of Wing Chun's childhood sweetheart, now also a martial arts master, who returns after a very long absence. He soon falls for Charmy, mistaking her for Wing Chun while at the same time taking Wing Chun for a man. What ensues are some comical manoeuvring and astounding fight sequences which culminate in the final showdown between Wing Chun and the bandits. Cast includes: Michelle Yeoh, Donnie Yen and Tsui Siu Keung. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
