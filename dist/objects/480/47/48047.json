        "This 13 segment video and guidebook dealing with sexual harassment in the work environment has been designed by psychologists, Eve Ash and Peter Quarry. Set in front of a studio audience including expert Barbara Wertheim, Commissioner of Equal Opportunity, and others who work in the area, this program looks at sexual behaviour, legal implications, effects on victims and strategies for deterring unwelcome advances. Includes four dramatisations of a man and a woman in harassment situations with follow-up discussions. Presented by Peter Quarry."
