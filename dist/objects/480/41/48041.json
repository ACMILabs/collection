        "Inspired by the documentary \"Through a blue lens\" (311463) which also features the work of the Odd Squad - Vancouver police officers who, since 1998, have been filming people addicted to drugs. \"Flipping the World\" is a brutally honest look at the world of youth and drug addiction, told by those who have been there. A culturally diverse group of seven high school students meets with members of the Odd Squad. The students talk to the police, then meet young people who are in recovery, and others still struggling with drug addiction. In the process, their views on drugs and the people who use them undergo important shifts. The students become more understanding and empathetic, and they reveal their own drug experiences. An important discussion-starter, \"Flipping the World\" provides a wealth of teaching material for educators and others who work with young people."
