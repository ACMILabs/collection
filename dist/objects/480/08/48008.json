        "Set in New England on an autumn night, this story is about a clever fox who, foraging for food in the village, outwits a farmer to bring a sumptuous meal back to his family in their den. The splendid watercolour illustrations have a light touch, are very expressive and humorous, and convey a wonderful sense of movement. They are used here to create a small film where the story is sung liltingly and clearly by Molly Scott. First the story is sung with most of the book's images, then the song is repeated with the words on the screen to follow/sing along with. A good aid for those wanting to teach the song to children (all seven verses). Based on the book of the same name by Peter Spier which originated from the 1945 Burl Ives adaption of an old folk song. Spier's novel was a Caldecott Honor Book winner in 1962 for best illustration in a children's book. Suitable for children all ages."
