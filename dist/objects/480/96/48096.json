        "The health and vitality of the gull reflect the \"health\" of the Great Lakes. When the gull population diminishes, biologists hasten to discover the reasons. The herring gull on Lake Ontario is in trouble, and so is the water. This film sounds a warning about the pollutants that are being pumped into these waters daily."
