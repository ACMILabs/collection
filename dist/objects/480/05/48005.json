        "Based on the book by Mary Hoffman and narrated by Alfre Woodard. Grace is a dramatic, creative girl who loves stories, whether she hears them, reads them or makes them up. Possessed of a wonderful imagination and a love of make believe, she constantly adopts roles and identities: Joan of Arc, Spider Man, Trojan Horse, Hiawatha, Mowgli, Aladdin, Dick Whittington etc. When her teacher asks who wants to play Peter Pan in the class production, Grace is very keen but dispirited when two classmates tell her she's not eligible because she's a girl and she's black. Inspired by her mother, grandmother -\"you can be anything you want if you put your mind to it\"- and a Trinidadian dancer, she spiritedly auditions, wins the part and shines as Peter Pan. Caroline Binch's radiant watercolour illustrations, the understated simplicity of the script, colloquial dialogue and endearing characters enhance the central positive message of self-affirmation. Suitable for children ages 4-8."
