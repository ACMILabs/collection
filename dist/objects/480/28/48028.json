        "The lives of residents of Loblolly by the Sea are transformed by the discovery of a passionate love letter, written to and from a nameless person. Divorcee Helen McFarquar (Kate Capshaw), first to read the letter begins a steamy romance with the much younger Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) who helps out in the bookstore where she works. The awakening of dormant feelings questions her to re-assess her relationship to George (Tom Selleck), an old friend from the past who has always been in love with her but lacks the eloquence and poetry of the letter. As the letter changes hands to Helen's friend and co worker (Ellen DeGeneres), the local policeman, it alters their lives and those around them indelibly, and as Helen's distant mother arrives back to Loblolly from overseas she discovers they have more in common than she realised. Cast also includes Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan. Based upon the novel by Cathleen Schine."
