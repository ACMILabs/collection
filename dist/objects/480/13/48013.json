        "Max is a musical hippo - \"you name the instrument, and Max can play it\". Max practiced a vast variety of instruments, much to the annoyance of his father and the neighbours. Only Max's mother loved the constant stream of music, which finally stopped at night when everyone had to go to sleep. One day, Max wakes up, and decides that he is not in the mood to play or practice any more. At first, everyone is relieved to finally have some peace and quiet, but gradually the silence starts driving Max's father crazy. Eventually, the neighbours find a solution to the problem, and Max gets his groove back in a spectacular fashion. From the book by Robert Kraus, illustrated by Jose Aruego and Ariane Dewey."
