        "In a pool room in downtown New York, down and outers are playing pool - some are sniffing cocaine and the theme song \"Some are going to win, some are going to lose\" is playing. This film is about drug addiction with the main story focusing on one particular addict, his habits, his pyschological and physiological state and the doctor who is attempting to rehabilitate him. A poignant story."
