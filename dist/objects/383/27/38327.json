        "Episode number 17 of Series \"Principles of accounting\". Long-term assets are those assets which will remain on a company's balance sheet for more than one year. They include tangible plant, natural resources and intangible assets, such as intellectual property. Each of these categories has their own accounting methods and this program looks at accounting procedures for tangible assets - plant, equipment, property, etc. Thomas Casey explains five different depreciation methods: straight-line depreciation, sum of the year's digits, double declining balance, units of production method and government methods, and the circumstances in which each method is best used."
