        "Episode number 16 of Series \"Principles of accounting\". Part two of inventory accounting, deals with the difference between the cost of inventory and the value of inventory. Cost is a fixed amount but value can change according to physical condition, market changes in demand and obsolescence. This program details ways of estimating this value for accounting purposes and how inventory records can be adjusted to accommodate fluctuations in value."
