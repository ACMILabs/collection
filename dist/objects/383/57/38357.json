        "Unfolding against the rolling contours of the beautiful Ulster coastline Thaddeus O'Sullivan's film is a brooding and stunningly photographed drama of broken taboos within the harshly repressive atmosphere of a turn-of-the-century Presbyterian community. Sarah is the servant girl left alone on the Echlin farm with brothers Hamilton and Frank. Her subsequent pregnancy outrages local minister Sorleyson when she refuses to name the father or marry either of the two men. But can she find a way of living with the consequences that neither ostracises the family completely nor runs against her steadfastly independent principles."
