        "As fourteen of Shakespeare's sonnets are being read we watch a young man isolated in a landscape of fierce physical terror. It is his confrontation with another man - at first antagonistic, then hesitant, and finally sexual - which liberates the man and his environment: rocks turn to water, physical struggle turns to creativity. This beautifully shot experimental film is a love poem dedicated to the artist's muse; this time the love celebrated is between men and the artist's liberation is defiantly homoerotic. The sonnets are read by Judi Dench. The atmospheric music score is by the avant-garde British group Coil."
