        "This thriller stars Lindsay Crouse as a successful psychologist and best-selling author of \"Driven: obsession and compulsion in everyday life\" who becomes increasingly drawn into the shadowy underworld of a confidence trickster, Joe Mantegna, and his enigmatic cohorts, discovering that the thrill of the con answers deep-rooted needs unfulfilled by her daily round of listening to other people's problems. Screenplay by David Mamet."
