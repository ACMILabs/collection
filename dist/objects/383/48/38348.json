        "This final part of Bill Douglas' trilogy takes Jamie through adolescence into adulthood, from a children's home to the RAF in Egypt. A brief return to his father's home, where his ideas of attending art school are rebuffed by his stepmother, is followed by various menial jobs, until his conscription into the RAF, where he is befriended by Robert, who introduces him to art and literature and friendship. A subjective epilogue returns to Newcastle, but now the images are bleached out, as if the pain has been washed away, and we are left with the triumphant concluding image of a tree in full bloom."
