        "Huston had for a long time wanted to direct a version of Herman Melville's classic novel. This superbly photographed epic features a thrilling performance by Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab, the man obsessed with killing the white whale which claimed his leg. The meticulous attention that Huston pays to the details of the sailors' lives and work is an apt cinematic rendering of Melville's realist prose. Though much maligned on its initial release, \"Moby Dick\" is now considered a flawed but magnificent achievement by one of America's most famous directors. Also starring Richard Basehart and Orson Welles. The script was co-authored by Huston and Ray Bradbury."
