        "A costume drama about one of the world's most loved composers this film, set in 1741, is about George Frederick Handel's creation of the most popular choral works since that time - The Messiah. This amazing work was completed in three weeks. Wilfred Lawson stars as Handel, and as this beautiful period piece was one of the early Technicolour films to be produced in Britain, it makes for delightful viewing."
