        "Carpenter Craig Savage considers that trimwork, being the most visible part of your house, should get the attention they deserve. As he trims out parts of a house, his step-by-step instructions and trade secrets will guide you on how to achieve professional results. Included in this video are demonstrations on how to make a tight butt, miter or cope joint, negotiate unsquare openings, seat mouldings solidly against bumpy walls and ceilings, extend window and door jambs and fit casing around doors and windows."
