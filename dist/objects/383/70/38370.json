        "The behaviour of the people in the Western World is being altered by an aural weapon devised to subconsciously affect those exposed to it. This artificial product, created by scientists, musicians and marketing experts is called \"Musak\" or \"functional music\". The authors of this film carried out intensive research before making \"Decoder\" as the function of \"musak\" is to stimulate or soothe, enhancing wellbeing by constructing a particular tonal sequence. \"Musak\" by its very nature has an undoubted political significance. This production blends reality and fiction: surreal, metaphorical imagery interwoven with music."
