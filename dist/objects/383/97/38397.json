        "F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece is a story that could only have taken place in the Jazz Age: an era in which recklessness with money, liquor, women and fast cars pervaded the American consciousness. Robert Redford is Jay Gatsby, the dashing, enigmatic millionaire obsessed with the elusive and spoiled Daisy Buchanan (Mia Farrow). The screenplay for this elegant story was conceived with a meticulous concern for language, time and place by Francis Ford Coppola. Cast also includes Karen Black, Scott Wilson, Sam Waterson, Lois Chiles, Bruce Dern, Howard da Silva, Patsy Kensit."
