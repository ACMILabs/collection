        "This film is about a group of people fighting for the preservation of Shoalwater Bay (Queensland). With its sweeping bays, untouched golden beaches, its jungle and rainforest, 200 metre high sand-dunes (purported to be the oldest in the world), Shoalwater Bay is home to a multitude of birds, plants and wildlife. But this is all under threat due to both the Federal and Queensland State Governments issuing exploratory sandmining leases to several Australian and Japanese mining companies - the justification being the potential creation of jobs. However, there are many who would dispute the actual number of jobs which will become available and who argue that this unique part of Queensland's coastline must be preserved at all costs. Produced by Award-Winning Documentary filmmaker, David Bradbury and narrated by Peter Garrett (of Midnight Oil fame)."
