        "Bruno Ganz is Daniel, an angel who flies above the city of Berlin, dreaming of experiencing the mortality of life, of touching flesh. He is entranced by the circus girl Marion (Solveig Dommartin) and an encounter with an ex-angel turned human actor (Peter Falk as himself), convinces Daniel to embrace mortality and seek the woman he loves. Wim Wenders' return to Germany, after his turbulent experiences working in the United States, resulted in this rhapsodaisical, beautiful film which is as much a love poem to the city of Berlin as it is an optimistic celebration of human struggle and endeavour in the decay and confusion of post-war Europe. Elegantly photographed in black and white and in colour, the film features a music score by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Crime and the City Solution and Tuxedo Moon."
