        "This interesting program gives background information to a news story that was run in San Francisco about an artist who maimed himself while pursuing his art. Three artists use shock tactics to get people interested in their performance art. They specifically use machines they have modified or built and fire as part of their art. While working on a piece of art Mark Pauline blew most of his left hand off."
