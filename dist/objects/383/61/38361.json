        "Turn of the tide (80 min): This rarely seen British film, based on the novel 'Three fevers' by Leo Walmsley, was filmed on location at Robin Hood's Bay and Whitby and tells the story of rivalry between two fishing families. It is set in the dramatically beautiful countryside of the Yorkshire coast. \"The Man at the gate\" (48 min): In 1940 Norman Walker put on his sea boots yet again and sent his location team down to Cornwall to shoot exteriors for a film which might have been regarded as a sequel. The story is centred around a fishing family, headed by Wilfrid Lawson."
