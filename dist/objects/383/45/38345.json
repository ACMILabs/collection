        "This is an experimental video. Sound and image do not necessarily correspond. The video moves from realist observation of everyday life to bizarre and surreal flights of fancy. \"Show Me What You Look Like\" is part of an alternative film and video culture which disregards mainstream concerns with narrative, commerce and exposition, and instead is committed to the production of cultural material which is personal, challenging and down-right weird. The electronic music score is by the English band Durutti Column."
