        "Kurosawa's first feature was released under the aegis of Kurosawa's own production company. It is an impressive tale of greed, corruption and revenge and a powerful indictment of the dark side of business and politics with distinct overtones of \"Hamlet\". Stars Toshiro Mifune. Japanese with English subtitles."
