        "The last straw is a beautifully rendered 2D hand-drawn computer animation that follows the 'life' of a humble wax straw from its' manufacture to final use. The animation shows the machinations behind technology, depicting a chaotic world on the verge of self destruction. A mad circus performing \"Globalisation\" is the destination of the final straw, taking centre stage as the eagerly awaited prop. A symbol for archaean technology."
