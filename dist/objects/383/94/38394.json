        "Set in the 1820's, Charles Dickens' Little Dorrit centres upon Arthur Clennam and Amy Dorrit who find love and happiness within Dickens' restrictive environment. Part 1: Nobody's Fault. Arthur is a kind but ineffectual man, bankrupt through speculation and in debtors prison where he encounters Amy whose story is told in Part 2: Little Dorrit's Story. Amy is a tough clear headed seamstress, cheerfully supporting her imprisoned father. Amy works for Arthur's mother whom she discovers has been denying Arthur's rightful inheritance. When her father is released from goal, a twist of fate reunites Amy with her gentle admirer and his fortune. Stars Alec Guiness, Derek Jacobi, Joan Greenwood, Roshan Seth, Cyril Cusak and Sarah Pickering as Little Dorrit."
