        "The first half of this program shows how painters have expressed their ideas about relationships between people, vice, injustice, human folly and achievement. It includes examples of social criticism by Goya, Hogarth, Rivera, David and Shahn. The painter as visionary is examined in the works of Blake, Bosch, Dali, de Chirico and Klee in the second section."
