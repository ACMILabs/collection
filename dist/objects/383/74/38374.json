        "Based on Nelson Algren's gritty novel, \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" is a harrowing story of a young man who is released from prison and is determined to beat his addiction to heroin. But his return to the Chicago slums of his youth, the bitterness of his unhappy marriage, and the temptations of the drug force him back into taking up the habit. Preminger's determination to make the film caused a sensation in Hollywood and the film breached the \"Hays Code\" which meant the film was released without a Seal of Approval by the Motion Picture Assoc. of America. In hindsight the film helped challenge the dominance of the Hays Code and led to American cinema tackling more adult and controversial themes. Technically brilliant and fast-paced, the film features a great central performance by Frank Sinatra as the struggling and confused central character. With Kim Novak. Features a great jazz score and wonderful titles by Saul Bass."
