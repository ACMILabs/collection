        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Video burn\". A collection of contemporary video music clips which explore some of the avant-garde electronic music and performance coming from Great Britain. As the title for the collection suggests, this volume of \"Video Burn\" explores themes of sexuality and transgression. All the video artists involved have attempted to trace modern experimentation with sex, fashion and gender in forms which arise from 19th century popular theatre: the circus, gambling, and pantomime. In \"The Jack Series\", George E. Saxon uses the myth of Jack the Ripper to examine the decadence of Victorian sexuality and how it still resonates today in sado-masochistic imagery; \"Archaos\", by Julie Kuziminska, is a video celebration of the anarchic circus troupe of the same name; and \"Assignation\" is a video performance of an Edgar Allan Poe short story which brings the story's sublimated sexuality to the fore."
