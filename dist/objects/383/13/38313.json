        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Principles of accounting\". This program focuses on the basic \"rules\" of accounting - Debits/ Credits and the basic \"tools\" of accounting - Journals/Ledgers. It is explained and demonstrated by using the basic accounting equation \"assets = liabilities + owner's equity\" how to determine which accounts are involved and then to analyse and record transactions using the Debit/ Credit (or double entry) rule. Journals and Ledgers are the tools for recording transactions, with Journals showing a chronological listing and Ledgers maintaining a running total of transactions in each account. Using the rules and tools of accounting it is shown how to finally produce a Balance Sheet."
