        "Episode of Series \"The Desire to read\". A young frog lives contentedly among the lily pads, plopping a flower over his head to catch a fly and doing an underwater ballet. But his life changes when up swims a witch, who changes him into a handsome prince! Based on the picture book by Elinor Landor Horwitz. Teacher's notes accompany the video."
