        "A three part program which combines traditional animation techniques with special optical effects to produce a dream-like evocation of ancient Egyptian beliefs about the Creation and man's place within it. The use of symbols to recreate the mental and spiritual world of the ancient Egyptians, transports the viewer to a zone which has more in common with Jung than popular notions of the ancient Egyptians. The parts are: \"Dawn: the Creation\"; \"Noon: the year of the king\" and \"Night: the gates of the underworld\"."
