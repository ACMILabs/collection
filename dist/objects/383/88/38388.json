        "Romano's marriage leaves him dissatisfied, until a visit to a spa where he falls in love with a mysterious Russian lady. But when he follows her to Russia, the dream dissolves. Based on Chekhov's classic 'Lady with a little dog', leading Soviet director Nikita Mikhalkov's first film abroad is richly romantic - and ironic. Mastroianni plays the Chekhovian anti-hero to perfection, supported by a magnificent Italian and Russian cast. Mastroianni won the Best Actor award at Cannes in 1987 for his performance. Also stars Silvana Mangano. Italian with English subtitles."
