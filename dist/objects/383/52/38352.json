        "Further explorations in experimental music video from Western Europe. As in the first collection of \"Extreme Art\", these industrial-electronic musicians use sound and images heavily influenced by European surrealism. In this volume many of the contributions show the influence of the acid- house music scene, with a greater use of sampling in the music and a greater reliance on computer animation in the video imagery. The collection spans across punk, industrial music, heavy metal and house to deliver music at the edge of chaos."
