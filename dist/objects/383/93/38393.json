        "The eerie and often disturbing animated films of The Brothers Quay have intrigued audiences around the world both for the extent of imagination they display and their challenge to conventional notions of animation. US born (in 1947) but London based, Stephen and Timothy Quay make the puppets, construct the sets, arrange the lighting and do the camerawork for their mini-masterpieces. Their work is utterly unique and personal yet is, at the same time, suffused with the influence of Eastern European animation, art, literature and music. This compilation contains \"The Unnameable little broom\", \"The Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer\" and their most famous work, \"Street of crocodiles\"."
