        "Old and out of time, the monstrous architecture of the institution forms a world endlessly growing into corridors, courtyards, fire escapes, places of worship and discipline. Moving freely through the building, manipulating his puppets, is an unfeeling and intimidating force - thief who preys upon the inhabitants. The inmates and their world are completely inseparable. One inhabitant is a nurse, numbed and repressed by a place which, she knows, touches and disfigures everything it contains. She becomes obsessed with one of the inmates, a lost and blind archivist, impotent amongst his nightmare relics from ancient dead cultures. In a desperate attempt to form some perfect bond with him, she uses the thief as a go-between to lure him into a secret tryst."
