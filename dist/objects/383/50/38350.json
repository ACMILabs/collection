        "Amidst the mud and blood of Passchendaele in 1917 Private Hamp awaits court martial for desertion. His crime? Simply walking away from the slaughter after three solid years at the front during which all his mates have been killed. Starring Dirk Bogarde, Tom Courtney and Leo McKern. According to Felix Barber of the Evening News, \"This film is not only going to be regarded as one of the half-dozen greatest war films ever made; it is going into the select gallery of screen classics\"."
