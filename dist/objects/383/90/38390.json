        "Out in the sand dunes a woman lives alone at the bottom of a pit. One day the local villagers bring a man to her. He can't escape; gradually the two are drawn to each other. Out of this bizarre, if simple situation, Teshigahara builds an atmospheric, highly charged and remarkably sensual exploration of the human condition."
