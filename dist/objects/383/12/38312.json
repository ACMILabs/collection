        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Principles of accounting\". Accounting processes are similar to the processes of other professions and consist of four stages - identification, analysis, recording and summarising. This introductory program relates these stages to the accounting process, explains the basic accounting formula, assets = liability + owner's equity and introduces the balance sheet, the financial statement and the basic vocabulary of accounting. Hosted by Thomas Casey."
