        "Episode of Series \"Mini dragons. II\". Since the British withdrew from Malaysia in the 50's Malaysia has developed dramatically in an economic sense. Now the government has a thirty year plan, Vision 2020, which seeks to accelerate this development in favour of the native Malays rather than the successful Chinese. The program looks at individuals and their particular problems: a Chinese business man, who is attempting to set up a multi-racial business school, a rubber and oil palm plantation manager who faces the loss of his workforce to the cities, a tribal community who face government takeover of their land, and a young Moslem woman who is attempting to protect from exploitation the young girls recruited from villages to work in the city factories."
