        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Australia at work\". A four part series examining Australians' attitudes to work and to changes in the Australian workplace. The first part of this episode examines the history of industry and labour in Australia, as well as looking at the current diversity of occupations and work throughout the country. Australians involved in unpaid labour are interviewed, particularly women working in domestic labour. The second half of the video examines the difficulties and discrimination encountered by women, migrants, Aborigines and the disabled in the labour market."
