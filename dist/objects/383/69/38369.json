        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Planet earth\". There are only 150 sites world wide for the minerals essential to man and in the past decade we have been made aware that the earth is a closed system and its resources are finite. This program looks at the challenge of finding new sources of these minerals and the highly sophisticated technologies which are employed to do so, and also at how the resources are created."
