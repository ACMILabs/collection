        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Principles of accounting\". Part seven of a series of videos exploring the mathematical, theoretical and practical applications of accounting. In this episode attention is paid to the organisation and record-keeping processes needed for effective financial management. The video begins with a dramatisation of a conversation between a financial consultant and a businessman and then proceeds to offer a methodology for the most effective processing of financial data and information. Combining the use of mathematical formulae and practical \"real life\" examples the videos are of use to students and to the lay business person."
