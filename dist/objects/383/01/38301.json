        "Episode of Series \"Mini dragons. II\". In Thailand sudden economic success has created violence in the streets as a prosperous new middle-class demands democratic reform. Success, however, comes at a heavy price - pollution, an ever-increasing gap between rich and poor, uncontrolled development and destruction of the rainforest. Interviews four individuals who represent different aspects of Thailand's success. A young ethnic Chinese millionairess who builds shopping malls, the Governor of the city of Bangkok, who is trying to solve its horrendous overcrowding problems, a couple of rural peasants forced to work in Bangkok to provide for their son's education and an activist Buddhist monk trying to save the rainforest."
