        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Video burn\". The advent of computer multi-media technology has resulted in a resurgence of the art of animation. This collection of experimental video and music utilises state of the art technology to produce intellectually and visually stimulating pieces which not only celebrate the possibilities of computer generated art, but also pose unsettling questions about the acceleration of technology and information. The videos include: \"A New Life\" (Simon Biggs) which investigates the link between myths of IVF and myths of the Immaculate Conception; \"Torso\" (Leigh Cox); \"Muybridge Revisited\" (Snow); \"Sublime NLV6\" (Gillman); \"Trout Descending a Staircase\" (Hawley), which is a very funny and very perverse thumbing of the nose at the capital-A art world; \"Double Trouble\" (Callas); \"Going for Goldfish\" (Collins/Myers) which pokes gentle fun at the penis; and John Butler's damning and electrifying critique of the new global technocratic future, \"World Peace Thru Free Trade\", which explores the totalitarian nightmares that might be unleashed by the marriage of capitalism and computer technology."
