        "Nothing transforms a room, old or new, like a beautiful wood floor. And with the choice of flooring and rental equipment now available, there's no reason you can't install your own wood floor. In this video, flooring expert Don Bollinger installs oak strip flooring in his own home - complete with uneven floors and walls - showing you step by step how to get professional results safely and efficiently. You'll learn about the types of flooring you have to choose from; how to remove old flooring and prepare the subfloor; how to use power nailers in tight places; how to establish a baseline and lay out your floor; how to lay flooring around awkward spots like hearths and heating ducts; how to allow for seasonal expansion of the floor boards."
