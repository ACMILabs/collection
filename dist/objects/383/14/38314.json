        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Principles of accounting\". This program covers the area of growth and decline in a business, ie. what kinds of transactions cause change in an owner's equity and/ or how money flows through a business every time it does a transaction. It demonstrates the need for recorded information so that all interested parties are aware of the business fluctuations taking place and shows how these changes can be summarised in three financial statements prepared in the following order: Income Statement, Statement of Owner's Equity, Balance Sheet."
