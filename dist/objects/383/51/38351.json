        "Platonov is thirty-five and believes he is a failure. Caught between ex-lovers at a wealthy widow's estate, he recalls youthful ideas while facing present reality. This sparkling adaptation is based on Chekhov's first play 'Platonov', and it reveals the essence of the writer's tragi-comic world. An outstanding cast of leading Russian actors makes it the most idiomatic of all Chekhov films. Russian with English subtitles."
