        "This is a collection of Western European experimental music videos. Featuring collaborations between electronic composers and avant-garde image-makers, the artists in \"Extreme Art\" all share a commitment to an artistic expression the roots of which are to be found in surrealism and dada. The visual work combines computer animation, video collage, and super-8 film to present a menacing vision of technological society at the point of implosion. The music in this video ranges from minimalist electronic experimentation to bizarre combinations of indigenous ethnic music with computer simulated noise; to brooding, menacing industrial soundscapes. Though the artists represented in this music video sampler are all unique from one another, they are all uncompromising in their desire to produce work which unsettles and disturbs. NOTE: SOME OF THE VIDEO IMAGERY MIGHT BE DISTURBING. DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET - SOME VIDEO SEGMENTS ARE DELIBERATELY UNSTABLE."
