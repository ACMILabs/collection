        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Principles of accounting\". This program deals mainly with trade receivables, ie. money owed to a company for goods or services and how to adjust accounts so that the effect of bad debts, which will inevitably occur, can be spread over each accounting period. Two methods of estimating bad debts are explained: the percentage of sales method, based on the income statement, and the aging method, based on the balance sheet and we are shown how to enter these estimates into the company's accounts. Hosted by Thomas Casey."
