        "This is not just another gangster movie, but far more a private obsessional duel, a battle of wills between a smooth-tongued gangster and a fixated cop, which is resolved in terms of individual foibles and motivations. The film deals with a new brand of corporate business-minded gangster. The film's two main characters (Leonard Diamond and Mr. Brown) run along parallel lines: both are haunted by chimeras of innocence, they are both aggressive in the pursuit of their differing ambitions. Stars Cornel Wilde, Richard Conte, Brian Donlevy, Jean Wallace."
