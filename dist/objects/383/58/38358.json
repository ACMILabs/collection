        "In a wonderland populated by an array of superbly animated puppets, steaks crawl, rolls sprout nails and Alice (the only human in the film), not only shrinks, but becomes her own doll. Czech surrealist Jan Svankmajer's definitive version of \"Alice's adventures in Wonderland\" is a distinctive vision which remains true to the absurd and menacing spirit of Lewis Carroll's work."
