        "Rudyard Kipling's classic tale of the orphaned son of a British soldier in India at the time of the British Raj is here brought to the screen with great enthusiasm. Kim and his horseman friend who belongs to the British secret service experience many adventures. These adventures eventually lead him into a friendship with a Buddhist lama in search of the river which sprang from the ground when the Lord Buddha shot an arrow, so he joins him in his quest, as he too searches for his own origins. Stars Peter O'Toole and Bryan Brown."
