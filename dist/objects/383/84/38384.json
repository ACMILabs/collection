        "A compilation of underground filmmaker George Kuchar's \"crazed, revved-up and stripped down melodramas... perverse, funny but strangely poignant.\" Twenty years before \"Blue Velvet\", Kuchar and his twin brother Mike were obsessed with pop culture and kitsch. Part of the New York \"underground\", they were unusual in wanting to make lavish melodramas featuring hand-painted titles, lurid colour and sound, tabloid-type tales, startling hair-dos and vivid costumes."
