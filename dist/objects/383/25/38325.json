        "Episode number 15 of Series \"Principles of accounting\". Inventory accounting involves keeping track of everything that is bought or sold by a company, and as such belongs to the current asset account. Thomas Casey shows the two methods of inventory accounting: the perpetual method, which adjusts the balance every time a transaction is made, and the periodic method, which adjusts the balance at the end of an accounting period. We are also shown how to deal with changing prices, using four different methods: Specific identification method; first in, first out (FIFO) method; last in, first out (LIFO) and the weighted average cost method."
