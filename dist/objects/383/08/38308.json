        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Australia at work\". A four part series examining Australians' attitudes to work and to changes in the Australian workplace. This first episode introduces some key concepts in any discussion of work: labour, division of labour, industry, and industrial relations. Through interviews with a wide cross-section of people the video examines what is meant by work and the work ethic, and examines how people define themselves through work."
