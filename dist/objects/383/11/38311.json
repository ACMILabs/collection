        "Episode of Series \"Australia at work\". A four part series examining Australians' attitudes to work and to changes in the Australian workplace. This final episode examines the increasing impact of technology throughout all Australian industry. Increases in productivity are linked to the growing mechanisation of industries and a resultant change to traditional work practices. As a direct result of increased mechanisation, workers now need to retrain and be educated in using new technologies. Through interviews with employees and management the impact of technology on working life is discussed, as well as the effects technology will have on Australian society in the future."
