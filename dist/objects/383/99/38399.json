        "This is a visual and auditory celebration of a great man and his music! It tells the life story of George Gershwin through the eyes of his friends and colleagues, using archival footage, rare home videos and interviews. The whole life is covered; from inauspicious beginnings as the son of Russian immigrants - Tin Pan Alley - early successes - \"Swanee\" and after - \"Rhapsody in Blue\" - Social success - \"Lady Be Good\"; Partnership with Ira - \"Concerto in F\" - Public and private lives - the great song writer - \"An American in Paris\" - \"Strike up the band\" - Hollywood - \"Porgy and Bess\" - the final years. This film allows great insight into the life of the reclusive composer and is a fitting tribute to the man who revolutionised musical performances by bringing vaudeville to the people in the streets."
