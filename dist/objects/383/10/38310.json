        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Australia at work\". A four part series examining Australians' attitudes to work and to changes in the Australian workplace. This episode examines wealth and the distribution of wealth in Australian society. Though considered a fair and equitable society, the video introduces us to the people who are not involved in \"wealth production\": the unemployed. An examination is made of the social welfare system in Australia and the importance of the Trade Union movement in fighting for the rights and for the safety of organised labour."
