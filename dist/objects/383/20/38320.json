        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Principles of accounting\". Part ten of a series of videos exploring the mathematical, theoretical and practical applications of accounting. This episode concentrates on the internal control of business and the role of special journals and ledgers in this activity. It covers the record-keeping procedures that have to do with a) the sales journal, b) the cash receipts journal and c) the accounts receivable ledger. Combining the use of mathematical formulae and practical 'real life' examples, the videos are of use to students and to the lay businessman."
