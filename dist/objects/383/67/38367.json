        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Planet earth\". Scientists tell us that no human beings have ever experienced the earth's \"normal climate\". Civilisation has flourished in a narrow window between vast ice ages. When will climate change again and why? Are we entering a new ice age, or will the current global warming trend from the greenhouse effect, hold off the inevitable?"
