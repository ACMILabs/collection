        "Episode of Series \"The Desire to read\". Torchy the firefly cannot twinkle like the others. He flashes so brilliantly that, instead of glowing secret messages, he makes the night woods as bright as day. \"Turn off that light!\" the forest creatures demand! Based on the picture book by Bernard Waber."
