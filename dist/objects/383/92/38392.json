        "A puzzle when it first appeared, but now hailed as one of Powell and Pressburger's most suggestive and profound explorations of Englishness, this is a modern-day pilgrimage. Four people, uprooted by the war, are drawn towards Canterbury - and discover what they couldn't find in peacetime. Described by Derek Jarman as English culture dealt with mythically in a very strange way. Stars Eric Portman, Sheila Sim, and Dennis Price."
