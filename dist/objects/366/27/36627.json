        "Following prolonged exposure to the Civil service, embodied by the scheming Sir Humphrey Appleby, now in the exalted position of Cabinet Secretary, Britain's top civil servant, it is as Premier that Hacker begins to find his feet as a man of some importance and to confound those used to manipulating him with such ease. Features three episodes: The key, A real partnership and A victory for democracy."
