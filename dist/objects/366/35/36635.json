        "Laurie Holden (Jack Thompson) is coach of a Victorian Football League (VFL) team that hasn\u2019t won a premiership for 19 years. Club president Ted Parker (Graham Kennedy) brings in a star recruit at great expense, but youngster Geoff Hayward (John Howard) is a major disappointment. As the club loses a string of games, the coach, president, committee members and players start to tear each other apart. Synopsis source: Australian Screen."
