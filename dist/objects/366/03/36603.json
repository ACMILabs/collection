        "Episode of Series \"Hypothetical (Television Program)\". Australian doctors and scientists who have pioneered test-tube baby technology must contemplate a future where men can become pregnant, where parents can choose the sex of their children and where the cure for dread genetic diseases may be found by experiments on human embryos. Geoffrey Robertson's Hypothetical on Science, Sex and Insemination, filmed in the Great Hall of Sydney University in December, 1985, confronts Australia's top scientists, lawyers and religious leaders with the ethical and moral dilemmas of tampering with nature, in a television format which has won international acclaim."
