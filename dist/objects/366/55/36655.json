        "Vali Myers is larger than life, or perhaps it's better to say as large as life. An extraordinary artist and adventurer, her work and philosophies reflect a wild primal spirit that no country or society can contain. At 59, Vali moves between the wilds of her Italian home near Salerno and a hip, limousined, sophisticated life in New York. A leading dancer with a modern dance company at the age of 18, she left Australia for Europe to become a street waif, passing through opium addiction and finally finding relief and peace in her own art. Her flamboyance and her desire to live to the fullest has led her to become a sought after personality."
