        "The time - the early 1930s. The woman - Teresa Hawkins, 20; her occupation University student. Her degree - love. She studies it with a passion. It is all consuming. She is obsessed. In the 1930s women were not supposed to believe in free love and independence. But that doesn't stop Teresa. Helen Buday gives an outstanding performance as a woman years ahead of her time. Sam Neill, Hugo Weaving and Huw Williams play three of the men who become part of her passionate life. Based on the novel by Christina Stead."
