        "The Fourth Man is a supernatural erotic thriller with strong reminders of the work of directors such as De Palma, Bergman, Roeg, Bunuel and Hitchcock. The plot revolves around Gerard Reve, a writer noted for his inability to distinguish fiction from reality - who travels from Amsterdam to lecture to a rather provincial literary circle in a nearby town. He accepts an invitation to spend the night with a beautiful, rich widow. Reve's voyeuristic attachment to the widow aided by his runaway imagination, leads him to the discovery of the widow's mysterious past. Dubbed in English."
