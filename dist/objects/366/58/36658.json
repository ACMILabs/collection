        "Writer/Director/Editor, Dziga-Vertov, was made Head of the Cinema Department of the All Russian Central Executive at the age of 22. His film shows all the tricks of which the camera is capable. Vertov shows Russia as it really is; indeed, the final impact of the film arises from a feeling of participation in life itself as we share the unique vision of the camera-eye."
