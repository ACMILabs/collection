        "Exquisitely, delicately told tale of two beautiful young daughters of a minister, who pass up love and fame to remain in their small Danish village. They grow old, using religion as a substitute for living life ... and then take in Babette, a Parisian refugee, a woman with a very special secret. Babette wins 10,000 francs in a lottery and spends it all on preparing a sumptuous banquet for her Lutheran employers and their friends. Based on a short story by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen). Stars Stephane Audran in the title role with Jean-Philippe Lafont, Jarl Kulle and Bibi Andersson."
