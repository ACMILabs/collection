        "Sloane Square: A Room of One's Own (1976, 9min); This super 8 footage shot in 1976 features Jarman and friends and is an example of his more personal, quasi-diary work. \"Pirate Tape\" (1982, 15 min); A portrait of William Burroughs, filmed during his visit to London in September 1982 for the Final Academy event. \"TG Psychic Rally in Heaven\" Film of \"Throbbing Gristle\" in concert, on 23/12/80, accompanied by three tracks from their \"2nd Annual Report\" album. Experiments with super-imposition and refilming abstract the performance into coloured patterns, drawing attention to the sound track content."
