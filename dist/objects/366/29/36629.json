        "The story of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the longest standing organisation of its kind. Begun during the first World War and still alive all around the world, the WILPF is a testament to women's historic resistance to militarism and oppression. Despite their important place in history, the WILPF's study has, until now, remained buried. \"Crossing Borders\" uncovers this dramatic and forgotten chapter in history."
