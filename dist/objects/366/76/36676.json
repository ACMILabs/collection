        "A Spanish flamenco ballet company is trying to create a dance version of \"Carmen\" out of the Bizet opera, Merimee's story and flamenco guitar music. Choreographer, Antonio, discovers an unknown girl to play the central role, a woman with a husband in prison. He becomes infatuated with her. But soon the legend of \"Carmen\" begins to assert itself."
