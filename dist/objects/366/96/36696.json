        "Brigitte Laurier is the beautiful daughter of the French Premier. When she is found, quite innocently, in bed with Michel, the Premier's principal secretary, a quick marriage seems to be the only solution to save appearances. In this lighthearted French comedy, a royal flirtation may not be the only thing in the way of married bliss. Stars Charles Boyer and Brigitte Bardot. Dubbed into English"
