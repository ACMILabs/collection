        "Maximilian Schell has created a fascinating film, amusing and sad, imaginative and courageously put together. He presents Dietrich as a genuine star to a new generation of moviegoers. Included are scenes from \"Destry Rides Again\", \"Morocco\", \"Witness for the Prosecution\", \"Judgement at Nuremberg\". Dietrich is difficult, forgetful, egotistical, with a unique presence and an unexpectedly forthright manner."
