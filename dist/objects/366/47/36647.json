        "Aimed at the general community and provides factual information about AIDS. What HIV/AIDS is. How HIV is transmitted. How HIV is not transmitted. How to prevent it. What to do if you are worried. Offers a telephone number in each State which people can call for further information. A current affair style approach with animation and graphics is used. It was developed for use by educators but can stand alone as an educational resource if no AIDS educator is available. Presented by Geraldine Doogue."
