        "Tom (Andrew McFarlane) was one of the lucky ones; he returned from the nightmare of Gallipoli - partially crippled, but alive. At a time when his life should be full and happy, he is restless and angry and can't adjust back to his hometown or young wife. Then he meets a free-thinking artist, Alice, and her passion and sexuality shocks everyone in town except Tom, who looks to her for an awakening from his nightmare. Cast includes Sara Kestelman, Andrew McFarlane, Tony Barry and John Bell."
