        "Many older people can play an important role in our community because of their skills, knowledge and experience. However, the media often portray older people as a hidden group. Politically they very often remain the victims despite changing attitudes. \"I Keep Remembering Ita\" presents three distinctive personal portraits of older women with three different approaches to growing older. Each portrait shows older people taking charge of their lives with the help of a positive mental attitude towards themselves and their community."
