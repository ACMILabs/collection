        "Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, starring in their only film together, are superb. The film tells of the lonely owner of a nightclub in Nazi-occupied Casablanca, and of the brief return of his former lover who now works for the resistance. Also stars Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt. An all-time classic."
