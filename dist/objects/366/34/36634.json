        "This play, written by Arthur Miller, is one of the enduring glories of the American theatre. This adaptation was filmed within the confines of a Broadway stage set, thereby enhancing the intimacy of this study of the disintegration of a travelling salesman. Flashbacks are adroitly interwoven with current scenes, providing a build-up to the shattering climax. Cast includes Dustin Hoffman and John Malkovich."
