        "Set in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp towards the end of World War II, the story subtly explores the bonds that develop between men in stressful situations; bonds that often transcend culture and inexplicably, sometimes, even transcend the barriers between captor and captive. Based on a novel by Sir Laurens Van Der Post. Stars David Bowie, Tom Conti, Jack Thompson and Ryuichi Sakamoto Takeshi."
