        "A mythical tale of love, betrayal and revenge, \"Medea\" is a fascinating collision of Freudian and Marxist themes from Italy's most controversial director. Adapted from the Euripidean drama, Pasolini's disturbing vision of personal and national conflict stars operatic legend Maria Callas in the title role, offering an extraordinary performance as the high priestess, Medea, whose love is threatened by corrupt political ambition. A vivid and aesthetically challenging vision, \"Medea\" is a complex blend of classical mythology and contemporary social criticism."
