        "Kagemusha means \"The double\", and refers to the practice used by Japanese warlords of employing others to impersonate themselves during battles. In this film, a thief about to be executed is reprieved and given the task of impersonating one such man. When the latter dies, the impersonation continues, until he is unmasked, whereupon the story moves on to explore the end of a warrior clan. An impressive, lavish work. Also known as \"The double\" or \"Shadow warrior\"."
