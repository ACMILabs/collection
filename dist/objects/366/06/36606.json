        "Far Eastern Cookery is a celebration of the myriad and distinctive flavours of the Far East. This video presents 16 of Madhur Jaffrey's favourite dishes from Thailand, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. Madhur Jaffrey evokes the atmosphere of each exotic country as she invites us to travel with her through the fruit markets of Bangkok to the seafront of Western Sumatra."
