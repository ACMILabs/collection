        "Following his stout stand against Eurosausage, The Rt. Hon. James Hacker PC, Mp, BSc (Econ), being of that simple, direct, noble breed of men called politicians, was propelled along the corridors of power to the very pinnacle of politics - No. 10. Fortunately for the country, his scheming adversary Sir Humphrey - now in the exalted position of Cabinet Secretary - proves more than willing to steer the unsteady ship of state through the perilous waters of government. Features three episodes: The grand design, The ministerial broadcast, The smoke screen."
