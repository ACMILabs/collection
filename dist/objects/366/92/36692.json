        "The lives of Black South Africans in the township of Soweto are the background to this powerful, absorbing and thoughtful film. It is the first international Black African feature film and it was made under the noses of South African authorities, who thought it was a gangster film. Unlike many political films, \"Mapantsula\" is a story viewed through the eyes of an anti-hero, a small time black gangster known to his friends as Panic. Panic is a smooth opportunist who takes down anyone, white or black. In Zulu, Sotho and Afrikaans with English subtitles."
