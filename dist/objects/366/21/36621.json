        "A desolate stretch of earth somewhere in Australia. Two tribes of Aborigines, the Wororas and the Riratjingus, preserve their ancient legends, songs and laws of creation here. Theirs is a struggle for a culture, myths and laws that are the result of 40,000 years of living in the desert. They come into conflict with the laws of modern Australia and the interests of a large company that works to mine uranium in one of their holy places, the place where the Green Ants dream."
