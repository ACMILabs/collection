        "Rebel (Matt Dillon) has done enough. He wants out. The war has taken its toll; it's wounded him, confused him and now it has sickened him. Rebel is deserting. He is on leave in Sydney, Australia. A guy called Tiger Kelly can arrange passage on a cargo ship back to America. All it takes is money. But that's not a problem because Rebel wants to get home - whatever the price. Rebel is now a runaway, a fugitive. His fate is sealed. If he gets caught he gets shot. What Rebel needs is a place to hide out. Kathy (Debra Byrne) has that place."
