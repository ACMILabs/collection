        "The Gospel According to St Matthew is a startlingly visual rendering of the biblical story of Christ. Acted entirely by non-professionals, Pasolini's adaptation blends breath-taking photography with an astounding musical score (from Bach to Billie Holliday) to create a unique vision which is both profoundly religious and forcefully political. Original title: Il Vangelo Secondo Matteo. In Italian with English subtitles."
