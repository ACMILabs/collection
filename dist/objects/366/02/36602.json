        "Paradise Camp is the story of Theresienstadt, the concentration camp which became the so-called `Model Jewish community', a macabre showpiece for the Red Cross and the world. The Nazis turned Theresienstadt into a smiling mask to distract the world from Auschwitz and the death camps. They called it the Paradise Camp. Survivors now living in Australia tell of how they were forced to take part in the bizarre `Great beautification' and witnessed the making of a propaganda film by which the Nazis hoped to fool the world about their Final Solution to the Jewish Problem. The survivors also describe the emergence of a remarkable culture in the camp, a victory of the human spirit. It is brought to life by photographs and by the startling picture-journalism of the famous artists of Theresienstadt, whose works have been located for the film in museums around the world."
