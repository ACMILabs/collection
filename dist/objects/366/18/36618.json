        "A passage to a land of spell binding mystery, of painful paradox and magnificent splendours. The enigma which is India enticed a young Englishwoman, drew her with an attraction which became an obsession - an obsession which caused an echo which would reverberate through the whole sub-continent. What happened that day in the Caves of Marabar would change her life - and haunt India forever. Based on the novel by E. M. Forster. This recent production stars Judy Davis, Peggy Ashcroft, Alec Guinness, Victor Bannerjee, James Fox and Nigel Havers."
