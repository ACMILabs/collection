        "This first film by one of Britain's most acclaimed theatrical creators already contains the seeds of such later successes as \"Abigail's Party\" and \"High Hopes\". A tippling spinster, a tongue-tied schoolteacher and a would-be pop star from Scunthorpe are just some of Mike Leigh's brilliantly conceived gallery of suburban types, living lives of quiet desperation and frequent absurdity. Beneath the acid wit, there is also sympathy and a disturbing vision of Britain's repressive society."
