        "Adaptation of John Steinbeck's famous novel. The dramatic story of the Joad family and their migration to California from their dust-bowl farm in Oklahoma during the Depression. An observance of America during a difficult era, the film reveals considerable compassion for poor, honest people struggling for dignity against seemingly insurmountable odds. Stars Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and Charley Grapewin."
