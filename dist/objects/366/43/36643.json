        "This film follows the development of the musical \"Les Miserables\" which has become a triumph the world over. When it opened in London in October 1985, at the Barbican Theatre, it opened to mixed reviews, but went on to silence the critics and is now one of the most successful musical shows of all time. \"Les Miserables\" is either in production or development in over seventy cities of the world. The success continues. A symphonic recording of the complete score is being released worldwide and a film version of the musical is in development. Using performance footage from the London, Oslo, Budapest and Viennese productions, this program celebrates this phenomenal success and discusses its progress with its writers, directors and producers."
