        "This is a perversely hilarious comedy about one restless night (among many) in the fading life of an ageing, over-sexed novelist, Clive Langham. Clive lives alone in a country mansion and spends his nights cursing his fate as he inserts suppositories, sits on the \"throne\" and downs bottle after bottle of white wine. A well acted study in the lack of communication. Stars Sir John Gielgud, Dirk Bogarde and Ellen Burstyn."
