        "Judy Davis stars as Nina Bailey, an investigative lawyer on the threshold of a dynamic career. Everything is going in her favour it seems, until she moves into an exclusive seaside apartment. The tranquil view from the apartment becomes a window onto her past; a past that threatens to be her executioner; a past full of secrets concealed from her all her life; secrets about Georgia, a woman she has never known. Also stars John Bach and Julia Blake."
