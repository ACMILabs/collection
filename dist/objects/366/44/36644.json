        "Such is life is a biographical retrospective of Sidney Nolan's life and work, told in a modern-day journey from Ireland to England, Hong Kong and Australia. Filmed against a background of Sidney Nolan's past and current projects, it includes the designs for a new opera production for the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, a large graphic suite on themes relevant to Australia's Bicentennial during 1988 and exhibitions of his new work in London and Hong Kong."
