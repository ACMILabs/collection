        "Senso means \"War\". \"Senso daughters\" is an account of the experience of Papua New Guinean and Japanese women in the South Pacific during World War II. A unique film in that it critically looks at the effect of the war not only on the indigenous culture but also on the Japanese people. Anti-war sentiment has never been tolerated within Japanese culture. For director, Noriko Sekiguchi, the film is very much a personal statement with a global message. Not only does the film critically question the war-time decisions of the late Emperor Hirohito, but it also makes public for the first time some startling information. The Japanese army took \"comfort women\" when they were occupying a new territory. The army prostitutes were conscripted from Korean and poor Japanese women and shipped to military bases in Rabaul."
