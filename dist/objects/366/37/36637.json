        "Cocteau's retelling of the classic \"Beauty and the Beast\" is addressed to \"what remains of the child in all of us\", but by avoiding all whimsy and sentimentality its appeal is universal. The Beast becomes another poetic figure in Cocteau's personal mythology, while his enchanted castle is evoked by some of the most startling imagery in cinema history - worthy of comparison with Murnau's haunting \"Nosferatu\". Cocteau's fairytale set standards in fantasy which few other filmmakers have reached. The sequences in the enchanted castle are pure magic. Cast includes Josette Day and Jean Marais."
