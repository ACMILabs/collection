        "Why do we see those with whom we are in conflict as monstrous and inhuman enemies? Recent events such as the fundamentalist Muslim death threats to Salman Rushdie or the upsurge of racist violence in Australia, raise questions about what drives nations and individuals to make monsters out of those they perceive as enemies. Faces of the Enemy is a fascinating yet disturbing film which presents a vivid picture of the ways in which societies create an image of the enemy, then become obsessed with this image to the point of being prepared to kill without guilt. In a chilling series of images we see the enemy depicted as demons, barbarians, madmen or vile animals to be exterminated without regret. Presented by Sam Keen"
