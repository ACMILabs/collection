        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Anger Magick Lantern Cycle\". Short films : \"Kustom Kar Kommandos\" (1965, 3 min): A young man strokes his customised car with a powder puff. \"Pygmalion and his machine mistress.\" \"Puce moment (1949, 6 min): A lavishly coloured evocation of the Hollywood now gone, as shown through an afternoon in the milieu of the 1920s film star. \"Scorpio rising\": A death mirror held up to American culture - Brando, bikes and black leather; Christ, chains and cocaine. A high view of the myth of the American motor cyclist. The machine as totem from toy to terror. Thanatos in chrome and black leather and bursting jeans."
