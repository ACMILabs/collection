        "Henrik Ibsen's stage classic of Nora, a Norwegian girl who struggles to make a success of a doomed marriage. The film chronicles Nora's married life to Torvald, from her initial excitement of spending her life with him to the realisation that the marriage is a failure. In \"A Doll's House\", Nora's affections and dependence move from her father to her husband. Through a number of personal experiences she realises that she has accepted without question the rules and conventions regarding a wife and woman's conduct, that she has acted like a doll child then a doll wife, not asked or persuaded to have opinions and judgement. Stars Jane Fonda, David Warner and Trevor Howard."
