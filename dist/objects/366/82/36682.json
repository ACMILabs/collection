        "Jean-Paul Belmondo is a good-hearted thief operating in 18th century Paris. He teams up with Venus, a gipsy pickpocket (Claudia Cardinale), overthrows the leader of the pickpocket gang (Marcel Dalio) and turns it into a crime syndicate that gives the fancy baubles of the rich to the poor. \"Cartouche\" encompasses tragedy, farce and violence in a popular, high-flown adventure."
