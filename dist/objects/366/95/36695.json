        "A superb stylised fairy tale. A young ballerina is torn between two creative, possessive men, one a struggling composer, the other an autocratic dance impresario. Still revered as the greatest dance film ever made and a landmark film for its integration of dance in storytelling and a perennial favourite of balletomanes. With choreography by Robert Helpmann, it was originally intended to star Merle Oberon but features the dazzling debut of Scottish-born Moira Shearer and Marius Goring as the romantic lead. She partners Robert Helpmann in a famous 14 minute ballet based on a Hans Christian Anderson fairytale about a magical pair of shoes. This film has inspired generations of aspiring dancers and will continue to do so. (Awards: Winner of Academy Award for Music)."
