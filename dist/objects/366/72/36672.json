        "I love old radio stories, and I know a million of them. I've collected them down through the years like a hobby. Anecdotes, gossip and inside stories about the stars. Plus I recall so many personal experiences, from when I grew up, listening to show after show. Now it's all gone, except for the memories. Let Woody Allen take you back to the golden era of the radio days. Linking a number of colourful radio stories with a delightful look at his own childhood, the writer-director recreates a lost era. Discover the Masked Avengers horrible secret! See how a beautiful blonde cigarette girl goes on to find stardom! And how some burglars win the star prize on radio \"Guess that tune\" for their unsuspecting victims!! Allen's ensemble of actors includes Mia Farrow, Diane Keaton, Julie Kavner and Dianne Wiest."
