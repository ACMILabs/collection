        "This samurai film, in which a shabby warrior helps young clan members root out corruption among the elders of their clan is a kind of sequel to \"Yojimbo\" with excellent fighting sequences and effective moments of humour. Toshiro Mifune reprises his role as the 'man with no name' from the earlier film. He is a shambling, scratching, bedraggled character described by many critics and a cross between Robin Hood and John Wayne, with a touch of Humphrey Bogart thrown in. With a heady blend of traditional Japanese theatrical conventions and the language of Western film-making this is a masterpiece of comedy-drama. Cast also includes Masao Shimizu and Tatsuya Nakadai. Also available on DVD [319260]."
