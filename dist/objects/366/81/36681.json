        "Meticulously restored and accompanied by an authoritative commentary and period music, this program includes events captured on film by Australia's first permanent Film Unit, the Salvation Army's Limelight Department, Ballarat's first Film Unit (producer of Australia's first provincial newsreel, Pathe's Ballarat Gazette), the Commonwealth Government's chief cinematographer, Bert Ive; and amateur cine enthusiasts of the 1930s. Film historian, Chris Long, researched this video and prepared the commentary for the National Film and Sound Archive. It is one of a series of video which brings history to life while giving public access to Australia's heritage of actuality and documentary film."
