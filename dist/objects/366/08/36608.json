        "The story of the love affair of John Reed and Louise Bryant in a war-torn world and how the Russian Revolution shook their lives. Warren Beatty is John Reed, American Communist, journalist and activist who was buried in the Kremlin Wall. Diane Keaton is Louise Bryant, writer and feminist, whose love for Reed carries her across continents. Jack Nicholson is Eugene O'Neill, America's greatest playwright, whose life intertwines romantically with Bryant's. Maureen Stapleton portrays anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman, and Jerzy Kosinski plays Bolshevik leader Gregory Zinoviev."
