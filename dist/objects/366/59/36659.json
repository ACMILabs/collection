        "Wharfies traces the history of the Australian Waterside Workers Federation from its foundation in 1902, under Billy Hughes, to the present day. Made in the tradition of the Waterside Workers Film Unit of the 1950s, \"Wharfies\" covers important historical events including industrial milestones, political crises and the stories of the men themselves. This film is pieced together through dramatised sequences, interviews with veteran wharfies and rare archival footage. Cartoons, news clippings and old photographs all help to tell the story."
