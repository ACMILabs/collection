        "A son's loving obsession with his mother turns to patricide and incest in this intricate exploration of what Freud has termed \"the Oedipus complex.\" Pasolini's powerful adaptation of Sophocles' play is a unique voyage of psychological discovery which blends the director's personal history with the timeless themes of mythology. Filmed amidst the atmospheric setting of the Moroccan desert and modern Bologna, \"Oedipus Rex\" is a startling visual achievement, boasting an extraordinary central performance by Franco Citti as the tortured Oedipus."
