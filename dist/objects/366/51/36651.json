        "Laurence Olivier directed this Shakespearian spectacular, timed for victory, and also starred in it. The method of starting in the Globe Theatre, moving gradually into reality for the battle and then returning was controversial, but in general the production could not have been more splendid. Leslie Banks, Robert Newton and Leo Genn stood out in a remarkable cast and the Agincourt charge sequence is justly famous. Music by William Walton."
