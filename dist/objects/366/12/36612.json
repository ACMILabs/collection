        "Set in a Latin American prison during a military dictatorship, this film explores the relationship that develops between two cellmates: a left wing journalist (Raul Julia) and a homosexual window dresser (William Hurt). To entertain his cellmate during the monotony and horror of prison life, the latter recreates stories from his favourite 1940's movies. Based on the novel by Manuel Puig, the film features William Hurt's Oscar winning performance."
