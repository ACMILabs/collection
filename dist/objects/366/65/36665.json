        "Episode of Series \"Hypothetical (Television Program)\". The Minister for Enterprise has a pet Bicentennial project: he wants to build the fastest train in the world, to service marginal electorates on its run from Sydney to Canberra. Businessmen and lobbyists share his enthusiasm for the supertrain but his Department head has reservations which the Press and the Parliamentary Opposition are keen to exploit! Moderator: Geoffrey Robertson."
