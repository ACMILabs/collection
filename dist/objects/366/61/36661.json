        "Better known under the title \"Storm over Asia\", this exotic film is a remarkable drama of British Imperial intrigue in Mongolia in the civil war days of 1920. Valeri Inkijinov plays a young Mongolian trapper ostracised from his village after he is cheated out of a valuable fox fur by a European trader. Becoming a Soviet partisan, the trapper is thrust into prominence when it is learned that he is descended from Genghis Khan. The occupying English army (identified as the White Russian army in foreign prints of the film) puts the trapper in charge of a puppet Mongolian government. By film's end, however, the \"puppet\" has cut the strings in a spectacular fashion. In Russian with English subtitles."
