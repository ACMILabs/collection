        "If you really want to stop smoking, this video is for you. We can't promise it will be easy, but if you have the desire, then here is the motivation, confidence, will-power and support you need to stop and stay stopped. This step-by-step programme answers your questions, gives firm advice, and most of all, gives support - support when your willpower flags, when the craving becomes unbearable, when you feel like giving in. Even when your guard slips and you accidentally take a cigarette, it will cheer you up, prop you up, and keep you going. Kick the habit with us and begin a healthier and happier life today."
