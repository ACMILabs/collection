        "It is 1917...the brink of the Russian Revolution. American journalist John Reed is there to write about it, to love it, and survive it, if he can. Now, almost 70 years later, and at a cost of over $50 million, the event has become a spectacular motion picture. Shot entirely on location in Russia, including magnificent scenes inside the Winter Palace, and with the entire Russian 3rd Army as extras, master filmmaker Serghei Bondarchuk has created one of the most spectacular motion pictures ever filmed."
