        "Commissioned to mark the tenth anniversary of the concentration camps' liberation, \"Nuit et Brouillard\" (English title \"Night and Fog\")is one of the most respected documentaries in world cinema. From the post-war ruins of Auschwitz, seen in elegiac colour, to its horrifying past, recorded in stark black and white, Resnais' film pursues the question which still haunts us today: do we share the guilt for those deported, tortured and killed? Jean Cayrol's moving commentary challenges us not to forget, to \"look around and hear people crying endlessly?\" For a few hours, the film wipes out the memory of all other films. It must be seen. Features photography by two of France's most renowned cinematographers, Ghislain Cloquet and Sacha Vierny. Music by Hanns Eisler, assistant director Chris Marker."
