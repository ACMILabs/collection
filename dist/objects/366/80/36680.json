        "This video explains the background, motivations and dilemmas of people seeking professional counselling. It moves from the counselling session to the social context, allowing the viewer time to reflect on the psychological, social and political factors involved. For the professional helper this reflection can lead to new insights into often familiar situations. This holistic overview is an invaluable guide to those involved in analysis and intervention in a wide range of client problem areas. Areas covered include old age, racial harassment, bereavement, homosexuality, single parenthood and disability."
