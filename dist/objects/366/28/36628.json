        "Blanche Dubois, a faded Southern belle whose fortunes have crumbled to nothing, comes to New Orleans to stay with her sister, Stella. Stella's husband, the brutish but magnetic Stanley Kowalski is suspicious of her past and puts in train a devastating chain of events which will finally destroy for all time Blanche's already tenuous grasp on the world of reality. Stars Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando. Based on the play by Tennessee Williams. Also stars Karl Malden."
