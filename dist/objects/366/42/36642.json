        "Two corpses on the Naples quayside lead Guy Van Stratten into the bizarre world of Mr Arkadin, a fabulously rich tycoon with a beautiful daughter and a shady past, which he claims to have forgotten. Van Stratten is hired to investigate - with murderous results. Welles' second European film returned to the fascination with total power which had made \"Citizen Kane\" his youthful masterpiece. Arkadin is closer to Harry Lime than to Kane, because he is a profiteer ... who nourishes himself on the corruption of the universe. Stars Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Akim Tamiroff."
