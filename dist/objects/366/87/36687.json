        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Anger Magick Lantern Cycle\". Fireworks (1947, 14 min): A dissatisfied dreamer awakes, goes out in the night seeking a light, and is drawn through the needle's eye. He returns to a bed less empty than before. \"Rabbit's Moon\" (1950, 7 min): A fable of the unattainable (the Moon) combining elements of Commedia dell'arte with Japanese myth. A lunar dream utilising the classic pantomime figure of Pierrot in an encounter with aprankis, enchanted Magick Lantern. \"Eaux D'Artifice\" (1953, 13 min): Hide and seek in a night-time labyrinth of levels, cascades, balustrades, grottoes, and ever gushing leaping fountains, until the water witch and the fountain become one."
