        "Photographs and newsreel shots are used in documenting the highlights of the life of Mohandas Gandhi, India's political and spiritual leader. Traces Gandhi's efforts to gain freedom for his people - the \"homespun\" program which stimulated production; the march to the sea in 1930 to protest against oppressive British excise taxes on salt; the movements to free the ostracised untouchables and to give women political equality. Discusses the effectiveness of Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance."
