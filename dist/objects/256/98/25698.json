        "The work of Thomas Hart Benson, one of America's modern painters, is studied in detail as he executes a 22 ft mural entitled \"Achelous and Hercules\" in a Kansas City women's store. The process of making a mural is followed from the time of the artist's original conception of the subject until the mural is completed on the walls."
