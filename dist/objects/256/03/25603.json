        "An amusing and well made cartoon, light heartedly pouring scorn on our feeble efforts throughout the centuries to keep warm and resist the hardy since it can be used in so many forms and the widest range of heating systems. Blends animation and live action in an incisive and witty manner which can be enjoyed as much for its vigorous invention as for the precision of its technique."
