        "Part 3 of the series \"Macbeth: a director's interpretation\". This episode analyses the character of Macbeth to indicate that within every human being is a terrible lust for violence. It emphasises the capacity for good and evil within the same human heart portraying a sense of tragic loss in the character of Macbeth. We cannot hate him for there remains something sublime in him. Narrated by Douglas Campbell. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
