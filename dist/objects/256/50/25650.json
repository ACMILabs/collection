        "The reigns of William the Conqueror, Henry I, Stephen of Bois, Henry Plantagenet and Richard the Lionheart are dramatised in this film which traces the history of England from the Norman invasion in 1066 to the crowning of King John in 1199. The background of feudalism - against which the drama of English kings and barons was portrayed - sets the scene for the famous meeting at Runnymede which resulted in Magna Carta. The film was shot as far as possible on the actual locations of these historical events."
