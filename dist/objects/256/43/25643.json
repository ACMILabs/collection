        "An interesting film from an historical point of view taking into account what we now know about the dangers to humans from breathing in or working around asbestos. At the time this film was made (1959), Canada was a major source of the world's supply of asbestos. In the Province of Quebec, where the largest deposits were located, thriving communities grew up around the extraction and processing of asbestos. We see a typical town, Thetford Mines, and all the stages the fibrous rock goes through from mine to mill."
