        "Discussion film for adults on parental authority and teenagers. When a high-school girl declares her preference for going to a gathering of her own friends rather than to a family gathering, she runs headlong into her parent's objections. It is their decision and not hers which is to abide. The result is a clash of wills. The question of what might have been a better approach is left with the film audience."
