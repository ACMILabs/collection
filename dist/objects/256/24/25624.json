        "Born in Glasgow in 1868, Charles Rennie Mackintosh was one of the first pioneers of modern design and architecture. Combining Scottish, Japanese and English influences, he created styles and designs which were not just ahead of his time but ones which stand the test of time. His contribution to the world of art and design is now recognised internationally. This documentary traces his career from his early paintings to his architectural commissions and the final landscapes. Mackintosh's work was a complete reversal of contemporary design, he made decoration intrinsic to the whole."
