        "On-the-job pictures show how a worker's strength is taxed by badly located and incorrectly designed controls on machine shop equipment. The following three principles are elaborated: 1. Locate the machine control so that the operator can maintain normal posture and is not required to work within a dangerous area. 2. Design controls so that unnecessary motions are eliminated from the operations cycle. 3. Design the controls so that necessary motions are within the normal work area."
