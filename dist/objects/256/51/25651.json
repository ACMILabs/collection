        "During the reigns of strong kings, the Crown had tremendous power; but when a weak king was on the throne, the barons asserted their rights. This film dramatises the events after the crowning of John which brought the conflict between kings and barons to a climax and resulted in the signing of the Magna Carta. Shows the discontent of the nobles over severe taxations and encroachment on their feudal rights, and the reaction of the Church to restriction of its established liberties. States the chief results of the Charter and its basis in constitutional policy."
