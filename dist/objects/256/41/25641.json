        "The work of Robert Gilbert, sculptor, we hear his voice as the camera examines his work, his tools and the leftover junk and objects which he assembles into his colourful kinetic sculpture. We see the work displayed in various places - on a truck riding along the freeway - in an elevator and in one painful sequence at Century Plaza, Los Angeles where we see \"MACHINE JUNE 23\", work which commemorates the brutal confrontation between police and demonstrators on that day."
