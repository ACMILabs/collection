        "In this film, young people talk about the perceived irrelevance of school and a teacher explains a work experience program. Also, some teachers discuss what they can do to make the school curriculum relevant to the students they teach, especially in disadvantaged areas where school material often does not reflect the realities of the immediate environment."
