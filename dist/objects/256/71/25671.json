        "A young actress makes up as a young girl, Becky Thatcher, and as an elderly spinster, Aunt Polly, for stage presentation of Tom Sawyer. Authenticity of characters achieved by make-up demonstrates complete severance from the normal appearance of an actress. Base, shadows, rouge, pencil and brush lines, and lines of age and highlighting are clearly shown in practical, useful study."
