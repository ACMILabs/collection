        "Traces the discovery of magnetic properties from natural loadstone to the researches of Oersted and Faraday leading to the theory of lines of force and the magnetic field. Explains paramagnetism and diamagnetism in terms of the behaviour of atoms and mentions the domain theory of ferromagnetism. Experiments are performed which confirm the theory in practical terms."
