        "An interpretation of characters. Are the witches goddesses of fate, wicked old hags, or figments of Macbeth's imagination? How does Macbeth remain a tragic hero when he is portrayed as a brutal murderer? Is Duncan a wise monarch, or an arrogant, corrupt and senile old man? What is the relationship among the main characters?"
