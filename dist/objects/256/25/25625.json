        "Mac Armstrong of Warweig, New Brunswick, single handedly runs a water-powered sawmill built back in 1909. While focussing on Mac and his mill, the film touches on other issues such as balanced economy and the intelligent use of natural resources. The film also proves that what worked half a century ago can work today and yield a decent livelihood."
