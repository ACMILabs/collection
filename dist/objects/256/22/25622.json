        "What do a dentist, an organization of religious crusaders, and a clairvoyant called \"Redhead\" have in common? Little except they are tenants of the McIntyre Block, an office building constructed in 1898 and still occupying an important corner of downtown Winnipeg. Every city has its \"McIntyre Block\" - buildings whose usefulness has long passed, and which will eventually disappear under the wrecking ball."
