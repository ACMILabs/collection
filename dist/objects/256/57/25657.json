        "The film demonstrates a few basic facts about bar magnets and their behaviour. Their father explains to Bob and Betty the difference between temporary and permanent magnets. The two children then learn that: like poles repel and unlike poles attract each other; that a suspended bar magnet acts like a compass needle; and that the magnetic force of a magnet will go through paper and glass."
