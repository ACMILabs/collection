        "Considers the problems that management faces in its approach to the human and financial facctors involved in technological progress. To what extent can unemployment be relieved by seeking larger markets, by adjustment of prices, wages, and dividends? How can management co-ordinate its own long-term self-interest with the needs of the workers and the consumer? Instead of attempting to answer these questions, the film poses them against the background of managerial organisation, asking the audience not to overlook the realities involved."
