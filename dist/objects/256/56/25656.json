        "Magnetosphere is a relatively new scientific term, which has been given two meanings: 1. The region of space in which geomagnetic field forces exert a dominant influence upon the motion of charged particles. 2. A similar region surrounding other planets. The purpose of this film is to define its meaning and to describe the efforts of scientists to establish more accurate concepts about it and its significance."
