        "A young actor makes up as Tom Sawyer, a teenage character, and immediately follows with Muff Potter, the tramp of great age and general decrepitude. Shows how make-up, effectively handled, eliminates \"type casting\" and permits allocation of parts based on talent without need to consider physical similarities. Detailed steps from base to greying hair and whisker application covered."
