        "This film recounts the early history of Victoria's National Gallery, and illustrates the important role of the Felton Bequest, established in 1904, in laying the foundations for the gallery's collection, and depicts some of the principal masterpieces. Finally Eric Westbrook, the gallery director, talks about the need for a new gallery, and architect Roy Grounds, discusses his aims in the design of the Arts Centre. Photographed by Nigel Buesst, music by George Dreyfus and written by Tim Burstall."
