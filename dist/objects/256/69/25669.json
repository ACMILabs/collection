        "Episode number 2 of Series \"What Do You Think\". A film designed to provoke discussion on the question of whether the elected representative of a group may legitimately support a measure which is disliked by the majority of electors. A situation is presented in which a class of high-school students voice their disapproval of the support given by their student council representative to a measure curtailing their extracurricular activities. In defending her action the representative gives adequate reasons for her support of the measure. The audience is invited to express its opinions."
