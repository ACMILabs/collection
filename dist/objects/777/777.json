        "Using excerpts, shots and screen tests from pornography produced in Eastern Europe and Russia, this startling documentary refutes the libertarian aesthetics of much of western queer politics. By forcing us to contemplate the faces of the young male models, it reminds us that even with the fall of communism, materialism and history still have a place in our thinking about film."
