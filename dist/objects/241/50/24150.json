        "The Housing Commission of Victoria has a huge project at Holmesglen, a suburb of Melbourne, for the manufacture of prefabricated houses. All components of a modern house or a block of flats are constructed at this factory and transported in bulk to the place of erection. Concrete walls, chimneys, fences, tiles for roofs, plumbing units, wooden door cupboards and other fittings are all shown under construction and are then shown being fitted into place as the house is erected. Credit is given to the research work being carried out by the CSIRO Building Research Division, particularly in regard to a new type of light weight concrete which has been developed there."
