        "A graphic record of moving pictures from the first glimmer in the mind of men to the film as we know it today, and maybe as we will know it tomorrow. A cartoon based on facts, it depicts the cave artist; the invention of the motion picture camera; the silent era to the talkies; the impact of television; and the motion picture industry's effort to combat it by widening the screen and eventually evolving a circular screen. Credits include: animation by Harold Whitaker, John Smith; story by John Halas, Nicholas Spargo; photography by Bill Taylor, Roy Turk; music by Jack King and commentary by Maurice Denham."
