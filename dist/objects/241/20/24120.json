        "Bozetto claims that it was lightning that first showed man the wonders of fire and set him on the hazardous path of invention. Since primitive times man's inventive itch has never been at rest; now we finds ourselves living on a planet so endangered by our inventions that we may well have to escape to another world to find the peace necessary to go on inventing. In English and Italian."
