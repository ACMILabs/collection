        "Don Heath and his wife, both teachers, moved to Oxley (10 km south-east of Wangaratta) in 1975, fell in love with the small rural town and decided to settle there. In this short interview Don talks of Oxley, and his coming of age in 1986 when he and his wife finally bought 4 acres of land and built their own home - a home that he loves and a place where there is plenty of space and freedom for his three young children."
