        "This film documents what was, for its time, a revolutionary breakthrough in occupational therapy - the pursuit of simple industrial vocation in sheltered workshops. A range of Victorian sheltered workshops are surveyed, and the filmmakers are keen to promote the greater satisfaction afforded their subjects by work which is both financially rewarding and socially useful."
