        "Hong Kong was faced after the war with problems of over-crowding, unemployment, hardship and disease which to a less courageous and hard-working people might have proved insurmountable. The film surveys the industrial and commercial expansion, the building schemes, the education and health services, the modernisation of transport and the outstanding achievements in land reclamation, which are bringing prosperity to the people of Hong Kong."
