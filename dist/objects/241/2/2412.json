        "Bendigo is better known for its old historic buildings than its heritage listed Botanic Gardens. Jan Orr, Rodney Orr and Glenys Anthony, members of the Friends of the Bendigo Botanic Gardens, talk about the history and some of the features of the Conservatory Gardens, including the rose garden and the fernery. The aim of the \"Friends\" group is to promote, protect and restore Bendigo's heritage listed gardens."
