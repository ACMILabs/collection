        "A pictorial and sound experiment in which there is virtually no subject movement. All movement is relayed by way of camera and sound track. On a ghost train a ghost of a man comes to town. He makes his way to the hub of that town, the gold mine. Working there, he is killed in a cave-in and remains as one of the town's permanent residents in the cemetery."
