        "Episode number 3 of Series \"What Do You Think\". This film poses the question of whether an honest judgment is better than diplomatic double-talk in situations where an individual's feelings may be hurt. We listen in on the conversation of high-school teen-agers following a school play in which a popular but untalented student has the leading role. The editor of the school paper defends his right to print an objective critical review of her performance. Other students feel that she should be let down more gently. The audience is invited to take over discussion of the issue."
