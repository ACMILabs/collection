        "Animated butterfly ballet suggested by the title of the 17th century French composer's \"Les Papillons\". The film reflects the animator's admiration of Chinese and Japanese painting as well as of the composer's music. The animation employs a device similar to stroboscopic or multi- image photography, that creates a smooth and fluid flow of motion, making the delicate choreography beautifully evident."
