        "A portrait of Himachal Pradesh State and its progress in recent years. Snowbound in winter the valleys awake in spring, when the sheep are shorn for their fine carpet wools, and the crops are planted. Isolation which has held back the development of Himachal Pradesh is being broken down by the building of the Hindustan Tibet highway. Life of the village people Mandi, where pilgrims flock to the ancient temple; traditions of religion, art and folkdance; orchards, timber and potatoes as increasing valuable products; snow sports in winter."
