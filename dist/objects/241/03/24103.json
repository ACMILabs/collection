        "An historical and cultural survey of Hinduism, set against a background of ancient temples and statues, and Hindu religious rites. Stresses the various mental and physical disciplines called yogas, through which Hindus seek eternal union with Brahma, the universal spirit of God. Also the caste system, the belief in reincarnation and the deep influences of the religion of the Hindu way of life."
