        "In Germany a large proportion of the horse population is employed in industry, agriculture, and in breeding, whereas the number of horses used for sport is by comparison small. The chief breeding areas are near Hanover, in Oldenberg, Westphalia, and Schleswig-Holstein. Breeding and sport often combine. Shows the work, training and successes of German horsemen."
