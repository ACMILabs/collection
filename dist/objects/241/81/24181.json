        "Episode of Series \"We Make Music\". Ifor James demonstrates the evolution of the horn from the old hunting horn of nearly 300 years ago, through each stage of its development to the orchestral horn and the modern valve horn, which is capable of rapid changes in key called for by contemporary composers. Illustrated with excerpts from Handel, Mozart and Weber."
