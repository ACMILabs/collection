        "The tourist attractions of Hobart, the peaceful capital in the Derwent Valley under the shadow of Mt Wellington. Although many attractive new buildings are rising in the business centre of the city, the old buildings with their historical associations retain the greatest charm. The sea and the docks are only a few minutes from the city and the Royal Hobart Regatta is a highlight of the Tasmanian year."
