        "Episode of Series \"The Great Religions\". In India, the home of most present adherents, this film traces the history of Hinduism, its evolution over the centuries and its connections to Buddhism and Jainism. Shown are the observances of this faith, its teaching of non-violence, its respect for all living things, how the social order created by it has been modified in the modern world to outlaw the declaration of individuals as \"untouchables\" and to remove limitations on freedom imposed by caste."
