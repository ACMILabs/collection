        "An animated film in which coloured shapes dance in time to old-fashioned calling music. The film was made without a camera, by drawing directly upon the film with ordinary pen and ink. Simple, swift moving forms dance about the screen, carrying out the mood of the music as the humorous aspect of the old time circus calliope - missing stops and a tendency to go out of tune - are all included on the soundtrack. No commentary."
