        "Adolph Hitler became legal head of the German government in 1933. To a nation torn by economic, political and spiritual crises, he promised strong leadership and a policy of revenge against supposed enemies, at home and abroad. With little opposition, Hitler soon made himself the master of Europe. Before the Allies finally defeated him, he would be responsible for the deaths of over 350 million people, an unmatched record of dictatorial brutality. Suitable for upper secondary level."
