        "A Birdland fantasy, by animation artist Evelyn Lambart, about a bluejay who takes whatever his beak can grasp and carry. Into his secret cache go berries, birds' eggs, nests and all. Even the sun in the sky is unsafe from his consuming greed. But, as in her film Fine Feathers, there is a moral tucked away. The bluejay learns a lesson, and Birdland returns to normal. Suitable for primary school level"
