    "description": [
        "O Panama, scripted by Burt Barr and filmed by James Benning, was made for TV. Immigrant (Willem Dafoe) comes to New York from an unidentified Latin American country and appears to fall ill in the middle of winter. He drifts through this illness, confined to his apartment where his imagination is free. The tedious reality of the sickness and the vivid hallucinatory visions of his delirium, are stitched together by the polarities of light and dark, hot and cold, sound and silence, day and night, presence and absence. There is no dialogue and little action as a `mental landscape...rife with heat and color' emerges from the backdrop of a bleak urban winterscape."
