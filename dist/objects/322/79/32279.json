        "Episode of Series \"Nature of Work\". This film explores the conflict between what a man (in this case an office clerk) wants from his job and what the company wants from him. It raises the question of how far an industry ought to be expected to go in relieving dull, repetitive work for the sake of employee satisfaction."
