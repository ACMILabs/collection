        "Episode of Series \"Golden West Series\". Paddy Hannan's find in 1893 led to the development of Kalgoorlie. Over 28 million ounces of fine gold have been taken from the \"Golden Mile's\" open cut and deep mines. Demonstrates the mining process from power drilling of the ore bearing rock to crushing, screening and grinding of the ore. Washing and treating before processing in flotation cells, storage before smelting and finally the bullion is produced ready for the last smelting at the Royal Mint."
