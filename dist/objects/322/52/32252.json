        "Examines the dilemma facing the mentally ill in America and the people who try to help them. With the advent of stabilising drugs, more patients are returning to the community. However, unless the patients have homes to return to they are released into communities unprepared to either accept or treat them. Follows three patients on their separate paths as they seek their release from a psychiatric centre."
