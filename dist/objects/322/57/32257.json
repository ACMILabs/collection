        "Canada's tenth province--its people, its resources, its way of life. The camera shows us St. John's, the capital city; Cornerbrook, pulp and paper center; and Bell Island with its iron mine. The greatest wealth of Newfoundland is her people, and a visit with Fred Greeley, inshore fisherman and his family, introduces us to our fellow Canadians. Finally the importance of Newfoundland's airports is stressed, and we visit Gander, where international air travellers come and go from the four corners of the globe."
