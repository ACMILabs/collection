        "The story of oyster farming in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, showing the various stages of oyster cultivation: the sampling of minute larvae by Department of Fisheries biologists, the staking of oyster beds by farmers, the nurturing of spat, and underwater scenes showing the dragging of the sea bed with cotton mops to ensnare starfish which prey upon the oyster. Final sequences show the grading and shipping of oysters and their arrival at the sea food restaurant or family dinner table, where they delight the eyes and palates of oyster lovers."
