        "A lively film about a barber who draws his own shop, adds a \"Mop Top\" customer, then cuts and shampoos the boy's unmanageable hair, finally rewarding him with a lollipop for his good behaviour. Rossini's \"Barber of Seville\" provides a lively musical accompaniament. No dialogue. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
