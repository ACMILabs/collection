        "With a colourful flow of images, this film directly relates the work of the famous 20th century painter, Paul Klee, to the artistic creations of young children. Klee's own words are complemented by youngsters' candid comments to reveal an unmistakable kinship between master and young beginner. A delightful portrait of Paul Klee for all levels."
