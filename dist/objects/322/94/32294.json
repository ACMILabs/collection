        "Four clients are seen in group assertion training, developing a style by practicing appropriate eye contact, gestures, body movement, touch, facial expression & voice tone & volume. Therapists are seen directing the client's progress and reinforcing small successes. Practice assignments are given in which newly learned skills are applied to situations in the client's daily lives. Narrated by McDonald Carey."
