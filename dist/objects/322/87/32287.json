        "Tells the story of the father in a Mexican-American family who wins a Cadillac car, forms grandiose plans for its use without regard to his inadequate income, makes himself unpopular by his over-solicitous care of the automobile, but is brought to his senses in a subtly worked out resolution. Uses still picture technique."
