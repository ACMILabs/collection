        "A fictional film about two people and a salamander. The car they are travelling in collapses unceremoniously on the road to Montreal. Finding a mechanic in the quiet countryside is never easy, but here the problem is compounded by linguistic misunderstandings. Eventually the car runs again, but one of the passengers refuses to run along."
