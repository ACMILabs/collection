        "Records the installation of the first marine gas turbine for an ocean-going vessel. Draws attention to the length of time taken for installation - three months, and the importance of further tests, when it is at sea. Concludes by pointing out that it will be a long time before the gas turbine takes it place with the steam engine and diesel engine, but the first steps have been taken."
