        "Initially, the film seeks to make us aware of the constant danger of being contaminated by poisoned air when we are breathing. Secondly, it seeks to make us realise that the problem of chemical fallout is being neglected and getting worse. Part 3's theme is \"How can we get clean air?\" and points out that three out of five Americans breathe dangerously polluted air while the list of polluted cities grows."
