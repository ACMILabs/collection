        "Documents the Sandinista uprising from the general strike of June 1979 through the first hundred days of reconstruction after the victory. A fast-paced \"on the spot\" film which eloquently captures the furious demise of the Somoza dynasty in its desperate attempt to turn back the tide of history, and which also paints a powerful portrait of the forces at work within the Nicaraguan revolution."
