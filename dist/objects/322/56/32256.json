        "What is dying? How does it feel? Afterlife is an impressionistic and visionary response to these eternal questions. Based on recent studies, case histories, and some of the ancient myths, the afterlife state is portrayed as an awesome but methodical working-out of all the individual's past experiences. Music performed by Herbie Mann. Nine awards including Montreal, Chicago, Hong Kong, Annecy and Columbus."
