        "Ask any French Canadian, who tells the funniest stories and he'll say with a chuckle Yvon Deschamps. Now big box office, Deschamps grew up in Montreal's inner city, where, he says, mothers didn't speak, they just hit. Here he is, on and off stage, quipping, haranguing with irreverent wit-the very embodiment of Quebec humour and slant on life."
