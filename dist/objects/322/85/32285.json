        "Presents life on Nauru, showing the people fishing, taming birds to attract wild ones, playing a ball game and wrestling. Phosphate, the only economic resource is shown being mined, crushed, dried and exported. As it runs out in thirty years, the Australian government which administers the island is planning for the future of the islanders - as well as exercising justice, educating children, and providing Australian scholarship. Includes the co-operative store, and the Local Government Council which Nauruans run."
