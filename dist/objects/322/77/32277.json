        "A string quartet illustrates the fundamentals of group musical performance. The range and distinctive qualities of each instrument are identified, then combined to show how the four voices develop form and mood. Excerpts from quartets by Mozart, Haydn and Schubert are used to show the relationship of performer to composer, and of the performers to each other."
