        "Presents a brief glimpse of the early history of Australia, particularly the beginnings of industry and manufactures followed by a current view (1959) of the range of products produced in Australia. Shows the wide range from heavy industries as railway engines, farm machinery and motor cars through to the smaller, lighter industries such as fabrics, cosmetics and jewellery. Statistics are given to illustrate the growth of the manufacturing industries since 1945 and the relationship in value between produced goods and imported goods."
