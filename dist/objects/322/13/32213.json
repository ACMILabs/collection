        "In the hearts of two Saskatchewan farm children nothing could take the place of a pony. But their father's eight hundred-hectare mechanized wheat farm seemed to have no place for one. How their wish was eventually fulfilled beyond expectation makes a heart-warming Christmas story. Cast includes Mary McNeil, George Russell, Helen Bothwell, William Cornish, Norman Ericson, Georgia Gibbs, Frank Hanson."
