        "Episode of Series \"Up a gum tree\". Australia owes a great debt to the Aboriginals who learned to tame the inhospitable countryside. But why did they never become farmers and what sort of diet did the first Australians enjoy? David Bellamy attempts to find out the answers to these questions."
