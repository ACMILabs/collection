        "Sensitive portrayal of American ideals and lifestyles, made to explain and promote the Department of Agriculture's program of rural electrification. Filmed on the farm of Bill and Hazel Parkinson in St. Clairsville, Ohio, capturing the hardship of a nonelectrified farm and the progress and profit brought by electricity. The film is critical of the reluctance by public utility companies to install power to rural areas. A significant documentary that elevates the status of farmers and the value of their work. Cinematography, Floyd Crosby and Arthur Ornitz. Script, Edwin Locke. Editing, Helen van Dongen. Commentary by Stephen Vincent Benet. Music, Douglas Moore."
