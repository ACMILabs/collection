        "A moving story about the work of the United Nations in Thailand and Mexico. First we travel to Mexico to the island of Yunuen, on Lake Patzcuaro. The level of the lake is falling and the fish are becoming fewer. The land is losing its fertility. A team of Latin American students arrive and seek ways of improving the fishing and farming. In the course of their work for the Indians, the student learn the meaning of practical co-operation and the benefits which arrive to both sides of such partnerships. In the simple lives of the peasant, in the vivid countryside surrounding the lake, they, and the audience, meet the real Mexico. From Mexico to Thailand; from the land whose people have known centuries of turbulence to the jungles of Thailand and the villagers of Ban Sang. The pressing need here is for medical aid to attack the horrible disease of yaws. Startling results following treatment with penicillin have helped in the gradual eradication of this scourge, but more people are needed to take the remedy to outlying districts."
