        "The Quayside was the old commercial area in Newcastle. It is now under threat from the redeveloper's hammer. The film is a poetic lament about its past while indicating fears for its future. Elaborate tracking devices were used in making the film and a soundtrack constructed from files found in old shipping offices."
