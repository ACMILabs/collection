    "description": [
        "Werckmeister harmonies: Haunting and atmospheric, this slow-moving narrative filmed in stark black and white reflects the harsh political environment that is Eastern Europe. The main character, Jancos (Lars Rudolph), a visionary and an outsider is drawn to the arrival in his bleak provincial town on the Hungarian plains, of a circus featuring the stuffed carcass of a massive dead whale and a mysterious, somewhat sinister figure called \"The Prince\". What follows this arrival into this already economically depressed village is quite disturbing. Using long and lingering shots, the images create nuances and subtleties that make \"Werckmeister harmonies\" an intriguing and beautiful film. Cast also includes Peter Fitz, Hanna Schygulla. Based on \"The Melancholy of Resistance\" by Laszlo Krasznahorkai. \"Damnation\": Featuring Bela Tarr's renowned long takes and bleak black and white images, this story follows Karrer (Miklos B. Szekely), a sullen and listless man obsessed with a married woman (Vali Kerekes) who sings at a local bar, the Titanik. Betrayal and conflict eventually lead to despair for Karrer and alienation from those around him. Extremely slow, beautifully photographed and quite depressing but definitely compelling. Cast also includes Gyula Pauer, Gyorgy Cserhalmi. A collaboration with writer Laszlo Krasznahorkai."
