        "The Great White Shark has a reputation of being one of the most feared creatures on earth, this fear no doubt heightend in the past by Hollywood films such as \"Jaws\". However, in this revealing expose, David Attenborough attempts to show us that there are several sides to this awe-inspiring species - killing machine maybe, selective and skilful hunter absolutely. Through some excellent underwater photography, including a remote video camera attached to a shark, we see the natural behaviour and environment of the Great White and up-close shots of not just one, but several sharks as they swim, hunt and mate. Mostly filmed around the oceans of Cape Coast at the southern most tip of South Africa, this documentary is both educational and entertaining. Photography by Paul Atkins, Peter Scoones, Doug Allen."
