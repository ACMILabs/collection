        "Preceded by \"Film annonce\", a 3 minute trailer directed by French writer/artist Maurice Lemaitre in 1993, \"Le Film est deja commence?\" is an experimental hand-colored/b&w film made in 1951 by Lemaitre which has since influenced both New Wave and avant-garde filmmakers with its combination of aesthetics and politics. The complete film session, made up of a montage of film excerpts and abstract images with dialogue spoken in French, had its World Premiere on December 7, 1951 at the Cine Club of the Latin Quarter in Paris. Contains silent footage with mainly French and some English subtext. Also includes booklet with English translation of the soundtrack."
