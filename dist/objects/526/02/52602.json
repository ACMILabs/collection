        "An amazing documentary recording the historic World March of Women between March and October 2000. Initiated by the Quebec Federation of Women, this march was a global protest against poverty and violence towards women, uniting women from all cultures, religions, ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds in a common goal - to change the world. Director Sophie Bissonnette, with the collaboration of Anne Laure Folly (Senegal), Pat Fiske and Nicolette Freeman (Australia), Deepa Chanraj (India), Carmen Guarini (Ecuador) and Helene Klodawsky (USA), covered the march. However, the filmmakers were invited by Bissonnette to film a special project occurring in their own country. In Senegal a community battles female genital mutilation through education; in Australia a women's circus teaches survivors of sexual assault to become skilled performers; in India a group of low-caste women mediate domestic disputes in informal women's courts; in Ecuador native women offer leadership training programs to create women leaders; and in the United States, Linda Carney explains Survival Inc. for the poor and homeless women in Boston. The film follows the journey of the march through Mozambique, Senegal, Belgium, Japan, Morocco, Australia, Lebanon, Canada, Mexico, Croatia, India, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, the Philippines and the United States capturing the spirit of the women, their music and songs of protest, their cry for peace and civil rights and for some a chance to relate their own personal stories. Contains some b&w images."
