        "In this brutal western, directed by Robert Aldrich, the central relationship is between an idealistic and inexperienced young officer and a world-weary veteran scout. They are sent on a mission to pursue a small group of Chiricahua Apaches who have broken out of the reservation. One of several westerns of the sixties and seventies which seem to have been made with the Vietnam War in mind, it is also one of the few westerns to attempt to unravel cause and effect, representing the Indian neither as merely hostile nor as the noble savage. Cast: Burt Lancaster, Bruce Davison, Jorge Luke, Richard Jaeckel."
