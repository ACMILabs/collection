        "The Fluxus movement is made up of many artists blending visual arts, music and literature. The movement was founded in 1962 and has been compared to Dada and Surrealism. The artists include performance artists and video artists whose work is influenced by mystical thinking, irony and sometimes LSD. In this anthology compiled by the founder of the Fluxus movement, George Maciunas, and then later, Maeva Aubert, thirty seven pieces are gathered. Some of the videos are meant to be viewed in a loop, others use found footage and others create visual effects with a high-speed camera. The pieces range from 10 seconds to 10 minutes in length. Some of the films were screened in New York as part of the 'happenings' of the avant-garde. The works are often playful, undefinable reactions to everyday life. The search for meaning in life mixed with reflective, nonverbal strangeness. The artists are not necessarily known as filmmakers and include Nam June Paik, Yoko Ono, John Cale, Mike Parr, Robert Watts and Dick Higgens."
