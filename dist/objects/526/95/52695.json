    "description": [
        "Silly Symphonies is a delightful presentation of seven animations from the Disney studios which are not focused on a main character or a plot but rather bring to life inanimate objects, cakes and plates as well as insects and animals. These more experimental animations allowed the animators freedom and expression developing new ideas and animation techniques. These innovative animations are exciting and a joy to watch."
