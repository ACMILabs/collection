        "The first independent feature film produced in Jamaica gave many Americans their first taste of reggae music with musician Jimmy Cliff in the title role, backed by a fabulous reggae soundtrack. Cliff plays Ivan, a naive rural singer who moves to the city in search of fame but is soon impoverished and exploited by the music industry before becoming embroiled in the trade of marijuana and murder; simultaneously Ivan's music is released to great acclaim and he becomes somewhat of a local anti-hero. As well as offering a unique view of the reggae scene the milieu of this film also offers a de-romanticised view of seedy Kingston life. Indeed Henzell's style borders on documentary, as he evokes the squalor of the street, the impoverishment of the people and the multi-faceted systemic corruption. Soundtrack includes the title track as well as other reggae hits \"You Can Really Get It if You Want It\", \"Sitting in Limbo\" and \"Johnny Too Bad\". Cast includes Basil Keane, Ras Daniel Hartman, Winston Stona, Janet Barkley, Bobby Charlton and Carl Bradshaw."
