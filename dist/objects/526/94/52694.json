        "Daisy Duck fine friend of Donald Duck is a keen and enthusiastic dancer. Although having a temper equal to Donald she is able to sooth him and is very good with his three nephews. Daisy can be seen here starring and playing bit parts in these exciting cartoons. There is an introduction by Walt Disney on the development of the Disney characters and the studio. Good family entertainment."
