        "Using Super-8 and an experimental technique of allowing bacterial decomposition and chemical breakdown of the film emulsion, a practice Jurgen Reble worked on as a former member of the German filmmaking group known as \"Schmelzdahin\" during the 1980s, \"Rumpelstilzchen\" and \"Passion\" feature as part of Reble's first solo works in this unusual and surrealistic style of filmmaking. Familiar to both pieces is the often repetitive and pulsating rhythmic soundtrack and images using both micro and macro cinematography and themes of creation, evolution and destruction. An intriguing concept and interpretation into the chemistry of life."
