        "A delightful animated fable, \"Kirikou and the sorceress\" starts with a child, Kirikou, speaking to his mother from the womb. Once born, Kirikou seeks about healing his village - principally from the curse that an ill-tempered sorceress has placed on the village including drying up the wells and eating up the men-folk. In his bid to confront the sorceress and see the end to his tribe's woes, Kirikou undertakes a perilous journey meeting an array of colourful beings and jungle creatures. The charm of the narrative is that it presents from a child's perspective with uncomplicated views on life, unsullied by conjecture and misguided beliefs. The African village where this whimsical tale is set is abundant with colour, humour, culture and magic, with animation inspired by the earth colours and myths of Africa and imbued with a rich palette reminiscent of 19th century French painter Henri Rousseau. Music scored by Senegalese musician Youssou N'dour."
