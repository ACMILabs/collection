        "Grace Trevethan (Brenda Blethyn) is a passionate gardener and housewife whose cloistered world is threatened by the sudden death of her husband. Grace discovers that not only was he unfaithful but he also left her saddled with enormous debt. Having no means of supporting herself, Grace is convinced by a friend to apply her considerable horticulture skills to growing marijuana and make a quick fortune. All goes well until Grace has to deal with the seedy trading of the goods and the attentions of the local constabulary. \"Saving Grace\", directed by Nigel Cole, can probably best be described as quirky feel-good English comedy with a touch of dark humour nudging the sides; it also has undertones of female liberation as Grace gains empowerment over her life. Brenda Blethyn is credible as Grace but the comedy flounders often as, despite some enjoyably anarchic moments, the narrative also calls for some dreadfully unlikely ones. Cast also includes: Craig Ferguson, Martin Clunes, Tcheky Karyo, and Jamie Forman."
