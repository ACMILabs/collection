        "An insightful realistic portrayal of China in the 1980s beautifully presented by acclaimed Chinese director Jia Zhang-ke and supported by an equally superb cast in Wang Hong-wei (Minliang), Liang Jing-dong (Chang Jun), Yang Tian-yi (Zhong Pin) and Zhao Tao (Ruijuan). \"Platform\" is set in a time of tremendous political and socioeconomic change where pervasive western capitalist influences are beginning to impact on all aspects of Chinese life, family and values. Change is inevitable, even in the small rural town of Fenyang in Shanxi Province where the Fenyang Peasant Culture Group, a local performing arts troupe made up of teenagers face the choice of either maintaining their communal ways and propaganda performances or move into the new world of privatisation and pop culture. The story follows the paths of four young performers in this troupe, over a period of ten years from 1979 to 1989, exploring their friendships and relationships with each other, with family and with the rapidly changing political and social environment around them as they struggle, individually, and as part of the Culture Group, for identity. It is in this arena of identity that music plays such a crucial role. Laconic and slow-moving, sparse in narrative and set against a somewhat bleak background where the characters often appear aloof and distant, \"Platform\" manages to draw the audience in, aided not only by the rare inside look at Chinese history during a turbulent time, but also by some powerful and evocative sounds and images shot by innovative cinematographer Yu Lik Wai. In Mandarin with English subtitles. (Awards: Venice; Buenos Aires; Singapore)"
