        "Adam Elliot's bittersweet claymation short work opens in Poland in 1922 with the birth of Harvek Milos Krumpetzki - an innocent child beguiled with the world, born to doting and quite dotty parents. Despite being mercilessly teased as a child, Harvek maintains interest in his surrounds, encouraged by his mother who assists him in collecting wonderful 'fakts' about the world. One night Harvek's life is irrevocably altered when WW2 breaks out and he migrates to a faraway land - Australia. In an attempt to assimilate Harvek changes his name to Harvie Krumpet and, in the suburb of Spotswood, begins a new life involving marriage, parenthood and finally, old age. With its melancholic, absurdist tone, \"Harvie Krumpet\" ably captures the peculiarities of this fringe-dwelling character whose desire for knowledge and love transcends the many trials and mixed fortunes of his life. Winner of an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and narrated by Geoffrey Rush. Also available on DVD [318606]."
