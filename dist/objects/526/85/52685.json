        "Ray (John Getz) and Mickey (Barbara Williams) Davis were the perfect married couple, or so everyone thought. Bored with her workaholic and disinterested husband, Mickey turns to her diary as an outlet, writing down her innermost sexual fantasies and desires. This is until the Davis' home is burgled and the robber takes off with not only an assortment of valuables, but also Mickey's secret diary. The thief, Scott Muller (Steven Bauer), soon finds himself obsessed with Mickey after reading her diary and plots and plans his way into meeting and seducing her. Mickey and Ray's life is turned inside out whilst Muller's obsession almost destroys him. Erotic thriller of the 80s with 80s soundtrack featuring Giorgio Moroder and Melissa Manchester. Includes a cameo role by a very young David Caruso (of NYPD Blues TV series fame) and support cast including George Wendt and Christine Ebersole."
