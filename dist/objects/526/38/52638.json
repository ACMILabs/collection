        "Compilation of works by German avant-garde animator Oskar Fischinger, an inventive artist who performed his own research, including different animation techniques, 3D, optical sound and colour. The works on this tape include: \"Muratti Privat\" (1935) In this advertisement for smoking the cigarettes are arranged in a series of balletic movements. \"War Experiments\" (1921-26) An intriguing work (with a silent track) that utilises time-lapse and sliced wax-imagery. \"Munchen-Berlin Wanderung\" (1927) A journey from Munich to Berlin was documented by Fischinger, presenting a fascinating glimpse of 1920s Germany. \"Study No. 5\" (1930) Thousands of charcoal images were shot frame-by-frame in this fluid, musical and beautifully choreographed work. \"Study No. 9\" (1931) Synchronised to Brahms' \"Hungarian dance no 6\", the graceful images on screen create a dynamic work. \"Study No. 12\" (1932) A work by brothers Hans and Oscar, is clever and elegant, set to Rubenstein's \"Bride of Corinth\". \"Komposition in Blau\" (1935) Delightful, experimental piece, utilises contrasting colour and shape to present dynamic movement between forms, utilising numerous animation techniques. \"American March\" (1941) Geometric images shape shift to become irregular forms, set to an American anthem. \"Organic Fragment\" (1941) A series of line drawings and painted cells, using an array of shape and colour. \"Mutoscope Reels\" (c. 1945) A rich variety of imagery and effects, these reels are essentially a series animation drawings. \"Muntz TV Commercial\" (1952) Intriguing television commercial in black and white with original soundtrack."
