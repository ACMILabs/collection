        "First of the very popular British costume melodramas produced by Gainsborough and often thought of as the best in the collection, \"The Man in grey\" is a tale of intrigue that twists and turns its way to a dramatic conclusion. The story begins at an antique auction in London during WWII and then proceeds to flashback to 19th century regal England to the aristocratic world of Clarissa Richmond (Phyllis Calvert) and her loveless marriage to the rather indifferent Lord Rohan (James Mason) - the \"man in grey\", whose sole intent is in fathering an heir. Clarissa soon finds herself distracted by the attentions of the handsome Rokeby (Stewart Granger) introduced to her by her old schoolfriend, Hester (Margaret Lockwood) who in turn falls for Lord Rohan. Deceit, love and betrayal weave their way into this web of treachery where circumstances and fate can only lead to a tragic conclusion. Magnificent performances by all four stars. Based on the novel by Lady Eleanor Smith, adapted by Doreen Montgomery with screenplay by Margaret Kennedy and Leslie Arliss."
