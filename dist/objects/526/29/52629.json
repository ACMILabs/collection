        "This dramatisation of the role of the peasant leader Emilio Zapata in the Mexican Revolution was the product of a close collaboration between screenwriter John Steinbeck and director Elia Kazan. Zapata (played by Marlon Brando), an ambiguous historical figure, is idealised in the film yet a certain psychological complexity is maintained. He is a symbolic figure, a 'natural' leader who is attuned to the essential needs of the people. Revolution thus becomes a natural rather than a revolutionary process. The weak idealist, Madero, cannot make the revolution work. The shadowy figure of Fernando, the advisor, stands as a symbol for Stalinism. Cast also includes Jean Peters, Anthony Quinn, Joseph Wiseman and Arnold Moss."
