        "Dangerous game is director Stephen Hopkins' debut feature film but he is better known for his later features \"Nightmare on Elm Street 5\", \"Predator 2\", \"Lost in space\", \"Blown away\" and several TV productions, including \"24\". This Australian thriller, set in Sydney, centres around a group of five uni students, David (Miles Buchanan), Jack (Marcus Graham), Tony (John Polson), Kathryn (Kathryn Walker) and Ziggy (Sandie Lillingston) whose lives are suddenly turned upside down when they decide on a whim, late one night, to break into a department store - just for the sheer thrill of it all. What they were unprepared for, however, was the presence of Murphy (Steven Grives) the psycho cop who had, for reasons of his own, taken to stalking and harrassing Jack, pursuing him in a menacing, almost fanatical, manner to such a point that he lost his job that very day through Jack reporting him. Now Murphy is the security guard in the department store and he wants revenge. From a fairly slow start, the film gradually builds up into an action thriller with some tense moments and unexpected outcomes. Based on an original script by Michael Ralph, screenplay by Peter West and cinematography by Peter Levy."
