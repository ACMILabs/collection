        "This amazing marriage of art, music and film took five years (1977-1982) in the making by its French creator, Patrick Bokanowski and programmed non-stop in a Tokyo cinema for nearly ten years. The impressionistic images are accompanied by a beautiful atmospheric soundtrack of original music composed by Michele Bokanowski to present a textured, multi-layered complexity of vision and sound. \"L'Ange\" makes for compelling viewing and deserves its cult status in the world of avant-garde filmmaking. Cast includes Jacques Faure, Martine Couture, Jean-Marie Bon, Dominique Lesourd, Maurice Baquet, Rita Renoir, Patricia Peretti."
