        "Made long before \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\" this wonderful martial arts epic will linger with you both for its atmospheric and mystical images and its lyrical and mysterious storyline. Set during the time of the Ming Dynasty in a rural village outside Peking, the story begins with the artist Ku Shen-chai who lives with his mother in a supposedly haunted, run-down fort. The arrival of a stranger, Ou-Yang Yin, to the village stirs the curiosity within Ku only to be further flamed by the sudden appearance of a beautiful woman named Yang Hui-Ching. Plot and sub-plot are interwoven to form an intricate tale binding the three protagonists in a web of intrigue and mystery. This is not a full-on action-packed martial arts film but the scenes of combat are impressively creative and beautifully performed. Cast includes Hsu Feng, Tien Peng, Hsueh Han, Shih Chun, Pai Ying. Photography by Hua Hui-ying."
