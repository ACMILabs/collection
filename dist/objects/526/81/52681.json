    "description": [
        "Using dramatic historical re-enactments and computer animation this documentary provides a fascinating insight into the world of prehistoric life and the eventual evolution of the human race from primitive Homo ergaster to Homo erectus, from the rise of the Neanderthals and the Pleistocene era of the Cro-Magnons, to the advanced sophistication of the Paleo-Indians. We see how humans battle to survive alongside such prehistoric predatory beasts as the sabretooth cat, woolly mammoths and gigantic bears in often extreme conditions where it truly is the \"survival of the fittest\". Episode 1. Hunt or be hunted: Begins in prehistoric Africa 1.7 million years ago with Homo ergaster and fast-forwards a million years to Homo erectus through to the Cro-Magnons. Discusses the evolutionary process and the importance of adapting to climatic and environmental changes, of developing skills to master the art of survival and of how the discovery of fire-making played such an important role in the evolution story. Episode 2. Mastering the beasts: Follows the Cro-Magnons to America revealing their tenacity in surviving harsh elements, extreme hunger and the company of woolly mammoths. Also focuses on the Paleo-Indians of North America as two small bands come together for a ritual buffalo kill. Based on available scientific evidence, this interpretive program is highly recommended as an educational tool. Narrated by John Slattery, story by Brian Fagan."
