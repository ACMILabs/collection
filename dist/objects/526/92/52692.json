        "Set in the shipping terminal at Glebe Island, Sydney this short film explores the life and emotions of crane-operator Ron Watson (Robert Noble) who is facing a crisis situation both at home and at work. His job is demanding, often requiring shift-work and long hours. His marriage is falling apart because of his obsession with work and yet Ron seems unable to prevent the inevitable. And the job itself is a dangerous one requiring total focus and agility. Ron, like many of his co-workers on the water front, finally is confronted with the stresses around him and is forced to face the grim reality of his situation. Cast also includes Maya Potter, Joseph Petruzzi, Bob Hornery, Nicholas Flanagan. Original music by Colin Watson, Jim Conway with drums by Hanumandas and cinematography by Brendon Young."
