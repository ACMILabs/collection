        "A film you will either love or hate - but certainly one for the romantics out there. This is pure 70s in every way, especially the music and the fashion. \"If ever I see you again\" is a story of first love lost and broken in the winter of 1966 and rekindled once more in the winter of 1978. Bob Morrison (Joe Brooks), a jingle writer in New York and widowed with two children takes up an opportunity to create music for a movie in California. On reaching California, Bob who has never forgotten his first teenage love, Jennifer Corly (Shelley Hack), finds that she is now living in California. Unable to resist seeking her out, Bob makes contact and the two, after a lot of soul-searching and comings and goings, eventually get it together. With love songs playing in the background, romantic scenes in the snow and warm Christmassy moments, what more can you ask for! This is Joe Brooks' film - he produced, directed, starred, composed, arranged and conducted the music and wrote, along with Martin Davidson, the screenplay. Cast also includes Jimmy Breslin, Jerry Keller, Kenny Karen, George Plimpton."
