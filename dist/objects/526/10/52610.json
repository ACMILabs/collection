        "Internationally acclaimed filmmakers Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (Rosetta, 1999) once again present a powerful story built around its central characters in a stylised and moving drama of moral reckoning. Featuring Olivier Gourmet in the role of Olivier, a somewhat dour carpenter who teaches his craft to help rehabilitate troubled teenagers and Morgan Marinne as Francis, the new student who becomes an object of inexplicable obsession by his teacher, Olivier. This ambiguously slow-moving story is stark and intensely gripping as it moves towards its unexpected ending. Cast also includes Isabella Soupart with verite-style cinematography by Alain Marcoen. (Awards: Olivier Gourmet, Best Actor 2002 Cannes Film Festival; Prize of the Ecumenical Jury - Special Mention 2002 Cannes Film Festival)"
