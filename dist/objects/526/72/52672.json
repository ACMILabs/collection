        "Charles Wills (Van Johnson) is a GI with literary ambitions who goes to Paris and meets and falls in love with the wealthy Helen Ellswirth (Elizabeth Taylor). Charles' ambition to write a novel falls to pieces as failure to sell his writing causes him to turn to alcohol. During a drunken argument Johnson accidentally locks Helen out of their Parisian apartment, causing her to catch a fatal dose of pneumonia. When Helen dies, custody of their child is granted to Helen's sister, who always disapproved of her sister's abusive partner. Shocked into action, Charles returns home and finally finds success as a writer, and the conviction to try and regain custody of his daughter. Based on the tragic love story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Cast also includes Donna Reed, Walter Pidgeon and Eva Gabor."
