        "A historic collection of classic animated cartoons from the 1930s including two very famous and much loved characters, Felix the Cat (The Goose that laid the golden egg) and Daffy Duck. Entertaining family viewing but also a fascinating look back at animation styles and techniques of the era. NB: Quality of sound and color is variable."
