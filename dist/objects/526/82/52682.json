        "This biographical drama loosely based on historical facts is set in mid-18th century Russia during the reign of the somewhat domineering and determined Empress Elisabeth (played by the wonderful Dame Flora Robson) who in her waning years sets out to arrange a marriage between her nephew and heir to the throne, Grand Duke Peter (Douglas Fairbanks Jnr) and a young German princess named Catherine (Elizabeth Bergner). It is not long, however, before Catherine discovers that her dearly betrothed is both unfaithful and madly insane and yet for all this, she remains devoted and true to him. But with the death of Empress Elisabeth, and Peter's ascension to the throne, life becomes more unpredictable and precarious for Catherine as Peter's mental health and behaviour becomes more unstable. Circumstances take control and eventually Catherine is forced to assume power. This is an interesting piece of filming for its time and the quality acting and lavish sets certainly add to its depth. Cast also includes Gerald Du Maurier, Irene Vanbrugh, Diana Napier. NB: Filmed in black and white, the visual quality is quite dark in some scenes and the soundtrack is scratchy but still worth viewing."
