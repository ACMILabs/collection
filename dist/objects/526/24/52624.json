Enter the lovely Kay Wonderly (Coleen Gray) a tourist who becomes a victim to the Casino, losing all her money and at the mercy of the Casino managers. Fate takes a hand and before long Nick and Kay find themselves not only sharing a mutual attraction but also of having been framed for murdering a US Treasury Agent. Hiding Kay away in a small village, Nick sets about doing a bit of his own detective work to find out just who the real murderers are. A film classic of drama and intrigue. Cast also includes Charles Goldner, Walter Rilia, Greta Grynt. Features an introduction and conclusion summary by Bill Collins."
