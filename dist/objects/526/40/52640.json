        "Lithuanian born curator, writer and avant garde filmmaker, Jonas Mekas has created this piece of artwork on film through images captured during his stay over several summers in a rented beach house (belonging to Andy Warhol) at Montauk in the late 60s early 70s with Jackie Kennedy and her sister, Lee Radziwill, and their children. Jackie co-opted Mekas into introducing Caroline and John Jr to home movies as a way of distracting them from the tragic loss of their father. This is the result of those wonderfully innocent, somewhat fragile, summer days - an eclectic mixture of old photographs and movie camera images of the Kennedy family and their cousins, brought together in fragmented, sometimes distorted or over-exposed, flashing images accompanied by a combined soundtrack of music, percussion, natural sounds of wind and surf, and the voices of the children often muffled and intermittent. Mekas has also woven some evocative images of a very young Jackie Bouvier Kennedy into this fascinating visual glimpse of one of America's most famous families."
