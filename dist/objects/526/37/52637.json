    "description": [
        "Compilation of works by German avant-garde animator Oskar Fischinger, who began experimenting visually from 1921, composing his well-known series of studies (Studie 1-13) from 1929-34. An inventive artist, Fischinger performed his own research, including different animation techniques, 3D, optical sound and colour. The works on this tape include: \"Muratti greift ein = Muratti marches on\" (1934). An advertising film, promoting the joys of smoking, Fischinger's technique was to use real cigarettes with a toothpick inserted in one end, shot frame by frame. Music from Josef Bayer's \"Die Puppenfee\". \"Spiritual constructions\" (1927-29). Kaolin wax figures are modelled and manipulated on a glass sheet with lighting from beneath, rendering opaque shapes with fluid, continuous movement. \"Study number 7\" (1930-31). Various shapes, including dots, squares and lines, are gracefully and energetically transformed, flickering and curving across the screen, accompanied by Brahms' Hungarian Dance No 5. \"Study number 8\" (1931) Complex and stunning work, presaged Fantasia, with an array of shapes humorously flitting hither and thither. \"Kreise = Circles\" (1933) A commercial commissioned by the Tolirag Theatre, Fischinger presents a free-form composition made of circles which interlink, flash, fly and surge past the viewer. \"Allegretto\" (1936) Fischinger's first American film is a splendidly colourful affair, accompanied by a jazz soundtrack. \"Motion painting no 1\" (1947) This piece is about the evolution of a painting, literally a work in motion, as swirls, shapes and lines are continuously layered, creating new patterns and forms. An influential artist, Fischinger's work is both visually spectacular and humorous."
