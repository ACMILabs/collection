        "Adam Elliot's bittersweet claymation short work opens in Poland in 1922 with the birth of Harvek Milos Krumpetzki - an innocent child beguiled with the world, born to doting and quite dotty parents.  Despite being mercilessly teased as a child, Harvek maintains interest in his surrounds, encouraged by his mother who assists him in collecting wonderful 'fakts' about the world. One night Harvek's life is irrevocably altered when WWII breaks out and he migrates to a faraway land - Australia. In an attempt to assimilate Harvek changes his name to Harvie Krumpet and, in the suburb of Spotswood, begins a new life involving marriage, parenthood and finally, old age.  Winner of the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and narrated by Geoffrey Rush."
