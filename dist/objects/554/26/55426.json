        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". In 1976 Dr Neville Bennett of Lancaster University published his research report evaluating the success and failure of various systems used in British primary schools. This was the first major attempt to analyse scientifically just how much children learn in establishments ranging from the most progressive, open-plan schools, to the most traditional. The publication of the report was an important educational event, and it will give rise to much questioning about the direction of current trends in British education. The report revealed that in one year pupils taught by formal methods can be as much as five months in advance educationally of those taught by the free style."
