        "A psychic parrot appears on television to announce that the world will end at midnight Friday. The President decides to send a rocket to the moon with a selected group of people on board so that the human race will survive. The build-up and drama in the days preceding the final events are dutifully reported by television and received by Henrietta (Alix Elias) and Fred (Michael Vale), stereotyped apartment dwellers who formulate their judgements while they experience life through television's perceptual filter."
