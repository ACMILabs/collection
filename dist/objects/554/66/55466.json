        "Examines the art event by Bulgarian artsist Christo, of wrapping a section of the Little Bay coastline near Sydney. As the wrapping progresses, the coastline takes on a glacial appearance, changes to a wrapped bundle, and is finally ripped apart by the force of the wind. Narrated by Kevin McCarthy, photographed and edited by Christian Blackwood."
