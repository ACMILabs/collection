        "Its the machine age, computers are taking over - reducing the workforce and increasing productivity. The unemployed can't afford to buy the products produced and therefore the company can't sell its products and is losing money. To make money they cull more workers, bring in more machines and again more unemployed who can't afford to buy. A satirical look at the effects of computers. Cast includes Martin Vaughan, Michael Ross, Ray Anderson, Tony Llewellyn-Jones."
