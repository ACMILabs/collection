        "Episode of Series \"World in action\". An American defence lawyer argues that his 15 year-old client is not guilty of murder. The plea is insanity, caused by exposure to television violence. The trial is the first major trial to be televised live during the proceedings. The case for and against this radical experiment is examined. A landmark use of television cameras inside a courtroom...an interesting overview and outcome from 1976. Suitable for upper secondary level."
