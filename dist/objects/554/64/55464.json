        "This film attempts to correct the view that chemistry only takes place in the laboratory. Two examples from Japan are used showing a volcanic lake found to be the most acidic in the world and the spectacular production of sulphur from gases emitted by volcanic vents. An explanation of the processes involved is demonstrated using laboratory equipment in the field. Discussion pauses are provided. Suitable for secondary level."
