        "A non-narrated impression of the Royal visit to Melbourne, in the Queen's Jubilee year, in 1977. Showing behind the scene preparations by the Army and Navy personnel, news crews, teachers and school children. The actual event is intercut with students from McRobertson Girls High School and Melbourne High School conducting a debate about the role of the Monarchy in Australia, touching on the issue of republic as an alternative. A good discussion starter on a 'hot' issue. (Includes shot of the half-built Westgate Bridge and Melbourne city skyline)."
