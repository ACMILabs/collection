        "Set in a school, this delightful piece makes very effective use of setting and the familiarity of its audience to the trials and tribulations of two unlikely heroes in their ever-hopeful and competitive quest for love. The well-developed script and voice-over establishes an affectionate, playful tone complemented by the scenarios in which the lead characters find themselves."
