        "Ten locals from the East Gippsland region in south-eastern Victoria tell their stories of survival during the fierce bushfires that swept the area in the summer of 2006-2007. Weeks of preparation and anticipation helped lessen the devastation but in no way eliminated the horror and heartache of living through a time when not only livelihood is in the hands of mother nature, but lives."
