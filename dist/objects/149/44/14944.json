        "Garry Hammer and his family battle the Gippsland bushfires to save their home. Garry's story is a personal account of the fire front that swept through his property, creating its own weather, a life-threatening yet positive force that ultimately gave him a new perspective on his life and his relationship with his son. This Digital Storytelling project was created  in partnership with Arts Victoria and Latrobe City."
