        "The purely abstract \"A Colour Box\" was Len Lye's first experiment with painting in colour directly onto celluloid. After its initial release in 1935, John Grierson acquired the film for the United Kingdom General Post Office, and it was re-released in 1937 as an advertisement, with the addition of a \"cheaper parcel post\" message. Note: this film has been restored by the National Film and Television Archive (UK) from Lye's original material using the Eastmancolor process."
