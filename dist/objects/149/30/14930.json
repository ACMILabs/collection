    "description": [
        "The backyard shed is an Australian icon. It may appear, to the unenlightened, to be a tacked-together corrugated iron structure full of junk, nails and spiders. In truth, it has become a peculiarly Australian horde of stories and myths about isolation, masculinity, identity, capability, self esteem, tradition and even passionate obsession. It is history on a very human scale, a one-person size record of a life. There is a mystery to a shed, with dark corners; yet grace, too in odd and unexpected ways. By talking to the owners and occupiers of twelve vastly diverse sheds all over South Australia, 'Blokes and Sheds' casts a gentle enquiring light into those cobwebbed nooks and crannies to tease out many paradoxes and passions. Each shed is the setting for its owner to open their hearts and share their stories in these twelve, two-minute documentaries. Based on the book by Mark Thomson."
