        "Photographed during the last few months prior to British evacuation from Abadan, the film shows the magnitude of the Persian oil operations. Shows the barren nature of the countryside, the enormous amount of work done n developing the resources of the oil field, the extent of the pipelines across the desert and the refinery at Abadan, and something of the life of both Persian and British in the refinery city."
