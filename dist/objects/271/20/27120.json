        "An outstanding film conveying impressions of one day in \"The Age\" newspaper office in Melbourne. This early film by noted Australian director Fred Schepisi, uses dramatic photography and natural sound to capture the atmosphere of the office, and records all the phases in the production of the paper: the collection of news stories, the lay-out, the printing and the eventual distribution. The camera work is by Peter Purvis."
