        "A film of contrasts: a workingman's family living today against the magnificent background of Venice's past. Tony Biasi and one of his sons repair the big diesel boats that transport passengers on the canals. Sergio, another son of school age, enjoys the everyday life of a Venetian boy, helping a friend transport vegetables, rowing on the canals, and helping with family chores."
