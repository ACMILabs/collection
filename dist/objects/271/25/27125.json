        "Covers the history and the peoples of Peru. Of a population of 7,000,000 a third are Indian, a third are mixed blood, and a third are white. Glimpses are given of the lives of these people in their various civilizations. The topography of the country is very varied from perpetual snow in the Andes to desert country where it only rains once in 20-30 years at the coast. Lima the capital was founded by the Spaniards in 1535 ad had many fine architectural features in a lavish mediaeval style."
