        "The film follows the reconstruction of the Greensborough footbridge after the original cable suspension bridge was swept away in the River Plenty floods of 1974. The Shire of Diamond Valley contracted B.C.S. Consulting Engineers and Surveyors and Gibbs Bright & Co, timber suppliers to rebuild the bridge. The Greensborough Bridge is unique in that it is the first structure of its kind to be made of pine, is the longest footbridge in Australia and was aesthetically designed to blend in perfect harmony with its rural surroundings."
