        "An animated film of simple geometric forms, as thin and flat as playing cards, but so arranged that a sense of perspective is conveyed. The effect is somewhat like the patterns seen in a kaleidoscope, but much more active, forming and re-forming constantly to the music. The koto, a thirteen-stringed Japanese instrument, is played by plucking the strings; the sound has a tinkling effect, well-suited to the glasslike shapes of the moving designs. A film without words."
