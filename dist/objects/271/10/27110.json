        "Observes the habits of the various species of penguins which live on Macquarie Island. The film was compiled from record material photographed by members of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition and officers of the CSIRO. The penguins are seen marching to and from their rookeries, assembling on the beach, looking after their young, and at play. Various features, which distinguish one species from another, are illustrated."
