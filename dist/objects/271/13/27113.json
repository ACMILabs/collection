        "Episode of Series \"American Enterprise\". Tom Novak, community college professor of Ethnic Studies, visits Ellis Island, where he reminisces about the early immigrants (16 million between 1890 and 1930) who helped shape America. Novak introduces us to some of their descendants in their homes and businesses. Japanese florists in California, Portuguese fishermen in Massachusetts and an Afro-American family in Long Island are featured. Narrated by William Shatner."
