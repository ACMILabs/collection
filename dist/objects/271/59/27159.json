        "A discussion of periodic motions by Patterson Hume and Donald Ivey, considering mainly simple harmonic motion. Demonstrates a self-plotted displacement time graph from which graphs of velocity and acceleration versus time are derived. Explains the derivation of the formula for the period of simple harmonic motion and demonstrates dynamics and period."
