        "Episode of Series \"People of the Seal\". The second of two co-productions by the British Broadcasting Corporation and the National Film Board of Canada, People of the Seal, Part 2: Eskimo Winter is compiled from some of the most vivid footage ever filmed of the life of the Netsilik Inuit in the Pelly Bay region of the Canadian Arctic. Together, the two films provide insight and understanding of a culture now almost vanished, as they show the incredible resourcefulness of the Netsilik (People of the Seal) who have adapted to one of the world's harshest environments. Part 2: Eskimo Winter shows how Inuit families gather in communities on the sea ice to harpoon seal as they come up through breathing holes in the ice. Also seen is the mid-winter season, a time of intense socialising in the communal igloo, with games, contests and ceremonial activities. (Awards: Salerno; Trento) Narrated by Alexander Scourby"
