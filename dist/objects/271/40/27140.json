        "This charming fantasy of two young brothers and the messy green concoction which transforms them for a moment into a chicken and a large sheepdog is presented with a child's wide-eyed trust and conviction. Their conversation concerning ingredients and their coming to terms for participation in the experiment are hilarious. Written and directed by noted film-maker and actor, Alan Arkin, and using his two sons as actors."
