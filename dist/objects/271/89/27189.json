        "Don't let the titles fool you - this thinly disguised documentary has little to do with people and their pets. Rather it is a piece of shameless promotion of Uncle Ben's pet food. At times the film also looks at Albury - Wodonga - however one comes to realise that such a focus is looked at only in terms of Uncle Ben's community involvement. Once you locate the essence of the film, what you see that is really about is a decentralised industry, quality control and general propaganda."
