        "Episode of Series \"Man Alive\". Talks with people who have faced the dilemma of whether to sacrifice themselves looking after dependent relatives or hand the responsibility to the authorities. They have chosen the way of family loyalty, a strangely strong call of duty. The problem of dependents is one which has concerned society for a long time. In the end the responsibility lies with the individual - a member of the family. They are the \"people in chains\"."
