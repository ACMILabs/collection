        "With industrialisation in Britain, more people have more time to spend on leisure activities. Made in Co-operation with The Countryside in 1970 Movement, this film examines the growing pressures that increased opportunities for leisure activities bring, particularly among people living in cities. Describes the problems that result from too many people attempting to utilise the inadequate facilities and the impact these pressures put on the countryside generally. Discusses the need for proper planning of future recreational facilities."
