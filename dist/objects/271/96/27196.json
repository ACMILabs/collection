        "The construction and use of phase diagrams and why they are a critical part of understanding how igneous rocks form. Deals with the construction and use of phase diagrams. Demonstrates how a simple diagram can be built and extended to three component systems. Step by step a three-dimensional phase diagram using three binary eutectics is constructed. Shows how phase diagrams can contribute to our understanding of how igneous rocks form, and demonstrates both basalt and granite systems."
