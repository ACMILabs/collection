        "Artist-activist group Boat-people.org organised large scale projection of their logo image - an Endeavour style Tall Ship above the words \"boat people\" on the side of the Sydney Opera House in October 2001. This is rough video footage of the projection and a security guard asking them to leave. There is an interview with organiser Deborah Kelly. This is a preview tape only, documentation of an event.  Second part of tape shows street protest, dance, parade, details unclear."
