        "A family visits their grandmother, who is in a nursing home, on Christmas Day. Peege, as they call their grandmother, is nearly blind and her mental and physical capacities are failing. Through a number of flashbacks the eldest grandson remembers her as she was when he was a child - full of vitality and laughter. When the others leave he talks to her of the old times, and breaks through her isolation. Cast includes Bruce Davison, Jeanette Nolan, William Shallert, Barry Livingston, David Alan Bailey, Barbara Rush."
