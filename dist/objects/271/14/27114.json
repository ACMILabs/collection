        "The adventures of a toy boat, released at the source of the Mississippi River are used to show the work of the people living along the course of the river and the heritages that these people have brought to America from their former homeland. A French-Canadian boy launches the boat, marked with his name and address. From along the river he receives letters telling of the adventures of this boat: from a Chippewa boy, from Swedish-American towboat captain; from a boy descended from early German migrants, from a girl who is a descended from the pioneers who came west, from a Negro and white boy on the cotton land of the South and from a girl living on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico."
