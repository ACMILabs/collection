    "description": [
        "Not many people know that the Melbourne International Film Festival was born at Olinda on the Australia Day weekend in January 1952, when a group of die-hard film buffs found that the only way they could see the European and Asian films they craved was to organise their own film festival. This documentary, filmed at the 50th Melbourne International Film Festival opening night, provides a fascinating glimpse of a significant event in Australian film culture through interviews, archival footage and stills."
