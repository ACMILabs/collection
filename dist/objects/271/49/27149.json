        "Episode of Series \"Psychology\". This film presents the theory that perception is not merely the sensing of stimuli but is a set of elaborate processes through which we organise our sensory impressions into meaningful pictures of the objects and events around us. The basic principles that support the theory are illustrated by the activities of a group of students relaxing in a common room."
