        "A tour of Hampton Court Palace, which has been open to the public for over a century. Visitors are seen relaxing in this pleasant and historic setting, buying grapes from the ancient Great Vine, watching \"real tennis\" on the original court and viewing a 400-year old astronomical clock. We see something of the events associated with the Guard Room, the Haunted Gallery, the Chapel Royal and the Great Hall."
