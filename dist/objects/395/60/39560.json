        "Assigned to an abandoned army post, Civil War hero, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) finds himself alone and beyond civilisation. Only a wolf and some roving Sioux Indians provide distractions. Curiosity and survival force Dunbar to overcome his fear and he develops a unique relationship with the Sioux. But as the US military ruthlessly pushes west, the Indians' existence is threatened and Dunbar finds himself torn between two cultures. Honoured with seven Academy Awards including Best Picture (1991), this epic is a cinematic masterpiece of scope, beauty, spirituality and rousing adventure. Dean Semler's photography is breathtaking. Screenplay by Michael Blake and based on his novel."
