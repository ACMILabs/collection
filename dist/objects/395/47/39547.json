        "Staged and directed by Werner Herzog, conducted by Peter Schneider, starring Manfred Schenk as King Henry, Paul Frey as Lohengrin and Cheryl Studer as Elsa. This romantic opera in three acts was first performed at Weimar on August 28, 1950. The action occurs in Antwerp 933 A.D. and is a love story with a peculiarly poignant ending. Elsa, the wilful daughter of King Henry of Saxony is wrongly accused of the murder of her brother. She prays to heaven for a handsome and courageous Knight to be her champion, and save her from certain death. Her prayers are answered, a miracle occurs and the handsome and mysterious Lohengrin, Knight of the Holy Grail, appears, heralded by a white swan, wearing a silver coat of mail, shining helmet and carrying a golden horn. He agrees to champion her on the condition that she never asks his country, name or rank but trusts in his abilities and his love for her. A magnificent marriage ceremony follows which includes the traditional bridal march which is still heard in many weddings. However, Elsa's inability to trust in her champion leads to the inevitable and tragic end of this epic love story."
