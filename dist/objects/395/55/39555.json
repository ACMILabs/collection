        "Winner of five Academy Awards, this is an inspiring yet heart-breaking film from producer Darryl Zanuck and director John Ford. Sixty year old Huw Morgan looks back on his life as a boy (Roddy McDowall) in a small Welsh mining town. His reminiscences reveal the disintegration of the closely knit Morgans, and his devoted parents (Donald Crisp, Sara Allgood), while capturing the sentiments and issues of their time. Maureen O'Hara and Walter Pidgeon co-star in this acclaimed classic, the story of one family's dreams, struggles and triumphs. Based on the famous novel by Richard Llewellyn. Includes performances by the Welsh Singers."
