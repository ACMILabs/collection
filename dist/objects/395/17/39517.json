        "Norman McLaren completed 60 films during his 50 year career. His films are a galaxy of techniques and themes. This compilation of fourteen films, many made in collaboration with Evelyn Lambart and Grant Munro, is a companion piece to \"Creative process\" a documentary about his life and work, and presents a selection of works that reflect the diversity of his movie-making interests, from films made without a camera to films impossible without advanced film technology. Each film is preceded by a brief summary of the technique used."
