        "Episode of Series \"Music maestro\". Blessed with a divine gift enabling him to create great works with apparent ease, Mozart left a musical legacy of enormous wealth. His own rewards however were less than just - a lifetime of constant financial anxiety and an early grave. This program explores the life and works of one of the world's greatest composers, narrated by conductor/composer David Palmer. The works performed by internationally renowned artists include: 'Marriage of Figaro Overture', 'Eine Kleine Nacht Musik', Piano Concertos No. 12 & 21, 'Horn Concerto No.4', 'Symphony No. 40', \"The Clarinet Concerto', aria 'Come Scoglio', 'The Flute and Harp Concerto' and more."
