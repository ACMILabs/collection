        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Six wives of Henry VIII\". After his stormy and fatal relationship with Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII falls in love with her absolute antithesis - the shy and devout Jane Seymour. Calm, serene, gentle and giving, she comforts and cherishes her king with loyalty and love - she even bears him a son. But the lives of both Jane and her child soon come to a tragic end."
