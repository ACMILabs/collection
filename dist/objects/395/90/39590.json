        "Peter and the Wolf is a long-established classic, but never before has it enjoyed such an unusual and exicitng visual treatment. This production features Claudio Abbado, Roy Hudd (as Prokofiev) and members of the Theatre de Complicite, and introduces Henry Feagins as Peter and some fantastic new 'Spitting Image' puppets. The result is a delightful visualization of the Russian composer and his universally beloved musical tale. Filled with hilarious caricature, this Prokofiev Fantasy mixes inspired puppetry with live action. Behind it is Sting's riveting narration and, of course, Prokofiev's immortal music - the Classical Symphony and Overture on Hebrew Themes as well as Peter and the Wolf - in bravura performances by The Chamber Orchestra of Europe conducted by Claudio Abbado."
