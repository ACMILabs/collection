        "The wandering albatross is the largest and most majestic of all sea birds, but until recently little was known about them. This program looks at the work of a team of French scientists on the Crozet Islands, south of South Africa, and their discoveries about this remarkable bird, as well as the teeming summer wildlife of the islands. Narrated by David Attenborough."
