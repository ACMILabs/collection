        "Suitable for ages 2-8. Illustrations from the books are brought alive through animation and iconographic techniques. The stories range from a variation on the Hansel and Gretel theme where three boys venture too far into a forest inhabited by an evil witch-woman, to nine cats bearing a coffin through a foreboding cemetery with the gravedigger's cat growing restless, to a journey on a dark, dark moor, through a dark, dark wood. Honoured by award after award at film festivals all over the world, this series of programs are the perfect bridge between video and children's reading. Titles contained in this volume: \"Teeny-Tiny and the witch woman\"; \"Attic of the wind\"; \"King of the cats\"; \"What's under my bed?\"; \"Goggles!\"; \"A Dark, dark tale\"."
