        "A selection of seven prize winning films reflecting a range of subjects and techniques that established the National Film Board's reputation in the field of animation. 1.'Begone Dull Care' (Norman McLaren 7 mins) Jazz music performed by the Oscar Peterson Trio is visually represented in a series of abstract lines and shapes. 2.'The Street' (Caroline Leaf 10mins) Draws on the experiences of a young boy growing up in the Jewish section of Montreal. 3.'Special Delivery' (John Weldon and Eunice Macaulay 7 mins) A series of misadventures stretches the imagination to its limits in this detective/soap opera. 'The Metamorphosis of Mr Samsa' (Caroline Leaf 9 mins) Communicates through images of sand and sound what Franz Kafka expressed through words. 'The Big Snit' (Richard Condie 9 mins) Compares the struggle of a domestic row to the conflict of a nuclear holocaust. 'Paradise' (Ishu Patel 15 mins) A Divine Bird performs a magical dance for an adoring Emperor. 'The Cat came back' (Cordell Barker 7 mins) Mr Johnson becomes increasingly manic as he tries to get rid of a yellow cat."
