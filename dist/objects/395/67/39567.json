        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Six wives of Henry VIII\". The story of Henry VIII's marriage to the rawboned Anne of Cleves is the story of an alliance between England and Germany, a pact between nations not persons, a political celebration without passionate consummation. But while the annulment of that marriage amounts to a corresponding escape from political dilemmas, it also means the parting of two close friends. Stars Keith Michell as Henry VIII."
