        "No Alternative is a collaboration between independent filmmakers and musicians dedicated to raising awareness of issues affecting people living with HIV and AIDS. The video combines live performances, poetry readings and experimental short films. Some highlights include Hal Hartley's evocative video for The Breeder's song \"Iris\"; Tamara Davis' documentary on the Riot Girls music scene (featuring Courtney Love, Kim Gordon and Huggy Bear); Lou Reed reading his poem \"Busload of Faith\"; Jennie Livingston's tribute to lesbian comedy (with music by the Smashing Pumpkins); and Derek Jarman's poetic super-8 short film based on Patti Smith's memorial to Robert Mapplethorpe. Music is provided by The Breeders, Smashing Pumpkins, Neneh Cherry, Urge Overkill, Suede, Buffalo Tom and an uncredited Nirvana. This exceptional video manages to be challenging, musically innovative, and informative."
