        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Six wives of Henry VIII\". The second in this critically acclaimed series. For all her passion, pride and intelligence, Anne Boleyn is too possessive, ambitious and strong willed to conform to the role requirements demanded of her as Queen of England. Wanting everything and unwilling to be subservient the second wife of the omnipotent king moves towards a shine to the end."
