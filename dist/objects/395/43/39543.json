        "Why do zebras have stripes? Why do broncos buck? How do horses manage to stand so still for hours? The horse. Its power and grace has stirred the human emotions for hundreds of years. From its exotic Arabian relatives to the show performances of the perfect thoroughbred, man's love for the horse is undying. But how well does man understand these equine creatures? In this captivating documentary, Desmond Morris shows that underneath the stripes, the wild exteriors and the tutored perfection, different breeds are much the same animal. A horse lovers delight, this unique video journeys from the African plains to the wild Navaho desert, exploring the nature and habits of all breeds of horse, showing the wild animal that lurks beneath the domesticity."
