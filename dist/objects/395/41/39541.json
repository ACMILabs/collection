        "Four young adults in their early 20s who are deaf come together to view a video that was made of them six years earlier. They reflect on their past and describe their lives over the years since. They talk about their families, their work, and their special interests. Through this discussion, and re-enactments, we learn about the things they have discovered in their transition from school to adult life, their feelings and experiences, and the things that they would like to say to young deaf students, their teachers and parents, and the community at large."
