        "Narrated by Richard Morecroft these two documentaries introduce and examine the lives of some of Australia's unique wildlife. \"Lizards of Oz\" explores the desert world of these little known creatures and examines how so many different species are able to co-exist in this seemingly inhospitable environment. Dragons, devils, goannas, geckos, legless lizards and skinks abound in this fasinating look at some of our small neighbours. \"Wombats: bulldozers of the bush\" examines the myths and reality of wombat life both above and below ground. Found only in and under Australia the poor- eyesighted wombat is mostly nocturnal, however these survivors of an ancient marsupial family - one member of which was as big as a cow, continue to suffer at human hands, blamed for damaging fences and fouling pastures."
