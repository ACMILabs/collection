        "Director Ken Russell, (Tommy, Altered States, Crimes of Passion), gave the world notice he was a major filmmaking force with \"Women in love\", based on D.H. Lawrence's erotic, mesmerising classic novel set in 1920's England. Nominated for four Oscars (1970) including Best Direction, \"Women in love\" remarkably brings D.H. Lawrence's complex characters to life. Alan Bates, Jennie Linden, Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson are superb in their portrayal of the mismatched pairs swept up in love, lust, inhibition, rage, jealousy and hate with the then little-known Glenda Jackson winning an Academy Award for her role. \"Women in love\" is a feast for the emotions, the eyes and the mind."
