        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Six wives of Henry VIII\". Having been forced to marry the gross and ageing King, Catherine Parr then finds herself protesting accusations of heresy. But the unpretentious Queen rises above the storm and proves to be the only wife whose courageous honesty, directness and shining intellect endear rather than anger King Henry. She is also the only wife to survive her marriage and outlive the most notorious king in history."
