        "As seen on the ABC's \"Behind The News\" program, this video looks at the ways in which Australia's native wildlife habitat has been altered by urban development. It also examines the ways in which students and teachers can learn about and value their local fauna. \"Our hidden neighbours\" is an introduction to native wildlife in urban areas and highlights the effect of urban development on wildlife. \"Nocturnal visitors\" looks at some of the native nocturnal wildlife found in urban areas. \"The Feral menace\" explores the problems that introduced animal species have caused for native wildlife. \"Attracting wildlife\" shows ways of attracting wildlife to your own backyard."
