        "Based on Peter Mayles' best selling novel, Peter and his wife Annie decide to take \"Le Plunge\" and abandon the rat-race of England to live in an old farmhouse at the foot of the Luberon Mountains in Provence. Coping with the language and the idiosyncratic behaviour and customs of the locals form the basis of their daily life."
