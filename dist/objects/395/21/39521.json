        "A joyous celebration of Luciano Pavarotti's sensational 1986 China tour. The beauty of Pavarotti's soaring voice combines with the cultural magic of imperial China to reaffirm the universality of art through the glories of Italian opera. Accompanied by the Genoa Opera Company, with whom performed 'La Boheme', Pavarotti's natural gregariousness and great talent make him a larger-than-life presence and a perfect ambassador of culture and good will."
