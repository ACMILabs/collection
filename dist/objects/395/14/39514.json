        "Adapted from the novel of the same name by Bibhutibhusan Banerji, this is the first part of Satyajit Ray's renowned trilogy of films about Apu, the son of a would-be writer in a small Bengal village, who grows up in poverty before setting off with what remains of his family to seek a living in Benares. It shows Apu as a young boy experiencing his first taste of the delights and tragedies of life. The film is universally regarded as a great work of poetic cinema. Music provided by Ravi Shankar. Bengali dialogue with English subtitles."
