        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Animals of Farthing Wood\". The first of the animated adventures of the Animals of Farthing Wood. It is Kestrel who brings the dreadful news - the humans are filling in the pond. It is the latest and most terrible in a series of blows to hit the animals that live in Farthing Wood. With no source of fresh water, they will surely die. So Fox, that most trustworthy and most sensible of animals, summons a special meeting - the Farthing Wood Assembly. With animals coming from the farthest corners of the Wood - from bashful Mole to spiteful Adder - the Assembly agrees that they must follow Toad's advice and head for the nature reserve at White Deer Park. Having all sworn a Vow of Mutual Protection the animals set off - they have a long, long way to go with many adventures ahead of them..."
