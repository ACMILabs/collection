        "For children of all ages. This program of stories brings alive actual illustrations from the original books, through animation and 'iconographic' techniques. Some of the stories range from a small boy playing with a dinosaur after visiting the museum, to the tale of the serpent Goorialla and his journey across Australia, to a tadpole that is not quite what it seems. Honoured by film festival awards world-wide, these stories are the perfect bridge between video and children's reading. Titles contained in this volume are: \"Danny and the dinosaur\"; \"Jonah and the great fish\"; \"The Beast of Monsieur Racine\"; \"The Rainbow serpent\"; \"The Mysterious tadpole\"."
