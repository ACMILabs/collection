        "Godard's controversial reputation as one of the revolutionaries of film art is due to his use of film and video as mediums of philosophical investigation. This film is an essay which explores the relationships between the Western world and the developing world; the Parisian working class and the Gaulist government; US cultural imperialism and the Vietnam War; and the politics that occur when a male director explores the meaning of \"woman\". If all this sounds obscure, difficult and pretentious, it is, but it is also exciting, challenging and powerful. At one point in the film a narrator imagines a synthesis of poetry and painting. \"2 or 3 Things I know about her\" achieves this synthesis in some of the most dazzling scenes ever filmed. What is this film? Literature or sociology? Documentary or essay? A poem or a lecture? Whatever it is, it is one of the most unique and audacious works in the history of cinema. In French with English subtitles."
