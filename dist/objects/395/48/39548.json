        "This first film of writer, actor, director Craig Hoogendoorn, revolves around the cafe conversations of three groups of people - the lovers in the midst of a breakup, the male whining to the female about his ex-girlfriend's behaviour and the three friends celebrating single life. Shot in black and white the camera plays back and forth between the three groups, catching their conversations in mid-flight. Witty and technically faultless, the film is a promising debut for this young Canberra based filmmaker."
