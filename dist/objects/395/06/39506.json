        "Norman McLaren was a cinematic genius who made films without cameras, and music without instruments. He produced sixty films in a stunning range of styles and techniques, collecting over 200 international awards and world recognition. Drawing on McLaren's private film vaults, a gold mine of experimental footage and uncompleted films, Donald McWilliams explores McLaren's methods, including his celebrated 'pixillation' techniques, and his daring forays into animated surrealism. He reveals sources of McLaren's creativity and shows how they were transformed into cinema. \"At last something new in the art of drawing!\" said Picasso upon seeing \"Hen hop\". This film shows us why."
