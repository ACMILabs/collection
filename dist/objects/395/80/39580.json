        "Bart Cummings, Colin Hayes and Tommy Smith, Australia's legendary trio of racehorse trainers. Their notoriety extends beyond the profession they have dominated for decades. Each of them possess a natural affinity with the horse: individually gifted with that enigmatic sixth sense. Record breaking achievements distinguish them from their contemporaries by the length of the Flemington straight. Their amazing winning formula applies not to hundreds of races, but thousands. Between them they've won 73 Derbies, 50 Oaks, 11 Cox Plates, 13 Melbourne Cups and 11 Golden Slippers. This is their success story."
