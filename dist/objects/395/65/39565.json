        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Six wives of Henry VIII\". The first episode of the unforgettable historical series starring Keith Michell in his outstanding portrayal as King Henry VIII. With her enormous love for her husband and her unflinching loyalty to her people and to her faith, Catherine of Aragon should have been the perfect Queen - but she was unable to bear King Henry a surviving son. Subjected to the humiliation of divorce proceedings she manages to maintain her integrity with a grand and touching defiance and with a quiet compelling dignity."
