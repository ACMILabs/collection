        "A satiric and explicit look at the battle of the sexes, examining how a man and a woman relate to each other when they are literally 'bound' together. Ricky (Antonio Banderas), a 23 year old ex-psychiatric patient chooses for his wife, Marina (Victoria Abril), a B-grade and porn movie queen with whom he spent a night during one of his many escapes from the institution. But when Ricky visits Marina on the set of her new movie, she doesn't even recognise him. He figures that his only option is to kidnap her, confident that she will fall in love with him. An audacious and startlingly strangely funny film from Almodovar. Spanish dialogue with English subtitles."
