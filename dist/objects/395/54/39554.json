        "As the famous theme plays under the opening credits, the tone is set for this powerful, historical drama. Based upon Leon Uris' international bestseller, \"Exodus\" chronicles the plight of post-war Jews in their fight to establish a homeland in Israel. Paul Newman gives a compelling performance as a resistance fighter who challenges British authority and brings Jewish refugees into Palestine. Eva Marie Saint is the compassionate American nurse who joins the cause. Their relationship grows as the events of the independence movement swirl around them, and when Sal Mineo, a young Auschwitz survivor, joins in terrorist acts against the British, the screen explodes with tension-filled excitement. Filmed on location in Cyprus and Palestine, this epic drama received several Academy Award nominations and won for Best Score. Also stars Ralph Richardson, John Derek, Peter Lawford and Lee J. Cobb."
