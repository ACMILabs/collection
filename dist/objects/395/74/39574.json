        "Episode of Series \"Music maestro\". Bach remained a provincial musician all his life and had such faith in his creative work that he devoted himself to it absolutely, to the virtual exclusion of all else. His output was prodigious, and mostly religious, as the majority of his patrons were churches. This program features a selection of his most well-known works played by The Moscow Symphony Orchestra, with narrative interludes and subtitles, which describe his life and times, as well as illustrations from portraits, etchings and feature films. Accompanied by a compact disc of the works featured."
