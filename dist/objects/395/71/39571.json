        "Episode of Series \"Music maestro\". Music came naturally and easily to Mendelssohn. He rarely had to struggle to find harmony or structure and his clarity, melody and feeling established him as one of the great masters of the music world. This program explores the character of the man and builds a picture of his life and times. Using feature film shorts, stunning period images and a masterful narrative by conductor/composer David Palmer, combined with superb performances by internationally renowned artists, this forms a lasting record of the the life and works of one of the world's greatest composers. Features excerpts from his works including 'Violin Concerto E Minor', 'Scottish Symphony', 'Hebrides Overture', 'Wedding March' from 'Midsummer Night Dream', 'Italian Symphony' and more."
