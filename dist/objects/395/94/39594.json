        "Years before television bought the news into our loungeroom, the Cinesound and Movietone news delighted and informed the cinema goers of Australia. This video contains news stories from the 1950's including Australia at war with Korea, the Redex Trial in 1955 and the filming of Neville Shute's \"On the beach\" in Melbourne."
