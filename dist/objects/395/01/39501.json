        "Acrylic paints and mediums are the most versatile and permanent materials available to artists today. The range of techniques is astounding. In this tape artist Russell Woody will show you the basics in creating oil-like tactile heavy painting, acrylic watercolours, marbling applications, collage and decoupage, through textile to sculpture. He will also detail all the basic rules for the use of supports, grounds and the use of the varied acrylic mediums. This tape is a practical, fast paced, easy to understand guide to all that acrylics can do."
