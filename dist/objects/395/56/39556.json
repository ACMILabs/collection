        "When a bigshot self-absorbed talkback radio host, Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges), loses his job after a tragedy, he is plucked from disaster by the most improbable of saviours - a former history professor (Robin Williams), driven mad and onto the streets where he lives in a remarkable medieval world full of swords and sorcery, terrifying Red Knights and damsels in distress. This film serves grand lunacy and wisdom of the highest order with rare vision and style."
