        "Episode of Series \"Human development: 2 1/2 to 6 years\". This episode explores two major approaches to cognitive development: Piaget's theory and the examination of the basic cognitive processes involved in problem solving. In understanding how children think, from the concepts of \"magical thought\" where children implicitly accept that what an adult says will happen, and where the seperation of fact from fantasy is not clear to a child, to the more complex and abstract thought processes used by older children, the development of the child as a confident thinking individual can be traced."
