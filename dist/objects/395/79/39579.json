        "The monsoon season is the most dramatic of all seasons in Australia, but each year it is different. \"The Big wet\" is the chronicle of a particularly wet monsoon in the tropical north. It starts with the last days of the dry in September and concludes with the first fires in April. The film looks at the effect it has on all living things in the Top End, particularly the salt-water crocodile, the wallabies and the magpie goose. Featured throughout the program is the majestic scenery of Kakadu and Arnhem Land. Narrated by John Waters."
