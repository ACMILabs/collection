        "Narrated by Robert Powell, this is the remarkable story of the unique dancing collaboration of Margot Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev that brought joy to millions around the world. Thought by many to be the most sensational partnership ever, it is certainly one against which all others will be judged. Theirs was a collaboration of two very contrasting personalities. Fonteyn, an experienced ballerina, idolized already for her own achievements and for whom stardom seemed an effortless progression. Nureyev, half her age and relatively unknown, had to thrust his way into a dancing career against the advice of family and friends. This wonderful voyage through their careers together is filled with the opinions and reminisces of the friends and contemporaries and some rare and intimate footage of the perfect partners. It includes performances from the ballets; Romeo and Juliet, Le Corsaire, Giselle, Swan Lake, Marguerite and Armand, Les Sylphides, Birthday Offering, Hamlet Prelude and Lucifer."
