        "Two hundred years ago bands of whalers roamed the oceans. In the Great Southern Land of Australia they discovered natives who cherished a mystical power called the Dreaming - a knowledge handed down from the beginning of their world. The whalers were bloodthirsty men, responsible for rapes killings and massacres - a taint upon the Dreaming. This taint lives on into the present and a new nightmare when a burial ground is unearthed, a girl dies, an ancient curse is revived and a young doctor becomes inextricably involved in a chain of supernatural events that point towards death. Starring Arthur Dignam, Penny Cook, Gary Sweet, Laurence Clifford and Kristina Nehm. Based on a story by Craig Lahiff and Terry Jennings."
