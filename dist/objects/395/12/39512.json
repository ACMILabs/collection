        "Spoken in Italian dialogue with English subtitles. Covering the period from the Allied landings in Sicily in 1943 to the Liberation in 1945, Paisa is a film in six episodes. Each deals with a different aspect of the war in Italy; from the personal, (a drunken G.I. visits a prostitute and fails to recognise her as the young girl with whom he'd fallen in love only months earlier), to the field of battle itself, (brutal partisan warfare in Florence and the marshlands of the Po Delta). Following on from \"Rome, Open City\", this was Rossellini's second great neo-realist work and is one of the peak's of film history. Stars Carmela Sazio, Robert Ban Loon, Dots M. Johnson, Maria Michi, Gar Moore, Harriet White, Renzo Avanzo, Bill Tubbs, Dale Edmonds."
