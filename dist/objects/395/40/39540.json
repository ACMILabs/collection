        "This video, volume one in a two volume set looks at the Great Barrier Reef from top to bottom, above and below the water, its past and its future. The reef itself is actually a chain of thousands of coral reefs and billions of life forms, stretching more than 2,000 kilometres down the East Coast of Australia, from Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland to Fraser Island near the border of northern New South Wales. This is a definitive journey into the world's largest living organism - the Great Barrier Reef. With stunning aerial photography and magical underwater sequences you explore the natural wonder of Fraser Island, and the fragile ecology of the largest sand island in the world through to the unparalleled beauty of the Coral Cays that straddle the reef. Marvel at a myriad of unique and bizarre under-water species and experience spectacular footage deep within the world's most celebrated diving spots. The producers focus on the issue of the demands of people versus the need to preserve forever the overwhelming beauty of the Great Barrier Reef, in order that it be there for future generations to witness and enjoy!"
