        "Tony Robinson, (Baldrick in Blackadder), and Aardman animator Peter Lord introduce a compilation of short animated films by student and professional animators which emphasise the need to care for our fragile planet and its resources. The aim is to make us think, rather than to preach, and as such would be a valuable resource in environmental education. Divided into three parts, the first sets the scene as we voyage through time and space. Part two emphasises the finiteness of resources and is full of anger, irony, fear and rampaging trees. Part three moves away from an implied pessimism to show us the light at the end of the tunnel with crazy notions of simplicity, moderation and reforestation as part of a global solution. The commentary by the two hosts provides an insight into the animation processes and the range of techniques and styles. The messages are often simple and swift, but they leave a lasting impression."
