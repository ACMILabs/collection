        "Did you know that pandas need to eat 45 kilos of bamboo each night in order to survive? Even a hundred years after its discovery, the Giant Panda is still a mystery. This special video explores the natural behaviour of the Giant Panda, filming its unique courtship rituals and the feeding and nurturing of its young. Narrated by David Attenborough, the secret life of the panda may shatter all your illusions."
