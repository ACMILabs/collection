        "This is a stunning visual journey through Australia's natural environment, accompanied by evocative and beautiful classical music with natural sound effects. Soar across harsh and unforgiving deserts, plunge into turbulent seas and delve into ancient, lush forests... be swept along with the sights and sounds of this majestic and beautiful land. Featuring the music of Tchaikovsky, Vivaldi, Mozart and other classical masters, this is an imaginative marriage of breathtaking images and sound."
