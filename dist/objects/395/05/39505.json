        "Starring Kazuo Hasegawa, a Japanese matinee idol, this is the story of a kabuki actor who plans a long suffering revenge on the men who drove his parents to suicide. A melodrama, this film jumps from the swooning romanticism of the kabuki and its traditional music to stylised action and Hollywood jazz. At the centre of this, Hasegawa brushes aside his advancing years and delivers performances of enduring skill and charm."
