        "Episode of Series \"Music maestro\". Adoring audiences, international acclaim and an independent fortune should have made Tchaikovsky a happy man. Unfortunatley they seemed only to add to the secret anguish of a tortured soul hiding dark secrets from the stifling high society of 19th Century Russia. Innovative and informative, this program explores the character of the man and builds a picture of his life and times. Using feature films inserts, stunning period images and a masterful narrative by conductor/composer David Palmer, combined with superb performances by internationally renowned artists, this is an unforgettable record of the life of one of the world's great composers. Featuring performances of such classics as: 1812 Overture, excerpts from Swan Lake, The Nutcracker Suite, the Slavonic March and more."
