        "The armoured battleships of the world's navies are undoubtedly the most awe-inspiring vessels ever to have sailed the seas. The battleship reigned supreme in naval warfare from the beginning of this century to 1945, and German rearmament ensured that the heavily-armed queen of the seas played a major part in World War II. This program includes archival footage covering Admiral Cunningham's fleet, led by HMS Warspite, in the Mediterranean, various other battleships in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and the D-Day landings as floating weapons platforms pounding shore-based enemy positions, and finally Japan's signing of their surrender on the USS Missouri. Narrated by Patrick Allan."
