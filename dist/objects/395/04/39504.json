        "This magnificent film was shot on location throughout Europe and North Africa with a multinational cast and crew. Producer/director Orson Welles plays Othello and considered it to be one of his best films. Sadly, the film was believed to be lost for over thirty years. Finally, the original nitrate negative was tracked down and using today's most innovative techniques, the film has been restored frame by frame to its original 91 minute director's cut. Now this film is finally accessible to whole new generations of movie audiences."
