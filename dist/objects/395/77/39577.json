        "The Last husky records the end of the era of sledge dogs in Antarctica. Featuring the final 600 km expedition of the huskies from Mawson Station, this fascinating program also documents the important contribution made to polar exploration by these hardy working dogs over the last 100 years, but times have changed. In 1991 an international agreement banned huskies from the region. As a result, in November 1992, the Australian huskies set off on an epic four week journey to their new home in Minnesota, U.S.A."
