        "Narrated by John Hurt, this beautifully photographed program introduces Fungi, a bottle-nosed dolphin who lives at the mouth of Dingle Harbour, County Kerry in south west Ireland. Fungi has been charming local people and visitors to County Kerry for six years, though why he came to the harbour is a mystery to locals and experts alike. We are introduced to local inhabitants who share their thoughts and feelings about Fungi and the precarious nature of the survival of dolphin's around the globe."
