        "The exotic, erotic, epic film version of Paul Bowles' celebrated novel, brought to life by one of the great masters of modern cinema, Bernardo Bertolucci. This is the extraordinary story of a husband and wife desperate to rekindle passion in their lives; daring to cross the border into a world where jealousy has no place, where sensuality knows no limits and where every fantasy is brought to light. Their journey will take them far from the civilised world into disaster and despair. Stars Debra Winger and John Malkovich."
