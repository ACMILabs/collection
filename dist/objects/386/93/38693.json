        "On a windswept battlement looming over a stormy sea, in a stone castle guarding a northern kingdom, a man stands alone, haunted by the mysteries of fate, love, violence, tenderness, revenge. Searching for the truth behind an evil deed which left his father dead and his mother sitting on a royal throne beside the murderer. Tortured by his inability to take action. Searching for his very soul. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. This lavish production directed by Franco Zeffirelli has assembled a cast to infuse the Shakespearian classic with a new light. Starring Mel Gibson as Hamlet opposite Glenn Close in the role of Gertrude and a supporting cast that includes, Alan Bates, Paul Scofield, Ian Holm and Helena Bonham-Carter as Ophelia."
