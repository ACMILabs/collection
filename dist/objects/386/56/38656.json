        "A sci-fi thriller with a difference. The crew aboard the space freighter Nostromo investigate a distress call and one of the crew brings back on board an Alien of unknown origin. In comparison to the technology dominated sterile world controlled by a computer, where no-one trusts anyone, the horror of the Alien is its very organic nature. Under Scott's direction this film is grippingly suspenseful and draws interesting parallels between the perfect inhumanity of the Alien and that of the company. Stars Sigourney Weaver, Dean Stanton and John Hurt."
