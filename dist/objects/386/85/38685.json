        "Mike Hayes presents this video which shows the immense variety of Australia's most important agricultural region, stretching from Queensland to South Australia. Not only is the area important agriculturally, but it is also an area of great beauty, rich in wildlife, history and folk lore. Produced for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission the program stresses that almost everybody in Australia is dependent in some way on this vast area and that therefore we should be working to prevent further degradation and repair some of the damage which has already been done."
