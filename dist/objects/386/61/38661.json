        "Episode of Series \"This Land Australia with Ted Egan\". A must for all railway enthusiasts; a journey into the past on trains from the \"golden age of steam\" and through some of Australia's most spectacular and breathtaking scenery. We ride the famous Zig Zag in the Blue Mountains (NSW), see three steam trains race side by side on modern suburban tracks in Sydney, watch Puffing Billy steaming its way through the Dandenong Ranges (Vic), then across to SA for an ambling trip on Australia's first public railway line - the old horse-drawn tram in Victor Harbour, the Pichi Richi railway in the Flinders Ranges and finally the ultimate - a trip on both the Old and the New Ghan across Central Australia providing a glimpse of the past and the future. Narrated by Ted Eagan."
