        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Faces of culture\". In order to make credible studies of other cultures, the anthropologist must undertake field work. This program details the work of Napoleon A. Chagnon with the Yanamamo Indians of Venezuela, with whom he lived for extended periods of time. Professor Chagnon stresses the need for the anthropologist to participate in the culture he is studying and to abide by its rules. He describes the methods of data collection which he used in order to build up a comprehensive picture of this society as it was before it would inevitably become contaminated by the outside world. Narrated by David Carradine."
