        "Join Babar in two more delightful episodes: 1. \"An Elephant's Best Friend\" - Lord Rataxes stops all pomegranate shipments from reaching Celesteville, but when Babar calls on the help of a warthog, Rataxes is suddenly willing to talk. 2. \"The Show Must Go On\" - Babar organises a world-class ballet to be performed in Celesteville, but the star of the show, a temperamental prima ballerina, causes problems for cast and crew. Based on the books by Jean and Laurent de Brunhoff."
