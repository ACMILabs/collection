        "Episode of Series \"The Storybook classics\". Since 1902, Rudyard Kipling's story of how the elephant got its trunk had delighted children with its playful use of language and sense of high adventure. The charming characterisations, Jack Nicholson's rich and savoury reading and Bobby McFerrin's extraordinary musical interpretation take us right to the edge of the great, grey-green, greasy Limpopo River where the insatiably curious baby elephant finds out what the crocodile likes for dinner. Adapted from the \"Just so stories\"."
