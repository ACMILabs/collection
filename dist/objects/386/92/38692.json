        "Episode number 19 of Series \"Faces of culture\". Man's quest for meaning, coupled with the idea of an ultimate reality beyond daily existence is evident in all societies. Religion explains the unknown, provides a common purpose and values for a community, helps weave all elements of society into one design and provides world views and belief systems that give meaning to all that humanity is and does. Religions can express harmony and balance, as with the North American Indians and Balinese Hinduism. Religions can be modified as cultures interact, can descend into magic and shamanism, or, as in industrialised society be relegated to special occasions or banned altogether. Although science seems to provide answers it is said that \"the cosmos looks more and more like a great thought\". Narrated by David Carradine."
