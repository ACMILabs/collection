        "Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman portray former lovers briefly reunited amid the chaos of World War II. The film tells of the lonely owner of a nightclub in Nazi-occupied Casablanca and of the brief return of his former lover fleeing the Nazis with her resistance-hero husband. Only Bogart can help them escape, but he refuses...until Ilsa reawakens his idealism. Also stars Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt. To commemorate \"Casablanca's\" 50th anniversary the film has been restored and digitally remastered. Also included is a documentary on the making of this classic, \"You must remember this\" narrated by Lauren Bacall, as well as the original theatrical trailer."
