        "Black Harvest is an extremely moving real-life drama of two ambitious men vying for power, of two cultures in conflict as a dream of wealth turns sour. In the highlands of Papua New Guinea, Joe Leahy, a mixed race Highlander and wealthy coffee plantation owner, joins forces with the Ganiga tribe to expand his empire. His greatest ally is the Ganiga tribal leader, Popina Mai, who wants to take his people into the modern world quickly. But on the eve of the coffee harvest, the work ethic and promises of wealth are abandoned as tribal warfare and tragedy erupt. This is the final part of a trilogy on the Ganiga people (\"First Contact\" and \"Joe Leahy's Neighbours\") made by award- winning filmmakers, Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson."
