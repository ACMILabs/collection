        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Faces of culture\". Marriage and family customs are intimately tied to the economic and social structure of communities. The family is a cornerstone of culture, minimising sexual competition, forming a basic economic unit, forming the basis for co-operative alliances between groups and providing emotional support and sustenance for individuals. Marriage is a key rite of transition and the basis of the family. This program looks at different approaches to marriage with the pygmies in Africa, extended families in India and Greek-Americans in Baltimore, and the pressures exerted on individuals as they try to either break away from or cling to tradition. Narrated by David Carradine."
