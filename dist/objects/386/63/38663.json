        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Little world of Dietmar Fill\". At Dampier on the north west coast of Western Australia, a tidal creek has been dammed off from the sea to produce salt from seawater. Dietmar Fill puts the salt-ponds under the microscope in this study of how life responds to this increasingly stressful saline environment. Included is a general description of the Pilbara area and its former inhabitants, the salt lagoons and its mining."
