        "The Butter Battle is the story of a war between the Yooks and the Zooks. The Yooks butter their bread butter-side-up, and the Zooks butter-side-down. At first they fought with sticks and stones, but their weapons became more and more sophisticated until one day they met to fight using the ultimate weapon - the Big Boy Boomeroo. A lighthearted parable on the dangers of the arms race based on the book by Dr Seuss."
