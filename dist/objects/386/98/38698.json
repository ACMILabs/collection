        "The final three hours of interviews, conducted by Bill Moyers, with world authority on myth, Joseph Campbell, shortly before his death in 1987. Episode 4 - \"Sacrifice and bliss\" Campbell discusses the role of sacrifice as a necessity for rebirth and the need for each of us to find a sacred place in today's modern world. Episode 5 - \"Love and the goddess\" Covers both the growth of romantic love associated with the 12th century troubadours and the worship of woman as goddess, earth mother and Virgin Mary. Episode 6 - \"Masks of eternity\" Campbell provides challenging insights into God, religion and eternity as revealed in Christianity, Buddhism, Native American Indian beliefs and the theories of Jung and Schopenhauer."
