        "An American nuclear submarine is mysteriously attacked by an unidentified vessel and when the crew of the submarine go deep into the ocean bed to investigate they find a force so powerful it threatens the future of humankind. Technically a masterpiece, with awesome set designs and special effects, and a chilling soundtrack, \"The Abyss\" is a terrifying movie. Directed by James Cameron (\"Aliens\"), \"The Abyss\" is an extravagantly mannerist example of the science-fiction genre in which the \"dark force\" is a mirror for the destructive powers which humans unleash on themselves."
