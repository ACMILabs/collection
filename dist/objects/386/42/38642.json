        "Episode of Series \"The Human face of the Pacific\". The three parts of this program show Pacific island nations, which have been affected to a greater or lesser degree by European colonisation. \"Part 1. Kiribati\" Formerly known as the Gilbert Islands, Kiribati is now independent from the British and still maintains a largely traditional way of life, expressed in its vibrant music and culture. \"Part 2. Tahiti\" The town of Papeete is a cosmopolitan mix of French and Polynesian, and attracts many island people to its city way of life. \"Part 3. The Marshall Islands\" Because of the U.S. use of Bikini Atoll for nuclear bomb testing, the inhabitants have been displaced to one small island, dependent for their welfare on the U.S. Unable to return to their homes for many decades, their culture is being lost in third world slum life. A teacher's guide accompanies this video."
