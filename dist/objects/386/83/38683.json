        "Episode number 17 of Series \"Faces of culture\". In order for societies to live together with some security for all, some form of political organisation, leadership or authority must exist. This program looks at different forms of political organisation from the bands of hunter-gatherers, through tribal systems, formal leadership, nation states and theocracies to the modern state systems with their huge bureaucracies. Narrated by David Carradine."
