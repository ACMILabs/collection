        "An excellently acted and moving drama based on the real-life story of anti-Apartheid activist, Ruth First, written by Ruth's own daughter, Shawn Slovo. Jodhi May plays an unhappy 13 year old girl, Molly, growing up in South Africa. Her mother (Barbara Hershey) journalist, has little time for Molly's adolescent needs because all her time and energy is devoted to her fight against the South African government, a fight which eventually leads to her imprisonment. An enthralling movie of discrimination seen through the eyes of a child."
