        "UK Channel 4's 'Out' and 'Out on Tuesday', hosted by Julian Clary, were the world's first networked TV series for lesbians and gay men. Debuting in 1989, the show was consistently stylish, informed and audacious. This collection brings together 7 of the best segments: \"Talking Hairs\", a snappy catalogue of gay hairstyles; \"Comic Cuts\" explores the real world of lesbian and gay comic books; \"Pride '91\" celebrates the 1991 London Gay Pride march; \"Fasten Your Seatbelts\" is a speedy montage of Hollywood's perverse subtexts; \"Postcard from New Zealand\" is Peter Wells' touching and humorous video postcard; \"Khush\" explores the lives of South Asian lesbians and gay men; \"Girls in Boy Bars\" investigates how women - straight or gay - feel in gay male bars."
