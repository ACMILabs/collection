        "Episode number 14 of Series \"Faces of culture\". For centuries the social structure of Bolivia consisted of three classes, a white oligarchy, the Spanish speaking mestizo middle class and an Indian peasantry. The 1952 revolution did much to change this, but the basic structure still exists, particularly in rural backwaters such as are portrayed in this video. In Ayata and Vitocoto the class system is still horrifically alive and well, as the despised peasantry labour for the mestizo landowners and priests for little or no pay and no hope of improvement due to inequalities in educational opportunities and health care. Narrated by David Carradine."
