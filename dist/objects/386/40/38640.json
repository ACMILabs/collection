        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Faces of culture\". In small societies, family and kinship groups are sufficient to provide the support the individual needs, but in larger, more complex societies other groups are formed. These groups can enhance, maintain or even change societies. They organise diversity, provide structure, integrate people, and reflect the values of a culture. These groups may be formed through common special interests, age, ethnic background or social class and may be dictated by need, birth or lifestyle. Examples shown include the Masai people, The Brotherhood of Black Sleeping Car Porters, The Young Skulls Gang, college fraternities, South African apartheid and the Indian caste system. Narrated by David Carradine."
