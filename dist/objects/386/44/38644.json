        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". On a world scale, Australian managers rank 23rd for quality. It is estimated that 85% of Australia's corporate problems are the fault of senior management, who have a basic lack of understanding of what is required to be competitive in today's market. This program looks at examples of good and bad management in Australia, including AWA, Holden and Mitsubishi and at modern management theories such as Total Quality Management, as developed by W. Edwards Deming and Just-in-time systems which are aimed at optimising supplies. Illustrated by brief excerpts from John Cleese's management video."
