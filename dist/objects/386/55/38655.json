        "Humphrey Bogart is the gin-soaked river tramp who reluctantly becomes a hero after rescuing a \"skinny-psalm-singing-old-maid\" (Katherine Hepburn) from the Germans during World War I. Their hazardous mission of escape becomes a pursuit as the odd pair survive malaria, insects, leeches and the persistent conflict of their personalities in order to destroy a German gunboat in the African Congo. Bogart won an Oscar for this role and the script was co-written by James Agee, based on C. S. Forester's novel."
