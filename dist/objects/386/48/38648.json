        "Mel Brooks' hilarious remake of the Lubitsch comedy classic about a Polish theatre troupe which gets caught up in Hitler's invasion of Poland. Brooks and Anne Bancroft play the lead actors in the troupe who are forever trying to gain the limelight from each other. When they become involved in a wild plot to threaten the Nazis, their battles become even more comic. The great cast includes Tim Matheson, Jose Ferrer and Charles Durning."
