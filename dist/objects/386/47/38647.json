        "In 1856 American Governor Harris became the first foreign diplomat to visit the Forbidden Empire of Japan. This semi-historical romance stars John Wayne as the diplomat engaged in hostile trade talks with the Japanese government, who finds himself falling in love with a beautiful geisha. Huston has directed a finely crafted tale of adventure and intrigue. The production was filmed entirely in Japan."
