        "A charming story set in Victorian England stars Shirley Temple. When her widower father, an army officer, is sent off to the Boer War, Shirley is placed in a boarding school. When he is reported killed, the mean headmistress relegates Shirley to being a servant. She suffers her indignities bravely until her shell shocked father returns. The film contains a famous dream ballet in which Shirley is crowned a princess, plus several dazzling song and dance numbers performed with Arthur Treacher. Based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett."
