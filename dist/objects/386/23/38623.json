        "England in 1832 is a dark and dangerous place. Ravenous wolves prowl the grounds of Willoughby Chase, but the lovely daughter of the owners, Bonnie, and her cousin, Sylvia, are kept safe by trusted and faithful servants. When Bonnie's parents set off to travel, Bonnie is left in charge of a new governess, Miss Slighcarp. Bonnie and Sylvia are transported to an orphanage and the greedy, evil Miss Slighcarp takes over the manor. She sacks the loyal servants and begins a reign of terror, helped in part by her strange power over the wolves - but Bonnie and Sylvia resolve to fight her evil powers. Stars Mel Smith."
