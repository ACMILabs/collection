        "'High Anxiety' is a parody of, and a dedication to, the cinema of Alfred Hitchcock. Using the simple plot of a psychiatrist with a fear of heights who arrives to take up a top post as head of the Institute for the Very, Very Nervous, Mel Brooks uses a gamut of scatological, Freudian and slap-stick jokes to create hilarious parodies of famous scenes in 'The Birds', 'Psycho', 'Vertigo' et. al. Cast includes Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman. The script was co-written by Barry Levinson."
