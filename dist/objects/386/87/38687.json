        "Two children's classics have been brought together on this one video. \"The Red balloon\" won many major awards on its release in 1956. A lonely French boy amazingly becomes friends with a red balloon which follows him to school and protects him in the streets of Paris. An absorbing and quite perfect fantasy. Shirley Temple stars in \"The Little princess\", which is adapted from Frances Hodgson Burnett's tale of an orphan girl who loses her father in the Boer war but has faith that he is still alive. Without ever giving up hope and with a little help from the queen she is finally reunited with him. Songs, dances and a spectacular dream sequence are some of the highlights of this 1939 colour film."
