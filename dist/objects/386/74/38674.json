        "Episode of Series \"World in action\". The fifth in a series of remarkable documentaries which explore the lives of a diverse group of people who come before the cameras every seven years to be interviewed. Approaching middle-age the adults in this film are now settled in their lives, not completely fulfilled, but no longer so confident in the possibility of dreams coming true. Born into different social classes and different kinds of families, the adults in \"35 Up\" are candid about their experiences of divorce, having children, failure and death. The power of this film is that as we watch the children grow into adults we are made to ask ourselves challenging questions about the nature of family, community, heredity, class and human will. The success of the documentary has been such that it is now much imitated by film-makers across the globe."
