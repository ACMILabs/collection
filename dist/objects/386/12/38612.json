        "In the gambling desert town of Reno, a recently divorced young woman falls for an ageing cowboy. They slowly begin to build a life together but the chance arrival of a younger cowboy, and the older man's obsession with his romantic memories of the \"old West\", threaten to destroy the relationship. A collaboration between New York playwright Arthur Miller and director John Huston, \"The Misfits\" examines the increasing commercialisation and subsequent alienation of contemporary life by modernising the most traditional of Hollywood genres: the Western. The film stars Marilyn Monroe, Montgomery Clift and Clark Gable in three superb performances. Intense and involving, \"The Misfits\" also stars Thelma Ritter and Eli Wallach."
