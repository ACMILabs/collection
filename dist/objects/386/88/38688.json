        "Based on a true story, Peter Ormrod's tragi-comic tale of aspiring no-hopers follows the misadventures of two Irish villagers, Vinnie (Stephen Brennan) and Arthur (Eamon Mornsey), made unemployed by the closure of a Japanese electronics factory, who take inspiration from an old Elvis movie and blow their redundancy money on building a motorcycle \"Wall of Death\". Local fame follows, but will the men have the spirit to survive if their big opening day doesn't quite live up to their dreams? In the tradition of the Frank Capra genre this film is sure to enchant."
