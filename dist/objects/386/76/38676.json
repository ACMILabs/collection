        "Shrinkage is the unaccountable disappearance of merchandise and can cost companies large amounts of money. \"Shrinkage\" may be due to external theft, administrative errors and internal theft. This program looks at the last of these three, through the experiences of two newly recruited shop assistants, and how they react to pressure to bend or break the rules. The program proposes four solutions to \"shrinkage\". Be conscientious in every procedure, know the rules and follow them, don't get involved with others' weaknesses, although you should report suspicious behaviour and lastly avoid temptation yourself."
