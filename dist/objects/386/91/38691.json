        "Through the story of a disillusioned young photojournalist who, returning from a fruitless assignment in the States, unwittingly becomes involved in a little girl's search for her family in the North German industrial heartland, Wenders forges a distinctly European variation on the road movie. Few films capture so evocatively the feeling of life in the 20th century technological jungle, but for all its vistas of alienation and Americanisation, \"Alice in the cities\" finally resolves itself into a touching, indeed moving, affirmation of human relationships in an otherwise bleak world. Cast includes Rudiger Vogler and Yella Rottlander, with a haunting musical score by Can."
