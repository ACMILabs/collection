        "This video uses brilliantly clear animation techniques to explain aspects of genetic engineering and protein synthesis. There are three parts to the video. \"Protein synthesis\" explains what DNA is, and how it works. \"Recombining DNA\" shows how it is possible to control or change which proteins an organism will make, by combining DNA from one organism with DNA in another. \"Isolating DNA\" shows how DNA fragments are isolated, and also how DNA can be built synthetically."
