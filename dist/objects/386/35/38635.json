        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Faces of culture\". Alejandro Mamani is a leader in his Bolivian mountain community, but he is an old man and believes himself possessed of evil spirits. Many remedies are tried to rid him of these spirits, from traditional forms of exorcism to sleeping tablets, but all attempts fail and after making his will he eventually commits suicide. Did he go mad or did he simply make use of his culture to leave life, once he saw there was no further use for him and his affairs were in order? Narrated by David Carradine."
