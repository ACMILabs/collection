        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Something shining tells the story of a young pilot, Frederick Valentich, who disappeared with his small plane over Bass Strait as he returned from a flight to King Island. His enigmatic message of sighting \"something shining\" just before he disappeared has led many, including his parents, to believe he was captured by a UFO."
