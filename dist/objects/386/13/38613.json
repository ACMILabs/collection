        "Episode of Series \"Children's classic story series\". A live action film that tells the tale of an emperor who employs two tailors who make him a special robe. What he doesn't know is that these two rogues are not tailors at all and when the emperor appears in public in his special new robe, no one can quite believe their eyes. Adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's well-loved tale."
