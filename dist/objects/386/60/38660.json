        "The space travellers return to earth on a special rescue mission to retrieve their alien friends who lay at the bottom of the ocean, sleeping in cocoons. However, scientists have opened one of the pods and the innocent alien inside is to be turned over to the military who want to exploit its mental abilities. Meanwhile, the returning earthlings each react differently to being back on earth and seeing their loved ones again. When the time comes to leave, some will go to live forever and some will stay on Earth to live out the remainder of their lives. Stars Don Ameche, Wilford Brimley, Courtney Cox, Hume Cronyn, Jack Gilford, Steve Guttenberg, Barret Oliver, Maureen Stapleton, Elaine Stritch, Jessica Tandy, Gwen Verdon and Tahnee Welch."
