        "Asta Cadell (Deborra-Lee Furness), a city barrister is touring the outback alone when she is forced to stay in a small, isolated town when her motorbike breaks down. During her enforced stay she uncovers the scandal that grips the town in fear, and becomes the catalyst for a dramatic and riveting battle. A disturbing look at the sexual attitudes of an Australian rural society in decline. Also stars Simone Buchanan and Tony Barry."
