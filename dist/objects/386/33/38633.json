        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". La Goulue, the celebrated cancan dancer and queen of late night Paris during the Belle Epoque, asked her friend Toulouse-Lautrec to paint two panels to decorate her carnival booth. The artist's two largest canvases were to have an extraordinary destiny. This video describes the panels in detail and the techniques which Lautrec used to paint them, as well as setting them in their artistic and social context."
