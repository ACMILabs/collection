        "Episode number 18 of Series \"Faces of culture\". All humans have to co-exist with other humans and for this to be a peaceful co-existence there must be some form of social control. Societies have therefore developed rules, habits and customs which are learned from childhood, in order to control behaviour. This program looks at different patterns of control, using as examples the Amish of Pennsylvania, the Masai, and the United Nations. It also explains the principles of mediation, adjudication and judgement and gives examples of these. Narrated by David Carradine."
