        "The troubles of the Civil War come home to a little plantation girl when her father is arrested and charged with espionage against the Yankees. Only a plea to President Lincoln can save the day. One of the most dramatically interesting of Shirley Temple's films, \"The Littlest Rebel\" is also a spirited musical comedy featuring an exuberant performance by the gifted dancer, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson."
