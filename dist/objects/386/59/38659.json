        "Ron Howard's enchanting sci-fi fantasy about a group of resident senior citizens in a Florida rest home who discover a fountain of youth from another planet is close to being the ultimate in feelgood movies. Their lives turned upside down when they meet some bizarre and not-so-human beings who are visitors from a distant galaxy. They have come to Earth on a rescue mission to retrieve a secret which has lain hidden on the ocean floor for thousands of years. They share a wondrous adventure and learn more about love and friendship than they ever imagined. Cast includes Don Ameche, Wilford Brimley, Hume Cronyn, Brian Dennehy, Jack Gifford, Steve Guttenberg, Maureen Stapleton, Jessica Tandy, Gwen Verdon, Herta Ware and Tahnee Welch."
