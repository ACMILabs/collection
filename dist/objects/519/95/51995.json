        "Episode of Series \"Australian biography\". Economist, chancellor, patron and advocate of the Arts and Aboriginal affairs, Dr. H.C. \"Nugget\" Coombs is one of Australia's most influential public servants and advisor to seven Australian Prime Ministers. Born in Kalamunda, Western Australia, in 1906 (died 1997), Herbert Cole Coombs speaks to interviewer Robin Hughes of how he first became passionate about economics and redressing the issue of racial antagonism, his time at the London School of Economics and his exposure to the inefficiency of the economic system there. He also talks of his years as economist to the treasury in Canberra after the outbreak of war, his role in Rationing, as head of Post War reconstruction, Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, as well as various Arts agencies. Coombs also talks briefly of his working relationship with Chifley, Menzies, Holt, Gorton, McMahon and Whitlam. He also reflects on achievements, regrets and thoughts and fears for the future."
