        "Partners in life and art, Sydney photographers Narelle Autio and Trent Park discuss why they are drawn to one another's work and what inspires and motivates them when they are behind the lens. Cameras follow the pair as they photograph goat racing in Lightning Ridge and attempt to capture the essence of Sydney city. They talk of work on their first collaboration in 2001 - the Seventh wave - which depicted images of Australian beach life and garnered them the World Press Award. They also speak of the moniker of \"The Roo couple,\" coined for their surrealistic images of dead animals by the roadside."
