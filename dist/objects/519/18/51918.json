        "Take a nostalgic journey back in time to the north coast of New South Wales as depicted in this wonderful collection of historical footage from home movies, documentaries, newsreels and feature film excerpts from the 1920s to the 1970s selected from the National Film and Sound Archive Collection and compiled by Ruth Hill. Focussing on the Clarence River District and the towns of Grafton, Inverell, Coffs Harbour, Casino, Lismore, Tenterfield, Iluka, Glen Innes, Maclean and Moree, the program is segmented into decades allowing the viewer to see towns change and evolve over a 50 year period. Entertaining and informative, the video provides a social commentary of Australian lifestyle, industries and landscape, highlighting such events as the Grafton Jacaranda Festival, street parades at Inverell and Casino, the Annual Flower Show at Lismore, centenary celebrations for both Maclean and Coff's Harbour and royal celebrations for Queen Elizabeth's coronation. Also includes footage of some of the industries which have progressed and developed in the district and along the river - oyster farms, fishing, dairying, cane-cutting and timber. Contains sepia, black and white, and colour footage with original commentary retained and music added to the silent segments."
