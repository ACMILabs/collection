    "description": [
        "Popular comic English television program \"Dad's army\", which ran for nine years, is about numerous men that comprise the local division of the Home Guard in the seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea during World War 2. The men are an eccentric lot who range in age from the very young to the decidedly doddery. In each episode the group muddle their way through a different situation in their own idiosyncratic way. Episodes on this DVD include: \"The Deadly attachment\" (1973, 30 mins) The platoon are ordered to guard a captive German U-Boat crew. \"Keep young and beautiful\" (1972, 30 mins) Concern over the condition of some of the elder members of the unit precipitates a frenzy of invigorating activities. \"Never too old\" (1972, 36 mins) Jones falls in love and becomes increasingly absent-minded much to the dismay of his cohorts. \"Asleep in the deep\" (1972, 30 mins) A bomb falls on the local plumbing station; Privates Walker and Godfrey require rescuing but typically the entire platoon become trapped. \"Sons of the sea\" (1973, 30 mins) Captain Mainwaring plans to patrol the rivers in order to keep the Nazis at bay."
