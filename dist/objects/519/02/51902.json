        "Episode of Series \"Compass (Television program)\". Presented by Geraldine Doogue, this three part series looks at the changing patterns of belief in Australia. Episode two examines the civil celebrant movement and the increase in rituals involving civil celebrants as opposed to traditional religious leaders. Doogue speaks to civil celebrant Dally Messenger, one of Australia's longest practising civil celebrants, Diane Storey who specializes in funerals, John Hill, an ex Roman Catholic priest who missed the rituals of the church and became a civil celebrant, Gael Brigden, a celebrant on a television program, and Paul Charvet-Jackson who specialises in same sex commitment ceremonies. The celebrants share their thoughts on what inspires them, how they devise the rituals, the preparation that takes place, and the future of their profession. Features footage of weddings, a naming day and interviews with people who have enlisted the services of the celebrants. Part of the television show, \"Compass\"."
