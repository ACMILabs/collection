        "Dan Bigras, Canadian singer and filmmaker, features in his own documentary along with his extreme fighter friends, Charles Ali Nestor (27 y.o.), David Loiseau (21 y.o.) and Steve Vigneault (22 y.o.) to demonstrate that an outlet can be found for those who find themselves battling with self-destructive impulses or overwhelming uncontrollable anger and rage. Where Bigras uses singing and song-writing as his outlet, his friends prefer to channel their energies into martial arts and extreme fighting as a way of rebuilding their lives. It would seem a common thread runs through the lives of each of these young men as they tell their stories of an unhappy childhood, bullying, teenage gangs, violence and family break-down. But the frankness and honesty in their personal tales and the friendship, loyalty and support between the four men in their collective struggle to transform their anger into a rage for life is what really defines this film, not the fighting scenes - their courage is to be admired. Features interviews with families, friends, sporting personnel and other extreme fighters and includes graphic coverage of bouts from competition fights and training sessions. In English and French with English subtitles. WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGES OF EXTREME FIGHT SCENES."
