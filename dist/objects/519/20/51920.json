        "This three part series made for the Discovery Channel draws its material from the landmark Disappearing World documentary series produced by Granada Television in the 1970s. With each of over fifty episodes supervised by an anthropologist, the series set out to record the way of life of indigenous peoples around the world whose traditional cultures were under threat. Each episode of \"Disappearing world revisited\" briefly recaps three of these original stories then provides a short overview of the situation of these people today. The three tribal peoples revisited in Episode 2 are: 1. Sakkudei: Living deep in the jungles of Sumatra, the Sakkudei are nevertheless forced by the Indonesian government to conform with 20th century society. 2. Dervishes of Kurdistan: Dervish tribesmen living in the mountainous frontier of Iran and Iraq perform feats of self mutilation to prove their devotion to Islam. 3. Masai Women: Focuses on the expectations placed on woman from the Masai tribe from the East African Rift Valley of Kenya once they reach child bearing age. Presented by Andy Kershaw."
