        "When his parents want to adopt another child, George Little begs them to bring him home a little brother, however he is surprised when they bring home a mouse who they name Stuart. George resents the intrusion into his family by a mouse, until a model boat race in Central Park draws the two brothers together. Unfortunately, the family cat Snowbell finds the temptation to eat the new family member unbearable and will not rest until Stuart is out of his life. Based on the story by E.B. White. Features the voices of Michael J. Fox, Nathan Lane, Jennifer Tilly and Bruno Kirby."
