        "This beautifully written, produced and directed documentary by AFTRS student Valerie Bichard encapsulates the emotions and determination of a group of Aboriginal Australians seeking peace and justice in their campaign for Sovereign Rights. Isabell Coe of the Wiradjuri Nation in Central New South Wales, journeyed to the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra just prior to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games to collect ashes from the Sacred Fire in order to establish another Tent Embassy with these \"healing\" ashes in Victoria Park, Sydney. This is the story of Isabell's peace campaign and the Tent Embassy in Sydney, the frustrations, negotiations, mediations and finally reconciliation with the South Sydney Council and the New South Wales Police. Through Isabell and other Aboriginal Australians including Kevin Buzzcott (Arabunna Nation Elder) and Chicka Dixon (Yuin Nation Elder) along with many of the Embassy supporters, an insight is given to the history of Aboriginal land rights, the birth of the Tent Embassy and the symbolic role which the Tent Embassy plays in promoting understanding between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Also provides an appreciation and meaning of the importance of the Fire ceremony or \"Healing\" ceremony towards the act of reconciliation and how such ceremonies are part of Aboriginal culture and their spiritual attachment to the land."
