        "Performer and writer Leah Purcell talks with five very different Indigenous women - Rosanna Angus, Kathryn Hay, Deborah Mailman, Cilla Malone and Tammy Williams - about what it means to be Aboriginal in Australia today. In a series of individual interviews and at one lively dinner party, the women frankly share their life experiences and opinions. Though their backgrounds are extremely diverse, common themes of culture, family, racism and denial run through their stories, as does the ongoing personal and social legacy of past government polices of forced removal. The result is a passionate and challenging exploration of black identity. Teachers notes available through Film Australia at: http://www.filmaust.com.au/programs/default.asp?content=teachers_notes"
