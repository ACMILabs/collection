        "Fresh from the success of \"Clueless\", Amy Heckerling (Fast times at Ridgemont High) dived into the life of the nerd in \"Loser.\" Jason Biggs (American Pie) is Paul Tanneck, a good-natured Mid Western teenager who wins a university scholarship and moves to New York City. Naively confident in his signature ear flap hat, Paul is thrust into campus life with 3 despicable drug addicted and brattish room mates who have nothing but contempt for him but are not adverse to asking favours when it suits them. He meets a soul mate in Literature class in Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari), a fellow outsider who appears to be operating on his wavelength. Following an alcohol drenched party hosted by his now ex-room mates at his new abode, Paul discovers Dora unconscious in the bathroom and takes her to the hospital. The two spend a few nights together while Dora recovers from having her stomach pumped and the two prove to be compatible. When Paul discovers Dora is having an affair with Literature's Professor Alcott (Greg Kinnear), he withdraws his attentions from her even though he can see through the philandering professor that Dora blithely dotes on. \"Loser\" is populated with caricatured college stereotypes and behaviour that borders on depressing rather than amusing, however the outcome is transparent, so you know the character flogging will abate."
