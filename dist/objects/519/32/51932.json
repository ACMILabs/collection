        "In 50 BC Gaul is a quiet, peaceful place. Ceasar has recently subjected the country to a Roman invasion and renamed the place, France. Only a small pocket of Gauls remain; eponymous warrior Asterix, best friend Obelix and his canine companion Dogmatix, village chief, respected druid and creator of Asterix's magic potion, Vitalstatistix, as well as Getafix and Cacofonix. When an army of Julius Ceasar's guards attack the Gauls, they cannot believe the strength of their opponents and return to Caesar claiming they have come up against a group of gods. Caesar is not convinced however, and, inspired by the 12 deeds of Hercules, sets the Gauls 12 new tasks to prove their godliness and earn their freedom from Roman occupation, perhaps even take up a leadership position. The tasks include: footrace, the javelin, gladiator, Isle of Pleasure, the Eyes of Isis, eat it all, cave of the beast, form 838, the invisible high wire, answer the riddle, plain of the invisible spirits and the final task."
