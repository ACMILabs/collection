        "Awarded a special Academy Award for Special Achievement, this fully animated adventure is riotous fun for kids of all ages. When a draw-stringed cowboy named Woody, his boy's favourite toy, is replaced one birthday by the latest toy - a flashy new space-ranger named Buzz Lightyear, it sparks an outrageous tiff between toys. Accidentally whisked away from home and into the clutches of the neighbourhood bully, these two squabbling rivals must work together as a team if they are to escape. Visual wizardry, uproarious laughs and the coolest characters ever assembled transform the world's first computer-animated feature film into an incomparable movie marvel."
