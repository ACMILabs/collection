        "Popular comic English television program \"Dad's army\", which ran for nine years, is about numerous men that comprise the local division of the Home Guard in the seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea during World War 2. The men are an eccentric lot who range in age from the very young to the decidedly doddery. In each episode the group muddle their way through a different situation in their own idiosyncratic way. Episodes include: \"Turkey dinner\" (30 mins, 1974) When Corporal Jones is left holding a dead turkey after the platoon's drunken night-watch, Mainwaring decides to treat the town's senior citizens to a feast. \"Ring dem bells\" (30 mins, 1975) Mainwaring is not pleased when his platoon is chosen to play Nazis in an Army film and Pike is selected to play a German officer. \"When you've got to go\" (1975, 30 mins) Despite his bad chest, sinuses and weak ankles, Pike is passed A1 on his medical."
