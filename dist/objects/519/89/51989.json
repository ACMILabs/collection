        "Martin Bishop heads an organisation of computer hackers, technology experts, reformed thieves and outsiders who are paid to break into high-security institutions in order to prove their vulnerability. Several shady characters approach Martin to steal an electronic code-breaker that is a risk to national security. Against his instincts Martin accepts the assignment when they threaten to expose his true identity. Naturally nothing goes to plan, and the friends find themselves in peril when they realise the decoder's awesome potential for destruction. What transpires is a thriller entailing conspiracy theories, double-crossings, a corrupt government and murder. \"Sneakers\" is quite amusing and, at times, somewhat fraught with tension, as the team battle a myriad of forces. Pre-dating the late 1990s, early 2000s paranoid computer-hacker films, \"Sneakers\" has a sprightliness that impresses and despite an overabundance of contrivances, makes for a satisfying caper. Top cast includes Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, Ben Kingsley, Dan Ackroyd, Mary McDonnell, River Phoenix and David Strathairn."
