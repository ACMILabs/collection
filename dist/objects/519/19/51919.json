        "This three part series made for the Discovery Channel draws its material from the landmark Disappearing World documentary series produced by Granada Television in the 1970s. With each of over fifty episodes supervised by an anthropologist, the series set out to record the way of life of indigenous peoples around the world whose traditional cultures were under threat. Each episode of \"Disappearing world revisited\" briefly recaps three of these original stories then provides a short overview of the situation of these people today. The three stories revisited in Episode 1 are: 1. Mehinacu: The Mehinacu Indians in Central Brazil perform ceremonies to appease the tree spirits. 2. The Kawelka: Ongka's Big Moka: The Kawelka people of the Central Highlands in Papua New Guinea organise a \"moka\" (a ceremonial exchange of pigs). 3. Hmong: Hill tribe people of Laos, the Hmong are caught up in the Vietnam War and forced to flee their traditional homes. Presented by Andy Kershaw."
