        "Episode of Series \"Compass (Television program)\". Presented by Geraldine Doogue, this three part series looks at the changing patterns of belief in Australia. Episode one examines the decline in attendance at traditional churches and the incidence of \"spiritual shopping\" whereby people are creating their own personal style of religion. In looking at the decline in church attendance since the 1960s and the melding of the experiential and the emotional, Doogue speaks to university lecturers Carole Cusack and David Tacey, Uniting Church Minister and director of the Christian Research Association Philip Hughes, and Anglican priest and sociologist Gary Bouma. The program also looks at the growth in Pentecostal churches, spending time at the Mount Annan Christian Life Centre, speaking to Andrew and Adrian Gray about their work. Youths also describe their experiences during an empowering conference. Features vox pops at Sydney nightclub and Acland Street, St Kilda. Part of the television show, \"Compass\"."
