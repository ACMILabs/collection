        "This animated feature was one of the first films to be made by Disney after Walt's death in 1967. Adapting the story of Robin Hood, in this take all the protagonists are animals - Robin is a handsome fox (very much in Errol Flynn mode), Little John is a bear and Prince John a lion. When the greedy sheriff taxes the citizens of Nottingham to the point of bankruptcy, Robin Hood, a benevolent outlaw arrives to save them all. Director Wolfgang Reithermann has created a fantastic animal kingdom in which to set the classic tale of the inhabitants of Sherwood Forest. Voices include: Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas, Andy Devine, Barbara Luddy, Roger Miller and Monica Evans."
