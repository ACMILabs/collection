        "This teen thriller, set in a small American port town named Cradle Bay, has echoes of the \"Stepford wives\", albeit played out in a more baleful and graphic manner. In this deceptively banal location a science experiment is being conducted on errant students, each of whom are hand selected then essentially lobotomised, after which they start to behave like 'perfect' students. After a family tragedy, the Clark family move from Chicago to Cradle Bay, and Steve, (a teenager struggling with a past tragedy), tries to comes to terms with the odd behaviours that he sees around him. Gavin and UV (two arch outsiders) implore Steve that danger abounds behind the seemingly A-grade students, the Blue Ribbons, whose violent outbursts belie their otherwise purist nature. Katie Holms plays Rachel, a rebel bad-girl who teams up with Steve to try to uncover the mystery and save future students from a sinister fate. David Nutter's feature debut pays due attention to the tropes of the genre, providing requisite thrills and tensions, beatings and romantic interludes, all to a soft-core punk-rock soundtrack. Cast includes James Marsden, Nick Stahl, Steve Railsback, Bruce Greenwood, Bill Sadler and Chad E. Donella."
