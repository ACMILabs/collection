Born in 1932, Lois O'Donoghue's biography reads: Foundation Commission, Aboriginal Development Commission 1980-84, Australian of the Year, 1984, Chairperson, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, 1990 onwards. Speaking to interviewer Robin Hughes, Lois talks about her experience in being forcibly removed from her family as a young child and raised by strict missionaries. She also talks of the relationship with her mother that she was reunited with as an adult, domestic service, her attempt to gain access to a nursing career at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, involvement with the Aboriginal Advancement League, nursing in India with Baptist missionaries and her work as an administrator in Aboriginal Affairs. She also addresses race relations and her encounters with racism."
