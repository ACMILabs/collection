        "Episode of Series \"Insight profile\". Writer Libby Gleeson talks of the inspiration behind her novels, the experiences and settings in the environment around her and how they inform the realistic nature of her fiction writing. She discusses the importance of a credible \"place\" and how environment has shaped the characters in her novels - decision making on how to decide on point of view and how it's influenced by the text is also covered. The importance of research, in particular in the classroom and in the schoolyard is mentioned, as well as issues throughout her novels. A brief biographical background and the business end of publication is also provided."
