        "Episode of Series \"Insight profile\". Unbeknownst to readers of Morris Gleitzman, he has a ghost co-writer, an 11 year-old version of himself who resides within and provides inspiration for his novels. He can't write without him and he can't be forced out. Gleitzman explains how daydreaming assists with the ideas process and provides examples of the inspiration behind \"Misery Guts\" and other novels. He also addresses the ambiance of his environs and how it can influence his writing, including the layout of the desk and his passion for stationery. Character development, discovering the story and the research process leading up to the process of writing the first chapter is also discussed. Morris talks of childhood aspirations, literary influences, and the path that led to his first novel, \"The Other facts of life\". He also discusses the editorial process, the role of his agent, and the business side of supporting himself as a writer."
