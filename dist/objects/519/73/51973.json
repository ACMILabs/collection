        "Marking a shift for sometime action/horror director Raimi, \"For the Love of the Game\" explores the tensions and romance of adult relationships. Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is an ageing baseball sports star who is coming to the end of his career. His commitment to the game has meant that his relationship with Jane (Kelly Preston) is suffering and she announces that she is leaving him. With both his love life and his sports career in tatters, Billy has to make crucial decisions about what kind of future he wants for himself. Based on the novel by Michael Shaara, \"For the Love of the Game\" is best when it is detailing the training, performance and expertise of the sportsmen. Preston and Costner make an attractive couple and Raimi's assured, crisp direction makes for an unusually fast-paced romance."
