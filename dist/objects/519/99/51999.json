        "One mid-Spring evening at midnight, a cuckoo bird is struck by lightning and thrown from his perch to the ground. In the morning when the storm has cleared, he makes his way back up the tree to discover that his comfortable and tidy home has been filled with three unhatched eggs. Pretty soon the eggs have hatched and in their place emerge three young live chicks that become his surrogate. The life of the routinely organised bird is thrown into disarray as his affection for the three grows. A delightful animated tale for children about the pleasures of parenting. Voice provided by A. J. Henderson. Original music by Louis Gagne."
