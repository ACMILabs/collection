    "description": [
        "This three part series made for the Discovery Channel draws its material from the landmark Disappearing World documentary series produced by Granada Television in the 1970s. With each of over fifty episodes supervised by an anthropologist, the series set out to record the way of life of indigenous peoples around the world whose traditional cultures were under threat. Each episode of \"Disappearing world revisited\" briefly recaps three of these original stories then provides a short overview of the situation of the tribal peoples today. The three stories revisited in Episode 3 are: 1. \"Kataragama\": In Sri Lanka, worshippers of the god Kataragama perform extreme feats of devotion. 2. \"The Kirghiz of Afghanistan\" Looks at the harsh life of the Kirghiz who live in the Pamir region of Afghanistan on the highest plateau in the world at 15,000 feet between the closed borders of Pakistan, China and Russia. 3. \"Embera: The End of the Road\": The traditional life of the river people of Colombia is threatened by a new major highway, and exploitation by traders. Presented by Andy Kershaw."
