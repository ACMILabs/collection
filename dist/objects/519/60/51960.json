        "Episode of Series \"Family foibles\". Part of the \"Family foibles\" series of documentaries about five Australian families. \"Upstairs downstairs\" explores Harald's and Louise's attempt to deal with the break-up of their 14-year relationship which occurred during the first year of their daughter Sophia's life. Both wanted to maintain a sense of family and home for Sophia without inflicting their personal conflict onto her by staying together 'for the sake of the children'. Their solution was to convert their house into two self-contained living areas with separate entrances, an arrangement that allows minimal disruption to Sophia's life. Both parents work full-time and share parenting through a 50:50 roster that has room for some flexibility. The daily workings of this social experiment are observed as the two negotiate the challenges of having a 'single but equal' approach to parenting, while living seperately in close proximity to one another. A study guide is available from http://www.roninfilms.com.au/related/2365104851-0.pdf"
