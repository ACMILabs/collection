        "Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Oscar winner Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Coppola paints a chilling portrait of a Sicilian family's rise and near fall from power in America, and the passage of rites from father to son. He masterfully balances the story between family life and the ugly business of crime in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best selling novel, this graphic and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations. Cast also includes Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden and Diane Keaton."
