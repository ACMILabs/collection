        "Curtis and Lemmon, on the run after witnessing the St. Valentine's massacre, masquerade in drag as members of an all-girl band. A satiric mix of slapstick and screwball comedy, this film is a tribute to American naivete and, for a mainstream film made in the fifties, exceptionally open in its treatment of androgyny. Curtis, with the image of a glamour drag queen, retains his heterosexual orientation but becomes more sympathetic, sincere and loving as a direct result of his experience. Lemmon, the campy transvestite, comes to totally identify with his role as a woman, which produces one of the great final lines in screen comedy. Wilder's film shows the influence of Howard Hawks' comedies, most notably \"I was a male war bride\". Like Hawks, Wilder's comedy turns on the reversals of gender expectations. Marilyn Monroe plays a singer in one of her best performances ever."
