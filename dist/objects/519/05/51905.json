        "Commencing with Federation and the birth of a nation on 1 January 1901, this wonderful video captures the very essence of Australia and its people over 100 years, politically, socially, historically and environmentally. It manages to cover all aspects of Australian life from the city to the outback, from arts and entertainment to sport, from industry to technology, from the person on the street to the legends and heroes, from bushfires and droughts to floods and cyclones, from wars to peace, from civil rights protests to reconciliation. Through a compilation of archival film, television and newsreel footage the viewer is taken on a sentimental journey of historic events including WWI, WWII, 1956 Olympic Games, the railway linking of Australia's east coast to the west coast, Royal visits, the birth of Canberra, along with glimpses of many famous faces such as Prime Ministers James Scullin, Billy Hughes, John Curtin, Gough Whitlam; sporting heroes Dawn Fraser, Sir Donald Bradman; actors and entertainers Errol Flynn, Lottie Lyall, Frank Thring Snr, Dame Edna, Mo, Ada and Elsie and much more. A most comprehensive and informative program. Contains b&w footage. Narrated by Amanda Keller."
