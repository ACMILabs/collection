When Andy goes to summer camp the toys have their lives thrown into chaos when Woody is 'toynapped' by a nasty toy collector, and ends up in a museum. Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the toys set out on a rescue mission to save their friend from becoming an exhibit. But does Woody want to leave the quiet and peaceful life he has at the museum? Featuring voices by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack."
