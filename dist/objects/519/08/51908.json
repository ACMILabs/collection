        "Introduced by Len Evans, former director of the wine bureau, this ScreenSound documentary utilises archival footage and film reels to illustrate the history of the wine industry in Australia. Reaching Australia's shores with the first settlers, a solitary vine and a pool of European viticulture expertise, the wine industry in Australia has created a plethora of famous vineyards and growers such as Penfolds, Brown Brothers, Great Western, Wolf Blass, Haughtons and the Hunter and Barossa Valley regions. The film includes advertising campaigns, product innovations, feast and famine in the industry, transportation, packaging and scientific research. Features footage from the following films: \"Wines of Australia\", \"From grape to glass\". Narrated by Hugh McKenzie."
