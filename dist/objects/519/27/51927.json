        "Episode of Series \"Insight profile\". Celebrated children's author Robin Klein discusses her lifelong passion with creative writing and the ideas process that never stops. In particular, she talks about the importance of \"mooning about,\" and the mooning and locales that have provided the source of inspiration behind \"Halfway across the galaxy and turn left\", \"Hating Alison Ashley\" and the Penny Pollard series. The program provides practical examples of observations that can be made from everyday encounters, such as at an historic railway station or spending time round a school. She speaks of her own personal style of writing, the first draft, the importance of self discipline, tools of the trade and the importance of the editorial process. Robin's books are enjoyed by children of all ages and have been adapted for stage and screen."
