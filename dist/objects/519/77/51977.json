        "Based on the best seller by Frederick Forsyth, \"The Day of the jackal\" is a taut and colourful suspense thriller about the attempt by the right wing OAS to assassinate General De Gaulle. Edward Fox portrays the ruthless, anonymous assassin hired by OAS Chief Colonel Rodin, played by Eric Porter. The cold precision of his preparations is juxtaposed with the plodding efforts of the French authorities to uncover the plot."
