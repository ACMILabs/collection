        "This film, based on the Ned Kelly legend, was filmed in and around Benalla by a specialist in low budget quickies with a local football hero, Bob Chitty as Ned. Told from the perspective of an ageing Dan Kelly in present day Benalla, the narrative is presented as a factual retelling of the exploits of the Kelly gang despite its obvious embellishment of the Kelly myth. The shortcomings of the script and its clumsy realisation were derided by the Benalla audience at its premiere and noted by press reviewers upon its brief Sydney release. Narrated by Charles Tingwell. Cast includes: Bob Chitty, Albie Henderson, Ben Crowe, Bill Wright, John Fernside, Chas. Tasman, Charles Webb, Edward Smith, Frank Ransom, Stan Tolhurst. Photography, Harry Malcolm ; editor, Alex Ezard ; sound, Berry Hallett."
