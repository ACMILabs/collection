    "description": [
        "Volume II of a two volume set compiled by the National Film and Sound Archive (now ScreenSound Australia) containing a selection of silent Australian films, both factual and fictional, that focus on representations of Aboriginal peoples. This volume contains two feature length documentaries. \"Coorab in the Island of ghosts\" is believed to have been made from ethnographic footage shot on an early expedition by adventurer and overlander Francis Birtles. The material was edited and narrative intertitles added to give a 'docudrama' style, white interpretation of the life and tribal activities of an Aboriginal named Coorab, who lived around Cape York in Northern Australia. Despite its patronising tone the film presents a vivid picture of Aboriginal tribal life. \"The Native problem in Queensland\" is a silent documentary that was made for the Queensland Government which shows traditional tribal life and State institutions. It discusses the Government's policy towards the native peoples of the state and is an official record of patrols to Queensland and Torres Strait reserves and missions by the Hon. E.M. Hanlon, Minister for Health and Home Affairs."
