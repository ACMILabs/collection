        "This program consists of a collection of well-known and well-loved children's nursery rhymes presented by Elka Laine and Peter Walters. First each story is told by either Elka or Peter accompanied by colourful but simple illustrations of the key characters from each nursery rhyme. Then Elka and Peter sing and act out each rhyme two or three times to music, encouraging their young viewers to join in with them. Assists in the teaching of young children the art of listening and storytelling, music and singing, and using their imagination to act out each of the rhymes. Music by Kevin McMullen. Illustrations by Kate McKague."
