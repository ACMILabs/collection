        "Episode of Series \"Insight profile\". Noted children's author Victor Kelleher talks frankly of how his homesickness for Africa led him to writing - \"In a way I stumbled into writing. I didn't go looking for a writing career. It found me.\" He explains how a dream from his youth and a visit to the zoo with his child led to the novel \"Taronga\"; a relative talking of his childhood, the inspiration behind \"Del-Del\". Settings also play an important role in his work as well as being a source of inspiration; the Zambezi Valley to \"Papio\" for example. The author explains the role of characters in his writing, where the inspiration comes from, writers block, interests and hobbies that have influenced his work (Where the whales sing, Parkland, Slow burn), and reads from various novels. A teacher's guide accompanies the tape."
