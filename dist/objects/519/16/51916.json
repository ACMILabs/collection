        "Popular comic English television program \"Dad's army\", which ran for nine years, is about numerous men that comprise the local division of the Home Guard in the seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea during World War 2. The men are an eccentric lot who range in age from the very young to the decidedly doddery. In each episode the group muddle their way through a different situation in their own idiosyncratic way. Episodes include: \"Is there honey still for tea?\" (1975, 30 mins) Private Godfrey's cottage is condemned to be bulldozed because a new airstrip is to be built. \"Come in your time is up\" (1975, 31 mins) Mainwaring's platoon discovers a German crew in a dinghy on a lake and endeavour to bring them to shore. \"High finance\" (1975, 31 mins) Mainwaring decides that Jones' bank account has been in the red too long."
