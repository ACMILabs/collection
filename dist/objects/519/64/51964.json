        "Recording of a 'talk and dance' performance that pays tribute to groundbreaking dancer and choreographer, Isadora Duncan, creator of what is now known as modern dance. The performance features a solo dance work by Lori Belilove, founder of the Isadora Duncan Dance Foundation and its resident company. Her dancing is accompanied by the words of Peter Kurth, author of 'Isadora: A Sensational Life'. Their performance highlights the unique qualities of Duncan's repertoire and tragic life, through anecdotes and vignettes. Choreography by Lori Belilove after Isadora Duncan."
