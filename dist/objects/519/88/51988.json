        "Publisher Will Randall - recently retrenched and replaced by younger, sycophant protegee Stewart (James Spader) - notices strange behaviour after a wolf at full moon bites him. The behaviour involves a heightening of the senses and rejuvinates his lagging demeanor, turning him into a younger version of himself. The metamorphosis reaches full flight at the next half moon when he takes a moonlit wander and awakes in the morning covered in blood and unaware of his actions. Medical science is unable to find an answer to his symptoms, however Dr Vijay Alezias (Om Puri) tells Will he is assuming the characteristics of a werewolf, the crucial point being that Randall can only change if he already possesses the animal instinct. He finds a sympathetic ear to his predicament from his former employer's beautiful young daughter Laura (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom he is entrusted with protecting after Stewart joins him as a werewolf but doesn't have the love of a good woman to quell his animal appetite. A hirsute love story, part comedy, part horror, the cast also includes Christopher Plummer, Prunella Scales, Kate Nelligan and David Hyde Pierce and features an impressive gothic mise-en-scene and evocation of the New York publishing scene."
