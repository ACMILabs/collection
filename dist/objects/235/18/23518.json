        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Fundamentals of film making\". An introduction to moving picture photography using the written word in an analogy with the completed film: how a succession of single frames, equivalent of a letter in a single word, gives an impression of continuous movement; the definition and examples of a \"shot\" likening it to a word in a sentence; then the \"sequence\" equivalent of a paragraph or chapter, depending on length. The purpose terms used and results achieved when camera angles are varied and the camera moved, and the effect of varying the time scale. How to make basic transitions (cut, fade, mix) from shot to shot."
