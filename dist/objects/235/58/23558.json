        "Ping-Pong between two international champions, Denis Neale of Great Britain, and Jaroslav Stanek of Czechoslovakia. In this demonstration match the camera plays its own part in the action, often showing front-face views of the players simultaneously so that their amazing virtuosity and most telling shots may be observed without interruption. It is a sports film with a difference, and one that will prove as instructive to those already adept at the game as to novices. No spoken commentary."
