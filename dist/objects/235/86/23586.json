        "Quebec has a long tradition of good eating, but the haute cuisine served at the autumn banquet of the 'Le Club Prosper Montagne' is something that must be seen to be believed. This club is one of the oldest, most exclusive dining clubs in Quebec. Through the film cameras, you savour the elaborate, twelve course dinner with vintage wines, prepared by Chef of the Year Marcel Kretz at Hotel La Sapiniere in the Laurentians."
