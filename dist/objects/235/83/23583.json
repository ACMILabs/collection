        "Episode of Series \"College Physics\". Graphically presents the six processes in the gasoline engine cycle. The ideal situation with the elimination of disturbing factors is demonstrated and the Otto cycle is traced on a pressure-volume diagram. The concept of thermal efficiency is discussed in this film."
