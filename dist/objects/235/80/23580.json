        "The gas turbine is a heat engine, the simplest and smoothest running yet devised. All heat engines burn fuel, change a small part of the heat produced into energy, and waste the rest through the exhaust. In the gas turbine, rushing torrent of hot high-pressure exhaust gas is the turbine's source of power."
