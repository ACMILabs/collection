        "Episode of Series \"Man Alive\". Gale was 19, beautiful, intelligent, had much to offer and everything to live for. However she was a drug addict, and was recently found dead. She had been shifted in and out of 14 institutions throughout her life and believed no-one cared for her. Reporter Harold Williamson talks to people in Gale's life and the film asks if Gale need have died, and tries to show that there may be other Gales for whom it is not too late to help. Letters read by Anna Frankel."
