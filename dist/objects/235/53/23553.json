        "A little tailor, plagued by flies kills seven of them at one stroke. Pleased with his exploit, he embroiders on his belt the words 'Seven at one stroke'. When people read this he is taken for a great hero and sent to fight the giants. By trickery he manages to capture two of the giants and leads them back to the town, where he marries the King's daughter. Music by Freddie Phillips."
