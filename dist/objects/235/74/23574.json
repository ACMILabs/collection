        "Generations of culture in Japan are shown in gardens existing for hundreds of years; varying in form and expression reflecting the influence of the period in which each was built. A temple garden with thick moss and symbolic arrangement of stones; dry landscaping; extravagant and imposing gardens with beautiful lakes reflecting the mountains beyond; peaceful and harmonious settings for the buildings which were set in them."
