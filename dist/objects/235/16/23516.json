        "Outlines types of animals with respect to their food habits and the classes of food in the human body are shown. There are a number of minimum requirements - in food-value and in vitamin content - which the human body must have if it is to be healthy. Experiments carried out on animals demonstrates the results of deprivation of any one or more of these necessities vital to health. The film ends with suggestions for substitutes for various classes of foods which whilst they are vital for health, are often very expensive or unobtainable."
