        "An experimental film using firework images, sometimes superimposed and sometimes in very soft focus. The mystery of outer space is evoked, its blackness broken by shooting stars and meteor trails, gaseous clouds and solar configurations. The sound track has reversed and slowed down triangle and cymbals added to an accelerated piano and xylophone."
