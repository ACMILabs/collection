        "Ablutions is an interactive journey where the user controls the fate of a character in a world that consumes technology. Through exploring the narrative the user partakes in the experience of cleansing the self from everyday technology and its commodities; questioning the nature of our identity. By doing this, freedom is redefined. Once cleansed, the character recovers the lost items, discovering their meaning and importance."
