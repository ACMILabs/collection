        "Episode of Series \"21st Century\". An examination of some of the methods humans are utilising in their search for knowledge of existing social problems as well as projected social problems of the future. This film introduces us to new games now being played to prepare us for tomorrow. As we witness three such games, we see that apart from their childish role-playing aspect they can be constructive also."
