        "General physical health and hygiene practices as the basis of good dental health. A practising dentist shows how errors of diet and poor dental hygiene lead to poor teeth and avoidable cavities. Patients who have eaten the right foods all their lives and made a practice of finishing a meal with a crisp fruit have near-perfect teeth when in their fifties."
