        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". Provides experimental evidence for Avogadro's Hypothesis. First, some properties that distinguish gases are shown. Then, the volume of ammonia and hydrogen chloride that combine are measured quantitatively. The volume ratio is found to be 1:1. In a similar way, simple integer volume ratios are measured for the combination of hydrogen and oxygen, of nitric oxide and oxygen, and of hydrogen and chlorine. These simple integer ratios lead, logically, to Avogadro's Hypothesis."
