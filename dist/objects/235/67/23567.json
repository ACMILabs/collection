        "A film animation experiment in metaphoric imagery. This is a surrealistic garden where the earth seethes with strange, unusual shapes and activity, accelerated in movement, compressed in time. Insect-like creatures dart under and over the sand with elusive swiftness; Picasso-like faces stare momentarily upward, mutate, and disappear; wilted blossoms become suddenly animated. What happens on the screen is punctuated and accompanied by synthetic sound effects. Music by Bruce Mackay."
