        "This is the boy-meets-girl game, but played without rules and at a time when the boy must prove himself in the chase. It is about the much-discussed sexual behavior of teenagers and shows that often the game starts with a challenge to his masculine ego from the boy's peer group. Few adults are seen or heard from, nor does the film take sides in this game. A dramatisation."
