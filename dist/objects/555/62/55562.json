        "A tale of intolerance and where it all ends, told in an animated cartoon about a king and his kingdom, and bigotry that had its day. The illustrations and dialogue are light and amusing, but that does not mask the moral of the story: that unless we tolerate individual differences - even the king's nervous twitch - peace may only come when all are behind bars. Voice and narration: Pat Burns, George Geertsen (Awards: Sydney; Melbourne)"
