        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Lessons in visual language\". Lays to rest the mistaken idea that focal length affects the appearance of depth. Demonstrates that the camera-to-subject distance is the governing factor in the perception of spatial relationships in the third dimension. Devised and narrated by Peter Thompson."
