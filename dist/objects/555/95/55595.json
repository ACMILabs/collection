        "The film aims to promote a greater understanding of the changes which are taking place in the workforce. It shows women working in non-traditional female occupations such as commercial photography, bank manager, plumber, jockey, explosives technician and stage manager, and attempts to encourage young women to consider a broader range of jobs than those commonly regarded as suitable for women. In 1979 women represented 36% of the workforce and 43% of all women were in paid employment but research showed that women tended to be concentrated in a narrower spectrum of occupations than men, thereby limiting their opportunities. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
