        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Life goes to the movies\". Hollywood turned to more mature themes in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Looks at \"Film Noir\" such as \"Snake Pit\" and \"Lost Weekend\". Following McCarthyism hundreds of professionals were blacklisted. Another change of approach brought on a spate of monster films. Hosted by Henry Fonda. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
