        "In the spring of 1975, 104 artists of San Francisco let fly with imagination and creativity and built 75 \"cars\" and 32 trophies for an artists' annual soapbox (billycart) derby. Entries were built from such diverse materials as wire, papier-mache, sage-brush and bread. They raised $20,000 for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art."
