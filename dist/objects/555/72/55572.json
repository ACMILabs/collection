        "In creating Village Colleges in England, Henry Morris pioneered the idea of augmenting premises at local schools for use by the whole community. In recent years there has been an escalation in the wider use of school premises, sometimes for economic and sometimes for social reasons. this film argues that, given the right administrative structure (unitary control with a strong local community association) and a relatively small amount of additional finance, schools can provide ideal centres for the whole community - its children, its adults and its older people. Commentary by David Cass; photography by Chris Ware."
