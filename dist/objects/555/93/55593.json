        "A film about the radical attack surrealism and Dada wrought on the familiar and traditional art values of the past. Through the perceptive choice of paintings and sculptures from the work of de Chirico, Duchamp, Man Ray, Ernst, Miro, Magritte, Dali, Klee and others, we become exposed to the philosophy, poetry and politics of these fascinating art movements. Suitable for upper secondary level."
