        "Presents a basic introduction to the ways in which different animals see. Shows that some animals have simple eyes and some have compound eyes, highlighting how these two eye-types function and how they aid the particular animal in functioning within its environment, eg the differences between the eye-types of hunted and hunter animals. Also defines lens, retina and iris. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
