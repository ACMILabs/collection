        "The life history of the majestic black swan is depicted in its natural surroundings of swampland at the edge of lakes and lagoons. The nest which is made on reeds and twigs or any slight elevation in the swamp is defended against all comers. From 2-6 eggs are hatched and the cygnets take at once to the water. By six weeks they are almost adult and able to look after themselves. Swans are nomads and when heavy rain swamps their home they fly off to seek a new one. Scenes are included of other water birds such as pelicans, swamp hens and egrets. No other credits available."
