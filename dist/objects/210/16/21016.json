        "Episode of Series \"Adults Learning\". Designed to promote group discussion on the problems of the adult learning process in management-staff relations through a discussion between a potential university dropout, his friend and an onlooker. It suggests that not all learning occurs in the classroom. This film should not be screened by itself as a documentary. It does not provide direct information on the process of adult learning. It is a teaching aid which provides a basis for discussion."
