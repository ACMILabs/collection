        "In the critical minutes before professional help arrives, what is done can mean the difference between life and death. The film shows how to stop the bleeding at once. Animation models and re-enactments are used to illustrate the physiology, main pressure points and effective first aid techniques. Suitable for secondary years 7-12."
