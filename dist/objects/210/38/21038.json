        "Explains how the physical structure of birds is adapted to the food they eat. Shows members of the hawk family, which hunt by day, and calls attention to their strong wings, talons, and sharp hooked bill. Shows night hunters which have the sharp hooked bill and powerful large talons of the hawks. Explains that they rely on keen night vision and sensitive hearing to locate prey, and draws attention to the soft downy feathers on wing tips which make flight noiseless. No other credits available."
