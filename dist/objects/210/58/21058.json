        "The story of the difficulties encountered by a man recently discharged from a mental hospital; produced to promote understanding of this problem by the general public. Schuster is accepted by his boss as perfectly competent to do the job, but has some difficulty in overcoming the distrust and ignorance of his workmates, which hurt him considerably. His relationship with his wife is damaged by his suspicious attitude to her motives for remaining loyal to him, but he eventually realises the strength of their mutual love and accepts the fact that although not everyone will be on his side, there are some people on whom he can depend."
