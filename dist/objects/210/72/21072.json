        "Richly woven of fine threads that mingle and separate, surface and disappear, this poetic documentary studies the works of one of Canada's greatest contemporary etchers: Newfoundland-born David Blackwood. The artist himself guides the viewer through a step-by-step explanation of the entire etching process. Scenes of his hometown, examples of his masterfully crafted prints, and the vivid tales of an old mariner recall the tragic seal hunts and a way of life that has now vanished. (Awards: Yorkton, Brussels, Paris)"
