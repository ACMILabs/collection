        "In this episode of Noise TV we join host Shane Laffy, who introduces us to Mayor Vince Fontana for the opening of the Darebin Music Feast, a community celebration inviting and encouraging us to participate in finding expression through the arts, sharing and benefiting from the diverse cultural experiences that enrich our very own continually developing and unique Australian style and identity. Featuring an original music score by composer Simon Moore with TheNoise performers and performances on this show include, quirky street horn players, Five Angry Men, the infectious dance drum rythms of the Tumbarumba Samba School & Latin Soulfire Dancers, the amazing Soukous Ba Congo,featuring the soulful vocals of King Bell, Kurdish expert instrumentalist Dursam Akar, a tribute concert for pioneer Greek composer Thymios Stathoulopoulos, featuring vocals from mother and daughter Yiota and Maria Stathoulopoulos, and the ever popular sound of Janine Marshall and Neil Robe."
