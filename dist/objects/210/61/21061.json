        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Commonwealth of Nations\". South Africa, one of the largest members of the Commonwealth, a country with full self-government, has an acute race problem that causes dissension not only within its borders but within the Commonwealth and beyond. We see a country of fourteen million people where only one out of five is white. Edgar McInnis gives a dispassionate appraisal of the motivations behind the policy of apartheid and of whether the practice of segregation provides a satisfactory solution. This documentary provides a comprehensive overview of the history of South African colonisation, the apartheid system and the country's political developments using re-enactments, drawings, interviews and historic footage. Narrated by Edgar McInnis."
