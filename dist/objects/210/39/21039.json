        "Explains how the physical structure of birds is adapted to the kind of food they eat. Draws attention to the strong wings and wide bills of birds that chase insects in the air; the small size and agility of birds that hunt in bushes; and the strong chisel-shaped bill of wood-peckers. Shows the swallow, nighthawk, kingbird chestnut -sided warbler, black-billed cuckoo, white-breasted nuthatch, flicker, robin, bluebird, housewren, and hairy, downy and redheaded woodpeckers. No other credits available."
