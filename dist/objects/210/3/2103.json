        "Ngan Jila, or House of Riches, is an extraordinary piece of architecture. Designed by Renzo piano and widely known as Centre Culturel Tjibaou (CCT), the building is intended as a gesture of reconciliation from the French Government to the Kanak people. The CCT is creating the first museum collection of contemporary South Pacific art, but what does this entail? Ngan Jila exposes the work of artists in this field, and explores its dynamic and cross-cultural nature."
