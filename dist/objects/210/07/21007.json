        "A film made for the Keep Australia Beautiful Council. A satirical attack on the practice of dumping rubbish and a plea to Australians to preserve the beauty of their country. A family picnics in a suburban garden and leaves it as littered as many people do when picnicking in the country. The film ends with the well-known slogan \"Don't rubbish Australia\"! Suitable for secondary years 7-12."
