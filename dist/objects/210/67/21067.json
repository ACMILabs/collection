        "A breathtaking story of animal adventure which will arouse children's sympathy for wild animals, teach them about animals' adaptation to particular geographic conditions, and show them authentic pictures of a strange place, full of wonder and beauty. Set in the ice-clad Tian-Shan range in central Asia, the story of Black Patch, the little goat, is told - how he grows up to lead the wild herd of mountain goats to safety in their flight from wolves and hunters. (Features a white panther with markings similar to a jaguar or leopard as one of the predators of the goats.)"
