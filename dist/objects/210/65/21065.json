        "By using camera movement and editing technique the film animates the series of paintings \"The Black Man and his Bride\", by Arthur Boyd, which tells the story of an aborigine and his half-caste bride. Tim Burstall also wrote the original ballad sung to guitar accompaniment which runs for the duration of the film sung by Donald Ayrton."
