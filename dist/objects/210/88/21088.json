        "An appeal to all in normal health between 18 and 65 to act as regular blood donors, instancing ways in which blood is used to save life, in accident surgery, open heart surgery, using the heart-lung machine, for mother or baby in childbirth emergencies, and in the treatment of anaemias and of burns. Donor sessions are shown to be quite friendly occasions, and the giving of blood painless and without after-effect."
