        "In March 1963, Bali's holy mountain, Gurung Agung, erupted. Over a wide area there was darkness and rain and thousands fled their homes. Molten lava poured down the mountainside killing 1,500 people; 189,000 acres of rice paddy fields were destroyed and a wide area was covered in volcanic ash. Narrated by Denis Mathews."
