        "A record of the 1954 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition, which relieved the scientific stations at Macquarie and Heard Islands and established a new station at Mawson on MacRobertson Land in Australian Antarctic Territory. The film describes the expedition\u2019s departure from Melbourne in December 1953 and follows its 12,000 mile journey through high seas and pack ice, providing an insight into daily life at the stations and the challenges presented by often-difficult conditions. There is stunning footage of towering icebergs and masses of penguins as well as aerial reconnaissance and surveillance."
