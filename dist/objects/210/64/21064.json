        "The famous asphalt lake in Trinidad is the scene of one of the island's major industries. The film shows how the raw material is dug, processed, packed and shipped to many parts of the world. Trinidad asphalt is used for floors, roofs, electrical insulation and roads. Roads surfaced by Trinidad Lake asphalt are found the world over. The film includes a full account of operations at the asphalt refinery converting the raw material from the lake into the finished product ready for export."
