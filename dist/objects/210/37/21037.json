        "Explains how the physical structure of birds is adapted to the kind of food they eat. Draws attention to the long sharp bill, long toes and legs to support wading birds like the heron, the strong sharp pointed bill of the kingfisher which plunges into water to seize fish in its beak, the strong wings, legs, and talons of the osprey which glides in the air then drops into water to seize fish in its talons."
