        "The story of a man who lost his sight during the best years of his life. Filmed with the help of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, this study of blindness tries to show the emotional effect of the sudden loss of sight and how a man so stricken climbs back from the brink of despair. How he learns a trade which enables him to support himself and eventually a family, is a story of quiet triumph convincingly portrayed. Starring Len Cariou"
