        "Tidal flats, exposed at low tide on Westernport bay, support vegetation which harbours small marine life. They provide in turn, the feeding grounds for a large variety of birds. Inland from these grounds lies Rhyll Swamp, a protected area which is an important breeding ground for such species of bird as the Royal Spoonbill and White hen. The film looks at the influence of tides on wading and fishing birds and shows them in their nesting colonies in Rhyll Swamp. Filmed by Art Mayer and Graham Pizzey. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
