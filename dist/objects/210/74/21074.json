        "In the summer of 1914, Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, Gaudier-Brska and others published \"Blast\", the manifesto of the Vorticist movement. Their aim was to disrupt the Edwardian conventions of the Royal Academy and to introduce an alternative artistic vocabulary. The film gives an account of the activities of the Vorticists. Script by Richard Cork, photography by David Peat, music by Ron Geesin."
