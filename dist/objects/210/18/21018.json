        "Bim is the first achievement of director, Albert Lamorisse and, as in the case of Crin Blanc and his latest release 'The Red Balloon', he has made a delightful film. Photographed in Algiers, it tells of the adventures of a donkey and his youthful, affectionate owner. Lamorisse is one of those film makers who have a camera eye, that is the gift of pointing the camera lens to obtain pictures of infinite expressiveness. The most distinguished director in this field is Robert Flaherty. The story is that long ago in a far off Eastern Island, it was the custom for each child to have a baby donkey as a pet. One day the son of the Prince was riding haughtily through the streets when he took a fancy to Bim, the donkey belonging to a poor boy called Abdallah. The guards kidnapped Bim, who found himself a prisoner, condemned to death for eating the Great Prince's dinner, Bim was rescued by thieves who raided the island for animals. After a thrilling chase on land and sea, Abdallah and his friends managed to rescue Bim and all ended happily. Narrated by William Bledsoe."
