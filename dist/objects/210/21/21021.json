        "Demonstrates the role of molecular structure in determining biological activity. Shows correlation of structure and biological activity of sulfanilamide with a vitamin essential to bacterial growth as one example, then considers the effect on human cell growth of compounds similar to some found in cell chromosomes. Time-lapse photography shows the effect of one such compound, 5-fluorouracil, on growth of cancer cells. No other credits available."
