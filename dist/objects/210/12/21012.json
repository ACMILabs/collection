        "In a makeup that is a cross between the mask of an African storyteller and a harlequin, comic Bill Cosby's bigot destroys the human race. Under his spoofing lies a serious comment that stimulates honest discussion of the problems of racial prejudice. Photographer: Walter Eby; music: Willie Ruff."
