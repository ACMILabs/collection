        "This film studies several species of wild ducks, geese and other waterfowl - some reared in permanent captivity, others transient seasonal visitors to the Delta Waterfowl Research Station on one of the largest marsh areas on the shore of Lake Manitoba. From the constant parade of wild fowl swimming about on the Station's ponds, for the camera singles out individual birds for close observation while the commentary discusses their behaviour, nesting and migratory habits, and range in North America. No other credits available."
