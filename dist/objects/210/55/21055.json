        "Questions and challenges many aspects of modern childbirth practices. Poses such questions as: why do mothers have little say in the services that exist entirely for them? Why does this occasion for the celebration of life turn so often into an emotional and biological disaster? R. D. Laing talks about his ideas on childbirth. A group of mothers discuss their experiences in hospitals."
