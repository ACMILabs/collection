        "Hosted by John Denver, this program considers the habitat and behavior of the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and shows how the lives of the sheep are being threatened by the activities of man. Denver speaks and sings of the oneness with the world he feels during his trip through the mountains and of how people must relearn to respect nature, her laws and inhabitants. The trip covers the period from early spring through winter, and many animals are glimpsed and discussed. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
