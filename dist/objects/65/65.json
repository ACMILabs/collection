    ], 
    "description": [
        "Originally part of a two-channel installation, this work presents a series of elusive narrative moments culled from snippets of ordinary life and oddly extraordinary objects. These moments gain their meaning on the periphery of perception. Writes Baldino: According to William James, the 'present' is about 3 to 12 seconds long; everything else is constructed memory. Each segment of In the Present is within this time frame. What you see or don't see depends on what you remember. Your memory becomes part of the picture and distorts the idea of 'present' time."
