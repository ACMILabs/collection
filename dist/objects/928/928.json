        "This experimental interactive CD-ROM explores the intersections of narrative, subjectivity and interactivity. A hybrid of cinematic, textual and interactive elements, it finds resonances between dream experience and the unexpected associations inherent in new media forms. A map of sorts. A handful of objects. A problem with dreaming. Found objects and their imagined traces and histories assist a woman who has a problem with dreaming."
