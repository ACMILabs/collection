        "Unlike the world of live action feature films, animation is a form of filmmaking in which women, particularly over the last two decades, have made an enormous impact. This second part of the series aims to give a taste of the range of voices and styles in contemporary animation. Some of the films are intensely personal, some give new, relevant life to the phrase \"the personal is the political\", some re-invent the comic cartoon but all are truly original pieces of animation. Titles include: Fatty Issues/Candy Guard; The Door/Nina Shorina; The Stain/Marjut Rimminen & Christine Roche; Delivery Man/Emily Hubley; Daddy's Little Bit of Dresden China/Karen Watson; You Be Mother/Sarah Pucill; Wishful Thinking/Candy Guard; Greek Tragedy/Nicole van Goethem; The Interview/Caroline Leaf & Veronica Soul; Girls' Night Out/Joanna Quinn."
