        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Comedies et proverbes\". Third in Rohmer's series \"Comedies et Proverbes\" this gentle comedy of adult sexual mores, has as its motto a saying of Chretien de Troyes \"Qui trop parole, il se mesfait\" \"A wagging tongue bites itself\". Pauline joins her cousin for a holiday by the sea and has her fifteen year old eyes opened to the duplicity, hypocrisy and plain silliness of adult sexual politics. As the eponymous heroine, Amanda Langlet gives a beautifully subdued performance. Winner of Best Director award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1983. French language with English subtitles."
