        "Further adventures of Georgina who comes to stay with her grandfather, Farmer Dick on Tumbledown Farm. In these episodes the Chickabiddies announce the arrival of the ten new chicks; the tractors, Hubert and Fred decide which are the cleverest animals; Farmer Dick tells the story of Dulcie Maud and her 106 kittens while Georgina finds out about Prince Charming and who went riding in the baker's van. These episodes are a charming blend of animation, puppetry and real life. Based on the stories of Dick King-Smith."
