        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Comedies et proverbes\". Eric Rohmer takes a proverb from La Fontaine as his guiding principle in this, the second of his \"Comedies et proverbes\". \"Can any of us refrain, from building castles in Spain?\" - the castles in Spain, in this instance being the dream of an ideal marriage, which the heroine Sabine pursues in the form of the unwilling Edmond, a lawyer introduced to her by her matchmaking friend. An acutely observed portrait of pain and humiliation, made palatable by Rohmer's deft handling of the lighter as well as the darker side of human frailty. Beatrice Romand won the Best Actress award at the 1981 Venice Film Festival for her portrayal of the paradoxical Sabine."
