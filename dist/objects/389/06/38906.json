        "Episode of Series \"A Travellers' guide to the Orient\". After the ravages of the Korean War the city of Seoul was reduced to rubble and the country was divided in half. This travel documentary explores the beauty and richness of modern Seoul. We explore ancient palaces and temples set amidst towering skyscrapers; we visit the historic Namhansansong Fortress; and witness the various rites of the country's Buddhist and Confucian religions. The video takes us on a cruise down the Han-Gang River where we end the journey at the splendid Olympic Stadium, a symbol of the reconstruction of modern Seoul."
