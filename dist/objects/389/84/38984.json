        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Infinity series\". The human eye, even aided by powerful modern-day telescopes can only see a small fraction of the universe. This program shows how modern radio astronomy and computer imaging techniques have enabled us to see previously invisible objects, as well as more familiar ones, through the light of radio waves, ultra-violet, infra-red and x-rays. This episode of \"Using the telescope\" shows how a 4\" and 8\" telescope in conjunction with an SLR camera, and accessories can be used to take spectacular photographs."
