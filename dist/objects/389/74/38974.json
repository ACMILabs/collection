        "Claudius reflects on the history of his family at the twilight of his life. Claudius - lame, a stutterer and considered a fool, manages to stay alive during the turbulent times of the early emperors of Rome. Here his evil grandmother Livia, married to Emperor Augustus, poisons her enemies, his uncle Tiberius runs a depraved court and his nephew Caligula sinks into a madness which manifests itself in unspeakable cruelties. Claudius seeks to tell the truth about the good and bad apples of his family tree. Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Sian Phillips as Livia received British Academy Awards. Also stars Brian Blessed as Augustus and John Hurt as Caligula."
