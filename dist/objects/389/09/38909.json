        "Globalisation of information, new technologies, the changing nature of our lives, are factors forcing educators everywhere to face an unprecedented period of reassessment. The teachers in this video are meeting this challenge head-on. \"Korea\" : a teacher uses drawings and cartoons to teach geometry. \"United States of America\" : an history teacher creates an experimental learning situation to foster an understanding of social injustice in her students. \"Poland\" : a teacher has his students exploring tradition and cultural taboo in relation to change and compromise."
