        "Set in the 21st Century, and influenced by 'Dr. Strangelove' and '2001: a space odyssey', \"Dark Star\" is essentially a serious concept about the condition of humankind. Entertaining and exciting, it also has dry humour and special effects that are out of this world. The scoutship Dark Star travels far in advance of the colony ships, combing the universe for unstable planets which could menace the main fleet. The crew of four men has been in space for twenty years, they must remain in space until all their bombs are gone and their mission is complete. Stars Brian Narelle, Dre Pahich, Cal Kuniholm and Dan O'Bannon."
