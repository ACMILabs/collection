        "Based on the novel by Bruce Chatwin, this is an unrelenting portrayal of the raw experience of rural farm life in the Welsh border country. Starting in 1895, it focuses on the lives of four generations of a farming community and spans 85 years. At the heart of the story is the intense relationship between identical twin brothers, Benjamin (Mike Gwilym) and Lewis (Robert Gwilym) Jones. The film ultimately expresses the healing nature of time and the promise of the future."
