        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Comedies et proverbes\". Illustrating the phrase \"the friends of my friends are my friends\", \"Boyfriends and girlfriends\" begins as a comedy of perversity involving mismatched couples, in one of the new satellite cities ringing Paris. What makes it such fun is the freshness that Rohmer is able to bring to his film. There's a vast dichotomy between what the characters say and do (or won't say and won't do) and the manicured man-made environment of Cergy-Pontoise. It is between those lines of dialogue and architecture that the film's punch and spirit rests. Wistful, poignant and tender, this last chapter of Rohmer's remarkable \"Comedies et proverbes\" cycle is a perfect place to take in the Gallic charm, elegant poise and cool wit of Eric Rohmer."
