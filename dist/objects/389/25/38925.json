        "Hanussen is the third in a sumptuous film trilogy by Istvan Szabo, concerning Central Europe between the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the prelude to WWII. All three star the charismatic Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer as individuals in whom the tragic contradictions of the period are brought to a crisis. In Hanussen he is an Austrian corporal wounded in the head during WWI, who then finds he has the power to foresee the rise of Nazism, but trivialises his powers as a hypnotist until his final downfall. Nominated for an Academy Award as best foreign film."
