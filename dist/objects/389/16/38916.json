        "The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) is the Australian Government overseas aid agency. Most Australians are aware of the government's role in international relief efforts. However this is just a small part of the aid program. Most of the program is directed towards long-term sustainable development. Sustainable development requires long term strategies to help people improve their own social economic circumstances. This 12 minute video gives an outline of Australia's official overseas development program. It explains why we have an aid program, where and how it is delivered, what types of assistance we provide and the commercial benefits to Australia."
