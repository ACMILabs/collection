        "Jules Feiffer's bittersweet story follows the diverse paths of Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel as each tries to match their sexual fantasies with an uncooperative reality. One chooses the narrow confines of the marriage contract, the other the broader pleasures of playing the field. They meet as roommates at college in the 1940s, where Candice Bergen is the object of mutual attention. We meet them again in the 1950s when Garfunkel is a bored suburban husband, and Nicholson is still playing the field, notably with Ann-Margaret. The final 13 minutes of the film are set in the late 1960s."
