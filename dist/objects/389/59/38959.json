        "SBS presenter Silvio Rivier hosts these two programs on the tourist delights of Korea, \"Land of morning calm\". Each program begins in Seoul, now the fourth largest city of the world and shows the enormous contrast between the old and the new, in the ancient palaces and the modern shopping centres. The first program also visits the Korean folk village near Seoul, Mt. Sorak National Park on the north coast and Kyongju, the ancient Korean capital. The second program visits the town of Pusan and Cheju Island, honeymoon capital of Asia."
