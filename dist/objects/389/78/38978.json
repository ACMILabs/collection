        "Russell Woody shows how to mix colour from a visual, rather than a theoretical perspective. Addresses how to select alternate colours to save money, how to correct failed colour mixes with minimal mixing, how to compare colours for opacity, outstanding coverage and transparency and glazes or washes. Provides an understanding of basic colour terms, how one colour can have several names, how words can distort colour vision and how to alleviate the problem."
