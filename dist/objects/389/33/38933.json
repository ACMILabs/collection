        "Frustrated in their efforts to find financial backing, six French film-makers took to the streets of Paris with scripts of their own devising and 16mm cameras in this demonstration of low budget, rapid production filmmaking. Many of the directors, actors and cinematographers in this compilation would go on to become central figures of the French New Wave. 1.\"Saint-Germain-des-Pres\" (Jean Douchet) An American studying in Paris is dropped by one French boy only to be picked up by another 2.\"Gare du Nord\" (Jean Rouch) A young couple's row is observed in real time in one continuous take 3.\"Rue-Saint Denis\" (Jean-Daniel Pollet) A shy dishawasher brings a prostitute back to his room 4.\"Place de l'Etoile (Eric Rohmer) A businessman hits a tramp with his umberella and imagines he has killed him 5.\"Montparnasse et Levallois\" (Jean-Luc Godard) A girl fears she has mixed up letters to her two lovers 6.\"La Muette\" (Claude Chabrol) A young boy tired of hearing his parents argue buys earplugs and fails to hear his mother's cry for help. In French with English subtitles."
