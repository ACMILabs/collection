        "Another animated classic from the Disney studios. Mowgli, the man-cub raised by wolves, must leave the jungle to take his place in the man-village. The journey is a dangerous one as Shere-Khan, the mighty tiger has sworn to kill the man-cub. Mowgli, accompanied by his loyal friends, Bagheera the panther, and Baloo, the irresponsible bear, meet an array of friends who help Mowgli escape Shere-Khan. A delightful score and voices by stars such as Phil Harris, George Sanders and Sebastion Cabot, make this a \"song-filled celebration you'll never forget.\""
