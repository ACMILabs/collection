        "The Builders: There is building work required in the hotel lobby and, when Sybil's back is turned, Basil immediately goes for the lowest quote for the job, but soon discovers why O'Reilly and his men come so cheap. \"The Wedding party\": Basil's prudish nature is outraged by what he perceives to be an outbreak of promiscuity at Fawlty Towers. As ever, he first grabs the wrong end of the stick and then proceeds to beat himself with it. \"The Psychiatrist\": A young yobbo whom Sybil obviously fancies, a voluptuous Australian girl and a psychiatrist provide a hilarious series of misunderstandings and blunders by Basil."
