        "The year is 2019. All that has survived of the 20th century is television. Television in a new and twisted fashion where the most powerful program on the air is a high-stakes, high-tech game show. \"The Running man\" is a deadly futuristic cat and mouse carnival in which contestants battle for the ultimate prize - survival! Based on the novel by Richard Backhman, this was rated one of the best action movies of the year."
