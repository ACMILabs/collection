        "Polanski's first feature film is a \"remarkably self-confident debut.\" Using only three characters, the dramatic tension of their interaction is intense; mirrored not only in the bare grey landscapes, but also underpinned by a cool but discordant jazz score. \"The Knife in the water\" counterpoints the youthfulness and vulnerability of the student with the armour-plated self assurance of the husband and wife. Set on board a small sailing boat, the sense of claustrophobia, hence being trapped, is heightened as the characters struggle for control over each other."
