        "Winner of an Academy Award for best foreign film, this is the story of Oskar, a small boy, born into the feast and famine, the facism and slaughter of Germany during the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich. At three, he'd already had enough of this violent and confused world and decides he'd be better off to remain a three-year-old forever. Incredibly, he remains frozen in size and faces life with two weapons... his tin drum- which he bangs to drown out horror and lies... and his childish voice which he raises to a piercing shriek which breaks glass. German language with English subtitles."
