        "Russia's deadliest drug smuggler has gone to Chicago to gain dominance of the drug market in the United States. Moscow's most disciplined police officer is sent over to hunt him down, working in collaboration with a wise-cracking U.S. detective who follows his own rules. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi, \"Red Heat\" is a well-crafted mix of humour and action with some deftly executed stunt sequences."
