        "Dickens' classic tale of kindness, truth and virtue completely mucked up and ruined by having a member of the Blackadder family involved. Also Baldrick, of course the man you can rely on to turn a Christmas dinner into a dog's dinner, as long as the dog isn't particularly fussy. Stuffed with deeply horrid people (many of whom are gigantically fat) and groaning with cartloads of seasonal bottom jokes, it manages to squeeze in not only a Victorian Blackadder but also his famous Elizabethan, Regency and Space Age relatives into a huge pie of entertainment that will satisfy all but the most discriminating viewers. Stars, Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Robbie Coltrane, Miranda Richardson, Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. Written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton."
