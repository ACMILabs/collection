        "No performer on the world stage has received so much acclaim and publicity as Rudolf Nureyev, and no one has given away so little about their private life and thinking. From his home on the Mediterranean island of Il Gali, Nureyev reminisces about his life, from his home town of Ufa in the central Soviet Union, to his time at the Kirov and his defection to the West in 1961. This definitive biography chronicles the truths and legends surrounding the fiery Tartar, and incorporates extensive archival material of Nureyev's most famous roles, including Le Corsaire, Sleeping Beauty, Marguerite and Armand, Apollo, Aureole, Don Quixote, Cinderella and Pierrot Lunaire."
