        "Episode of Series \"A Travellers' guide to the Orient\". Nestled among mountain ranges and blessed with a cool, temperate climate we journey to some of the lesser known areas of Thailand. We take a jungle trek with the women of the Karen tribe, visit the Emerald Lake in the Angthong Marine National Park and participate in the beautiful Candle Festival at Sukhothai. The paradisaical Thai landscape is full of beautiful forests and rivers and we visit an elephant park at Surin. We glimpse Thailand's natural beauty as well as the rites, customs and lives of its Buddhist population."
