        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". In this program Teresa M. Amabile shows how to supplement the graphic representation of distributions with a few well-chosen numbers. Using the example of the comparable worth debate on women's wages, she demonstrates how to find the median and the mean, the significance of quartiles, and maximum and minimum values when there is a skewed distribution. A box plot is a useful tool for comparing distributions and when the distribution is symmetric the terms, interquartile range and standard deviation are useful. Other examples used are the calorific value of hot dogs, and the analysis of urine samples using sound."
