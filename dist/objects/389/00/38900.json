        "Episode of Series \"A Travellers' guide to the Orient\". India is a land of contrasts: imperial grandeur sits next to miserable poverty; the steep icy pinnacles of the Himalayas and the corrosive heat of Calcutta. This video begins by taking us through the frenzied streets of Calcutta, then we go onto Darjeeling and witness a sunrise over the Himalayas. The other places spotlighted on this beautifully shot video include Orissa, Puri, Madras, Konark, Hyderabad, Bangalore and we visit the majestic palaces of the Maharajahs in Mysore. The journey ends amongst the spiritual havens of Ooty and Cochin."
