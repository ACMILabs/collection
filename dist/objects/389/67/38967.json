        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". One of the greatest difficulties facing migrants arriving in Australia is the difficulty of acquiring English language skills. This video explores some of the innovative language courses being designed for work-places with a large number of non-English speaking background employees. The experiences of an older generation of migrants who received no English language training are contrasted with the experiences of more recent migrants who have found that English courses at work-sites offer a boost to their confidence at work. Apart from examining the benefits of English training at work, the video shows the conflicts arising between migrant and Australian-born workers, the latter often being initially resistant to the value of the courses."
