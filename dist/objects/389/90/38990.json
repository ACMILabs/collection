        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Dragon's tongue\". This first episode introduces the phrases \"What is your name?\", \"How old are you?\" and their answers, \"This is\", \"He is\" and \"She is\" and words for family members and pets. At the same time we are shown the homes of two different families in Beijing, glimpses of children at school, a zoo visit and the pets the Chinese keep. We also have a brief introduction to calligraphy and how the modern pictograms have developed. Introduced by Colin McKerras. In Mandarin and English."
