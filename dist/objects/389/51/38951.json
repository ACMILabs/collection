        "Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra romp elegantly through the scenic, moneyed grounds and waters of outwardly elitist Newport, Rhode Island in this hip, witty, musical version of Philip Barry's 'The Philadelphia story'. Legendary Louis Armstrong, starring as himself, plays his trumpet and narrates in prose and song the peccadillos of his song-writer friend C. K. Dexter-Haven as he tries to win back his haughty ex-wife on the eve of her marriage. Music by Cole Porter."
