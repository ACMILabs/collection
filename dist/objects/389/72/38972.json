        "Gustav Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) is a distinguished man, a world-famous conductor who embodies all the civilised virtues of the European culture he represents. Yet on a solitary holiday in Venice, he spies an innocent boy - and abandons himself to a secret passion that carries him to his doom. Lyrical, intelligent and heartbreakingly beautiful \"Death in Venice\" accompanied by the haunting music of Gustav Mahler, will leave its echo in your memory for years to come. Based on Thomas Mann's classic novel 'Death in Venice', Visconti's film was voted Grand Prix winner at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. Also stars Marc Burns, Bjorn Andresen and Silvana Mangano."
