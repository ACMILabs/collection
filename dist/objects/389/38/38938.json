        "Alice Walker's joyous Pulitzer Prize winning novel comes to the screen as one of Steven Spielberg's most powerful personal films. This enthralling story begins in a small Georgia town in 1906, when young Celie, hardly more than a child herself, gives birth to two children, fathered by the man she calls \"Pa\" and who takes the infants from her at birth and tells her nothing of their fate. Sustained by a close bond with her sister Nettie, Celie submerges her own identity as she is mistreated by every man in her life. This film covers the gamut of joy, sorrow, loss and reunion. It is truly unforgettable and the ending is an inspirational triumph. Stars Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Rae Dawn Chong, introducing Whoopi Goldberg as Celie and Oprah Winfrey as Sofia."
