        "Unlike the world of live action feature films, animation is a form of filmmaking in which women, particularly over the last two decades, have made an enormous impact. This first in a series aims to give a taste of the range of voices and styles in contemporary animation. Some of the films are intensely personal, some reinvent the comic cartoon but all are truly original pieces of animation. Titles include: Feet of song/Erica Russell; Two sisters/Caroline Leaf; Alternative fringe/Candy Guard; Springfield/Emma Calder; Emergence of Eunice/Emily Hubley; Poodle/Nina Shorina; A little something/Candy Guard; Murders most foul/Gillian Lacey; Some protection/Marjut Rimminen; Full of grace/Nicole Van Goethem; Second class mail/Alison Snowden."
