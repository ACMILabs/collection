        "Episode of Series \"A Travellers' guide to the Orient\". China is the world's longest continuous civilisation and the country is rich with ancient artefacts and sites. The opening of China to tourism by its Communist rulers has meant that this nation of over one billion people is now a popular tourist attraction. This video begins in the capital of Beijing where we witness the marvels of the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven. From there we travel to Xian and follow the Silk Road to Lanzhou, and visit a Buddhist monastery. From there onwards we travel across the stark Gobi Desert. This video is an excellent introduction to the landscape and vast diversity of China."
