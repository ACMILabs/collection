        "Featuring close-up photography of the pyramids, the ancient city of Luxor, the Valley of the Kings, Tutankhamen's tomb, as well as modern cities and towns, this film examines a country that was the first great power of the ancient world. The film illustrates how throughout the ages Egypt has depended greatly on the Nile River for water, for agriculture and for survival."
