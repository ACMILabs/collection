        "Wolfgang Sawallisch conducts the choir and orchestra of the Bayerischen Staatsoper, in this often unsuccesful masterpiece. The director, August Everding, in the 27p. booklet accompanying this video, sees Man, bound together by body and soul, as the principal character of this great drama which describes the road from Nature to Civilisation, and which seeks to reconcile the duality of dark and light, good and evil. The singers include Lucia Popp, Edita Gruberova, Francisco Araiza, Wolfgang Brendel and Kurt Moll. Sung in German."
