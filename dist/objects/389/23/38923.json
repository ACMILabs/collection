        "Jessie Matthews, \"the dancing divinity\" of British cinema in the 1930's, stars in this attempt to emulate the large production musicals of MGM. The score is by Rodgers and Hart, and each number \"adds a little something to the story.\" A young actress successfully impersonates her own mother, a former music-hall star who had mysteriously disappeared a quarter of a century earlier at the height of her career. This promotional gimmick of the \"star who will never grow old\" sets in motion an intriguing story of mistaken identity and sexual ambiguity."
