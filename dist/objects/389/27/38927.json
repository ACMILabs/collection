        "A brilliantly allusive meditation on the nature of fantasy, imagination and magic this seminal film is regarded by many as Rivette's most accomplished film. The narrative, spinning a tortuous, circular fantasy out of reality, using correspondences, premonitions and transferences as its mortar, is absolutely riveting: weird and wonderful, scary and funny in equal measure. A compulsive shaggy dog story, the real importance of the film is the way it demonstrates exactly how cinema works through an exhilarating display of parodies and genre pastiches. Cast includes Juliet Berto, Dominique Labourier, Bulle Ogier and Marie-France Pisier."
