        "Episode of Series \"A Travellers' guide to the Orient\". The Philippines is a nation of over a hundred ethnic groups and since ancient times it has been a major trading partner for the Asian world. This two part video starts off in Manila and its surrounds as we explore the historic sites and buildings left behind by the island's Spanish and American colonisers. From Manila we travel to the opulent Coconut Palace of the Marcos Regime and observe a bizarre flagellation and crucifixion rite that occurs every Easter. In the second part of the video we explore some of the multitude of islands that make up the Philippines, including Cebu and the beautiful natural paradises of Badian and Dakak."
