        "Episode of Series \"Comedies et proverbes\". He who has two women loses his soul is the cryptic message at the start of this film in Eric Rohmer's \"Comedies et proverbes\" cycle. The he of the message is, in this instance, a she - Louise who cannot bear being \"loved too much\". And so she plays a game of seduction with her two aspiring lovers, one of whom she loves too, in her own way. And what if they get tired of waiting, of being available? Pascale Ogier won the best actress award at Venice in 1984 for her role as Louise. She is supported by Tcheky Karyo and Fabrice Luchini."
