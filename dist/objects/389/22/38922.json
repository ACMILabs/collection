        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Comedies et proverbes\". The first of Eric Rohmer's six \"Comedies et proverbes\" hinges on the activities of four central characters who mislead, misunderstand and finally miss out. A delightful comedy of errors, spiced with Rohmer's portrayal and obvious understanding of the pain which can result from poor human communication."
