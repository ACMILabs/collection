        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Infinity series\". A breathtaking tour of the solar system. Moving pictures and photographs from NASA and leading observatories, plus exciting animation create this fascinating and striking documentary. Some narration, but mostly a visual production with an excellent musical score. Space and the wonders of the Solar System are revealed before our eyes. A bonus feature at the end shows how telescopes work."
