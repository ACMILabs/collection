        "Claudius continues the history of his diabolical family. Plunged further into madness, Caligula imagines himself to be the most divine god of Rome. The power he wields causes him to act with cruelty and tyranny. Ultimately he is murdered by those no longer willing to suffer injustice. Claudius, the \"old fool\", is reluctantly elected Emperor as prophesised. In Part IV, Claudius married to the cunning, unfaithful Messalina, rules wisely but longs for the Republic. These programs contain scenes of violence and nudity."
