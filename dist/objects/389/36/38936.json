        "This is the final part of a three volume series featuring the best of world animation by women. The three films included have been recognised for their ground breaking qualities and make witty and provocative use of the myths, fairytales, and sexual iconography that have affected the way women have been seen - and see themselves. Featuring: Asparagus/Susan Pitt; The Decision/Vera Neubauer; The Brooch Pin and the Sinful Clasp/Joanna Woodward."
