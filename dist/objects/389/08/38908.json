        "Globalisation of information, new technologies, the changing nature of our lives and our work, are factors forcing educators everywhere to face an unprecedented period of reassessment. The teachers in this video are meeting the challenge head-on. \"Australia\": Stephanie Lawrence, a teacher from Devonport, Tasmania, uses self actualisation techniques to develop her students self-esteem. \"Japan\": Shigeto Honda, a teacher from Ichikawa City near Tokyo, teaches his students about the diversities of Asian cultures by experiencing first hand. \"Canada and Finland\": Pekka Hynninen from Rantasalmi in rural Finland takes his students on a hike and boat trip for a scientific environmental study. The class of Rachel Hunneault from Northern Ontario participates in an interactive Telecommunications Network."
