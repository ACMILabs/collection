        "A biography of brilliant physicist Professor Stephen Hawking who has expanded and re-evaluated our knowledge of science despite having ALS - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis since the age of 21. An inspirational film exploring the infinite possibilities of the human mind in extending the boundaries of knowledge in regard to why we and the universe exist. The bold use of graphics and striking imagery address theories surrounding an expanding universe, the creation, black holes and past, present and future."
