        "Georgina comes to stay with her grandfather Farmer Dick on Tumbledown Farm. She makes friends with a variety of puppet characters and animals, including the Chickabiddies (singing hens), Hubert and Fred (farm machinery) and her friend the cat. In these three episodes Georgina discovers who is the cleverest animal; Farmer Dick tells how he flew in the story of Barney the Bull and Georgina discovers which comes first - the horse or the cart. This video is an enchanting, entertaining blend of animation, puppetry and real life. Based on the stories of Dick King-Smith."
