        "When the military authorities release a noxious substance that causes \"death from instant old age\" in everyone over twenty-five, the youth of America are left to their own devices to invent a new world order. This black, totally zany film is one of Roger Corman's triumphs as it captures a blend of acid rock, far-out humour and revolutionary politicking in the true spirit of the sixties and the Love Generation. Stars Robert Corff, Elaine Giftos, Ben Vereen and Cindy Williams and features music performed by Country Joe and the Fish."
