        "A stormy night becomes a spiral of mounting terror as Lord Byron entertains his guests at the Villa Diodati on the shores of Lac Leman. Gathered by Byron is the poet Shelley, his young lover Mary Godwin and her impulsive half-sister Claire. Dr. Polidori completes the party. The terrifying topics that the five turn to after dinner creates an atmosphere (already enhanced by opium) that will eventually bombard them with nightmarish visions. Inspired by events that took place in 1816, Mary Shelley was inspired to write \"Frankenstein\" after this weekend. Stars Gabriel Byrne, Julian Sands, Natasha Richardson, Miriam Cyr and Timothy Spall."
