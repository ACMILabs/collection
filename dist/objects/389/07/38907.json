        "A profoundly moving and inspirational sequel to the critically acclaimed \"Suzi's Story\". It is the story of Vince and Troy Lovegrove, the father and son who survived Suzi when she died from AIDS in 1987. Troy carried the AIDS virus from birth. This is Troy's story - the story of what it is to be seven, to love life as only a child can and yet to be a victim of AIDS."
