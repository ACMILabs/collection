        "Episode of Series \"A Travellers' guide to the Orient\". Borneo has long held a fascination for travellers because of the variety of its land forms and the multicultural communities of its population. The video explores the range of islands which make up Borneo, taking us through Sabah (the largest island) then onto Selingaan Island home of wild and beautiful turtles. In Sarawak we explore the fairy-tale palaces of the White Rajahs and take a trip down the Skrang River into the rainforests of Bako. This beautifully shot video is a stimulating introduction to the geography and people of Borneo."
