        "Maddalena is a rich and respectable wife and mother, who occasionally abandons her Roman villa to go and live in Florence as Rosanna, the mistress of a handsome gipsy criminal. Like the classic horror film it is a drama rooted in sexual repression, using schizophrenia and amnesia rather than the fantastic. \"Madonna of the Seven Moons\" is based on the novel \"The Madonna of Seven Moons\" by Margery Lawrence and stars Stewart Granger, Phyllis Calvert and Patricia Roc."
