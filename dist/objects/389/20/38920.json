        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Six contes moraux = Six moral tales\". La Collectionneuse was the first feature Rohmer made in 35mm and colour. Feeling vaguely abandoned as his girlfriend has gone to London, Adrian, a dilettante philosopher, goes to stay at a friend's villa on the outskirts of St. Tropez. Daniel, an avant-garde artist, and Haydee, a sweetly amoral nymphette who sleeps with a different boy every night, are there also. As the collector of the title, she causes disarray in the two men who decide it is their duty to resist her advances - an intellectual rather than physical moral superiority. It is Adrian, frustrated and chastened, who finally fulfils the moral outline of the series, by hopefully planning a reconciliation with his girlfriend."
