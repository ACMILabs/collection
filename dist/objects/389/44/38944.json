        "Peter Sellers debuts in this film as Inspector Closeau and in doing so, has become a movie legend. Romance, intrigue, exotic locations and an all star cast including Claudia Cardinale, David Niven, Robert Wagner and Cappucine, make this film a sheer delight. The movie takes its name from the rare \"Pink Panther\" gem owned by Princess Dala. The Phantom, a well-known jewel thief is intent on robbery, and Inspector Closeau, while knocking over vases at every turn, attempts to foil the plot. This film includes a universally acclaimed animated sequence featuring the cartoon Panther."
