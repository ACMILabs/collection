        "Filmed in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge, the world famous King's College Choir perform the traditional Christmas festival of nine lessons and carols. The carols include all of the standard favourites, such as \"Once in Royal David's city\", \"O little town of Bethlehem\", \"We three kings of orient are\" and \"O come all ye faithful\". The second half of the video is a documentary which shows the lives of the choristers and scholars in the school, some performances and their preparations for the Christmas festival as well as explaining the history of the school and the chapel. The Choir is directed by Stephen Cleobury."
