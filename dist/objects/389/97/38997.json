        "In the near future, the air and water is poisoned, the result is sterility. Only one out of a hundred women can still bear children and some women stopped, believing there would be no future. The solution; to create an army of 'handmaids', an involuntary, semi-religious order of women who exist solely to bear children for the rich, powerful ruling class. Kate (Natasha Richardson) becomes a victim of this cruel and backward world, where women are divided into three kinds, Handmaids, Wives or Prostitutes. A chilling look at a possible future. Based on the novel by Margaret Atwood. Screenplay by Harold Pinter. Cast also includes Victoria Tennant, Faye Dunaway, Elizabeth McGovern, Aidan Quinn and Robert Duvall."
