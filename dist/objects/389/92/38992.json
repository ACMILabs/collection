        "In 1987, Sally Jones interviewed three of the world's most famous cricketers; Imran Khan, Sir Richard Hadlee and Australia's Allan Border. With introductions by ex-England Captain Bob Willis, viewers are given an opportunity to share in the public and private life of these legendary sportsmen. Imran talks about his his status as a \"pop star\" cult hero type in Pakistan; Sir Richard Hadlee of his family's involvement in New Zealand cricket; while Allan Border shows what he can do on the golf course as well as the cricket pitch."
