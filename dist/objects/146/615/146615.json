    "description": [
        "In the 1930s, Anne-Marie Stratter lives in Calcutta with her husband, the French Ambassador. During a reception at the Embassy, Anne-Marie dances with her lover, Michael Richardson, unaware of her husband's glances. Anne-Marie is equally unaware of the passion in the vice-consul's eyes. The vice-consul declares is passion to Anne-Marie. She rebuffs him. The vice-consul runs off and a heartrending cry tears the stillness of the night. Further viweing: In 'Son nom de Venise dans Calcutta desert'(1976), Marguerite Duras re-uses the same soundtrack, this time accompanied with images of the Embassy, now deserted, where the action of 'India Song' took place. The closing sequence of 'Son nom de Venise dans Calcutta desert' is used as the opening sequence for 'India Song'.  Credits: Producer, Stephane Tchalgadjieff ; director, Marguerite Duras ; writer, Marguerite Duras ; photography, Bruno Nuytten ; music, Ludwig van Beethoven, Carlos d'Alessio. Cast: Delphine Seyrig, Michel Lonsdale, Claude Mann, Mathieu Carriere, Didier Flamand, Vernon Dobtcheff."
