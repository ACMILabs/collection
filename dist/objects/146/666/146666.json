        "Three 'bourgeois' who have built their fortune on drug trafficking attempt to get together to celebrate a successful transaction, but only there are complications waiting at every turn. Bunuel applies his surrealist touch to a mundane event: a dinner party that may never come to pass. The initial problem seems to be a simple scheduling mistake, but the obstacles become more and more bizarre. At one point, the guests are interrupted at the table by an army on manoeuvres.
