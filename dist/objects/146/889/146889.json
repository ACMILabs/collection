        "The film is based on the 15th century French legend, wherein the Devil, disturbed by the encroaching forces of Good, sends his envoys to Earth to drive the citizens to despair. Dominique and Gilles appear at the court of Baron Hugues disguised as troubadours on the day Hugues celebrates the engagement of his daughter Anne to Renaud. Dominique seduces the Baron and persuades him to kill Renaud during a tournament. But Gilles and Anne fall in love. Furious to see his scheme thwarted by true love, the devil himself decides to intervene. Note: The antisemitic laws of the Vichy regime made it illegal for Trauner and Kosma (regular members of Carne's crew) to work in the film industry. Their work on this film is uncredited. Francois Chaumette, Simone Signoret, Alain Resnais and Jean-Pierre Mocky appear as extras.  Credits: Producer, Andre Paulve ; director, Marcel Carne ; writers, Jacques Prevert, Pierre Laroche ; photography, Roger Hubert ; music, Joseph Kosma, Maurice Thiriet ; art direction, Alexandre Trauner, Georges Wakhevitch, Leon Barsacq. Cast: Arletty, Alain Cuny, Marie Dea, Jules Berry, Fernand Ledoux, Marcel Herrand, Roger Blin, Jean d'Yd."
