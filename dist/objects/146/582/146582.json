        "Ben is a woman who never gets to do what she really wants to and is the victim of everybody and everything. Benedict is her imaginary creation: the girl who would respond with strength and mastery to situations Ben can only submit to. She is married to a cad who says he only married her because she was pregnant, and now he wants his freedom. Her real love is a fellow medical student who shows some interest in her. Nonetheless, she remains faithful to her unenthusiastic husband, until she becomes pregnant again. At this point she begins to act more like the Benedict of her dreams and less like the Ben  she has lived as until now.  Credits: Producer, Claude Nedjar ; director, Paula Delsol ; writer, Paula Delsol ; photography, Claude Beausoleil ; music, Larry Martin ; title song, Pierre Barouh. Cast: Francoise Lebrun, Andre Dussolier, Daniel Duval, Francois Perrier [voice only], Jacques Jeannet."
