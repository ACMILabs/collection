        "Paul, a jazz musician, lives with his wife, Isabelle and their young boy, Marc. He is offered to tour the USA for what he thinks is a vast amount of money. Instead, he spends ten years in  prison for passing counterfeit money. On his return to France, he is informed he has lost custody of his child. Considering he has been victimized enough by his sojourn in prison, Paul decides to go in search of Marc. At first, he is happy enough to observe the boy from a distance, but after a while, he realises his need for close contact and puts a plan together to kidnap his son.  Credits: Director, Gerard Blain ; writers, Gerard Blain, Andre de Baeque, Marie-Helene Bauret ; photography, Daniel Gaudry ; music, Jean-Pierre Sabar. Cast: Gerard Blain, Dominique Ravix, Daniel Sarky, Cesar Chauveau."
