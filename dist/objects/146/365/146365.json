        "An old village in Siberia is to be destroyed and its peasant community, locked into ancient ritual, resettled in a development of faceless apartment blocks. Darya opposes the move, preferring to die rather than acquiesce, while her son works as foreman of the operation. The whole period from the announcement of the scheme to its completion is covered, presenting a conflict between the old order and the new, and a record of the price that has to be paid for progress. Larisa Shepitko, the wife of the director, was scheduled to direct this film but she and four other crewmembers died in a car accident on the first day of location shooting, July 2, 1979.  Credits: Producer, A. Rasskazov, G. Sokolova ; director, Elem Klimov ; writer, Larisa Shepitko, Rudolf Tyurin, German Klimov ; photography, Alexei Rodionov, Yuri Skhirtladze, Sergei Taraskin ; music, V. Artyomov, A. Shnitke ; editing, V. Byelova. Cast: Stefaniya Stanyuta, Lev Durov, Alexei Petrenko, Leonid Kryuk, Vadim Yakovenko, Yuri Katin-Yartsev."
