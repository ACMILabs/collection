        "Cinematic interpretation of Benjamin Britten's 1961 masterly religious/poetic choral oratorio, combining the Latin Mass with several poems by the British war poet Wilfred Owen. Owen was killed on the battlefield a week before the armistice that ended WWI. Jarman merges dramatic sequences, paintings, collages and documentary footage from the wars of the 20th century to evoke the tragedy of war and the untimely death of youth. The film has been interpreted as a metaphor on the war against AIDS. A film without dialogue, featuring Olivier in his final film role.  Credits: James Mackay ; director, writer, Derek Jarman ; photography, Richard Greatrex ; editing, Rick Elgood. Cast: Laurence Olivier, Tilda Swinton, Nathaniel Parker, Owen Teale, Nigel Terry."
