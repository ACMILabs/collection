    "description": [
        "Penniless Octave Mouret arrives in Paris at the turn of the Century to take up a job as assistant in a draper shop run by Madame Hedouin. She takes a fancy to him, as do two girls in the house where he lodges. In this adaptation of Zola's novel Duvivier is less interested in Octave than in the life of the building, a real melting pot of the vices of the 19th century Paris bourgeoisie.  Credits: Producers, Robert and Raymond Hakim ; director, Julien Duvivier ; writers, Henri Jeanson, Leo Joannon, Julien Duvivier ; photography, Michel Kelber ; music, Jean Wiener ; art direction, Leon Barsacq. Cast: Gerard Philippe, Danielle Darrieux, Dany Carrel, Anouk Aimee, Jacques Rispal, Jane Marken, Olivier Hussenot."
