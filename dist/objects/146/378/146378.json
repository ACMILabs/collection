        "A film about conspiracy, the effects of violence in our culture, and personal transformation. Mike Max is a leading Hollywood producer, whose triumph has come from a string of extremely violent action films. His work is his life, and he neglects his wife in his pursuit of success. Frustrated with his lack of attention, she leaves him, and Max is forced to admit he was a less-than supportive husband. Not long after, he becomes involved in a violent killing, and fearing for his life, goes into hiding, falling victim to a new top-secret surveillance system that caught the crime on camera. Escaping into L.A.'s underworld, Max confronts violence more terrifying than anything he could put on film.  Credits: Producers, Deepak Nayer, Nicholas Klein ; director, Wim Wenders ; writer, Nicholas Klein ; photography, Pascal Rabaud ; music, Ry Cooder ; editing, Peter Pryzygodda. Cast: Bill Pullman, Andie MacDowell, Traci Lind, Rosalind Chao, K. Todd Freeman, Gabriel Byrne."
