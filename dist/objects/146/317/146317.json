        "The Chinese Emperor Genso of the Tang Dynast marries a beautiful scullery maid on the death of his wife, with whom he falls in love. The new empress is destroyed by jealousies and intrigue around her as a popular revolt rises against the couple.

A film about political intrigue and corruption in 8th century China, 'Princess Yang Kwei Fei' depicts the dying stages of a dynasty. In the film's final scenes the Emperor, who has survived the uprising but is old and unhappy, is mystically reunited with his deceased wife.
