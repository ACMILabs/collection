        "Zhou Yi is a smart graduating student from the Yellow Sea senior high; he has a younger sister who is currently attending junior high school. Due to the loss of their father in their early childhood, their sick mother is supporting the whole family alone, earning their tuition fees by working odd jobs continuously.  After Zhou Yi discovers his mother wishes him to quit school and work after graduating high school, he breaks down and blames his mother for not being understanding. In order to support Zhou Yi, Zhou Yi\u2019s mother starts working day and night in secret to make up for their tuition fees, but due to her original health condition she finally falls ill. Under such circumstances Zhou Yi has no choice but to give up his university dream and work to support his sister\u2019s education.  Zhou Yi\u2019s school mentor comes along and encourages Zhou Yi to not give up; Zhou Yi decides to follow the mentor\u2019s guidance and he continues to work while studying at the same time. The exam period finishes, Zhou Yi is unable to participate in the exams; he sits beside his ice lolly cart, is once again left in his own thoughts.  Zhou Yi\u2019s mentor comes over and hands him the poem journal he once threw away into the sea, tells him she has already forwarded his poems to a publishing agent. Zhou Yi pulls himself together, decides to embark upon a new journey to fulfill his university dream. (Wendy Xu, 2013)."
