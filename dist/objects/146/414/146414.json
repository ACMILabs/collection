        "Qiuyue\u2019s adopted son, Tiangui is going to marry her daughter, Cuicui. But Tiangui\u2019s biological parents have now learnt where their estranged son is and are against the marriage. Qiuyue sends Tiangui back to his parents, who joined the revolution in the early years and are now senior officials living in the city. Tiangui\u2019s mother is excited to see her son and arrange everything for him to begin a new life. Tiangui is not comfortable with the easy life and misses his foster mum and fianc\u00e9e in the country. Tiangui\u2019s mother tries all means to prevent her son going back, and she wants Tiangui to marry the daughter of a colleague. Noticing the problem, Tiangui\u2019s father blames his wife and asks Tiangui to invite Qiuyue and Cuicui to their home. However, Tiangui\u2019s mother sends a letter to Qiuyue, telling her that only Cuicui is invited. Tiangui would not go without Qiuyue, and Qiuyue eventually compromises. At Tiangui\u2019s home, Qiuyue accidentally finds out that Tiangui\u2019s parents are the couple that she saved years ago. She did not tell the truth to her children but chose to leave without letting anybody know.  Similar to The Green Mountain of Bamboo (1982), this film also deals with young people\u2019s free love. Traditionally in China, a couple\u2019s marriage would be arranged by their parents. Very often, the couple would have no chance to meet with each other before their wedding day. Arranged marriage is regarded as a \u201cfeudal concept\u201d and thus criticized by the CCP. Produced in the early 1980s, this film delivers a message to the audience that CCP members must not be corrupted by feudal ideas. (2 stars - Yuxing Zhou; December 16, 2010)"
