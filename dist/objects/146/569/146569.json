        "Ophuls traces the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire by spiritually linking the tragic 19th century romance of Crown Duke Rudolph and Baroness Maria Vetsera to the 1914 assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and the subsequent outbreak of WWI. Mistrusted by his aristocratic peers because of his progressively democratic notions, Ferdinand seems destined to be martyred at the hands of his enemies, in much the same way that Rudolph was.  Credits: Producer, Eugene Tucherer ; director, Max Ophuls ; writers, Marcelle Maurette, Carl Zuckmayer, Jacques Natanson, Andre-Paul Antoine ; photography, Curt Alexandre, Curt Courant, Otto Heller ; music, Oscar Straus ; art direction, Jean d'Eaubonn Cast: Edwige Feuillere, Gabrielle Doziat, John Lodge, Jacqueline Marsan, Aime Clariond, Monique Clariond, Jean Worms, Colette Regis, Jean Debucourt, Raymond Aimos, Henri Bosc."
