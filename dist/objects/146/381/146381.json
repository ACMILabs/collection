        "Cynthia is an unmarried factory worker who lives in a state of siege with her perpetually enraged daughter, Roxanne. In sharp contrast, Cynthia's brother, Maurice, runs a thriving photographic studio and works hard to provide a luxury home for his neurotic, childless wife. Meanwhile, an adopted young black woman, Hortense, is scouring London for her real mother, who, she learns to her shock, is white. An acutely accurate portrait of familial tensions, which reflects Leigh's practice of carrying out months of intensive workshopping with his actors before beginning to shoot. The film remains true to its subjects even as the story veers from comedy to tragedy. Also available on 16mm.  Credits: Producer, Simon Channing-Williams ; director, writer, Mike Leigh ; photography, Dick Pope ; music, Andrew Dickson. Cast: Timothy Spall, Brenda Blethyn, Phyllis Logan, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Claire Rushbrook, Rin Cook, Lesley Manville, Elizabeth Berrington, Michelle Austin, Lee Ross, Emma Amos, Hannah Davis."
