        "This film depicts incidents in the life of the distinguished Russian scientist and former Oxford professor and scientist Klement Timiriazev (renamed in the film) who, despite ostracism by colleagues, joined the Bolsheviks in 1918 and became a hero of the revolution. 'Baltic Deputy' ably balances propaganda, action, humour and pathos, presenting a period of revolution and social upheaval through the eyes of one man.  Credits: Director, Alexander Zarkhi, Joseph Heifitz ; writer, Alexander Zarkhi, Joseph Heifitz, David Dell, Leonid Rakhmanov ; photography, Hoissaye Rakhmanov, M. Kaplan ; music, Nikolai Tomofeev. Cast: Miriya Domasheva, Boris Livanov, Nikolai Cherkasov, Oleg Zhakov, Alexandr Melnikov, M. Dubrava"
