        "The central thematic of the Comedies and Proverbs series is the lack of any dominant moral direction among today's young. The result inevitably is an immersion in self. Here a Parisian secretary, abandoned by her friends, cannot bear to spend an August in Paris. Her hopes of finding a dream lover are anything but fulfilled as she holidays on her own at the seaside. Although largely improvised the film has none of the looseness often associated with this approach. Rohmer's realism is as precise and deceptively simple as ever. There is, however, a touch of magic here.  Credits: Producer, Margaret Menegoz ; director, Eric Rohmer ; writers, Eric Rohmer, Marie Riviere ; photography, Sophie Maintigneux ; music, Jean-Louis Valero ; editor, Maria-Luisa Garcia. Cast: Marie Riviere, Lisa Heredia, Amira Chemakhi, Vincent Gauthier, Beatrice Romand."
