        "A man and his son search for his stolen bicycle which he needs to hold his job as a bill poster; without the bicyle he is condemned to unemployment. This remains an important film although the reasons for its importance have changed over time. What is now most apparent is a particular stylisation which passed for realism. The use of non-professional actors, real locations and the absence of a complex story-line and characterisation, disguise the carefully calculated and detailed mise-en-scene, the stylised representation of an authentic environment. The son has been set up to create a sentimental commentary on the central dilemma. This engenders an empathy with the characters qualitatively different from the more usual identification. Alternate version also available on 16mm. Also available on VHS and laserdisc.  Credits: Production manager, Umberto Scarpelli ; director, Vittorio de Sica ; writers, Vittorio de Sica, Suso d'Amico, Cesare Zavattini ; photography, Carlo Montuori ; production designer, Antonio Traverso ; music, Allesandro Cigognini ; editor, Erald Cast: Lamberto Maggiorani, Enzo Staiola, Lianella Carell, Gino Saltamerenda."
