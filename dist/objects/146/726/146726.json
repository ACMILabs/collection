Merinchal, a journalist who had previously interviewed Servoz, decides to cover the search and rescue operation. When he reaches Chamonix, he realises that Servoz and Chevalier were not on an ordinary training run but were attempting to open a new way to the top of the Drus. This made for TV film details with a documentary precision the close knit community of moutain guides. It contains stunning rock climbing sequences.  Credits: Director, Jacques Ertaud ; writer, Henry Grange ; photography, Rene Vernardet, Louis Miaille, Georges Orset ; music, Francois de Roubaix.
