        "Toni, an immigrant Italian worker in Provence, falls in love with Josepha but she is already engaged to somebody else. Out of spite, he takes up with Marie and both weddings are celebrated on the same day. Toni and Josepha meet up years later, both unhappy in their respectives mariages. The result is a crime of passion. Following the example of Marcel Pagnol, Renoir completely abandoned the studio and filmed exclusively outdoors and in genuine interiors in the Midi, using authentic sound and actors from the region. The film is remarkable for its avoidance of the melodramatic, the depth and fluidity of the camerawork and the feeling for figures in a landscape. Reference: Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide.  Credits: Director, Jean Renoir ; writers, Jean Renoir, Carl Einstein ; photography, Claude Renoir ; music, Paul Bozzi. Cast: Charles Blavette, Jenny Helia, Edouard Delmont, Max Dalban, Andrex, Celia Montalvan."
