        "Pierre registers at a dismal hotel in a desolate seaside resort in Normandy. He had worked there as a kitchen hand some years before and run off with a famous singer, who has just been found dead. He is supected by a mysterious fellow guest of having committed a crime of passion. Instead of finding peace in the village were he grew up, Pierre is driven to desparation by the grotesque pettiness of the local townsfolk, the duplicity of friends and so-called loved ones and the relentlessly rotten weather.  Credits: Producer, Emile Darbon ; director, Yves Allegret ; writer, Jacques Sigurd ; photography, Henri Alekan ; music, Maurice Thiriet. Cast: Madeleine Robinson, Gerard Philippe, Jane Marken, Jean Servais, Julien Carette, Mona Dol, Andre Valmy."
