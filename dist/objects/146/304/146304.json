        "In the final days of the Romanov regime (1613-1917), the 'mad monk' Rasputin wields power at the court. He is portrayed as a man completely out of touch with the people and political reality, immersed in sexual decadence and the lascivious manipulation of others. The relationship of Rasputin, the Czar and the Empress are explored in this historical drama, with the latter two falling under Rasputin's spell. Klimov takes a docu-drama approach mixing colour re-enactments of historical events with simulated black and white newsreel footage. This film was completed in 1975 but due to its sympathetic portrayal of Czar Nicholas II, was not released until 1981  Credits: Producer, Semion Kutikov ; director, Elem Klimov ; writer, Semyon Lungin, Ilya Nusinov ; photography, Leonid Kalashnikov ; music, Alfred Shnitke. Cast: Velta Linei, Alisa Freindlikh, Anatoly Romashin, Alexey Petrenko, A. Romantsov, S. Muchenikov."
