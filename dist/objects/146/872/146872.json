        "Pierre is a garage mechanic in his mid-30s with a considerable taste for the ladies. It comes as something of a surprise when he falls passionately in love with Jeanne, a woman in her 50s. She is unmoved by his advances, and despite her sharp rebuffs, he persists. Her heart thaws when she learns she is suffering from an incurable and fatal disease.  Credits: Producer, Cecile Clairval ; director, Paul Vecchiali ; writer, Paul Vecchiali ; photography, Georges Strouve ; music, Gabriel Faure, Roland Vincent. Cast: Nicolas Silberg, Helene Surgere, Christine Murillo, Madeleine Robinson, Myriam Mezieres."
