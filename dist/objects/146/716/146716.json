        "In 1937, Paul is a boarder in a religious institution. He suffers greatly from being separated from his mother and lets his school grades slip. During the Occupation, he becomes the pet of  German soldiers, running errands for them. Later, he helps the Resistance, and when the Americans come to stay, he is really in his element with them. The films chronicles Paul's attempts to fit in and connect with an authority figure.  Credits: Producer, Philippe Dussart ; director, Gerard Blain ; writers, Gerard Blain, Michel Perez ; photography, Emmanuel Machuel ; music, Jean Schwarz. Cast: Jean-Francois Cimino, Cesar Chauveau, Annie Kovacs, Claire Treille, Jean Bertal."
