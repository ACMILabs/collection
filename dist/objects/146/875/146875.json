    "description": [
        "A small French village is plagued by a poison pen writer, whose principal target is the town doctor. The vitriolic letters wreak so much havoc that soon neighbour turns upon neighbour. Eventually, the doctor himself is suspected of writing the letters, cloaking himself in the respectability of his office. When the psychiatrist starts receiving letters as well, he decides to investigate. Concluding that his own wife is the culprit, he has her committed. But soon after, more letters arrive ... 'Le Corbeau' is a realistic portrait of Occupied France and its obsession for petty bickering and vengeful denunciation. Produced by the German production company 'Continental Films' the film was condemned as unpatriotic after the Liberation, and director Henri-Georges Clouzot was banned from filmmaking until 1947. Le Corbeau' was remade in Hollywood by Otto Preminger as 'The 13th Letter' (1951).  Credits: Producer: Rene Montis ; director: Henri-Georges Clouzot ; writers, Henri-Georges Clouzot, Louis Chavance ; photography, Nicolas Hayer ; music, Tony Aubin ; sound, William-Robert Sivel.
