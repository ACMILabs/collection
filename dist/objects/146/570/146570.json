        "On Bastille Day in Paris, a flower-girl and her taxi driver boyfriend meet various people. A child is born, a woman dies, there is a hold-up, and a drunkard is blissfully unaware of his surroundings. Clair's films have the same reputation for gaiety as Paris, the city he loved. This light comedy is the last of Clair's pre-war 'Paris' pictures. The city is more the creation of Russian emigre set designer Lazare Meerson who created the ideal space for Clair's choreographed characters.  Credits: Director, Rene Clair ; writer, Rene Clair ; photography, Georges Perinal ; music, Maurice Jaubert ; art direction, Lazare Meerson. Cast: Annabella, Georges Rigaud, Pola Illery, Thomy Bourdelle, Aimos, Raymond Cordy."
