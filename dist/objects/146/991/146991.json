    "description": [
        "His name is Piel. He is four years old. He is the last survivor of planet Perdide. How could he outsmart the dangers of a planet that has already claimed the lives of his parents and recognise the poisonous fruits and the venimous flowers? His last link with the world of humans is a radio transmitter whose distress signals have been received by Grand Max, a traveller with a generous heart. Max uses the radio to keep watch on the orphan while trying to organise a rescue mission. Stephan Wul (born 1922) is one of the pioneers of French science-fiction writing. Jean Giraud, by the name of Moebius, revolutionised the universe of fictional comics, creating a special and magical atmosphere around his stories. He is credited with inspiring the visual imagery of works such as 'Blade Runner' and 'The Fifth Element'. Further reading: Gianalberto Bendazzi. 'Rene Laloux. Drawings That Move'.
