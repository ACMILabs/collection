        "Lucien Bourrache, colonial soldier stationed in Orange, is a lady's man. While on a business trip to Cannes, Lucien meets Madeleine. Lucien accepts to lend money to Madeleine that she later looses at the gambling table. Although Lucien is smitten by Madeleine, she rejects him. Lucien returns to Orange and resigns from the army in order to follow Madeleine to Paris, where he discovers that she is kept by an other man. Raoul Ploquin was at the time in charge of the French section of the German production company UFA. He had Gremillon under contract to film 'L'Etrange Monsieur Victor' which was delayed. Ploquin organised the Gremillon-Gabin meeting and filming started soon after at the Neubabelsberg studios and in Orange and Cannes for the exteriors.  Credits: Producer, Raoul Ploquin ; director, Jean Gremillon ; writer, Charles Spaak ; photography, Gunther Rittau ; music, Lothar Bruhne ; assistant director, Louis Daquin. Cast: Jean Gabin, Mireille Balin, Rene Lefevre, Marguerite Deval, Pierre Etchepare, Jane Marken, Jean Ayme, Robert Casa, Henri Poupon, Pierre Magnier."
