        "Eisenstein conceived his first film not as the portrayal of an actual historical event but as a generalised picture of a strike without individual heroes; the mass is a collective hero represented by types rather than characters.of poster-like sketches containing Eisenstein's first experiments with montage both for direct emotional impact (collision) and for the presentation of abstract ideas (metaphor). A constructivist approach is evident in the way machinery is represented not as dominating the workers but as being enlisted by them in the struggle. Also available on VHS, LD and 16mm.  Credits: Director, Sergei Eisenstein ; photographer, E. Tisse, Vassili Khvatov ; [producer, Boris Mikhine ; script, Sergei Eisenstein, V. Pletniev, I. Kravtchunovsky, Grigori Alexandrov]. Cast: [Grigori Alexandrov, Maxim Strauch, Mikhail Gomarov], credited as Troupe of the workers Theatre."
