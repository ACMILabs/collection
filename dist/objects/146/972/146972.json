        "Henri is married to Therese and together they have two children. Henri also has a mistress, Leda. The adulterous relationship is known to all around him, but all feign to ignore it. One day, Therese breaks the silence and confronts Henri about Leda. Not long after, Leda is found dead. 'A double tour', Chabrol's first colour film, is especially notable for its striking cinematography, its complex narrative structure, and the exuberance of its flamboyant style; it represents Chabrol's first studied attempt to examine and criticize the moral values of the bourgeoisie as well as to dissect the sociopsychological causes of the violence which inevitably erupts as the social and family structures prove inadequate.\" Reference: Charles Derry.
