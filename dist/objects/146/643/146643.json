        "Summer 1928. As usual Colette settles for the summer in her beloved country house to enjoy the earthly pleasures of Provence, the company of her artist friends and time to write. Now in her 50's, the writer is offered a last chance at love by a much younger man, Vial. Vial is also wanted by a newcomer to Colette's circle, Helene Clement. 'La naissance du jour' is a biographical account of Colette's slow acceptance of age and renouncement to love. Filmed on location at 'La treille muscate', Colette's house in St Tropez.  Credits: Producer, Philippe Baraduc ; director, Jacques Demy ; writer, Jacques Demy ; photography, Jean Penzer ; music, Mendelsohn. Cast: Daniele Delorme, Jean Sorel, Dominique Sanda, Orane Demazis."
