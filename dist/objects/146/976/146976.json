        "The life and work of Saint Vincent de Paul, who was in conflict with the rich and powerful because of his pioneer work among the poor. Although the film had some financial backing from the catholic Church, this inspiring depiction of saintliness contains only a modicum of sermonizing. The beauty of the photography does not exclude the strakness of the poverty or the brutality of the age. Fresnay, growing from a young man to old age, carries even atheists along with him. Awards: Academy Awards (Oscars) 1948: Best foreign film ; Venice Film Festival (Mostra) 1948: Best actor for Pierre Fresnay. Reference: Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide.  Credits: Director, Maurice Cloche ; writers, Jean Bernard-Luc, Jean Anouihl ; photography, Claude Renoir ; music, J. Grunenwald. Cast: Pierre Fresnay, Aime Clariond, Pierre Dux, Jean Debucourt, Lise Delamare, Gabrielle Dorziat."
