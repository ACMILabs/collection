        "A respectable businessman during the day, Monsieur Victor is also the boss of gang of thieves. When a blackmailer threatens to reveal the true nature of his business, Monsieur Victor kills him with a tool belonging to his neighbour, Bastien Robineau. Bastien is found guilty and condemned to seven years of hard labour. Seven years later, Bastien comes back to town to seek revenge. 'Monsieur Victor' was partially financed by the German company UFA. The exteriors were shot in Toulon (South of France) and the interiors at the Babelsberg studios in Berlin. The film had no success when released in 1938. Raoul Ploquin, the producer, took the initiative to re-issue the film in 1974, after lengthy research in various cinematheques. The film was then hailed as one of Gremillon's finest work.  Credits: Producer, Raoul Ploquin, Albert Valentin ; director, Jean Gremillon ; writers, Marcel Achard, Charles Spaak ; photography, Werner Krien ; music, Roland Manuel. Cast: Raimu, Madeleine Renaud, Pierre Blanchar, Marcelle Geniat, Andrex, Viviane Romance, Marcel Maupi."
