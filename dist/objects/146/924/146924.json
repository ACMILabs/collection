    ], 
    "description": [
        "An adaptation of three ironic short stories by Guy de Maupassant ostensibly linked by a common theme: the paradoxical deceptions of pleasure. The first story, 'Le Masque', contrasts pleasure and old age in the story of an old man so addicted to dancing that he wears a mask to disguise his age. The second story, 'Le Modele', opposes pleasure and marriage. A young painter has an affair with his model, which after her attempted suicide ends with their marriage. The third, 'La Maison Tellier', is virtually a short feature. Pleasure and purity are opposed as the inmates of a city brothel spend a day in the country attending the first communion of the madame's niece.  Credits: Director, Max Ophuls ; writers, Jacques Natanson ; photography, Christian Matras, Philippe Agostini ; music, Maurice Yvain, Joe Hajos ; art direction, Jean d'Eaubonne. Cast: Danielle Darrieux, Jean Gabin, Jean Servais, Claude Dauphin, Gaby Morlay, Madeleine Renaud, Helena Manson, Daniel Gelin, Simone Simon, Pierre Brasseur, Anton Wallbrook, Henri Cremieux, Paulette Dubost, Ginette Leclerc, Mila Parely, Louis Seigner"
