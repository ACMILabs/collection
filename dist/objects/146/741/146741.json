        "The third of Rohmer's Comedies et Proverbes series (see summary for La Femme de l'Aviateur) is prefaced by a medieval motto 'Who talks o'ermuch, himself doth harm.' At the centre of what has been described as 'an airy comedy of manners, encompassing genuine pain' is 15 year-old Pauline. Her ideals are put to a severe test when, during a holiday at Normandy, she is caught up in an emotional triangle which attendant hypocrisies transforms into an even more fraught hexagon.  Credits: Producer, Margaret Menegoz ; director, writer, Eric Rohmer ; photography, Nestor Almendros ; editor, Cecile Decugis. Cast: Amanda Langlet, Arielle Dombasle, Pascal Greggory."
