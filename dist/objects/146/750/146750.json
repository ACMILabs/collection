        "An ex-concert pianist, working in a seedy bar gets involved with gangsters when he helps his two petty crook brothers escape from them, an action culminating in the death of his girlfriend. This film, more than any other, reflects the influence of Hollywood low-budget melodramas on Truffaut and his cinematic style.  Credits: Producer, Pierre Braunberger ; director, Francois Truffaut ; writers, Francois Truffaut, Marcel Moussy , photography, Raoul Coutard ; music, Georges Delerue. Cast: Charles Aznavour, Marie Dubois, Nicole Berger, Albert Remy, Michele Mercier, Daniel Boulanger, Alice Sapritch, Boby Lapointe."
