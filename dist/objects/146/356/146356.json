        "Keaton, an engine driver, recaptures his train and rescues his girl after it has been stolen and she has been kidnapped by Union soldiers from behind Confederate lines. Based on an actual incident in the Civil War this is widely regarded as Keaton's finest film. Oblivious to the dictates of normal comprehension, Keaton as Johnny its own.  Credits: Producer, Joseph M. Schenck ; directors, Buster Keaton, Clyde Bruckmann ; writers, Al Boasberg, Charles Smith ; photography, J. Devereaux Jennings, Bert Haines ; piano accompaniment, William Perry. Cast: Buster Keaton, Marion Mack, Glen Cavander."
