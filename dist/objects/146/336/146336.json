        "Naive, middle aged provincial industrialist Benoit Castejac is harassed by threatened strikes at his factory, as well as tax difficulties, leading him to consider a takeover by an American company. Retreating, Benoit installs himself in the luxury of the Hotel George V in Paris where he is introduced to Christine (with whom he falls in love), only to discover that she is a high-class call girl. Nevertheless, Benoit, clutching at happiness, abandons his wife Francoise, to pursue a future with Christine. A comedy that examines one man's mid-life crisis and hope for love, the film contains a fine performance from Mireille Darc as Christine.  Credits: Director, Edouard Molinaro; writer, Francis Veber; photography, Gerard Hameline; music, Vladimir Cosma. Cast: Mireille Darc, Pierre Mondy, Michel Lonsdale, Daniel Ceccaldi, Gerald Herold, Francois Prevost."
