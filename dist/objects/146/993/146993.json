        "Michel Verta, a police officer, lives happy in Bordeaux with his wife Nathalie and their child.  From time to time he indulges in homosexual encounters. During a routine crime enquiry in a night-club, he meets Bernard, a musician, with whom he falls in love. Michel's family finds out, and their reactions to the news are quite predictable. When Bernard accidentally kills a man who has been blackmailing him, the gay couple's troubles are intensified, especially since Michel tries to illegally protect Bernard. The two lovers are caught in an increasing spiral of lies and despair.  Credits: Producer, Denise Petitdidier ; director, Yannick Bellon ; writers, Yannick Bellon, Alain Marcel, Remi Waterhouse ; photography, Houchang Baharlou ; music, Catherine Lara. Cast: Victor Lanoux, Xavier Deluc, Anny Duperey, Michel Galabru, Valerie Mairesse, Michel Galabru."
