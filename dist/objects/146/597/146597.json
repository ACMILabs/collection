        "Kurys' autobiographical first feature is an account of a year in the lives of two sisters - 13-year-old, introverted Anne, and outgoing 15-year-old Frederique - in the early 1960s. Avoiding sentimentality and nostalgia, the film charts the oppressions of a dreary, authoritarian school and the girls' difficult relationships with their parents (a separated Jewish couple), their friends and each other. Awards: Prix Louis Delluc 1977. Also available on VHS in the National Collection.  Credits: Producer, Serge Laski ; director, writer, Diane Kurys ; photography, Philippe Rousselot ; music, Yves Simon. Cast: Eleonore Klarwein, Odile Michel, Anouk Ferjak, Michel Puterflam, Yves Renier."
