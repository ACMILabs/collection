    "description": [
        "Melville adopted the thriller format for his account of the Resistance. It can be regarded as the third instalment of a trilogy about life in France under German occupation started with 'Le silence de la mer' (1949) and 'Leon Morin, pretre' (1961), both held in our collection. Far from the usual romantic cliches showing handsome young men playing tricks with the Nazis and falling in love with sublime women, the substance of the movie is reality. It depicts a 'shadow army' made of courageous men who are ready to sacrifice their lives but are aware of the huge cost they will eventually have to pay. It shows the cruel and sometimes inhuman choices they have to make in order to survive. Both writer Joseph Kessel and co-writer and director Jean-Pierre Melville belonged to this 'Army in the shadows'. Andre Dewavrin (known as Colonel Passy  in the Resistance) plays himself.  Credits: Producer, Jacques Dorfmann ; director, Jean-Pierre Melville ; writer, Jean-Pierre Melville ; photography, Pierre Lhomme, Walter Wottitz ; music, Eric Demarsan. Cast: Lino Ventura, Simone Signoret, Paul Meurisse, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Nathalie Delon, Paul Crauchet, Claude Mann, Christian Barbier, Serge Reggiani, Alain Mottet, Andre Dewavrin."
