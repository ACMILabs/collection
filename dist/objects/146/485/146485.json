        "The film is about China\u2019s economic reform in the 1980s. Xiao grew up in Thailand and returned to China in the 1960s. Newly appointed as acting mayor of the Yingzhou city, Xiao announced that he would do ten good things for the city at his inauguration. He encouraged the local peasants to build a bridge through self-financing, and he lent his support to the director of Baiyun Pharmaceutical Factory in terms of promoting a blacklisted engineer, Li Huaxin. Xiao also helped Li Huaxin\u2019s daughter, who was not allowed to go abroad to study because of her father\u2019s background. As an acting mayor, Xiao made some achievements but also aroused controversy. Even the Party Secretary, who had been supportive, thought that Xiao was too radical in some aspects. Xiao\u2019s wife and daughter are concerned about people\u2019s misunderstanding, but Xiao is determined to carry on the reforms, believing that he is in line with the central government as long as what he does benefits the people. At a news conference, Xiao says he would rather break rules than go against the will of the people. In order to fulfill his promise to do ten good things, Xiao asks for a new term of three months as acting mayor.  The film should be understood in relation to China\u2019s reform in the early 1980s. It was reported that the film aroused controversy when it was shown to senior officials in the central government. Hardliners in the Communist Party insisted that the film need a few cuts before it could be released for public screening. However, the then Chinese Premier, Hu Yaobang gave green light to the film. The leading actor of the film, Yang Zaibao also starred in The Meeting of Two Heroes. (4 stars - Yuxing Zhou; December 16, 2010)"
