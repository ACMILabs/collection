        "Nanteuil, 1944. The joy of the impending liberation is stopped by the arrival of a group of German soldiers. They have no murderous intent, in spite of the exhortations of one of their officers. They just want to make a deal: they will lock the population in the church and wait for the arrival of the US army to whom they want to surrender without fighting. During the wait in the church, the tension between the villagers rises, slowly entertained by a French fascist,  to the point where bloodshed seems inevitable. For attempting to break the traditional image of the Resistance, this film was held on the shelves for two years and released only in February 1962  Credits: Producer, Daniel Muller ; director, Jean Dewever ; writer, Jean-Charles Tacchella ; photography, Ghislain Cloquet. Cast: Pierre Collet, Paul Mercey, Henri Maik, Danielle Godet, Alix Mahieux, Bernard Verley."
