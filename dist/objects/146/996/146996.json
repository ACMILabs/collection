        "The painful life of a mentally unstable but highly gifted woman is unveiled in this film, based on episodes from the life of an  actual person. Aloise creates a series of haunting drawings while she is incarcerated in an institution for the  insane in turn-of-the-century Switzerland. She endures torments as a musically gifted girl and later as a young woman; her  developing madness and the barbaric treatments of the time are shown.  Credits: Producer, Alain Dahan ; director, Liliane de Kermadec ; writers, Liliane de Kermadec, Andre Techine ; photography, Jean Penzer. Cast: Roger Blin, Delphine Seyrig, Jacques Weber, Isabelle Huppert, Julien Guiomar, Michel Lonsdale."
