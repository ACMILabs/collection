        "Annie and Frederic, aged 16 and 19 respectively, are courting during summer in Poitou. Secretly, Annie yearns for some more excitement and when Alexandre, superficially more sophisticated than the local boys, comes to Poitou, she gets it. Fragile and charming, this is a female rites of passage film, played in the context of happy family relationships and everyday people. Thomas brings to the whole enterprise an observant eye for the details of village life.  Credits: Director, Pascal Thomas ; writers, Pascal Thomas, Roland Duval, Suzanne Schiffman ; photography, Colin Mounier ; music, Vladimir Cosma. Cast: Annie Cole, Frederic Duru, Jean Carmet, Christiane Chamaret, Bernard Menez, Daniel Ceccaldi."
