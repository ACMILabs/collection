        "This comedy peeks in at the lives and relationships between elderly thespians living in an actors' retirement home. The home is almost bankrupt and so the actors must support themselves. The residents include a faded sex symbol, an intellectual actor who kept a great distance between himself and the audience, and a depressed thespian who tries to conceal the fact that he was only an understudy.  Credits: Director, Julien Duvivier ; writers, Charles Spaak, Julien Duvivier ; photography, Christian Matras ; music, Maurice Jaubert ; art direction, Jacques Krauss. Cast: Louis Jouvet, Michel Simon, Madeleine Ozeray, Victor Francen, Gabrielle Dorziat, Sylvie."
