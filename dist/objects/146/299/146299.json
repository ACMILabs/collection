        "In his most famous role as Erik the Phantom, Chaney demonstrated his genius for mime, and his ability to bring humanity to the most deformed of creatures. Produced by Universal, the film was shot in 1923 and shelved for nearly two years, and was subjected to intensive studio tinkering. It was both the stepping off point for Chaney's run as a superstar at M.G.M. and the prototype for the horror film cycle at Universal in the 1930s. The story concerns Erik, a much-feared fiend who haunts the Paris Opera House. Lurking around the damp, dank passages deep in the cellars of the theater, he secretly coaches understudy Christine Daae to be an opera star. Through a startling sequence of terrors, including sending a giant chandelier crashing down on the opera patrons, the chandelier crashing down on the opera patrons, the Phantom forces the lead soprano to withdraw from the opera, permitting Christine to step in. Luring Christine into his subterranean lair below the opera house, the Phantom confesses his love. Alternative versions also available on 16mm film and VHS.  Credits: Producer, Carl Laemmle ; directors, Rupert Julian, Edward Sedgwick ; writers, Raymond Shrock, Elliot Clawson ; photography, Charles Van Enger, Virgil Miller, Milton Bridenbecker ; art director, Dan Hall. Cast: Lon Chaney, Mary Philbin, Norman Kerry, Gibson Gowland."
