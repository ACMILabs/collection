        "A reconstruction of the resistance work, including sabotage of the railway link between the Occupied and the Free Zones by French railmen during World War II. Clement brought the stark realism of his documentary shorts to bear on his first feature, a peaan to the courage of the railway workers, with the men themselves re-enacting their actual exploits. Reference: Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide. Awards: Cannes Film Festival (1956): Best film, best director.  Credits: Director, Rene Clement ; writers, Rene Clement, Colette Audry ; photography, Henri Alekan ; music, Yves Baudrier. Cast: Barnault, Clarieux, Daurand, Desagneux."
