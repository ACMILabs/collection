        "Entree des Artistes' details the lives and loves of several students at the Paris Conservatory of Drama. Wealthy student Cecilia is in love with fellow student Francois and jealous of his relationship with poor student Isabelle. Cecilia successfully plots to break-up the relationship. As the end of the presentation approaches, Cecilia decides to play the part of a woman who dies of poisoning. Of particular interest in this film is the 'real-life' scene in which Louis Jouvet plays his own role as a teacher at the Paris Drama School rehearsing young actor Bernard Blier.  Credits: Producer, Georges Jouanne ; director, Marc Allegret ; writers, Henri Jeanson, Andre Cayatte ;  photography, Christian Matras, Robert Juillard ; music, Georges Auric ; art direction, Jacques Krauss, Alexandre Trauner. Cast: Louis Jouvet, Janine Darcey, Claude Dauphin, Odette Joyeux, Andre Brunot, Mady Made, Julien Carette, Marcel Dalio, Sylvie, Roger Blin, Bernard Blier, Michel Vitold."
