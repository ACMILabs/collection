        "At the end of 1941, two jewish boys, Maurice, 13, and Joseph, 10, living in Paris are forced to wear a yellow star. This does not have much significance for them and they quickly swap them for a bag full of marbles. Chastised by their father, they learn about the surrounding dangers and are told they must leave their family to go and seek refuge in the 'Free Zone' with their two elder brothers. When the German Army invades the Zone, the children are arrested. In order to recover their freedom (and save their lives) the children must convince a priest to deliver them with a christening certificate.  Credits: Producer, Pierre Grunstein ; director, Jacques Doillon ; writers, Jacques Doillon, Denis Ferraris ; photography, Yves Lafaye ; music, Philippe Sarde. Cast: Paul Eric Schulmann, Richard Constantini, Joseph Goldenberg, Reine Barteve, Michel Robin, Dominique Davros, Gilles Laurent, Gilles Laurent, Hubert Drac."
