        "Set in Djibouti, this story is filmed in subjective camera style. An introspective, slightly self-absorbed  journalist asks a French woman to share a room with him. He is attracted to her but is not sure how to go about making that  point clear. They spend their time in banal conversation. After seeing an Australian movie ('The man from Snowy River') they decide to make their way across the desert to Alexandria.  Credits: Producers, Pascale Dauman, Francois Margolin ; director, Raymond Depardon ; writer, Raymond Depardon ; photography, Raymond Depardon. Cast: Francoise Prenant."
