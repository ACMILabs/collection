    "description": [
        "Oblomov is based on a gently satirical novel by Ivan Goncharov set in the mid-nineteenth century about an absentee landlord who stays in bed because he cannot find a convincing reason for getting up. He has tried getting up in the past but sees no reason to go on with it. Moreover, as a man of means he is in the position of being able to choose not to go on with it. '(An) engagingly adapted parable of a privileged recluse being reluctantly dragged towards light, life and love...As the tardily socialised eternally indecisive Oblomov, Tabakov invests sloth with a winning seductiveness' (Paul Taylor in Time Out). Another print also available on 16mm.  Credits: Director, Nikita Mikhalkov ; script, A. Adabashian, N. Mikhalkov ; photography, Pavel Lebeshev ; music, E. Artemiev. Cast: Oleg Tabakov, Yuri Bogatyryov, Andrei Popov, Yelena Solovei."
