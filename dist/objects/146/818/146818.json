        "Aristocrat, philosopher and inventor, Count Savinien de Kerfadec loses his wife as she gives birth to their daughter, Celine. The same night he brings home Aurele, a newborn he found of the doorstep of the church. A few years later, young Tarquin who is on his way to the seminar, runs away and becomes the third addition to the eccentric Kerfadec household. As the children grow up, a love triangle develops, until the day the boys are sent away to make their way in the world. In 1793, Tarquin comes back to Brittany as a representant of the Republic, in charge of repressing the uprising in the Western provinces and possibly woe Celine. But Aurele and Celine, whose love for each other has blossomed, are active among those called 'Les Chouans'.  Credits: Producer, Ariel Zeitoun ; director, Philippe de Broca ; writers, Daniel Boulanger, Philippe de Brocca, Jerome Tonnerre ; photography, Bernard Zitzermann ; music, Georges Delerue. Cast: Sopphie Marceau, Lambert Wilson, Philippe Noiret, Stephane Freiss, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Roger Dumas."
