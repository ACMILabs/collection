        "This film records a production of the historical play '1789', in which the Theatre du Soleil re-enacts the French Revolution and its aftermath. It shows  how the Revolution served only to replace one set of rulers (the aristocrats and nobles) with another (the rich), an analysis which is clearly influenced by Marxist thinking. Filmed in June 1973 during 13 shows presented on the stage of 'La Cartoucherie de Vincennes'.  Best print: X0131.  Credits: Producers, Georges Dancigers, Alexandre Mnouchkine ; director, Arianne Mnouchkine ; writer, Ariane Mnouchkine ; photography, Jean-Paul Meurisse, Michel Lebon, Eduardo Serra, Bernard Zitzerman. Cast: Philippe Caubere, Mario Gonzales, Genevieve Penchenat, Jean-Claude Penchenat."
