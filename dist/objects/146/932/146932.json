        "Marius, who works in his father's dockside cafe in Marseilles, is set to marry Fanny, his childhood sweetheart. But the call of the sea is too strong for him, and he joins the merchant navy, unware that Fanny is pregnant. The film succeeds best in his portrayal of the little people of Marseilles, their humour and accents. This is the first film of Pagnol's 'Marseille trilogy', followed by 'Fanny'* (1932) and 'Cesar'* (1936) [*=Held in our collection].  Credits: Producer, Bob T. Kane ; director, Alexandre Korda ; writer, Marcel Pagnol ; photography, Ted Pahle ; music, Francis Gromon. Cast: Raimu, Pierre Fresnay, Fernand Charpin, Orane Demazis, Alida Rouffe, Robert Vattier, Marcel Maupi."
