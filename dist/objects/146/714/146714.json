        "Emmanuel lives with his second wife, Mara, and her 20 year old daughter, Natacha. The relationship between Emmanuel and his step-daughter are tense, and an argument erupts just when Emmanuel is about to go and join his first wife, Lili and his young daughter Elise for the week-end. Emmanuel and Elise take a trip from the  south of France into Spain, working on a film project. Through a series of round-about conversations, Emmanuel manages to  open up a few channels of communication with Elise -- channels that expand even wider when he uses the technique of talking  into her video camera to express thoughts and feelings that otherwise would have remained hidden.  Credits: Producer, Jean-Francois Lepetit ; director, Jacques Doillon ; writers, Jacques Doillon, Jean-Francois Goyet ; photography, Michel Carre. Cast: Sami Frey, Mara Goyet, Juliet Berto, Juliette Binoche, Aina Walle."
