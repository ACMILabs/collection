        "This multi-parts film deals with the difficulties of sustaining a relationship under the pressure of modern life. In 'Nuit, une guerre', a couple's amourous pursuits are interrupted by the noises coming from the street and the neighbouring appartments. In 'Entrevu par l'indiscretion d'un Judas', a man hears is own story told on the radio by a 'talk-back' programme listener and realises his wife has left him to seek refuge with her mother in the country. In 'Adieu voyages lents', Simone reveals to her mother the reason for leaving her husband and aborting the child she was expecting.  Credits: Director, writer, Marie-Genevieve Ripeau ; photography, Jean-Francis Gondre. Cast: Andree Tainsy, Michele Simonnet, Evelyne Dandry, Jean-Francois Stevenin, Virgineie Thevenet."
