        "Georges Rouquier revisits the characters of his 1938 'Biquefarre' 35 year later. The family whose farm was wired for electricity in the first film are still on the family spread in 1983. The plot revolves around Raoul who decides to sell the farm to take up a job as gardener with the City of Toulouse. Though documentary in technique, the film is well planned and scripted, with its amateur cast convincingly mouthing the lines given them by Rouqier.  Credits: Producer, Bertrand van Effenterre, Marie-Francoise Mascaro, William Gilcher ; director, Georges Rouquier ; writers, Georges Rouquier, Maria Signorini ; photography, Andre Villard ; music, Yves Gilbert Cast: Henri Rouquier, Maria Rouquier, Roger Malet, Roch Rouquier, Raymond Rouquier."
