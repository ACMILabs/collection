        "Revolution in the Ukraine in 1917-19, culminating in the suppression of the workers' revolt in a munition factory at Kiev, is treated symbolically, employing the dynamics of montage in an epic celebration of victory in defeat. A blend of folklore, comedy, drama and caricature. Also available on 16mm.  Credits: Director, Alexander Dovzhenko ; writers, Isaac Shpinel, Vladimir Muller ; photography, Daniel Demutski. Cast: Semyon Svashenko, Mikola Nademsky, Ambrose Buchma, Pyotr Masokha."
