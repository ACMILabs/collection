        "Diego has spent his life working for a revolutionary group still fighting the battles of 1936 in a Spain that no longer exists. Living in Paris Diego makes repeated trips to Spain to work for the cause. Through his close collaboration with Jorge Semprun, the Spanish novelist then in exile, Resnais constructs the tragedy of a man who has come to question the very thing that has defined the value of his existence. He is bound to continue 'the war' but for him it is now more personal than political. Diego's relationships with two women represent the myth and reality of his political life. The rhythms of the film are harnessed to Diego's subjectivity - the memories, imaginings and connections in his mind together with moments of profound feeling. Also available on VHS (NLA #2081353).  Credits: Director, Alain Resnais ; writer, Jorge Semprun ; photography, Sacha Vierny ; music, Giovanni Fusco ; editor, Eric Pluet. Cast: Yves Montand, Ingrid Thulin, Genevieve Bujold, Jean Bouise, Antoine Vitez, Gerard Lartigau, Bernard Fresson."
