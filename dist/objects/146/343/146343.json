        "The Far Road' is a study of the life of a railway worker's wife, showing the domestic and industrial situation. Shot entirely in Northern Japan, it offers the viewer some previously little seen scenery and the last look at a now bygone era - that of the steam train. The film is also a study in the social mores and class-consciousness that ensures that the railway worker does not rise about his station in life. The Japanese National Railway Workers' sponsored the first film to be directed by Hidari, already known for her acting abilities.  Credits: Producer, director, Sachiko Hidari ; writer, Ken Miyamoto ; photography, Junichi Segawa ; music, Minoru Miki. Cast: Sachiko Hidari, Kenji Isomura, Kyozo Nagatsuka, Yoshie Ichige, Hisashi Igawa."
