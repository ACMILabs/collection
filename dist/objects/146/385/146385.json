        "Revisiting the vampire legend director/writer Michael Almereyda creates a modern day setting for several sexy undead creatures of the night. Elina Lowensohn plays the title role - a New York based vampire who is celebrating the demise of her father, and is hoping that her new life will encompass the attractive Lucy. Unfortunately Lucy is married to the nephew of a vampire hunter who is hell-bent on conquering Nadja. Aesthetically the film is an alluring mix of 35 mm footage and black-and-white, low-budget Pixelvision video. As an art film, the form is impressive but the narrative wanes at key moments, leaving an overall sense of a film that wavers inconsistently between a surrealist  Credits: Producer, Mary Sweeney, Amy Hobby ; director, writer, Michael Almereyda ; photography, Jim De Nault ; music, Simon Fisher Turner ; editing, David Leonard. Cast: Elina Lowensohn, Suzy Amis, Galaxy Craze, Martin Donovan, Peter Fonda, Karl Geary."
