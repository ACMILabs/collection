        "Andre Chatelain is a quiet, middle-aged restaurant owner in Les Halles district of Paris. His life becomes unexpectedly complicated when Catherine pays a visit. She introduces herself as the daughther of his late ex-wife. Moved by the distress of Catherine, Andre invites her to stay with him. Soon after, Gerard, Andre's adopted son, is smitten by the young woman. But she makes it clear she is only interested in Andre. Andre, however, suspects the young woman to be a liar and possibly a psychotic, mixed up with a number of underworld types. This film offers a very realistic depiction of the life and activities of Les Halles at the time it was considered as the 'belly of Paris'. The title song is interpreted by Germaine Montero.  Credits: Producers, Charles Borderie, Robert Bossis ; director, Julien Duvivier ; writers, Julien Duvivier, Maurice Bessy, Charles Dorat ; photography, Armand Thirard ; music, Jean Wiener. Cast: Jean Gabin, Daniele Delorme, Grerad Blain, Germaine Kerjean, Lucienne Bogaert, Robert Arnoux, Jean-Paul Roussillon, Robert Manuel."
