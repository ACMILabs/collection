        "Paris during the winter after the Liberation. Diego meets up with his friend Raymond Lecuyer. A tramp pretending to be Destiny predicts Diego will meet the most beautiful girl in the world. The same evening, Diego meets Malou. Malou is the daughter of a businessman who does not disguise his sympathy for the now defunct Vichy regime. Diego soon discovers that Malou's brother, Guy, was the one who denounced Raymond to the Gestapo. Carne and Prevert paint a realistic portrait of the social landscape of France immediately after the Liberation, with its war victims, resistants, black-marketeers and Vichy nostalgics. For 'Les portes de la nuit' Alexandre Trauner re-created in studio the metro station Barbes-Rochechouart and several facades of houses along the canal St Martin.  Credits: Producers, Raymond Borderie, Pierre Laurent ; director, Marcel Carne ; writer, Jacques Prevert ; photography, Philippe Agostini ; music, Joseph Kosma ; art direction, Alexandre Trauner ; stills photographer, Raymond Voinquel. Cast: Pierre Brasseur, Serge Reggiani, Yves Montand, Nathalie Nattier, Saturnin Fabre, Raymond Bussieres, Jean Vilar, Sylvia Bataille, Jane Marken, Dany Robin, Fabien Loris, Mady Berry, Julien Carette."
