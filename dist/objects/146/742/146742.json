        "\"For his first feature, Jean-Jacques Beineix borrowed the formal innovations of the French avant-garde - Godard's colors and conflicting tones, Rivette's screwball thriller plotting - for a work of unalloyed entertainment, which was such a sharp commercial idea it's a wonder no one had thought of it before. A young postal messenger who worships an American opera singer makes an illegal tape of one of her recitals; meanwhile, a dying prostitute drops a cassette of her tape-recorded confessions, which will help indict a drug ring, into his mail pouch. Beineix stays too close to the themes and emotions of the formula cult film - a morbid romanticism, a lingering cuteness - for the picture to take off into art, but any film with this much stylistic assurance is impossible to fully resist.\" Reference: Dave Kerr.
