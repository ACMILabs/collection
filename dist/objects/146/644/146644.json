        "Shot entirely on location at the Chateau de Versailles, 'Si Versailles...'  tells, Guitry-style, the story of the famous castle - from humble beginings as a hunting pavillion to classic splendour - and of the many events, affairs and gatherings it hosted. This is a typical Guitry production with a stellar cast, dozens of cameos and more one liners and 'bonts mots' than a '90s sitcom. As usual Guitry makes light of history, mixing major historical events and sexy anecdotes, while playing the central role of Louis XIV. Although it is an historical film, 'Si Versailles ...' is ladden with anachronisms and factual errors. A share of the profits of the film went to the restoration and upkeep of the castle.  Credits: Producer, Clement Duhour ; director, Sacha Guitry ; writer, Sacha Guitry ; photography, Pierre Montazel ; music, Jean Francaix ; art direction, Rene Renoux. Cast: Sacha Guitry, Michel Auclair, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Jean-Louis Barrault, Jeanne Boitel, Gilbert Boka, Bourvil, Pauline Carton, Gino Cervi, Jean Chevrier, Aime Clariond, Claudette Colbert, Nicole Courcel, Danielle Delorme, Jean Desailly, Renee Devi"
