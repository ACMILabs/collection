        "Alex's father, an old ganster, has just died. For old time's sake, Alex asks two former accomplices of his father to organise one last robbery. The target is a new antidote designed to fight a virus called STBO. STBO is spread by having impersonal sex and is killing adolescents by the score. With 'Mauvais Sang' (his second film), Leos Carax finds his way into an esthetic movement of French cinema emerging in the 1980's as 'neo-baroque' (aka 'cinema du look'). Just like Luc Besson and Jean-Jacques Beineix, Carax favours outrageous lighting effects, a very pronounced acting style and a fetishist usage of objects. Awards: Prix Louis Delluc, 1986.  Credits: Producers, Alain Dahan, Philippe Diaz ; director, Leos Carax ; writer, Leos Carax ; photography, Jean-Yves Escoffier ; music, Charlie Chaplin, Sergei Prokofiev, Benjamin Britten. Cast: Denis Lavant, Juliette Binoche, Michel Piccoli, Hans Meyer, Julie Delpy, Hugo Pratt, Serge Reggiani, Mireille Perrier, Jerome Zucca."
