        "The captain of a tugboat is happily married but, when he rescues a boat from stormy waters, he falls in love with the wife of its captain. He leaves her to keep a vigil at the bedside of his own wife who is mortally ill. An intimate and perceptive study of passion and the nature of fidelity which benefits from a Prevert script and a trio of France's top stars. Filmed partly on location in Brest, work began in 1939, was hampered by the restrictions imposed by the Nazis and was completed 2 years later in a Paris studio.  Credits: Producer, Roland Tual ; director, Jean Gremillon ; writer, Jacques Prevert ; photography, Armand Thirard ; music, Roland Manuel ; art direction, Alexandre Trauner ; assistant director, Louis Daquin. Cast: Jean Gabin, Michele Morgan, Madeleine Renaud, Fernand Ledoux, Jean Marchat, Nane Germon, Charles Blavette, Alain Cuny."
