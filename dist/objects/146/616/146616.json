        "A young woman marries a pawnbroker but finds she cannot adapt her life to his. She toys with murdering him, but kills herself instead. With the introduction of colour in his films, beginning with 'Une femme douce', Bresson's vision darkened, his growing pessimism disclosed in an increasingly voluptuous rendering of the world. (One might say sobriety invites intoxication.) The flatness of Bresson's compositions and his emphasis on dedramatization places Bresson in the tradition of modernism, yet his universe often seems archaic.\" Reference: James Quandt.
