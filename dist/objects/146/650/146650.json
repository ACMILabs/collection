        "Two pigeons in love are flying above Paris. They visit their friend the Eiffel Tower who is suffering from stress. Today is a celebration day in Paris and the tower would like to participate, but its large size and clumsiness only serves to create mayhem. The tower decides to go and spend some time in the country, leaving crowds of angry Parisians looking for the soul of their City. Hearing of government plans to build a new Eiffel Tower and glad to be missed so dearly, the original tower decides to reappear.  Credits: Directors, Jean Image, Mose and Peter Sachs ; writers, Eraine, Claude Santelli, Paul Colline ; photography, Kostia Tchikine ; music, Jean Yatove. Cast: Francois Perier [voice only]."
