        "A young apprentice baker is fired by his boss. Since his room is included as part of his wages, and he cannot afford to leave, Chris decides to barricade himself in his room with a motley crue including a male friend, two girlfriends, a waitress and a Swedish hippie. Shot in black and white on 16mm with a largely amateur cast, this film is an excellent example of the young cinema of the 1970s.  Credits: Director, Jacques Doillon ; writers, Jacques Doillon, Philippe Defrance ; photography, Yves Lafaille. Cast: Christophe Soto, Olivier Bousquet, Ann Zacharias, Roselyne Vuillaume, Gabriel Bernard, Martin Trevieres, Pierre Fabien, Francois Beranger."
