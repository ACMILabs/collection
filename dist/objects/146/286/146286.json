        "Two thuggish truck drivers making a desperate fast delivery run across the United States, pick up a prostitute as a diversion. When she offers her body in exchange for the ride the woman, beaten and angry from a previous encounter, begins to experience even more of the degradation she was trying to escape. Rejected and scorned, her feelings of self-pity soon evolve into plans of revenge.  Credits: Producer, director, Joseph Strick ; writer, Judith Rascoe ; photography, Don Lenzer ; editing, Sylvia Sarner ; music, Stanley Myers. Cast: Robert Drivas, Regina Baff, Barry Bostwick, David Bauer, Regina Baff, Joe Pantoliano."
