    "description": [
        "Topaze, a shy and idealistic provincial schoolteacher is used as a front by a disreputable financier to sign cheques and take the rap if necessary. But he catches on fast, and ends up by appropriating both his boss's organization and his mistress. The combination of Jouvet's magisterial performance and the pungent dialogue of the play that made Pagnol famous is irresistible. Pagnol himself would direct it, with Armoudy in 1936 and Fernandel in 1951 in the title role, and in 1961, Peter Sellers, directed himself disastrously in 'Mr Topaz'. Reference: Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide.  Credits: Director, Louis Gasnier ; writer, Marcel Pagnol ; photography, Fred Langenfeld. Cast: Louis Jouvet, Paulet, Edwige Feuillere."
