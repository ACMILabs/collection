    "description": [
        "Roddy, a TV cameraman has a camera implanted in his brain and is assigned by a ruthless TV producer to follow the slow agony of a mortally ill woman, Katherine Mortenhoe. His footage will then be run on the popular TV series, 'Death Watch'. Katherine knows she is condemned by an incurable illness. While the TV station is only interested in ratings and the grim spectacle of what goes on inside the brain of someone who knows she's doomed, Roddy becomes increasingly compassionate and disgusted by the tawdriness of his assignment as he comes to know Katherine better. Sadly, all the English speaking actors are dubbed in French in this particular version.  Credits: Producers: Elie Kfouri, Bertrand Tavernier ; director, Bertrand Tavernier ; writers, Bertrand Tavernier, David Rayfel ; photography, Pierre-William Glenn ; music, Antoine Duhamel. Cast: Romy Schneider, Harvey Keitel, Harry Dean Stanton, Therese Liotard, Max von Sydow, Bernhard Wicki."
