    "description": [
        "When Spaniards invade a Flemish town in 1616, the men make themselves scarce and the women hatch a plan to conquer the enemy by seducing them with a lavish banquet. So impressed are the soldiers by the this gesture, they decide to not destroy the town, nor tax the inhabitants and instead return year after year continuing their association with the women who live there. The lavish sets and costumes entertainingly evoke the bucolic life of 17th century Flanders, in a successful attempt to deliver, writ-large, the poetic setting of a Flemish masterpiece. A sharp amusing script has made this film a continuous favourite with audiences. Controversially, the film was banned in Germany, suspected of parodying the rising Nazi army. Winner of Best Director at the 1936 Venice Film Festival.  Credits: Director, Jacques Feyder ; writer, Charles Spaak, Jacques Feyder, Jacques Feyder ; photography, Harry Stradling ; music, Louis Beydis ; editing, Jacques Brillouin. Cast: Francois Rosay, Jena Murat, Louis Jouvety, Lyne Clevers, Andre Alerme, Micheline Cheirel."
