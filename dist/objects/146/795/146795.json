        "Cocteau's updating of the Orpheus legend which haunted his own life takes the poet, from contemporary Paris to a mysterious chateau ruled by an imperious Princess, who first claims a younger poet, then Orpheus' wife, Eurydice. With its unforgettable imagery of leather-clad motorcyclists, the eerie ruins of the Zone and messages from another world received by car radio, this has had a profound influence on both Hollywood and the avant-garde. Awards: Venice Film Festival 1950: Fipresci Prize ; British Academy Awards 1950: Best Film.
