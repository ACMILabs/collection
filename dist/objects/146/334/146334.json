        "The first part of a trilogy based on the memoirs of the writer Maxim Gorki dealing with early experiences that formed his outlook. This first part is constructed around Alexei's (Gorki's) observation of life with the grandparents that raised him. Although charged with a revolutionary romanticism and the lyrical spirit of the Volga this deeply humanist work is also recognised as a recreation of rural life in Czarist Russia. The characters are presented in terms of their ambitions and relationships within the family structure. Valeria Massilitinova is especially memorable as the grandmother. Also available on VHS and 16mm. Part 2 (My Apprenticeship) of the trilogy available on 16mm, 35mm and VHS. Part 3 (My Universities) available on 16mm and VHS. 'The Gorky Trilogy' available as one title on VHS.  Credits: Director, Mark Donskoi ; writers, Mark Donskoi, I. Gruzdev ; photographer, Pyotr Yermolov ; music, Lev Schwartz. Cast: V. Massalitinova, M. Troyanovsky, A. Lyarsky."
