        "Francois Gerane is convinced his father, a famous lawyer, has killed his mother. Using as a pretext one of Francois's small misdeed, Maitre Gerane has the rebellious young man committed to a mental home. Much of Franju's first feature was shot in an actual asylum. The film is essentially a plea for a more sensible treatment of the mentally ill and the emotionally distressed, calling for much-needed widespread reforms. 'La tete contre les murs' is surely the most beautiful French film made since the war, and possibly the most beautiful French film ever made.\" Reference: POSITIF, 1/7/1959.  Credits: Producer, Jerome Goulven ; director, Georges Franju ; writers, Jean-Charles Pichon, Jean-Pierre Mocky ; photography, Eugene Schuftan ; music, Maurice Jarre ; assistant director, Jacques Rouffio ; camera assistant, Claude Zidi. Cast: Jean-Pierre Mocky, Anouk Aimee, Pierre Brasseur, Charles Aznavour, Paul Meurisse, Jean Galland, Edith Scob, Jean Ozenne."
