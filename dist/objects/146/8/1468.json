    "description": [
        "An old, frayed photograph depicts the image of a young domestic servant living and working on a NSW property in 1912. Using fragments of memory and ritual, Restoration gradually reveals the events behind the photo. Drenched in colour, this visually sumptuous work reveals that willing submission can disguse a fierce determination to change. In the abscence of any dialogue, the film employs a variety of innovative stylisitic techniques to convey narrative, including an evocative use of non-diegetic sound. The unconventional use of dance to depict the relationship between the maid and the photographer provides a memorable focal point of the film."
