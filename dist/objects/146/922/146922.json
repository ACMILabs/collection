        "Two young men, fresh out of prison for misdemeanor, attempt to stay on the straight and narrow. They often find themselves torn between family, mates and the necessity of finding a job. Filmed in the high-rise projects of Nanterre, this film is an uncompromising look at the life of young people eking a living at the edge of society. By its choice of topic and its stylistic, this film is at odds with the mainstream of the 1960s cinematographic production. Other artists and technicians credited: Maurice Dugowson, Serge Gainsbourg. See also: Les enfants du Palais [X000369] and Le petit Marcel [X000486].  Credits: Producer, Raoul Ploquin ; director, writer, Edouard Luntz ; photography, Jean Badal ; music, Jean-Louis Chautemps, Bernard Vitet, Guy Pedersen, Daniel Humair, Henri Renaud ; editors, Colette Kouchner, Suzanne Schiffman. Cast: Gerard Zimmermann, Erick Penet, Maryse Maire, Paul Preboist, Francois Dyrek."
