    "description": [
        "A single forged banknote changes hands as a schoolboy prank and follows a remorseless path (the chain reaction of Tolstoy's novella) which culminates in murder. Bresson ignores sociological and psychological explanation in austerely charting the paradoxical path of crime and punishment which leads the murderer towards redemption.
