        "This melancholic comedy is a story of post-war displacement and one man's sense of conflicting loyalties. Ruben, an Armenian, returns to his family after the war, only to leave them to go live with a nurse who saved his life. His proud wife, struck by the insult, enlists the help of her children in order to entice her husband back to the family home. Lurching between the two homes leaves Ruben in a state of abject confusion about his familial duties and personal needs.  Credits: Director, writer, Albert Mkrtchyan ; photography, Rudolf Vatinian ; music, T. Mansurian ; editing, S. Gabrielyan. Cast: Galya Novents, Mger Mkrchian, Elina Agamyan, Narine Bagadasaryan, Samvel Sarkisyan, Azat Gasparyan."
