        "Miquette aspires to be an actress. She runs off with a nobleman who promises to make her a star. When Miquette's mother searches for her wandering daughter, she finds the girl working with a ragtag touring company. The mother takes a job with the troupe to keep the lecherous nobleman away from Miquette. The film works best as a portrait of a provincial theatre in the 19th century.  Credits: Producer, Paul Joly ; director, Henri-Georges Clouzot ; writer, Henri-Georges Clouzot ; photography, Armand Thirard ; music, Albert Lasry ; art direction, Georges Wakhevitch. Cast: Louis Jouvet, Bourvil, Daniele Delorme, Mireille Perrey, Saturnin Fabre, Pauline Carton, Paul Barge, Leonce Corne, Jeanne Fusier-Gir, Olivier Hussenot, Philippe Nicaud, Pierre Olaf, Maurice Schutz, Louis Seigner."
