        "On New Year's Eve, Inspector Antoine Gallien, assisted by Belmont are questioning local attorney Martinaud in regard to the rape and murder of two young girls whose bodies have been found on the beach. Martinaud knew one of the children. At first the  questioning progresses politely, and then less so, as the interrogation team chips away at the suspect's alibi and Martinaud becomes the prime suspect. Claude Miller's film appears as a discreet homage to H.G. Clouzot's 'Quai des Orfevres'. Both films share the New Year's Eve setting and the same names for the police inspectors.
