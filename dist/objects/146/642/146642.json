    "description": [
        "The clan of the Goupi rules over a small provincial town. Each of them wears a quirky nickname: Goupi Tisane (herbal tea), Goupi Cancan (chatterbox), etc \u0085 But two of the Goupi have chosen to live outside the clan: Goupi Mains Rouges (red hands), poacher and witchdoctor and Goupi Tonkin, a former colonial soldier. One day, Goupi Tisane is found murdered in the forest. 'Goupi Mains Rouges' is one of the great successes of French cinema of the Occupation. At a time the Vichy regime was extolling the virtues of life on the land, the film delivered a biting satire of country life and country folks.  Credits: Producer, Jean Mugeli ; director, Jacques Becker ; writer, Pierre Very ; photography, Jean Bourgoin ; music, Jean Alfaro ; editor, Marguerite Renoir. Cast: Fernand Ledoux, Georges Rollin, Blanchette Brunoy, Robert Le Vigan, Line Noro, Maurice Schutz."
