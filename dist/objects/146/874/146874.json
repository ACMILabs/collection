        "This war time docudrama is based on real life events. Richard Sorge was from 1935 through 1943 working at the German embassy in Japan. Sorge was also a Russian spy, leaking out secret invasion plans in preparation for the anticipated Soviet takeover of Japan after the war. After his activities were uncovered, people say he was tried and hanged by the Japanese in 1944. Others suspect he may have been exchanged. His faithful secretary thinks Sorge paid for other people's mistakes. The film attempts to discover the truth by following with great minutiae the last months of Sorge's life.  Credits: Producer, Jean Cotet ; director, Yves Ciampi ; writers, Yves Ciampi, Rodolphe-Maurice Arlaud ; photography, Emile Villerbue, T. Ubukata ; music, Serge Nigg. Cast: Thomas Holtzmann, Hans-Otto Meissner, Keiko Kishi, Nadine Basile, Jacques Berthier, Jesse Hahn."
