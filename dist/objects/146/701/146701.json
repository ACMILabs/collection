        "Paris, 1961. Michel Jussieu, film producer, discovers the body of murdered political activist Georges Yvain on his way to a party. Haunted by guilt since he revealed under torture the names of members of his Resistance movement, Michel refuses to assist the police in the murder investigation and decides to conduct his own enquiry.

Credits: Producer, Pierre Braunberger, director, Jacques Doniol-Vacroze ; writer, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze ; photography, Henri Raichi ; music, Georges Delerue ; editor, Bob Wade ; assistant director, Jean-Louis Bunuel. Cast: Maurice Ronet, Francoise Brion, Sacha Pitoeff, Michel Lonsdale, Jean-Claude Darnal, Nicole Berger, Raymond Gerome, Francois Maistre."
