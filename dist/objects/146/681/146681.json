        "An ordinary bank clerk who has had a streak of good luck at the Nice casino, falls in love with a compulsive gambler, who has left a husband and child to satisfy her craving. Shot very quickly on the French Riviera, this love story with a roulette wheel as the motif and the motive, is one of the most vivid evocations of gambling fever on film. The luminous photography and the hypnotic music add to the film's attraction. Reference: Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide.  Credits: Producer, Paul-Edmond Decharme ; director, Jacques Demy ; writer, Jacques Demy ; photography, Jean Rabier ; music, Michel Legrand, art direction, Bernard Evein. Cast: Jeanne Moreau, Claude Mann, Paul Guers."
