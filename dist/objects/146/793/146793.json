        "Maryvonne works hard in a factory and one day meets and eventually falls for an attractive Algerian co-worker. Meanwhile, the workers at the factory go on strike, and Maryvonne fantasizes that she is leading them Joan of Arc-style, or as a Russian revolutionary. When a journalist arrives to record the strike, he encourages Maryvonne to write her account of the matters at hand. The journalist is based in Paimpol, and as Maryvonne travels to meet him, her dreams and his reality are set on a collision course.  Credits: Producer, Dominique Laurent ; director, John Berry ; writers, Josiane Leveque, John Berry ; photography, Bernard Zitzerman ; music, Serge Franklin. Cast: Myriam Boyer, Michel Boujenah, Jean-Francois Garreaud, Dora Doll, Michele Brousse."
