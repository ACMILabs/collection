        "This is an attempt by his assistant, Alexandrov, to reconstruct Eisenstein's unfinished film 'Que Viva Mexico'. While it is obviously not a realisation of Eisenstein's vision (one doubts, for example, that Eisenstein would have approved of Alexandrov's selection of music) it is the closest we are likely to come to it. Although around 30 hours of unedited film shot in 1930-1932 remains, Alexandrov confined his reconstruction to reworking the four hours of footage used by Jay Leyda in his compilation. Alexandrov provides an introductory commentary. Two other films have been edited from the 'Que Viva Mexico' footage: Marie Seton's 'Time in the Sun' and the producer's 'Thunder Over Mexico'. Also available on VHS.  Credits: Director, Sergei Eisenstein ; script, Sergei Eisenstein, Grigori Alexandrov ; photography, Eduard Tisse ; editors, Grigori Alexandrov, Nikita Orlov. Cast: Grigori Alexandrov."
