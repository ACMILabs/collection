        "An exceptionally moving documentary about Harvey Milk, the first openly gay candidate elected to San Francisco's Board of Supervisors. A courageous activist, Milk worked hard to express the political concerns of not only gays and lesbians, but also of African-Americans, Hispanics and other so- called American minorities.  After eleven months in office, Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco were assassinated by Dan White, a conservative member of the Board of Supervisors. The subsequent trial, in which White received a lenient sentence, resulted in massive rioting in San Francisco by gay and lesbian activists. Amidst the tragedy the film builds a convincing and impassioned picture of a man committed to human rights and human dignity. Academy Award winner for best documentary, 1985.  Credits: Producer, Richard Schmiechen ; director, Robert Epstein ; writer, Judith Coburn, Carter Wilson ; photography, Doug Dunderdale, Nancy Morita, Thomas O'Shea ; music, Mark Isham ; editor, Deborah Hoffmann, Robert Epstein. Cast: Harvey Fierstein (narrator)."
