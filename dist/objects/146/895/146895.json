        "Rima, a young orphan, lives in an Algerian village whose chief source of income is a salt mine. When the absentee owner refuses to raise the wages of the labourers, a strike is called. The mine owner calls the army to the rescue. Rima resorts to a stratagem to get rid of the troups. 'Remparts d'argile' was filmed in semi-documentary fashion in the Algerian village of Tehouda with a cast of local residents. Awards: Prix Jean Vigo 1971.  Credits: Director, writers, Jean-Louis Bertucelli, Jean Duvignaud ; photography, Andreas Winding. Cast: Leila Shanna."
