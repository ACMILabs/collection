        "Sacha Guitry used Talleyrand's nickname 'the Devil with a limp' as the starting point for a film on the first 'Eurocrat' and his life full of ups and downs, conspiracies and betrayals of every sort. From the Ancien Regime by whom Talleyrand was elevated to Bishop of Autun up to the reign of Louis-Philippe when he negotiated the peace with Britain, the path of this most famous political opportunist was played to the music of infidelity and the thirst for power. Talleyrand's grand passions (money, women and power...) are filmed with outstanding cinematic finesse.  Credits: Producer, Jean Mugeli ; director, Sacha Guitry ; writer, Sacha Guitry ; photography, Nicolas Toporkoff ; music, Louis Beydts. Cast: Pierre Bertin, Pauline Carton, Daniel Ceccaldi, Jean Debucourt, Emile Drain, Maurice Escande, Jeanne Fusier-Gir, Sacha Guitry, Robert Hossein, Lana Marconi, Jose Noguero, Jean Piat, Maurice Schutz, Renee Devillers."
