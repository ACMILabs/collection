        "An epic, wild, extremely black tragi-comedy, 'Underground' traces the war torn history of Yugoslavia from World War II to Bosnia. The story focuses on two friends, Marco and Blacky, and their absurd misadventures over the fifty years. The characters in this film inhabit a world of self-delusion, deceit and abuse, but also of revelry, vitality and love. Kusturica's blend of lush surrealism, wistful fantasy and dark irony, perfectly juxtapose both the hilarity and intense drama of this tale of townsfolk who, in an effort to escape the brutality of war go underground. It is both an historical documentation of the complexities of Yugoslavian politics, as well as an absurdly dark fairytale of unpredictable proportions about the absurdity of war.  Credits: Producer, Pierre Spengler ; director, Emir Kusturica ; writer, Dusan Kovacevic ; photography, Vilko Filac ; music, Goran Bregovic ; editing, Branka Ceperac. Cast: Miki Manojlovic, Lazar Ristovski, Slavko Stimac, Srdjan Todorovic, Pierre Spengler, Branko Cvejic."
