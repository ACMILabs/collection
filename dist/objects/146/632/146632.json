        "At a time when the New Wave had lost its initial momentum, Schroeder commissioned six 'new' directors - Douchet, Rouch, Pollet, Rohmer, Godard and Chabrol - to each produce a short film organised around daily life in a specific geographic locale in Paris. They were made on 16 mm. film (subsequently blown up to 35 mm.) both for low cost and to capture something of the raw documentary feel of television reportage. Rouch, for example, used 'the ten minute take' while cinema verite film maker Albert Maysles, the cameraman in Godard's episode, filmed without much idea of what Godard and the actors had in mind. Best print: X0072.  Credits: (Saint Germain des Pres) Director, Jean Douchet ; photography, Nestor Almendros ; (Gare du Nord) director, script, Jean Rouch ; photography, Etienne Becker ; (Rue Saint Denis) director, script, Jean Daniel Pollet ; photography, Alain Levent ;"
