        "This adaptation of Courteline revolves around a group of public servants working in a Ministry. Boring routine, mental inflexibility, narrowmindness: all the low points of human nature in general, and public administration in particular are being finely observed and satirised.  Credits: Director, writer, Daniel Ceccaldi ; music, Georges Delerue. Cast: Raymond Pellegrin, Daniel Ceccaldi, Evelyne Buyle, Roger Carel, Raymond Armontel, Bernard Lecoq, Claude Dauphin."
