        "Albert Camus, born in Mondovi (Algeria) on 7 November 1913, earned a worldwide reputation as a novelist and essayist and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1957. Through his writing, and in some measure against his will, he became the leading moral voice of his generation during the 1950s. At the height of his fame, Camus died in an automobile accident in 1960. This documentary, made for TV, discusses his work and in particular his relationship to the Algerian landscape. Contains interviews with Jules Roy, Mouloud Mammeri, Francis Jeanson, Jean Pellegri and Pascal Piat.  Credits: Producer, Cecile Clairval ; director, Paul Vecchiali ; photography, Jacques Duhamel. Cast: Julien Guiomar, Djelloul Beghoura [narration only]."
