        "A nomadic herdsman who has married a woman from a tribe with which his family has an ancient feud, takes a flock of sheep to sell in Ankara. On the way, some sheep die and others are stolen, and in the big city, the man is paid much less by a dealer than he was promised. Finally, his wife dies. Without preaching or sentimentality, the film exposes the hardships and injustices of Turkish society. Like 'The Enemy' and 'Yol', this film was supervised by Yilmaz Gueney from prison.  Credits: Producer, writer, Yilmaz Gueney ; director, Zeki Okten ; photography, Izzet Akay ; music, Zulfu Livaneli. Cast: Tarik Akan, Melike Demirag, Tuncel Kurtiz, Levent Inanir, Meral Niron."
