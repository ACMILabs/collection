        "An unhappily married man with two children watches a beautiful woman kill herself when she ties herself inside a car and drives  off a cliff. Jean tries to save the woman but it is too late. After hanging out with his bohemian friends, he  writes a letter to the local newspaper saying that he killed the woman. Jean is galvanized by the sensationalism of the headlines  and becomes intoxicated with thoughts of murder. He does away with the pretty model and girlfriend of his painter friend in a similar manner. Soon the painter grows suspicious of Jean and believes he is the one who has sent the letters to the paper telling the story of a little man who gains self importance by murder.
