        "An existential political thriller that grapples with the legacy of post-1968 European political activism. A successful but angst ridden German art critic, established in London, is contacted by a student friend from the 1960s to assassinate a Chilean military torturer. Approaching a comfortable middle age, he is unsettled by the disruption which forces him to confront his political convictions and choose between the activism of his youth or the complacency and security of his present life. Filmed on location in London and Hamburg.  Credits: Producer, Colin McCabe ; director, Andi Engel ; writer, Andi Engel, Lewis Rodia ; phototography, Denis Crossan ; editing, Christopher Roth ; music, Simon Fisher Turner. Cast: Jeroen Krabbe, Susannah York, Ulrich Wildgruber, Kate Hardie."
