        "Julien Vercel is a real-estate dealer accused of killing his wife and her lover. He hides in his office while his secretary Barbara sets out to discover what really happened and why. When Barbara starts looking into the dark past of her boss's wife, she comes across illicit love affairs, a prostitution ring and shady private detectives. \"I liked the idea of a 'serie noire' (detective novel) without gangsters. Second, the relationship between a secretary and her boss, which can be so amusing, has not been explored in recent films. And most of all, I wanted to make a detective film with Fanny Ardant. I read many novels by Williams and found that he created the best roles for women. I liked the idea of an 'ordinary' woman from daily life conducting  the investigation. Fanny represents in France a certain elegance and lyricism. I wanted to show that she could be a comedienne - in a popular role, behind a typewriter.\"   Reference: Annette Insdorf. 'Francois Truffaut'. Cambridge University Press, 1994.  Credits: Producer, Armand Barbault ; director, Francois Truffaut ; writers, Francois Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman, Jean Aurel ; photography, Nestor Almendros ; music, Georges Delerue ; art direction, Hilton McConnico.
