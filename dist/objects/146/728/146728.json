        "Isabelle, Adeline and Cecile work in a radiology practice. Disappointed by relationships with men, they content themselves with chance encounters. In this indulgent piece on mid-life crisis in the middle classe, the male characters are presented as a collection of irresponsible, self-centred creatures while women battle to come to term with the great decisions in life such as child bearing and rearing, with force booze and cigarettes for solace.  Credits: Producer, Alain Terzian ; director, Christopher Frank ; writer, Christopher Frank ; photography, Jean Tournier ; music, Georges Delerue. Cast: Marthe Keller, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Caroline Cellier, Fanny Cottencon, Philippe Leotard."
