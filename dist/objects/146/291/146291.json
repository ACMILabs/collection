        "This impressionistic adaptation of De Maupassant's classic novel 'Mouche' about a laundress and her five suitors was made for Czech television. Slovak-born director Juraj Herz has a career in film and television that spans more than 35 years and 30 films, working mainly in Prague but also in Slovakia, Germany and France. Although he first came to prominence in the 1960s, his work stands apart from that of other Czech and Slovak New Wave directors in its willingness to cross genres and constitutes a dense exploration of the fantastic.  Credits: Director, Juraj Herz ; photography, Jozef Simoncic. Cast: Jana Plichtova, Frantisek Velecky, Peter Debnar, Milan Lasica, Julius Satinsky and Lubor Zahon."
