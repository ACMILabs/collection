        "\"The narrative centers on the adventures of a couple of eighteen-year-olds, Madjid, a Beur and Pat, his illiterate French friend. However, the loose episodic structure of the narrative, covering a week or so in the lives of people living on the ironically named Flowers Estate, allows other stories to be intercalated, particularly that of Josette, a single mother who loses her job and is driven to attempt suicide, and Malika, Madjid's mother, who not only holds her own family together, but also provides support for other women on the estate who are unable to cope. The film is primarily interested in exploring Madjid's conflicts of identity, torn between the (unrealistic) expectations his mother has of him as an Algerian and his experiences on the streets of Paris with Pat.\" Reference: Carrie Tarr. Questions of identity in Beur cinema: from 'Tea in the Harem' to 'Cheb'. Screen 34:4 (Winter 1993).Awards: Prix Jean Vigo 1984.  Credits: Producer, Michele Ray-Gavras ; director, Mehdi Charef ; writer, Mehdi Charef ; photography, Dominique Chapuis ; music, Karim Kacel Cast: Kader Boukhanef, Remi Martin, Laure Duthilleul, Saida Bekkouche, Nicole Hiss."
