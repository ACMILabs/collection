    "description": [
        "A series of brutal attacks, mainly on women and children, are traced to a mysterious Monsieur Opale, whom the respected Dr. Cordelier claims as a friend. One day, the doctor's lawyer discovers that his client and Opale are one and the same, the doctor having created his alter ego by means of a drug. This re-telling of the Jekyll-Hyde legend adheres to Renoir's long-standing 'leitmotiv' of the individual who must stand alone because he is incapable of conforming. The original Robert Louis Stevenson story is updated, making several pointed comments about the good/evil dichotomy of the modern world. Renoir used up to 8 cameras and 12 microphones which gives the film a fluid, rough-edged, spontaneous appeal. This production was first conceived as a live TV play. The director's method of cutting only after each sequence allowed the actors to determine their own speed.  Credits: Producer, Albert Hollebecke ; director, Jean Renoir ; writer, Jean Renoir ; photography, Georges Leclerc ; music, Joseph Kosma. Cast: Jean-Louis Barrault, Teddy Bilis, Michel Vitold, Jean Topart, Micheline Gray, Jaque Catelain, Gaston Modot, Regine Blaess."
