    "description": [
        "Russian prince Muichkine returns to St. Petersburg after a stay in a Swiss mental hospital. Blissfully unaware of the greater social problems of his country, the prince believes that love and goodness reign supreme around him. He becomes betrothed to an innocent young girl while trying to save a less-innocent woman from her downfall. Jealousy and his own naivete conjoin to bring about an unimaginable tragedy. 'L'idiot' was remade in Japan by Akira Kurosawa (1951) and in Russia by Ivan Pyriev (1958).  Credits: Producer, Sacha Gordine ; director, Georges Lampin ; writers, Charles Spaak, Georges Raewsky ; photography, Christian Matras ; music, Maurice Thiriet, V. de Butzow. Cast: Gerard Philipe, Edwige Feuillere, Lucien Coedel, Nathalie Nattier, Marguerite Moreno, Jean Debucourt, Sylvie."
