        "This early installment of the 'Six Moral Tales 'series revolves around the rather free-floating amourous life of a young student in the Latin Quarter in the 1960s. 'La Carriere de Suzanne' is not typical of the other 'Contes Moraux' involving four young people in game playing during the course of failed relationships. In this film the theme is both more complex and less clear than in the first moral tale.  Credits: Producer, Barbet Schroeder ; director, writer, editor, Eric Rohmer ; photography, Daniel Lacambre. Cast: Catherine See, Philippe Beuzen, Christian Charriere."
