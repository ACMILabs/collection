        "Griffith used a variety of tinted film stock for dramatic effect on a scale seldom equalled in silent cinema. One of the most influential films in the history of cinema, on the theme of man's intolerance throughout the ages, told in four separate but interwoven stories--'Fall of Babylon', 'Passion of Christ', 'Massacre of St. Bartholomew' and 'The mother and the law'--which culminate in a climax of cross cutting. Alternate versions also available on 16mm and VHS. Credits: Director, writer, D. W. Griffith ; photography, G. W. Bitzer ; production designer, Frank \"Huck\" Wortman ; music, Joseph Carl Breil, D.W. Griffith ; editor, James Smith, Rose Smith. Cast: Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Miriam Cooper, Walter Long, Tully Marshall."
