        "Orfeu Negro is an transposition of the story of Orpheus and Euridyce to the modern city of Rio da Janeiro during the Carnival. It is interpreted by a cast of non-professional actors. Perhaps it was their amateur enthusiasm, the exoticism of the location, or the eventual freedom which Camus was granted to make the film he wanted, but somehow he managed to capture on film the frenetic, pulsating atmosphere of Carnival while telling the moving and poignant story of these doomed lovers. Awards: Cannes Film Festival 1959 - Palme d'or ; Academy Awards 1959 - Best Foreign Film. Best print: X0196.  Credits: Producer, Sacha Gordine ; director, Marcel Camus ; writer, Marcel Camus, Jacques Viot ; photography, Jean Bourgoin ; music, Luis Bonfa, Antonio Carlos Jobim. Cast: Breno Higeno-Mello, Marpessa Dawn, Lourdes de Oliveira, Lea Garcia, Alexandro Constantino, Waldemar da Souza, Jorge Dos Santos, Aurino Cassanio."
