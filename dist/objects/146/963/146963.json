        "Gardefort, a passionate horse trainer at the famous military riding school 'Le Cadre Noir' in Saumur prefers to resign after 16 years of exceptional service rather than accept a promotion that would send him away from his beloved horses. He accepts to stay on the school's purchasing committee. While on an inspection visit, he comes accross Milady, a horse deemed too imperfect for the school, in which he sees riches of potential. What follows could almost be described as a classic tale of 'amour fou' between a man who can only exist when riding on horseback and an animal willing to be transformed into the finest executant of the complex range of 'Haute Ecole' steps.  Credits: Producer, Denis Mermet ; director, Francois Leterrier ; photography, Georges Leclerc ; music, Georges Delerue. Cast: Jacques Dufilho, Claude Giraud, Francois Marthouret."
