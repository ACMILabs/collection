        "Dumont, an obstinate peasant, his son and cousin refuse to sell their land with its health-giving water spring to property developers anxious to turn the place into a fashionable spa. This late comedy of Rene Clair makes fun of all the trappings of modernity. Bourvil has a lot of fun playing all the members of the uncompromising Dumont family.  Credits: Producer, Jacques Plante ; director, Rene Clair ; writers, Rene Clair, Jean Marsan, Jacques Remy ; photography, Pierre Petit ; music, Georges van Parys. Cast: Annie Fratellini, Bourvil, Colette Castel, Philippe Noiret, Francoise Dorleac, Alfred Adam."
