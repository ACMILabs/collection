    "description": [
        "Alfred Jarry's Ubu roi ('King Ubu') was produced in 1896, with nonrealistic settings and costumes. All the scene settings were displayed simultaneously on a backdrop, and the costumes and makeup were deliberately grotesque, as was the acting style, an amalgam of buffoonery, the horror of Grand Guignol, and extravagant mock-tragedy. Far from posing an alternative to the materialist values of the bourgeois audience, the first line of Ubu roi attacked the audience's values head on. When Firmin Gemier, in the title role, advanced to face the audience, looked directly into their eyes, and uttered the first scandalous word of the text, 'merde' ('excrement'), a pattern was set that has been followed by many avant-garde theatre companies throughout the 20th century.
