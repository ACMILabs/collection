        "Lafont, a rarefied, egocentric, malicious art critic, and ruthless womanizer, is jolted by a series of encounters and experiences into reconsidering his character. The film's title refers to the floor of the apartment block where Lafont lives and periodically crosses paths with his neighbours, including a gay artist whose affection he does nothing to discourage. What begins as an intriguing character study degenerates into a superficial and soft-centered film, largely dominated by stereotypes, and of no particular distinguishing features. Reference: Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide.  Credits: Producer, Marie-Dominique Girodet ; director, Jean-Charles Tacchella ; writers, Elvire Murail, Jean-Charles Tacchella ; photography, Jacques Assuerus ; music, Raymond Alessandrini. Cast: Robin Renucci, Jean-Pierre Bacri, Jacques Bonaffe, Catherine Leprince, Michel Aumont."
