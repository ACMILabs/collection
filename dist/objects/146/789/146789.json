        "Baton Rouge' is the story of three friends, one Frenchman, Mozart, and two Beurs (see footnote), Karim and Abdenour, who dream of travelling to Baton Rouge in pursuit of the American Dream (inspired by a Mick Jagger song). After a series of sequences set in the suburbs of Paris, introducing the characters, and showing them doing various temporary jobs, a whimsical twist of fate allows the threesome to make their dream come true. The plot follows their adventures in the United States as they journey south to Louisiana. Although they encounter obstacles aplenty, and are forced by lack of money into bumming train rides or stealing from a garage, they also bathe in the warmth of a more tolerant atmosphere than they have come to expect in France.\" Reference: \"Questions of identity in Beur cinema: from 'Tea in the Harem' to 'Cheb'\". Screen 34:4 (Winter 1993): pp 321-342. Footnote: The word Beur is derived from Parisian backslang for 'arabe' (Arab), and was in circulation within the immigrant community in the late 1970s. Its hybrid form reflects the conflict of identity experienced by the newly visible 'second generation' (as they are still called).  Credits: Producers, Humbert Balsan, Jean-Pierre Mahot ; director, Rachid Bouchareb ; writers, Rachid Bouchareb, Jean-Pierre Ronssin ; photography, Jimmy Glasberg, Pierre Dupouey ; music, John D. Faure. Cast: Jacques Penot, Pierre-Loup Rajot, Hammou Graia, Elaine Foster, Romain Bouteille, Katia Tchenko."
