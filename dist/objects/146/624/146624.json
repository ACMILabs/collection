        "Feeling vaguely abandoned as his girlfriend has gone to London, Adrian, a dilettante philosopher, goes to stay at a friend's villa on the outskirts of St. Tropez. Daniel, an avant-garde artist, and Haydee, a sweetly amoral nymphette who sleeps with a different boy every night, are there also. As the collector of the title, she causes disarray in the two men who decide it is their duty to resist her advances - an intellectual rather than physical moral superiority. It is Adrian, frustrated and chastened, who finally fulfills the moral outline of the series, by hopefully planning a reconciliation with his girlfriend. 'La Collectionneuse' was the first feature Rohmer made in 35mm and colour. This is the fourth installement of Rohmer's 'Six Moral Tales'.  Credits: Producers, Georges de Beauregard, Barbet Schroeder ; director, Eric Rohmer ; writer, Eric Rohmer ; photography, Nestor Almendros ; music, Les Blossom Toes, Giorgio Gomeslky. Cast: Patrick Bauchau, Haydee Politoff, Daniel Pommereulle, Seymour Hertzberg."
