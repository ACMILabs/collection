        "A humble civil servant, learning that he is dying of cancer, discovers the meaning of existence - when one lives, one must live entirely. An elaborate and rigorous formal system of symmetrics and asymmetrics contained within the overall 'rough-hewn geometry' has been analysed by Noel Burch. The first two-thirds shows Watanabe's actions, his own reactions to his approaching death. The last third ironically shows the reactions of others - their rejection of Watanabe and the meaning of his death. This sets up a complex interaction between emotional involvement and distanciation. Also available on 16mm, VH and LD.  Credits: Director, Akira Kurosawa ; writers, Akira Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto, Hideo Oguni ; photography, Asaichi Nakai ; music, Fumio Hayasaka. Cast: Takashi Shimura, Miki Odagiri, Nobuo Kaneko, Kyoko Seki."
