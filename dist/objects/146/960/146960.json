        "In 1974, Chirs Marker followed singer Yves Montand as he was preparing a benefit concert for the Chilean refugees. Without any commentary, but with virtuoso editing and many insightful close-ups, Chris Marker sketches a warm portrait of the singer. He analyses Montand's political engagement, his tension before the show and his relationship with his pianist, Bob Castella.  Credits: Director, Chris Marker ; photography, Pierre Lhomme, Yann Le Masson. Cast: Yves Montand."
