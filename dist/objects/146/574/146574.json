        "After one of his ships fails to return safely to Venice, Volpone, a wealthy merchant finds himself crippled with debts and sent to prison. When the ship finally appears, Volpone is released, vying for revenge. With the help of Mosca, a former cellmate, Volpone fakes his own death and bequests his fortune to Mosca. At first, Volpone enjoys the spectacle of his greedy creditors fighting for the spoils. But then the joke turns sour as Mosca proceeds to evict Volpone from his own palace.  Credits: Producer, A. Hertz ; director, Maurice Tourneur ; writer, Jules Romains ; photography, Armand Thirard ; music, Marcel Delannoy. Cast: Harry Baur, Louis Jouvet, Charles Dullin, Jacqueline Delubac, Alexandre Rignault, Fernand Ledoux, Pierre Sabbagh."
