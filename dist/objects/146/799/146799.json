        "In 1962, two teenage boys spend their weeks in a boarding school in a provincial town. They horse around, playing pranks, roughhousing with each other and climbing over the school's walls to  harass and tease the local girls. Their main interest in life is women; anything to do with them is pleasing to them. They scrape together the money for a trip to Sweden, and despite more difficulties than they anticipated, one of them succeeds in making love with a girl.  Credits: Producer, Albina du Boisrouvray ; director, Pascal Thomas ; writers, Pascal Thomas, Roland Duval ; photography, Colin Mounier ; music, Vladimir Cosma. Cast: Frederic Duru, Edmond Raillard, Jean-Marc Chollet, Daniel Ceccaldi, Serge Rousseau, Jacques Debary, Virginie Thevenet."
