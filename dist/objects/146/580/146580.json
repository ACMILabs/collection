        "Michel is in charge of building a road cutting through the savanna of Senegal. When the building work threatens a sacred tree, Michel has to face the wrath of the villagers of Tiolene. The film looks at the difficulties faced by an ex-colony once it has received its independence. Corrupt structures do not disappear with the colonialists, but remained ingrained in the practices of the indigenous bourgeois class. This film was the first French-Senegal co-production. See also: 'Xala' (Ousmane Sembene, 1974) held in our collection.  Credits: Producer, Jean Cotet ; director, Yves Ciampi ; witers, Cast: Corinne Marchand, Maurice Ronet, Nanette Senghor, Iba Guey"
