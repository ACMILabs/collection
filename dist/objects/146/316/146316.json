        "Isaburo is an aging swordsman loyal to the feudal system of Japanese society. His son, Yogoro is requested to marry his father's overlord's mistress, Ichi, with whom the lord has become displeased. Against his father's wishes Yogoro agrees to the match, and falls in love with Ichi, who bears him a son. When the clan's elder son dies, the lord sends for Ichi to return - but the family refuse to be parted. Supported by Isaburo, for whom life has renewed meaning, father and son join forces against the warlord, who orders the couple to commit suicide and then when they refuse, sends soldiers to execute them. Set in 1725 Japan, 'Rebellion' is an intriguing historical drama that pitches the samurai's code of honour against his familial loyalties, reaching a typically bloody and beautifully choreographed finale.  Credits: Producer, Toshiro Mifune, Tomoyuki Tanaka ; director, Masaki Kobayashi ; writer, Shinobu Hashimoto ; photography, Kazuo Yamada ; music, Toru Takemitsu ; editing, Hisashi Sagara Cast: Toshiro Mifune, Takeshi Kato, Yoko Tsukasa, Tatsuya Nakadai, Tatsuyoshi Ebara, Michiko Otsuka."
