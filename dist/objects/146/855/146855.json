        "In a provincial city in the mining region of Northern France, a group of disillusioned students with no prospects other than dead-end jobs or unemployment, see little point in doing any work for their 'baccalaureat' (high school certificate). Ignoring the futile dissertations of their teachers, they drift aimlesslly round the local bistro or down the coast; some engage in hollow sexual encounters; others go to Paris. Pialat's minutely detailed observation of dispossessed youth is made with an admirable combination of objectivity and compassion.  Credits: Producer, Maurice Pialat ; director, Maurice Pialat ; writer, Maurice Pialat ; photography, Pierre-William Glenn ; music, Patrick Juvet. Cast: Sabine Haudepin, Philippe Marland, Valerie Chassigneux, Annick Alane, Michel Caron."
