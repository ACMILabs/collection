A young Belmondo plays the dashing hero.  Credits: Director, Claude Barma ; writers, Claude Barma, Pierre Nivollet ; photography, Jacques Lemare ; music, Jean Marion. Cast: Jean-Paul Belmondo, Jean Chevrier, Daniel Sorano, Hubert Noel, Gaby Sylvia, Pierre Asso, Michel Galabru, Georges Descrieres, Bernard Dheran, Robert Hirsch, Michel Galabru."
