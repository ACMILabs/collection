        "Charles, a law student, shares a sumptuous Paris apartment with his sister. One day, he finds a very strange love letter in the pocket of his father's tuxedo. While trying to understand his father's love entanglements, he is led to a Pigalle nightclub where act after act is performed with the intent of splintering bourgeois sexual mores into humorous pieces.  The 'cinema du look' is not quite confined to the films of Beineix, Besson and Carax, the tree neo-baroque 'wonder boys'. Caroline Roboh's camp cabaret 'Clementine Tango' (1982) belongs to the genre too, as does Virginie Thevenet 'La nuit porte-jaretelles' (1985), which led 'Les Cahiers du Cinema' to coin the phrase 'style Forum des Halles', and prompted an attack from 'Positif' on the quality of the narrative, acting, and portrayal of sexuality.\" Guy Austin. 'Contemporary French cinema'. Manchester University Press, 1996.  Credits: Producer, Vladimir Forgency ; director, Caroline Roboh ; writer, Caroline Roboh ; photography, Mario Barroso. Cast: Claire Pascal, Francois Helvey, Caroline Roboh, Arturo Brachetti, Josephine Larsen."
