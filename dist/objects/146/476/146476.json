        "Big Brother Zhang, a monk, visits Lao Li to discourage him from getting a divorce. Lao Li explains that he has been suffering from depression due to his marriage. Zhang brushes this off as a new-age term that is used without thought. He tells Lao Li to think carefully before making a decision he may later regret.  News spreads that Lao Li has returned to his wife, and they attempt to settle back into their life together. Lao Li has difficulty adjusting to married life again and constantly bickers with his wife. One evening, he reads her a poem about the beauty of solitude and the desire for freedom. She takes offense, thinking the poem is about her.  Meanwhile, Lao Li appears to have feelings for Ma, a young woman who lives in the same housing complex who has been disowned by her family, When Lao Li's wife finds out, she verbally attacks her in the hallway.  Lao Li's work colleagues ask to meet his wife. They organise dinner at the local Western Restaurant. Although the restaurant is lavish and high class, Lao Li's children make a calamitous mess and his wife behaves like a peasant, embarrassing him. Lao Li's work colleagues laugh at her unrefined behaviour. Lao Li is mortified, believing he is condemned to be laughed at for the rest of his life.  The next day at work, the director of the company pays Lao Li a visit and is impressed by the quality of his work. A colleague invites Lao Li and his wife to dinner at his house, but she is still too embarrassed by the previous night's proceedings.  That evening, just as Lao Li is about to leave for the dinner by himself, his wife emerges with the children, all nicely dressed, and they all head off together. Much to Lao Li's pleasure, they behave perfectly.  The next day over lunch, a friend of Lao Li's tells him of his horrible marriage and subsequent divorce, which has effectively destroyed his life. When Lao Li returns home late that night, his finds his wife has taken up the whole bed, forcing him to sleep on the floor.  The next day is Chinese New Year, and Lao Li encounters Ma in the street. She tells him that they must no longer see each other, so that his wife doesn't abuse her again. New Year's Eve celebrations continue while Lao Li sits at home and wallows. A few days later, he witnesses Ma playing with the children in the courtyard.  When Lao Li's wife discovers that he plans to leave her for Ma, she is devastated, claiming she cannot go on and she wants to die. Humiliated, she calls him heartless. Lao Li resigns from his job. THE END.  Cultural History of the Film:  This film is indicative of a common preoccupation of Chinese Cinema of the time \u2013 the relationship between classes.  Lao Li's class ambition and desire to conceal his family's peasant roots is incredibly disagreeable, and the way he regards his wife is borderline misogynistic. He appears to detest her for no other reason than her natural peasant inclinations.  It is difficult to determine whether or not the film is critical of Lao Li's snobbery and pretension. The viewer does, however, sympathise with Lao Li's wife. (2 stars - Aleena Glentis; November 2, 2012)"
