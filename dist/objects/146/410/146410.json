        "The film represents the final years of Kuomintang (the KMT, also known as the Nationalist Party which retreated to Taiwan in 1949) leader Liao Zhongkai in the 1920s. In June 1922, civil governor of Guangdong, Chen Jiongming attacked Sun Yat-sen\u2019s residence and forced him to escape. Sun\u2019s friend and assistant Liao Zhongkai was arrested. Although Chen released Liao due to pressure from different parties, Liao was on Chen\u2019s hit list. Liao and his wife escaped to Shanghai to meet Sun Yat-sen with help from friends. The 1920s was a time that China\u2019s Qing dynasty had been overthrown and warlords and different political parties were all competing for power. Liao supported Sun\u2019s initiative of reforming the KMT by recruiting Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members. Liao went to Japan on behalf of Sun to meet Russian Communist representatives, which laid a foundation for Sun\u2019s policy. In 1923, Sun retook Guangzhou (capital of Guangdong province) and appointed Chen to be financier of the KMT and governor of Guangdong. Liao had to fight with the Rightists in KMT, who were against the KMT-CCP cooperation. Liao lost the battle to the Rightists and was forced to resign. 1924 witnessed riots in Guangzhou again, but Liao led his force and repressed it. In 1925, Sun died in Beijing and Liao decided to uphold Sun\u2019s policy. Liao\u2019s pro-Communist political stance irritated the KMT Rightists who plotted a murder again him on 20 August 1925. Liao died at the age of 48.  The film was awarded Best Director and Best Actor at the 4th PRC Golden Rooster Film Festival in 1984. Liao Zhongkai is a key figure in modern Chinese history. Although Liao was a KMT leader, he was praised by the CCP for his pro-communist stance. Liao\u2019s wife, He Xiangning was also well-known as a key founder of China\u2019s Revolutionist Party, and there is an art museum named after her in Shenzhen.
