The newly-appointed governor of Yangzhou caught Huang's big brother and executed him. Huang plotted an assassination of the local governor after he failed to rescue his big brother. A girl went to assassinate the local governor with her father on the same night as Huang, and mistakenly took Huang as the governor's body guard. By the time they knew the identity of each other, the two were surrounded by a large troop. Huang helped the girl escape but was caught by the troop. To Huang's surprise, the local governor set him free and let him go back home to see his dying father. Huang's father hoped his son to break away with the bandits and work for the government. The local governor caught Huang again on his father's funeral day and lured Huang with official title and a promising future. Huang was struggling in mind but eventually took the offer. He then was assigned to escort a large amount of silver to the emperor by the governor. Huang's team was attacked by bandits on their way to the capital.
