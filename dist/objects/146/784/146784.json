        "Les Camisards' brings events to the screen from the period in which King Louis XIV revoked the Act on Religious Tolerance (1685) and ordered French Protestants to convert to Catholicism or face persecutions. Rather than being a sweeping epic, this film examines the fight of a small group of Protestants for survival in the mountainous Cevennes region. Some of the story is told using excerpts from the diary kept by an actual participant in the conflict. The movie is notable for its period authenticity and historical accuracy.  Credits: Director, Rene Allio ; writers, Jean Jourdheuil, Rene Allio ; photography, Denys Clairval ; music, Philippe Arthuys. Cast: Francois Marthouret, Dominique Labourier, Rufus, Isabelle Sadoyan, Jacques Debary, Genevieve Mnich, Maurice Benichou, Suzy Rambaud, Jean Benguigui, Christine Laurent."
