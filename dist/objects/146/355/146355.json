        "Set in the Deep South with Keaton as the wimpish son of a steamboat captain who ultimately proves himself in helping his father fight off a wealthy rival. Particularly memorable is the hat-buying sequence and the remarkably staged cyclone sequence in which the town is destroyed around a stoic Buster. Version without musical soundtrack also available on 16mm.  Credits: Director, Chas F. Reisner ; photographers, Dev Jennings, Bert Haines ; writers, Carl Harbaugh, Buster Keaton ; piano accompaniment, William Perry. Cast: Buster Keaton, Tom McGuire, Ernest Torrence, Tom Lewis, Marion Byron."
