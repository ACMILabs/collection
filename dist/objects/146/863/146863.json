Pretending to be Mr. Davis' intermediary, Pardot at last makes it big in the business world. A crisis develops when Pardot's investors demand to meet Mr. Davis in person--and when several young ladies show up, claiming to be the mothers of Mr. Davis' children. Re-made as 'The Associate' (1996), with Whoopie Goldberg. Both are a re-makes of the 1939 film 'The Mysterious Mr. Davis' directed by Claude Autant-Lara with a cast of British actors, including Alastair Sim.  Credits: Producer, Simone Allouche ; director, Rene Gainville ; writers, Rene Gainville, Jean-Claude Carriere ; photography, Etienne Szabo ; music, Michel Bernholc, Mort Schuman.
