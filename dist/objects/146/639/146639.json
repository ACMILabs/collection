        "Joseph is a young Savoyard peasant who makes a living by crossing the Alps into Italy in the winter months selling his wares to the villagers. This story traces a winter's itinerary as the man encounters various adventures in his always dangerous journey, but he remains oblivious to all the nuances and reverberations of social change going on around him. When he finally returns to his family after many months away, he discovers to his surprise that his village is now a part of France and it looks like a Savoyard would soon be sitting on the throne of a unified Italy. The film was originally shot in wide screen format. This copy is presented in standard screen ratio 3:4.  Credits: Producer, Claude Nedjar ; director, Bernard Favre ; writers, Bernard Favre, Bertrand Tavernier ; photography, Jean-Francis Gondre ; music, Marc Perrone, Nicola Piovani. Cast: Richard Berry, Berangere Bonvoisin, Sophie Chemineau, Marc Perrone, Robin Renucci."
