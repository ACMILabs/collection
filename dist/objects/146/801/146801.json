        "Pierre and Jean journey to a holy shrine in Northern Spain (Santiago de Compostella). Are they pilgrims or tramps? No one knows their identity or their true motives. During this timeless intitiatic journey, their faith is severely tested by some of the irreverent characters they confront in the course of their pilgrimage. Even chance meetings with Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Devil are not quite what Pierre and Jean have been prepared for in their religious training. This late Bunuel film is one of his most direct treatment of the Catholic Church  and the six central mysteries of Catholic dogma: the nature of God, Christ, the Virgin Mary, the Eucharist, divine grace and evil.  Credits: Producer, Serge Silberman ; director, Luis Bunuel ; writers, Luis Bunuel, Jean-Claude Carriere ; photography, Christian Matras ; music, Luis Bunuel. Cast: Delphine Seyrig, Laurent Terzieff, Ellen Bahl, Paul Frankeur, Agnes Capri, Julien Berthau, Augusta Carriere, Julien Guiomar, Muni, Georges Marchal."
