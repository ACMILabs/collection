        "Roller skating expert Lin Jia Jun is involved in a traffic accident which forces him into prison as a result of killing a Hong Kong traveller. Soon after coming out of prison and returning to his garage, he encounters the dead traveller\u2019s widow Zhao Ya Yi. The two of them develop from misunderstanding to affectionate feelings towards each other. However, Lin Jia Jun fails to realize that the traveller was an important member of the Hong Kong Mafia, who before passing away hid a stash of drugs which triggered his Hong Kong associates into hiring a professional killer to deal with the business in the Mainland. He attacks during Lin and Zhao Ya Yi\u2019s wedding, and in the crossfire Zhao Ya Yi is brutally murdered, and Lin Jia Jin decides to help the Mainland police as they have been keeping the Mafia gang under surveillance. As soon as the Mafia gang shatters into Lin\u2019s garage Lin Jia Jun, disregarding his own safety, takes the gang on, until the Mainland police make their entrance from the roof and annihilate the gang. (Awards: Golden Rooster 1991 - Editing). (Wendy Xu, 2014)."
