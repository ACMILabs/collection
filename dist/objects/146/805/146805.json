        "A series of casually linked episodes moving from Toledo in 1808 and Goya's painting of 'The executions of 3 May' to contemporary Paris where various people try to grasp or shun, in Karl Marx's phrase, 'the phantom of liberty'. This is Bunuel's very personal version of 'La Ronde'. In eight sketches - each representing a different aspect of hypocrisy - he creates a succession of dazzling moments. The sketches use every type of comedy: there is an interval of French farce with slamming bedroom doors, two black jokes about cancer and mass murder and a piece of pure Ionesco. Each sketch has its point to make and its own authority figures to be lampooned. This is a delightful and hilarious Bunuelian masterpiece.  Credits: Producer: Serge Silberman ; director, Luis Bunuel ; writers, Luis Bunuel, Jean-Claude Carriere ; photography, Edmond Richard.
