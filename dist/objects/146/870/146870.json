        "When anti-military rebellion erupts in a remote Central Americam tin-mining settlement, a group of French people led by Shark, an escaped prisoner, make for Brazil via the river. Forced to abandon their boat, the fugitives trek through the jungle, enduring all manner of hardship and deprivation. This is a straightforward adventure yarn, indeed a poitboiler, but Bunuel's familiar targets - greed and hypocrisy - are still in evidence.  Credits: Producers, Oscar Dancigers, David Mage ; director, Luis Bunuel ; writers, Raymond Queneau, Gabriel Arout, Luis Alcoriza ; photography, Jorge Stahl Junior ; music, Paul Misraki ; editor, Marguerite Renoir. Cast: Simone Signoret, Georges Marchal, Michel Piccoli, Michele Girardon, Charles Vanel."
