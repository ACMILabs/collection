        "A crime has been committed near an isolated farm called 'Les Granges Brulees', in the mountains of Jura. The farm is owned by Rose, the pillar on which her family depend and against which it pulls. Judge Larcher is in charge of the investigation and every piece of evidence points towards Rose's youngest son. As the investigation progresses, Larcher becomes drawn into the secrets of Rose's clan, digging up painful truths about each member of this apparently closely knit family.  Credits: Producer, Ralph Baum ; director, Jean Chapot ; writers, Jean Chapot, Sebastien Roulet ; photography, Sacha Vierny ; music, Jean-Michel Jarre. Cast: Alain Delon, Simone Signoret, Paul Crauchet, Bernard Le Coq, Miou-Miou, Renato Salvatori, Jean Bouise, Christian Barbier, Fernand Ledoux."
