        "Damoure and Lam leave Niger to travel to Paris in order to investigate the possibility of building a multi-storey building in Niamey. This is a pretext for Rouch and his interprets to cast a caustic look at French society and to indulge in largely improvised reversed ethnology. During their research trip in Paris, Damoure and Lam meet up with a young African prostitute, a bum and a young woman who is bored with her life to whom they extend an invitation to come and spend time in Niger with them.  Credits: Producer, Pierre Braunberger ; director, Jean Rouch ; writer, Jean Rouch ; photography, Jean Rouch ; music, Enos Amelolon, Amicale de Niamey, Alan Helly. Cast: Safi Faye, Damoure Zika, Lam Ibrahim Dia, Illo Gaoudel, Ariane Bruneton, Tallou Mouzourane."
