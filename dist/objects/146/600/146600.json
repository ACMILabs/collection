        "Alceste, disgusted with the hypocrisy of the world, has declared that there is no good in man and has vowed never to lie about the virtues of others. He is, of course, the misanthrope of the title. This attitude gets him into a considerable amount of trouble, including a law suit which he loses because he refuses to flatter the judge. Alceste is in love with the flirtatious and shallow Cime. So much so that is is incaplable of noticing in her the defaults he so despises in other people.  Credits: Director, Jacques-Gerard Cornu ; photography, Jean-Jacques Graude ; art direction, Willy Holt. Cast: Jacques Dumesnil, Anouk Ferjac, Giselle Touret, Bernard Dheran, Jacques Charon."
