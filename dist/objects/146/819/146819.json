        "Of Luxembourg nationality, Julien is not drafted for the First World War, and is therefore able to continue his piano lessons in Paris. His friend Jacques is a pilot doing service at the war front. One day, Julien receives a telegram in which Jacques invites him for a stay at his remote estate in Bray. Julien leaves to meet his friend, but Jacques does not show up. His only company at the lovely estate is a reticent woman whom, he assumes to be the housekeeper. By the time Julien decides to return to Paris, persuaded his friend has died in the war, he reads in the newspaper that the weather may have been the cause of Jacques'absence.
