        "Judge Castaing in is charge of the Juvenile Delinquency Section of the Pantin area. Everyday he is faced with lost teenagers on the brink of criminality, irresponsible parents and an indifferent administration. Castaing is the archetypal 'honest man' who truly believes in his mission. Part judge, part father figure, the film shows a day in the life of a man who feels a father-like responsibility for every youth he is in charge of. All performances in 'Les enfants du Palais'  ring so true that ultimately the spectator is compelled to share in Castaing's anger and despair when one of his young charges is caught in a Police shoot-out. Filmed in documentary style (it is at times difficult to differentiate the actors from the real life participants), 'Les enfants du Palais' present a portrait of a system that has barely changed since the days of the infamous reformatories, and which is still unable to achieve its real mission: to save the children. See also: Les coeurs verts [X000390].  Credits: Director, Jean-Marie Perier ; music, Donovan. Cast: Francois Perier, Martial Pautrel, Dani Graule, Simone Signoret (voice only)."
