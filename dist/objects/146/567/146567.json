    "description": [
        "In 1912, Monsieur Ladmiral, 76, lives alone in his home on the outskirts of Paris. He is a talented painter who will not adapt to the new Impressionist style. As happens most Sundays, he awaits the visit of his son and family. It promises to be a Sunday like many others, full of politeness and affection. The sudden arrival of Irene, Mr. Ladmiral's daughter disrupts the monotony of the day. Young and emancipated, Irene stirs up the laughter of the children, the anger of Mr. Ladmiral's son and the old man's nostalgia. The film contains many references to French painters such as Bonnard and Vuillard, as well as to Jean Renoir's 'Une Partie de Campagne'.
