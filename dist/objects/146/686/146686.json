        "Bart Cordell inherits his father's business following his father's accidental death. Bart is convinced the circumstances of this death were dubious and may be part of a ploy to destabilise his financial empire. He hires a private detective and finds that a reporter working for his father's magazine (one of the many companies he owned) was looking into plans by another multinational to take over the company.  Cordell also discovers that his father-in-law, a former Italian fascist, may not have given up his old loyalties.  Credits: Producer, Jacques-Eric Strauss ; director, Philippe Labro ; writers, Jacques Lanzmann, Philippe Labro ; photography, Jean Penzer ; music, Michel Colombier ; art direction, Theobald Meurisse. Cast: Jean-Paul Belmondo, Carla Gravina, Jean Rochefort, Charles Denner, Maureen Kerwin."
