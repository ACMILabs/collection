        "An aged professor - introverted and emotionally cold - makes a journey to collect a university award and en route relives his past through recollection, dreams and imagination. Borg emerges purged, if not wholly changed from this confrontation with self. The theme of the film, incarnated in the successive generations of the Borgs, is death-in-life, emotional-spiritual atrophy. It has been compared with King Lear and Strindberg's Dream Play and in structure with a Bach fugue. Wild strawberries are a Swedish symbol for the emergence of spring, the rebirth of life. Also available on 16mm and VHS.  Credits: [Producer, Allan Ekelund] ; director, writer, Ingmar Bergman ; photography, Gunnar Fischer ; music, Erik Nordgren. Cast: Victor Sjostrom, Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Andersson, Gunnar Bjornstrand."
