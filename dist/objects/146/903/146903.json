        "Filmed during WWII, Robert Bresson's first feature was shot entirely at night. Establishing a precedent that he would follow in his later films, Bresson utilises non-professionals in the leading roles. Rich young Anne-Marie thinks she has found her vocation when she joins a Dominican convent as a novice. The convent specialises in rehabilitating female prisoners, and Anne-Marie becomes especially fascinated with Therese, trying to get her to join the convent to redeem her for her sins - but Therese protests her innocence and refuses the offer. Upon her release, Therese kills her lover, and seeks refuge from the police in Anne-Marie's convent.
