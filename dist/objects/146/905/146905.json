    "description": [
        "Recorded at the Eglise Saint-Germain during the Festival du Marais. 'Esther' (1689) is a biblical tragedy complete with musical choral interludes composed by Jean-Baptiste Moreau, who would serve in this same role for Racine's last play, Athalie. The play shows how Esther, the wife of the Persian king Ahasuerus (Xerxes I), saves the Jews from a massacre plotted by the king's chief minister, Haman. With its three acts, chorus and transcendent message that God and truth can be made manifest on stage, Esther breaks sharply with Racine's previous practice in tragedy. It is not one of his major works, despite the beauty of its choruses.\" Reference: Encyclopedia Britanica. Online; http://www.eb.com  Credits: Director, Dominique Delouche ; photography, Emanuel Machuel ; music, Jean-Baptiste Moreau. Cast: Andre Falcon, Liliane Nataf, Julien Bertheau, Claude Brosset."
