        "A second-rate French journalist visiting West Germany to write a series of articles meets a successful author and his French wife, who appear to be an exceptionally happy couple. He insinuates himself into their lives, becomes obsessed with their relationship and attempts to seduce the wife, thereby causing destruction. One of the most elegant of Chabrol's early works, the films presents an intriguing situation that develops with Hitchcockian undertones, even though the warped behaviour of the journalist remains somewhat of a puzzle. However Chabrol's Peeping Tom camera is effectively used to suggest a study in voyeurism. Reference: Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide.  Credits: Producers, Georges de Beauregard, Carlo Ponti ; director, Claude Chabrol ; writer, Claude Chabrol, Marcel Matthieu ; photography, Jean Rabier ; music, Pierre Jansen. Cast: Stephane Audran, Jacques Charrier, Walter Reyer, Daniel Boulanger, Andre Badin."
