        "A poacher, wishing for fatherhood, coaxes an itinerant girl away from her simple knifegrinder companion and sets up house with her in a deserted village which they bring back to life. Reference: Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide. A darker side to Marcel Pagnol's work drew on an older Mediterranean culture, that of the rural drama reflected in 'Jofroi' (1933), 'Angele' (1934)* and 'Regain/Harvest' (1937). These melodramas were grounded in the same archaic patriarchal values as the trilogy, but they swapped theatricality for location shooting and have been recognised as influential on neo-realism.\" Reference: Ginette Vincendeau. The companion to French cinema. BFI Publishing, 1996. *=Held in our collection.  Credits: Director, writer, Marcel Pagnol ; photography, Willy ; music, Arthur Honegger. Cast: Gabriel Gabrio, Fernandel, Orane Demazis, Edouard Delmont, Marguerite Moreno, Robert Le Vigan."
