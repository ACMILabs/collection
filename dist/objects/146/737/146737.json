        "Lola, a cabaret singer and dancer in Nantes, tries to choose between three men, two of them being sailors. Dedicated to Max Ophuls, Demy's film has the circular construction, long tracking shots and frothiness to remind us of the dedicatee, but it owes as much to 'On the Town' with its sailors on leave, chance encounters and fleeting love affairs. Lola, a lyrical poem to Nantes and the cabaret artiste played by Anouk Aimee, shared some of the aesthetic concerns of the New Wave (although Demy was not strictly part of it): location shooting, exhuberant mise-en-scene - especially stunning camerawork by Raoul Coutard - and love for the American cinema.\" Reference: Ginette Vincendeau. \"The Companion to French Cinema\" London: BFI Publishing, 1995 Awards: Grand Prix de l'Academie du Cinema, 1961.  Credits: Producers, Georges de Beauregard, Carlo Ponti ; director, Jacques Demy ; writer, Jacques Demy ; photography, Raoul Coutard ; music, Marguerite Monnot, W.A. Mozart, J.S. Bach, Michel Legrand, Ludwig van Beethoven. Cast: Anouk Aimee, Marc Michel, Elina Labourdette, Alan Scott, Margo Lion."
