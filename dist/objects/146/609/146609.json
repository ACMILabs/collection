Frightened by the German army entering Montauban, he asks his friend Francois to drive his wife and daughter to a back country village where Julien owns an old castle. One week later, Julien decides to go and join his family for the week end, but the Germans are already occupying the village. On his way to the house, Julien discovers the corpses of the villagers in the church, then, further away, the charred bodies of his daughter and his wife. He vows to personally kill every one of the Germans responsible in order to assuage his grief.
