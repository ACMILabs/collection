        "Paris, 1962. Rego Boccara is back from a tour of duty in Algeria and attempts to revive his singing career. His agent, Nadia, must help him fight the animosity of Firmani, an influent music-hall owner, who has vowed never to allow Rego back on stage. Meanwhile, Antoine, Rego's younger brother, is marking time at the local high school, until the day he meets the new music teacher. This 'coming of age' drama is a faithful portraiture of France and its youth culture in the early 1960s.
