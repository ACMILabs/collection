        "Meeting at King's Cross rail station one day, ex student housemates and friends Hannah and Annie, are reunited after six years apart for a weekend o apart. Annie, initially a painfully shy young woman with a noticeablef reminiscences. Initially hesitant around one another, as time progresses we are privy to their insecurities, loves and animosities, both past and present, that they shared together and skin condition has gained confidence as she has grown older. Hannah still has a quick tongue and will do anything to avoid the 'psychobabble' inflicted on her by people who attempt to understand her. Throughout the weekend they meet people who remind them of the events that have shaped their lives, awakening them to the realisation of where they've come from, and where they are headed.  Credits: Producer, Simon Channing-Williams ; director, writer, Mike Leigh ; photography, Dick Pope ; music, Marianne Jean-Baptiste ; editing Robin Sales. Cast: Katrin Cartlidge, Lynda Steadman, Mark Benton, Kate Byers, Andy Serkis."
