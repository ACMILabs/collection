        "This is a perversely hilarious comedy about one restless night (among many) in the fading life of ageing, over-sexed novelist, Clive Langham. Clive lives alone in a country mansion and spends his nights cursing his fate as he inserts suppositories, sits on the 'throne' and downs bottle after bottle of white wine. In his nightmare, the characters of his novel mix with his real life relatives. As Clive gathers his relatives around him for a final week-end and they attempt to nurse him back to life, he realises that they are not the monsters he perceived them to be.  Credits: Produces, Yves Gasser, Yves Renot, Klaus Hellwig ; director, Alain Resnais ; writers, David Mercer ; photography, Ricardo Aronovitch ; music, Miklos Rozsa ; art direction, Jacques Saulnier. Cast: Dirk Bogarde, Ellen Burstyn, John Gielgud, David Warner, Elain Stritch, Peter Arne."
