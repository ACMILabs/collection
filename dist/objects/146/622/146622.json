        "Helene is 8 months pregnant when she is abandoned by Frank, her companion. Lonely and desperate she boards the first train heading south. Aboard, she meets vineyard heir Bertrand Meyrand and his wife Patricia, also 8 months pregnant. During the night, the train is derailed. Bertrand and Patricia die during the accident. When Helene wakes up at the hospital, she realises that everyone mistakes her for Patricia, including Bertrand's parents who offer her shelter at their wine growing property. Helene settles uncomfortably in her new family, until the day Frank comes back to blackmail her. The plot is based on a story by Cornell Woolrich and was filmed twice before as 'No Man of Her Own' in 1932 and 1949 in the U.S.A. In 1996 it was remade again as the romantic comedy 'Mrs. Winterbourne'.
