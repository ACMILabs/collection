        "A distant planet fathoms the fears and memories buried in its observer's minds and externalises these into living beings. As a result an astronaut relives a doomed relationship with his lost wife. In the novel by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem, Tarkovsky found the elements of obsession and repetition he needed for access to his own life - science fiction as grandiloquent autobiographical text. (Adapted from a note by Patrick Strick, NFT, London). Also available on VHS.  Credits: Director, Andrei Tarkovsky ; script, Friedrich Gorenstein, Andrei Tarkovsky ; photography, Vadim Yusov ; music, Eduard Artemyev ; production designer, Mikhail Romadin ; editor, Ludmila Feganova. Cast: Natalya Bondarchuk, Donatas Banionis, Yuri Yarvet, Nikolai Grinko, Anatoly Solonitsyn. Note: Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem."
