        "Set in the early 1980s in a small village in south China, The Green Mountain of Bamboo tells the story of how a young woman stands up to oppose an arranged marriage by her father and eventually finds true love. Mr. Qin has two sons and a daughter who are all grown-ups now. The elder son is about to get married, which cost Mr. Qin a fortune. Mr. Qin listens to the matchmaker\u2019s advice and wants his daughter to marry a young man from a well-off family. However, Qin\u2019s daughter, Li Mei, is already in love with another man, Li Shangyou, whose family is quite poor. Li Mei asks her father to give Shangyou a chance, who promises to Qin that he will prepare enough money in three months to marry his daughter. Li Mei, Shangyou and Shangyou\u2019s mother all work hard day and night to make money for the marriage. Just by the time they had the money ready, Shangyou\u2019s mother fell sick but refused to use the money for her illness. Li Mei is moved and determined to marry Shangyou. However, Li Mei\u2019s father severely blames his daughter and forces her to marry the other man. Li Mei seeks support from the director of the Women\u2019s Association, who firmly stands on Li Mei\u2019s side. At Qin\u2019s elder son\u2019s wedding banquet, Li Mei disappears. Shangyou\u2019s mother finds a scarf of Li Mei and sends it to Qin, who is shocked and thought his daughter must have died. Qin regrets for what he did. However, it turned out that Li Mei didn\u2019t die but went to marry Shangyou with the support of the Women\u2019s Association.  Xiaoxiang Film Studio was established in 1958 when Chinese cinema was nationalized with the help of Soviet Union\u2019s experts. Formerly known as Hunan Film Studio, it changed to the current name in 1980. The film was made in the early 1980s when the economic reform was launched and a \u201cThought Liberation\u201d movement swept the whole country. This film can be understood as a politically-oriented film in the sense that it delivers a clear message to its audience that arranged marriage and mercenary marriage represent the feudal ideas and should be condemned.
