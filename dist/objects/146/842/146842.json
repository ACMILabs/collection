        "In Geneva, at the time of the Algerian War, a French secret agent, on a mission to kill a top man in the FLN, finds himself used as a pawn by both sides. Filmed in 1960, Godard's second feature film was banned by the French government and released, with minor cuts, in 1963 because of its ambivalent attitude to the Algerian War  and its reflection of brutality on both sides. Other reasons might have been its matter of fact filming of torture and the treatment of the political crisis as a confusing gangster movie.  Credits: Producer, Georges de beauregard ; director, Jean-Luc Godard ; writer, Jean-Luc Godard ; photography, Raoul Coutard ; music, Maurice Le Roux. Cast: Michel Subor, Anna Karina, Henri-Jacques Huet, Laszlo Szabo, Mohamed Messoussa."
