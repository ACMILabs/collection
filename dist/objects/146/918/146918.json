        "The wife of a rich building contractor, beginning to tire of being merely a social asset to her husband, finds an outlet by running an art gallery and taking a lover. In the end, she sacrifices both men for her independence. White sports cars, cocktail parties, an art gallery, a recording studio, modern skyscrapers, jazz and Bach on the soundtrack and quick, slick cross-cutting, give Astruc's contribution to the 'Nouvelle Vague' an over-riding air of chic. In this film Astruc is also influenced by Japanese filmmaker Mizoguchi ('Tales of a Pale Moon After the Rain') for whom he had great admiration.  Credits: Producer, Leopold Schlosberg ; director, Alexandre Astruc ; writers, Alexandre Astruc, Claude Brule ; photography, Marcel Grignon ; music, Richard Cornu, Jean-Sebastien Bach ; art direction ; Jacques Saulnier. Cast: Annie Girardot, Christian Marquand, Daniel Gelin, Michele Girardon, Michele Gerbier."
