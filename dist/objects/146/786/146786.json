        "In a fairytale kingdom, the King swore to his dying wife that he will not remarry unless his new wife was as beautiful as she. Thus, he is compelled to wed his own daughter. The fairy godmother tries to save the girl from this incestuous fate by telling her to make impossible demands for her wedding gifts. One such demand is for the skin of a magic donkey who serves as the King's banker. Demy's homage to 'Snow White' and 'Beauty and the beast' suffers at times from very a kitsch art direction. It has, with time, achieved cult status in France and become a family favourite.  Credits: Producer, Philippe Dussart ; director, Jacques Demy ; writer, Jacques Demy ; photography, Ghislain Cloquet ; music, Michel Legrand. Cast: Catherine Deneuve, Jacques Perrin, Jean Marais, Delphine Seyrig, Micheline Presle, Fernand Ledoux, Pierre Repp, Sacha Pitoeff, Henri Cremieux, Sylvain Corthet."
