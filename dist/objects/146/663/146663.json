        "Claude, an impoverished music teacher, lives a life of boredom in a small provincial town. His lovely young neighbour seems smitten, but he has little time for her. Each sound he hears or every person he meets begets a new fancy. He dreams himself a conquering hero, a musketeer, or a soldier of the French Revolution, but always the conquerer of delicious women. The conflict between waking and dream worlds leads to amusing, strange, even fantastic situations. Which world will prevail?
