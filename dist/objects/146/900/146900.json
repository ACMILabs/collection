        "This performance of 'Fidelio', Beethoven's only opera was recorded at the antique theatre of Orange (France). The 'Philharmonic Orchestra of Israel' is conducted by Zubin Mehta, with the 'New Philharmonia' choir of London. The stage direction is by Alfred Lipmann. The performance is introduced by an extract from 'Napoleon et la Revolution' directed by Abel Gance. 'Fidelio' was composed in reaction to the shattered hopes of the French Revolution and Napoleon's encroaching grip over Europe. It is a classic love story in which liberty and justice triumph of oppression and tyranny thanks to the steely resolve of love.  Credits: Producers, Daniele Gegauff, Stephane Tchalgadjieff ; director, Pierre Jourdain ; photography, Michel Kelber. Cast: Gundula Janovitz, Jon Vickers, Theo Adam."
