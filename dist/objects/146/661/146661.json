        "It all starts with the bold murder of a well-heeled Frenchman. Commissaire Carella assigned to the case is most puzzled for there seems to be no motive. Then an old man and an astrologer are killed in exactly the same way, leaving the detective to figure out how the three disparate victims are linked. All he has to go on is a mysterious diary given to him by the step daughter of the first victim and containing a list of the man's lovers.  Credits: Producers, Jacques-Eric Strauss ; director, Philippe Labro ; writers, Philippe Labro, Jacques Lanzmann ; photography, Jean Penzer ; music, Ennio Morricone. Cast: Jean-Louis Trintignant, Dominique Sanda, Sacha Distel, Carla Gravina, Erich Segal, Gilles Segal, Laura Antonelli, Paul Crauchet, Stephane Audran, Jean-Pierre Marielle."
