        "The development of railways in Britain encouraged an interest in milk-marketing hygiene. The purity of British milk today is the result of painstaking research since that time. immense care is taken in every aspect of milk marketing. Veterinary inspectors ensure that the cattle are disease free, and laboratory assistants supervise every stage of its journey. They examine the milk during transport, and through the automatic pasteurisation, bottling and sealing processes. Narrated by Ronald Baddiley."
