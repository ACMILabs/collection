        "Part one of a three-part television documentary series about architecture and the way we interact with it. The series focuses on the work of a number of Australian architects with diverse styles and philosophies. Through interviews with these architects and the people that occupy the houses and public buildings they have designed, the series investigates the passions, politics and creative vision that shape the final appearance of public and private spaces. Part one 'Keeping the Faith' focuses on the legacy of modernist architecture in Australia. Buildings featured include the Commonwealth Law Courts and Storey Hall in Melbourne, and private residences designed by Sean Godsell. Striking cinematography by Matt Temple brings these and many other examples of contemporary Australian architecture to life. With music by 'The Necks' and narration by David Wenham. An accompanying multimedia presentation to the series that features virtual tours of cutting-edge Australian architecture, transcripts and audio-visual slide show highlights of the programs can be found at: http://www.abc.net.au/architecture/default.html"
