        "At a village pony auction a Davey misses out on buying a pony which was purchased by the owner of a pony trekking stable. He gets a job at the stable looking after the pony 'Mischief' leading to the jealousy of other stable hands and his eventual wrongful sacking. When another young boy visiting the stable is thrown from the pony onto a quarry ledge, Davey and 'Mischief' try to rescue him before blasting commences at the quarry. Stars: Paul Frazer, Iain Burton, Adrianne Byrne, Michael Newport, Gina Malcolm, Gerald Sim, Colin Gordon, Bill Owen, Frieda Knorr, Charles Rea, Peter Porteous, Deidre Benner and Gerald Williams."
