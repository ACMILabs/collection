        "The film portrays \"lucky\" Joe, an electrician, in several hazardous situations, each potentially lethal. Joe's enthusiasm for providing power and tools to whoever should require them, or to do electrical repair work himself, is not equalled by his observance of the strict site safety rules with the result that he puts many others as well as himself into considerable danger."
