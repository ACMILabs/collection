        "The second part in Gregg Araki's 'Teen apocalypse' trilogy (\"Totally fucked up\" and \"Nowhere\" complete the trilogy), \"The Doom generation\" wryly proclaims itself in its opening credits as being a 'heterosexual movie', then boldly proceeds to be anything but. This deliriously violent road movie chronicles the doomed adventures of nihilistic trio Amy (Rose McGowan), Jordan (James Duval) and Xavier (Jonathon Schaech), who unwittingly become outlaws after a botched and bloody convenience store robbery. The three hit the road and along the way journey into the dark recesses of the American psyche, which is populated by senseless violence, right wing fascists, and surreal urban landscapes. Considered to be one of the main purveyors of 'Queer cinema', Araki's bleak vision of bored and aimless youth is not without pleasure, reveling in acidic one liners, offbeat pop culture cameo's, an abundance of sex, and a gleeful disrespect for the American mainstream. Cast includes Parker Posey, Heidi Fleiss, Cress Williams, Dustin Nguyen, Margaret Cho, Christopher Knight, Perry Farrell and Amanda Bearse."
