        "This Italian-Turkish co-production is the story of a successful Italian businessman, Francesco, who goes to Istanbul to settle the estate of his estranged Aunt. In Turkey he encounters his Aunt's surrogate family and decides to stay on in Istanbul and restore an old hamam (Turkish bath). Francesco finds that not only is he attracted to the generosity of his new \"family\", he also finds himself sexually attracted to the son, Mehmet. When his wife Marta arrives from Italy they find themselves locked in a bitter exchange that strips bare the lies and evasions that underpin their marriage. For both Marta and Francesco, the city of Istanbul - half European, half Asian - comes to symbolise a freedom, a romance and a community that is no longer available in the fast-paced materialistic culture of Western Europe. And for both of them, with the destruction of their marriage and the intervention of violent tragedy, they discover themselves recreating the Aunt's original exile. Filmed in location in Istanbul, this is the first film of Turkish director Ferzan Ozpetac. Cast includes Allessandro Gassman and Francesca d'Aloja. In Italian and Turkish with English subtitles. (Awards: Winner of two Golden Globe Awards for Best First Film and for Best Musical Score)"
