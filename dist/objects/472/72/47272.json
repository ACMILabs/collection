        "The Port Arlington steam flour mill was opened in 1857 and closed in 1874. This film was shot during the early stages of the National Trust's project to reconstruct the mill showing volunteers excavating the boiler house area. The supervising architect and archaeologist take a reporter on a brief tour of the historic building providing an explanation of artifacts uncovered during the excavation; structural and architectural features; a brief history of the mill; and an outline of the restoration project."
