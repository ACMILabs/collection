        "One day in September is a tense and vivid account of the 1972 Munich Olympics, where a group of Israeli athletes were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group, Black September. Director Kevin Macdonald revisit's the volatile situation through archival news footage and interviews with family members of the victims, Olympic officials and the only surviving member of the Black September group, Jamal Al Gashey. Starting on a rather ironic 70's travelog of Munich, the documentary rapidly pieces together the tentative political climate at the time, cumulating in the eventual media circus surrounding the kidnappings and the ill conceived rescue mission mounted by the Munich police. Narrated by Michael Douglas. (Awards: Academy award, Best Feature Documentary 2000)"
