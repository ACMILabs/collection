        "Part three of a three-part television documentary series about architecture and the way we interact with it. The series focuses on the work of a number of Australian architects with diverse styles and philosophies. Through interviews with these architects and the people that occupy the houses and public buildings they have designed, it investigates the passions, politics and creative vision that shape the final appearance of public and private spaces. Part three 'Corrugated Dreams', asks if there is a style of architecture that can be described as identifiably Australian. It looks at the work of architects like Harry Seidler and Glenn Murcutt which has often been regarded as conveying an Australian sensibility, as well that of architects who have reacted against the notion of an Australian style. Striking cinematography by Matt Temple brings the many examples of contemporary Australian architecture shown to life. With music by 'The Necks' and narration by David Wenham. An accompanying multimedia presentation to the series that features virtual tours of cutting-edge Australian architecture, transcripts and audio-visual slide show highlights of the programs can be found at: http://www.abc.net.au/architecture/default.html"
