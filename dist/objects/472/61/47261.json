        "Part two of a three-part television documentary series about architecture and the way we interact with it. The series focuses on the work of a number of Australian architects with diverse styles and philosophies. Through interviews with these architects and the people that occupy the houses and public buildings they have designed, it investigates the passions, politics and creative vision that shape the final appearance of public and private spaces. Part two 'The Public Good', looks at the forces at work behind the realisation of public spaces and buildings in our cities. It features the work of the firm Denton/Corker/Marshall who designed the Citylink gateway in Melbourne, and focuses on the controversies surrounding the East Circular Quay building on Sydney's foreshore, and Federation Square in Melbourne. Striking cinematography by Matt Temple brings the many examples of contemporary Australian architecture shown to life. With music by 'The Necks' and narration by David Wenham. An accompanying multimedia presentation to the series that features virtual tours of cutting-edge Australian architecture, transcripts and audio-visual slide show highlights of the programs can be found at: http://www.abc.net.au/architecture/default.html"
