        "Venice in 1866: Italy is soon to be freed of Austrian occupation. An older woman, a countess in a loveless marriage sacrifices her position, her honour and her principles for the love of a cynical Austrian officer. Livia's full-blown romanticism drives her into isolation and near-madness and destroys Franz, the embittered romantic. Visconti's special blend of the operatic and the realistic reflects his double focus as an aristocrat and Marxist on Italian history (the Risorgimento), continued in \"The Leopard\" in a subtler, more realistic mode. Cast includes Alida Valli, Farley Granger, Heinz Moog, Rina Morelli, and Massimo Girotti. Based on the novella by Camillo Boito. In French with English subtitles."
