        "The veiled women of the Middle East have provided a constant source of fascination for Western culture over the years. The hijab (veil) has come to represent a number of conflicting issues, namely the oppression of Muslim women, the notion of the exotic \"other\", and the tensions existing between Eastern and Western values. This insightful and thought-provoking documentary focuses on a group of women in North America who choose to wear the hijab for reasons relating to identity, religion and politics. Rebelling against the fragmented images of women presented through the Western media, these women reveal the complex ideologies behind the veil while simultaneously throwing down a challenge to those - both from the East and West - who would try to oppress them."
