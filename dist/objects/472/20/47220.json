        "This is an intricate and engrossing documentary on the versatile composer, Lalo Schefrin. His philosophy and thoughts form the commentary. The ideas for many of Mr Schefrin's works come from natural sounds. His interests find expression in experimental music, jazz, music for films and television, and music for the concert stage. He is also seen working on a string quartet, rehearsing and discussing its interpretation with the group, and attending its performance."
