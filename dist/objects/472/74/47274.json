        "Victoria's Castlemaine market was restored by the National Trust in the early 70's. This film records segments of the opening ceremony speeches by Victorian Premier Rupert Hamer, Australia's Governor General John Kerr and a representative from the National Trust. Includes interior and exterior footage of the restored market and part of a photographic exhibition tracing the history of the market and the region. NB: The first five minutes and the last two minutes of the film has a magnetic soundtrack. The segment in-between is silent."
