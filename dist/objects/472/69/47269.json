        "A careful portrayal of the ceremonies in which a Jewish youth confirms his faith. An honored estate, Bar Mitzvah - the coming of age - follows several years of study of the Hebrew language, scriptures and customs. Through the film we realize the seriousness with which boys prepare for the ritual that ushers them into the full obligations and privileges of their faith."
