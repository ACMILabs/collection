        "Episode of Series \"The Researchers\". At the present level of coal usage a mountainous 15 million tonnes of waste is left behind every year after the coal is washed. Most of the waste is a coarse coal-bearing shale which is dumped in slag heaps. A program to reduce and utilise the waste from coal washeries has come up with far-reaching economic possibilities. The film looks at these possibilities."
