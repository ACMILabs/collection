        "Shows efforts by the British government to maintain production during the war. Many working men and women were required to relocate to factories away from their home town to support the changing production demands of war. Recognising that the health, safety and welfare of workers was critical to victory, various programs were implemented to assist relocated workers. These varied from locating suitable accommodation, providing health services and ensuring that recreational activities were available to workers during their leisure time. New lighting and ventilation designs were also introduced into factories to compensate for the conditions caused by the blackouts that were enforced during aerial attacks."
