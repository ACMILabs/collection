        "This skilful documentary follows Jeff Solow, a young celloist of great promise. The film focuses on his drive to become an accomplished musician. We see him playing professionally although still in college, composing and practising a cadenza, in rehearsal with an orchestra, and on the night of the performance at which he is soloist. His thoughts and observations about music form the commentary."
