        "Jeannette Winterson adapted the screenplay for this BBC television series from her semi-autobiographical best-selling novel of the same name. The series follows the story of Jess (Charlotte Coleman), a young girl, and her relationships with her adoptive mother - an outrageously fanatical Evangelist; the church - including an equally devout pastor and flock; and the people of her small township in Northern England. In accordance with her mother's wishes, Jess is set to train as a missionary. However, when her relationship with local girl, Melanie, is exposed as more than friendship, ensuing tensions propel Jess' arduous journey of self-discovery on a more difficult and changed trajectory than she had planned. The story of Jess' hardwon escape from the township is treated with both tragedy and black humour. This series won three BAFTA awards including Best Serial and Best Actress."
