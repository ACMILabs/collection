        "A cult classic of the post-punk era, \"Liquid Sky\" is a bizarre and erotic subversion of the science-fiction film. Set in the New York New Wave fashion milieu, the story concerns a group of aliens that have landed upstairs from fashion model Margaret (Anne Carlisle). The aliens are in search of pure heroin which they need for their biological survival, but while on earth they become addicted to the chemicals secreted by the brain during orgasm. Margaret, who is pursued constantly by men and women, becomes the pivotal conduit for the space creatures' addiction but, unfortunately for Margaret, the use the aliens make of her body results in the death of her lovers. Wickedly perverse in its delight in the rituals and pleasures of addiction, aptly identifying the paranoias and fears attached to sex with the onslaught of the AIDS epidemic, and cruelly bitchy about the New York art and fashion worlds, \"Liquid Sky\" is a visionary precursor to the New Queer Cinema of the 1990s. It is directed by Russian emigre director, Slava Tsukerman, and features an inventive original electronic music score by Tsukerman, Brenda Hutchinson and Clive Smith."
