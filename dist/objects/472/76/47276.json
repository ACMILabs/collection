        "A fact-based drama about Valerie Solanas, the lesbian feminist writer who achieved her fifteen minutes of fame after shooting Manhattan pop artist/guru Andy Warhol in 1968. Solanas was a peripheral figure in Warhol's Factory studio scene in New York during the late Sixties, and the founder and sole member of her 'Society for Cutting Up Men' (SCUM). Her SCUM manifesto has since become a feminist classic. The film focuses on her troubled life, as broke, homeless and psychologically unstable she turns to begging and prostitution to survive. Convinced that Warhol's support could change her life, she becomes violently enraged when the artist and his friends begin to turn away from her. Cast includes Lili Taylor, Stephen Dorff and Jared Harris."
