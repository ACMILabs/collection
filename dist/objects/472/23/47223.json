        "Aside from serving as the nation's capital, Tokyo is an industrial centre that boasts the manufacture of virtually every conceivable type of product. It also faces such typical urban problems as pollution and overcrowding, as well as its unique and chaotic system of unnumbered streets. This film is about the O-ga family who live in one of Tokyo's immediate suburbs. It follows the family's routine on a typical weekday including Mr O-ga motorbiking his way to the small factory where he is employed as a draftsman-technician. Like Mr O-ga, thousands of Japanese are heading for Tokyo and its environs, creating a massive commuter crush. At six o'clock, the work day ends. Mr O-ga returns to his modest home, the evening meal served Japanese-fashion at a low table, and television. Although many western influences are clearly visible in Tokyo, its people have not relinquished their most favoured traditions."
