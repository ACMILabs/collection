        "Hyper excitability is invariably the symptom of the Phalaris Staggers in the acute phase. Generalised muscular tremors, rapid bobbing of the head, and lack of coordination in gait are also characteristic. This record of these outward symptoms was filmed at an experimental area at Brecon, in South Australia, between July and August, 1953."
