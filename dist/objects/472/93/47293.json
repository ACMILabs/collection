        "Between two and four hundred million dollars are spent in Australia each year on replacing metal equipment work by abrasion, impact and erosion. One way of preventing wear is by coating metal components with wear-resistant alloys. The choice of the appropriate alloy is based on a thorough understanding of its performance in particular situations and the influence of temperature and corrosive environments on it."
