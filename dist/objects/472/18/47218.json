        "Every night in Britain, thirty million letters go through the post. This film shows the processes behind the safe delivery of this mail with emphasis on the travelling post office, and sorting, transport and delivery from Euston Station. The film also sees the service from the postman's point of view, whether at work in the Outer Hebrides or on a daily round in London."
