        "Sheep grazing freshly shooting \"Phalaris tuberosa\" particularly following the break of dry season, often develop neurological disorders commonly known a \"Phalaris Staggers\". The outward manifestations of the disease have been recorded in two films intended for veterinary officers. A complete lack of muscular coordination is obvious in all chronically affected sheep observed during an outbreak of the disease in the southeast of South Australia, in October 1951. Knees and fetlocks either remain flexed or tend to buckle under, and sheep move about with a propping gait on their knees. Exertion or agitation leads to respiratory distress."
