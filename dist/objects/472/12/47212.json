        "Set in the 1950's in New Zealand, this film is based on a true story that shocked the nation at the time. New arrival Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) quickly befriends the quiet Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) at their conservative school in Christchurch. Although their backgrounds are very different, the two girls are both creative and intelligent writers, and form a close friendship which gradually becomes more and more obsessive. Together, they create a fantasy world peopled by characters who become very real for both of them. Their parents are increasingly disturbed by the obsessive nature of their relationship, and take steps to separate them. This leads to the girls plotting a horrendous crime to ensure they remain together."
