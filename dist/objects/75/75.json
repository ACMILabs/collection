    "description": [
        "A powerful examination of the determined spirits who compete in the Double Dutch rope-jumping championships in New York City. In this raw work, both the camera and the microphone have the incidental presence of a trusted insider. Moving between the training and the competition, Blumberg manages to capture the excitement of the crowd, as young athletes drive themselves and their partners to the edge of the possible. The rhythmic beat of the ropes, the chants, and the strain of concentration, taps into an unexpected well of emotion through which we seem to be almost participants in the event itself."
