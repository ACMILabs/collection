        "Rudolph Valentino is Juan Gallardo, a poor boy who realises his ambition to become one of Spain's greatest matadors. When he marries his childhood sweetheart it seems as if his dreams will be fulfilled, but he soon falls prey to a seductress. Ultimately, Gallardo is defeated as much by his own conduct as by the events in the arena. This Valentino feature prompted a series of films about bullfighters, however it is this film which sees Valentino at his \"scorching\" best."
