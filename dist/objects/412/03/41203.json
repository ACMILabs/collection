        "Urquhart is determined to remain in power longer than Margaret Thatcher but as that time approaches, his hold on the poltical ladder is not as firm. Tom Makepeace, the Foreign Secretary is likely to be his successor and is encouraged by his mistress to challenge the leadership. Urquhart's past is threatening to overtake him but he and his wife are determined that his years as the Prime Minister will end in glory, not defeat. Ian Richardson is superb as Francis Urquhart in a compelling performance and this finale to the Urquhart story is both gripping and dramatic."
