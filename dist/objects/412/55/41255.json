        "The dropping of the second atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Nagasaki, effectively ended the Second World war. In this program, the events and arguments surrounding this event are examined in detail. The decision by the United States to drop the bomb was influenced by many factors, and these are examined from the perspectives of politicians, military personnel, eye-witnesses and historians. The atomic bomb had a devastating impact and changed the nature of war forever. This program is accompanied by Teacher's Notes."
