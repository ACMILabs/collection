        "Beyond the mind's eye offers a compilation of computer animation from around the world. The emphasis is on psychodelic fantasy and \"gee wiz\" special effects, with original music by Jan Hammer. The viewer is taken on a surreal voyage that explores imaginative visions of a technological future, the outer reaches of the universe and alternate dimensions filled with colour and movement."
