        "Nikita (Anne Parillaud) is a junkie psychopath who gets life imprisonment for shooting a cop while she's high on drugs. Whilst in prison she is given a second chance at life when she is asked to become an undercover agent for the French secret service. Within three years, after gruelling training, Nikita emerges as a superspy, a highly trained assassin, who kills effectively and emotionlessly until she falls in love ... and then her world begins to crumble. Filmed with an adrenelin speed by Besson and shot in elegant colour by Thierry Arbogats, \"Nikita\" is a stylish thriller that breathed new life into the spy genre by its audacious use of style and art direction. From its tense beginning to the rivetting climax, \"Nikita\" is a non-stop rollercoaster."
