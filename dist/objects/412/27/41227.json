        "Based on Alan Duff's controversial best seller, \"Once Were Warriors\" is an intense and powerful film that leaves audiences stunned with its uncompromising insight into the strength of Maori culture in the face of degrading urban ghettos and devastating family violence. Jake (Temuera Morrison) and Beth (Rena Owen) have been married 18 years and she still finds him irresistible. Jake is a muscular, handsome man who exudes an explosive sexual energy but spends most of the time at the pub, often proving his masculinity with his fists and regularly exploding into rages that leave terrible scars on Beth and their family."
