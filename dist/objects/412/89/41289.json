        "Over a gleaming icefiled and up steep cliffs of bare rock, the camera follows members of the Alpine Club of Canada. Before they set out we are introduced to the climbers' basic equipment and learn the uses of rope and ice axe. Excitement mounts as the Alpinists leap gaping chasms and drag themselves up sheer walls of rock. At the top, they pause for a view over the sea of mountains surrounding their own vanquished peak. Narrated by Lorne Greene."
