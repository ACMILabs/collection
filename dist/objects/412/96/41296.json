        "Buster goes to college and becomes sports obsessed when his lady love considers him less than manly. Spending a fortune on every imaginable piece of sporting apparatus, Buster is determined to muscle his way into her affections. This film is representative of Keatons madcap antics and incredible stunts with a grand comic finale which will leave the audience reeling."
