        "Al Pacino gives one of the screen's great performances as Frank Serpico, a young New York cop, who is appalled by the bribery and corruption in Police Departments. Serpico refuses the many bribes which are offered him and in doing so finds himself disowned and outlawed by his colleagues to such a degree that their hostility almost costs him his life. His lone fight against corruption ultimately leads to a full-scale enquiry into police crime. Based on the book by Waldo Salt."
