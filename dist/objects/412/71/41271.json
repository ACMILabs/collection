        "Susan Lambert's first feature film is a witty commentary on 90's relationships and lifestyles. Two close women friends spend a day together. Their frank and funny conversations reveal hidden desires, erotic secrets, painful confessions and a bizarre fantasy that has unexpected results. Angie Milliken as Stephanie and Victoria Longley as Julia capture the strengths and confusion of women in their 30's who mistakenly think they might want to trade lives. These women do not simply talk but, by the film's conclusion, are empowered by their mutual support and easy confidence to act as well. Co-starring Richard Roxburgh, Jacqueline McKenzie and John Jarratt."
