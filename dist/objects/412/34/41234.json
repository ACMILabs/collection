        "In the years before television, Australians flocked to the cinema to see the latest editions of the Cinesound and Movietone News. The three newsreels segments featured are the achievements of three famous Australians: Donald Bradman, Sir William Dobell and Les Darcy. \"The Don\" as he was affectionately known is regarded as one of the world's greatest cricketers. His uncanny skill with the bat thrilled audiences as the newsreel captured his exploits. Dobell was one of the most controversial Archibald Prize winners in Australia's art history, whilst Les Darcy, known as the \"Maitland Marvel\" was unbeatable in the boxing ring."
