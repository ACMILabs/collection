        "Relive the history of the Murray riverboats from the 1920s to the 1970s; from the declining cargo trade to their restoration for the resurgent tourist market. This documentary consists almost entirely of rare archival footage and reveals the people, places and memorable events of the Murray region's past. It includes original footage of many vessels which have been restored or earmarked for recommissioning such as the famous paddlesteamers Adelaide and Pevensey, and others which have long since disappeared."
