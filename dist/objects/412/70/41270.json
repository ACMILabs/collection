        "Insightful documentary that goes beyond the glamour of the big names to look at the unsung heroes of the opera: the men and women who comprise the chorus. The singers of the San Francisco Opera speak frankly about their lives, aspirations and their music. Their stories are funny poignant and inspiring. The \"behind the scenes\" footage is fascinating and enhances the picture of what it means to work as a performing artist for a major company such as the San Francisco Opera."
