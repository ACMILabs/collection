        "During World War II, Sandakan prisoner of war camp in British North Borneo held nearly 2,500 Allied prisoners. By war's end, only six survived. The story of the atrocities committed by the Japanese at Sandakan is one of the grimmest of the Pacific War. Shot in Australia, Malaysia and Japan, this documentary recounts the tragic story of prisoners of war and examines the legacy of these events for survivors and their families. Some of the images in this program may be disturbing to some viewers."
