        "Hotel Sorrento is the story of three sisters who grew up in a small Australian coastal town. One is a successful writer living in London, another a businesswoman in New York, while the third remained at the family home after the death of her husband. When they are reunited after years apart, not only are fond family memories rekindled, but the unspoken feelings and unresolved tensions of past betrayal resurface. When tragedy strikes, they not only confront old wounds but discover that their lives will never be the same again. Starring Caroline Goodall, Caroline Gillmer, Tara Morice and Joan Plowright. Co-starring Ray Barrett, Nicholas Bell, Ben Thomas and John Hargreaves. Based on the stage play of the same name by Hannie Rayson."
