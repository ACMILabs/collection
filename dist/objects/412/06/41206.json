        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Bush tucker man series\". Les Hiddins travels Australia-wide tracking down stories of survival in the wilderness. \"Gold Fever\" looks at the legend of Lasseter's lost reef of gold in Central Australia. \"The Passionate Prussian\" retraces Leichardt's exploration from Moreton Bay to Point Essington and the mystery which shrouds his disappearance. \"The Great Misadventure\" looks at the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition and how a knowledge of Bush Tucker may have changed the outcome. The final episode \"Into the Vilest Country\" features the Cape York Penninsula as Les travels to the area in a manner which contrasts that of the cumbersome Kennedy exploration."
