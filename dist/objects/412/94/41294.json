        "This classic silent film of the Victor Hugo novel is a masterpiece of film-making. Lon Chaney as the hunchback Quasimodo was grotesque and pathetic. The actor suffered for his art in a rubber suit weighing over seventy pounds. Dubbed \"The man of a thousand faces\", Chaney's portrayal of Quasimodo is not the only outstanding feature of this production. The set which took a year to build, the enormous cast of extras, adds to the epic grandeur of the film. Starring Brandon Hurst, Nigel De Brulier and Patsy Ruth Miller as Esmeralda."
