        "A selection of comedy sketches from the earliest years of one of Australia's most original and inventive comedy teams - the D Generation. Originally discovered at a Melbourne comedy venue by an ABC producer, this young team of Melbourne University students went on to produce some of the most unique and memorable moments in Australian comedy, including The Late Show, Fast Forward and Frontline. Screened on the ABC over 10 years ago this compilation contains the sketches: the awesome scope of \"The Making of Chisolm\", the baffling, enigmatic \"Yellow thing with hinges\", gasp at the fashions in \"Dag City\" and reminisce with \"Fart-Whistles\", \"The Tense Family\", \"Hijack Bloopers\", \"The Discoverers\", the classic \"Thunderbirds\" and much more. Featuring Santo Cilauro, Marg Downey, John Harrison, Rob Sitch, Magda Szubanski and Michael Veitch."
