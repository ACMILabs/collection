        "Set in a peasant village in the French countryside this delightful ballet tells the tale of the difficult path of young love. Widow Simone is determined to betroth her wilful daughter Lise to the eccentric son of a rich farmer, but Lise and her lover Colas conspire to thwart the widow's plans. Features the famous wooden clogs solo by Ray Powell and the ribbon pas de deux by the two main protagonists. This classic, funny and entertaining ballet was choreographed by the great Frederick Ashton and features Ray Powell as the widow Simone. Fiona Tonkin as Lise, David McAllister as Colas and the players are supported by the wonderful Australian Ballet Corps de ballet."
