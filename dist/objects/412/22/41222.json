        "A child is brought to an hospital emergency room with bruises that indicate possible abuse. This program addresses how to identify whether a crime has been committed, procedures emergency room personnel should follow upon admission of a child and how to approach the parents. The main characters are portrayed by experienced hospital staff and the program emphasises that help can be provided only if the interaction with the parents is handled with skill, support and empathy. Highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to assist the family and child."
