        "The Sundowners stars Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum as Paddy and Ida Carmody, migrant drovers who travel 400 miles of Australian outback with 1200 sheep. Despite their devotion to each other and their acceptance of the itinerant life, Ida and their son Sean yearn to settle down on a farm of their own. The Carmody's own drama is played out against the backdrop of Australia's startling landscapes; at one moment lush and green and in the next, stark and forbidding. This film is a a testamony to the keen eye of director Fred Zinnemann and the excellent performances of Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr. Based on the novel by Jon Cleary."
