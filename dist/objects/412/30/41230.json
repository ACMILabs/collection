        "This is the story of the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. Perhaps the most remarkable - certainly the most successful - book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor. The story of Arthur Dent, a seemingly normal Englishman whose ordinary life suddenly takes a startling turn one Thursday. A Thursday which becomes steadily more extraordinary when his buddy Ford Prefect imparts the terrible, hideous news: He's not from Earth and the Earth's going to be demolished in 12 minutes to make way for a new hyperspace bypass! This program brings to life once more the magic of the cult TV series."
