        "The 11th. St Laurent long distance cycling race with participants from 13 countries covers 1500 miles of the Quebec countryside in 12 days. From a distance, the cyclists are a moving colour frieze against the picturesque landscape; closer we see the taut faces and straining limbs of the competitiors above the bright circle of their machines."
