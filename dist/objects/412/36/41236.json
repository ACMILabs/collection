        "The Melbourne Juvenile Justice Centre was opened in December 1993 and replaced the outdated and inadequate Turana Youth Training Centre. It introduced a new approach to accomodating and rehabilitating young offenders completing sentences from the Victorian Court. This program shows efforts to break the circuit of offending by Client Service Planning and a strong emphasis on educational and vocational programs."
