        "Twelve year-old Cedric Erroll's world is turned upside down when, completely unexpectedly, a lawyer from London arrives with the news that he is the grandson and rightful heir to the vast lands and fortunes of the Earl of Dorincourt. So, Little Lord Fauntleroy and his mother leave their humble New York abode to live in a castle in England. However, he soon finds that money doesn't necessarily bring happiness. His bitter and often cruel grandfather refuses to allow Cedric's mother into his home. Starring Michael Benz as Cedric, George Baker of Inspector Wrexford fame as the Earl of Dorincourt and Betsy Brantley as Cedric's mother. A triumph of good over bad, the new world over the old, this timeless story has captured the hearts of both children and adults alike for generations. Based on the novel by Frances Hodges Burnett."
