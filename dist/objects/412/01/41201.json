        "Bruno Gunter, a 14 year-old boy from a German immigrant family grows up on a wheat farm in South Australia during the 1930's. Even though his father is strict and an advocate of hard work, Bruno finds plenty of mischief and adventure. He has to deal with a new school teacher, the feud between Jack Ryan and Hermann Heinz as well as coping with his family. This adaptation of Thiele's novels will delight the family as a byegone era is vividly recreated and a period of Australia's history and heritage is bought to life. Starring Jamie Croft as Bruno, Christian Kohlund as his father and Susan Lyons as his mother. Based on four novels written by Colin Thiele."
