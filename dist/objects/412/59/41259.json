        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Dancing in the street: a rock and roll history\". Whole lotta shakin examines the grass roots beginnings of rock and roll. In New Orleans, Afro-american performers like Little Richard were unleashing a new type of music which echoed through the Mississippi Delta into Sam Phillips' Studio in Memphis. What was predominantly Afro-american music became \"legitimised\" commercially when singers like Elvis Presley emulated this energetic form of music. \"R.E.S.P.E.C.T\": Motown and Stax records paved the way for legendary Afro-american singers to become successful in their own right. Aretha Franklin was the Queen of Soul, but artists like Ray Charles, Martha Reeves, Otis Redding and the Supremes also made their mark as rock and roll legends."
