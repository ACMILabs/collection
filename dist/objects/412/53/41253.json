        "Through the lives of five older Australians, this program explores the Commonwealth Governments' new directions for aged care services. The services featured include Home & Community Care services that allow people to remain in their own homes, the Geriatric Assessment Teams that assist individuals and their families in making informed choices and then co-ordinate the services, and a new range of choices for hostels and nursing homes. Discusses programs that address special needs such as those of older migrants. Narrated by June Salter."
