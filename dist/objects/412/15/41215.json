        "Chronicles the events of the Shoah (Holocaust) as witnessed by those who survived. This documentary combines archival footage with the survivor's personal testamonies and photographs, describing life in pre-war Europe, the devastating impact of Nazism, the liberation of the concentration camps and life fifty years later. The impact of the survivor's stories prompted Steven Spielberg to establish Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a non-profit project to videotape tens of thousands of these personal accounts and make them available for education worldwide."
