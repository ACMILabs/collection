        "Episode number 9 of Series \"From spirit to spirit (A)\". In 1960 the remains of an Aboriginal woman were exhumed at Lake Mungo, NSW by the white anthropologist/archaeologist, Alan Thorne. The woman had been cremated at least 25,000 years ago, providing the first evidence of this practice, and evidence for elaborate funerary customs by Aborigines in pre-historic times. The remains were exhibited around the world, before being returned to the Aborigines in 1990. This program takes a look at this incident from an Aboriginal perspective."
