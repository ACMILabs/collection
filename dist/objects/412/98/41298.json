        "Possibly one of the wittiest and sophisticated films ever made by Hollywood, \"All About Eve\" is a bitchy and sharp comedy about the jealousies and rivalries of theatrical life. Bette Davis, in one of her greatest performances, is Margo Channing, a self-obsessed, driven and committed actress who is shadowed and wooed by an aspiring starlet, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). However, the shy Eve is not as naive as she appears and by the end of the film she is moving to replace Margo and the poisonous cycle of ego and ambition is about to repeat itself. Wonderful adult dialogue, great direction and a cast of excellent supporting actors at their peak (George Sanders, Thelma Ritter, Celeste Holm) makes this movie one of the most entertaining ever produced. Watch out for Marilyn Monroe in an early cameo. Winner of six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Costumes by Edith Head. When they talk about the Golden Years of Hollywood this is one of the films to which they refer."
