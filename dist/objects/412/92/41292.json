        "This is one of the classic screwball comedies of its time. An heiress (Carole Lombard), hires a butler (William Powell) after finding him on a scavenger hunt. She and her family are under the impression that he is a tramp without a job. He decides to teach \"High Society\" that money isn't everything, and in the tradition of screwball comedy gets his girl as well as making his point. The film was unsuccessful at the Academy Awards despite six nominations but remains one of the best of its genre. Based on the novel by Eric Hatch."
