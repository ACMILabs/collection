        "Ian Richardson is chilling in his portrayal of the now Prime Minister, Francis Urquhart. Determined to keep his power intact, Urquhart is challenged by the new King; a man with liberal ideals which set him on a collision course with the Prime Minister. Although Urquhart upholds the principles of the monarchy, he does not respect the man and therefore plans to topple him from his throne. Aided by a beautiful and cunning political assistant and egged on by his scheming wife, Urquhart is determined to remain the man pulling the strings."
