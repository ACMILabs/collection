        "Rev up your dune buggies and return to the Banana Pad for one last stand with the crazy Banana Splits - Fleegle, Bingo, Drooper and Snorky! Experience the first three episodes of this groovy 1960s children's entertainment show. Tune in for your fix of psychedelic performance clips from the Splits and get the vibes from the original cartoons - \"The Arabian Knights\", \"The Three Musketeers\" and the live-action \"Danger Island\" starring Jan-Michael Vincent. Far out!"
