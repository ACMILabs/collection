        "For those people who loved listening to The Goons on the radio, this video is definitely for you. For the BBC's 50th anniversary in 1972,the archives delivered three coffins before a destinguished audience at the Camden Theatre, London. They contained three men of entertainment history. Spike Milligna, the well-known typing error, script-writer and voice of Eccles, Moriarty, Little Jim and Minnie Peter Sellers, alias Major Bloodnok, Bluebottle, and Henry Crun, practising his comeback by whistling a soliloquy from Hamlet. Harry Secombe, bald, toothless, Welsh and weighing 37 stone, the brains and the brawn behind Neddy Seagoon, dressed in a floral cretonne frock. The Goons take their final bow, in their last performance after 12 years of silence. From 1952-1960, The Goon Show spawned a cult of quickfire humour as radios' most influential clowns, driven by an inspired lunacy which wrenched conventional comedy into a new era. Preserved on video as a lasting tribute to their genius, the combined manic brilliance of Milligan, Sellers and Secombe is as fresh and funny today as it was yesterday."
