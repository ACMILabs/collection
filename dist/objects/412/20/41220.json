        "Fred Schepisi is one of the most inventive and succcessful film directors Australia has produced. This documentary features in depth interviews with Fred which reveal an articulate, unpretentious, easy going and hardworking filmmaker. The interviews are illustrated with extracts from his movies: The Devil's Playground, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, Barbarosa, The Ice Man, Plenty, Roxanne, Evil Angels, The Russia House, Mr. Baseball and Six Degrees of Separation. This documentary uses a clever mix of interview, reunion with colleagues and excerpts from his films to give a complete impression of a larger than life director and his craft."
