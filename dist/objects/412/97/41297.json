        "The \"Three Colours\" trilogy is loosely inspired by the ideals of the French Revolution: Blue for freedom, Red for fraternity and White for equality. White also represents the hero's marriage, the Polish winter and an alabaster bust that threads through the narrative, its significance unexplained. Karol is a Polish hairdresser in Paris. When his French wife divorces him he is left without money or possessions, except for a suitcase full of diplomas, a comb and a paper. A compatriot smuggles him home and his luck improves. Things have changed in the new democratic Poland. Janos becomes a successful businessman but must still resolve his relationship with his wife. Polish and French dialogue with English subtitles. Winner of the Silver Bear award for Best Director, Berlin, 1994."
