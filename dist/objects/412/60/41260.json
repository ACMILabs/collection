        "A furiously energetic short film about young homeless people who spend a night in emergency accommodation. They are bored and decide to search for some speed. When their efforts prove fruitless one of them decides that maybe a dose of vegemite might to the trick! With an excellent young cast and tight scripting, \"Happy Little Vegemites\" manages to be both comic, and in the scenes between the naive Gerard and the streetwise Chad, effectively touching. Features an excellent music track including Radiohead, Beasts of Bourbon and Rebecca's Empire. Be warned, vegemite may never look the same again!"
