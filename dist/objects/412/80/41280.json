        "Episode number 11 of Series \"From spirit to spirit (A)\". This program focuses on the work of four Elders from a North American Indian tribe in Canada, who were survivors of the prison system. After leaving the reserves, it is not uncommon for those who had made the move to the city, to become caught in a vicious cycle within the criminal justice system. The Elders attempt to work with young offenders using their own experiences and knowledge of the traditional way of life, to educate the young people into developing a sense of self worth and hopefully prevent them from becoming caught in a similar cycle."
