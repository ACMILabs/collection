        "'Music for Airports' is a visual counterpoint to the 1978 recording of the same name by Brian Eno, which explored the idea of background or ambient music. Designed to be played at low volume, Eno's music uses minimal elements of melody and rhythm, which are layered and looped, denying a sense of progression or conclusion. The music infiltrates and influences the general soundscape without dominating it. Scheffer exploits the qualities for which video is often condemned, creating glowing and fluid images by using inexact focus, 'ghosting' of moving figures and bleeding colour. He describes the results as 'the emancipation of blur'. Frank Scheffer has indicated that this video was designed to be one of many elements in the overall visual environment."
