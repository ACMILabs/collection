        "A joint Greek and American production based on Euripedes' play \"The Trojan women\". Katharine Hepburn is Hecube, the wife of King Priam; Vanessa Redgrave is Andromache, the widow of Hector; Genevieve Bujold is Cassandra, the cursed prophetess of Apollo and Trojan Princess and Irene Papas is the beautiful Helen of Troy. The victors of the Trojan war ransack the city and take as part of their spoils, the women and children. The play tells of their bitter struggle to survive the cruelty of defeat and capture."
