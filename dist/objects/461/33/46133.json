        "A frankly adult comedy about the sex lives of the rich and aimless, \"Shampoo\" is also a pointed commentary on the demise of the 60s idealism at the dawn of the Nixon era. It is election day, 1968, and Beverly Hills hairdresser George Roundy is too worried about attending to all of his womens' tonsorial and sexual needs and trying to swing a bank loan to fund his own salon to notice the fateful Presidential race. As George juggles the demands of girlfriend Jill and mistress Felicia, not to mention Felicia's daughter, he meets Felicia's husband - Lester, to get money for the salon and discovers that his beloved ex-girlfriend, Jackie is now Lester's mistress. Lester asks George to escort Jackie to a banquet for Nixon supporters, leading to a series of climactic confrontations at the dinner and a Hollywood orgy that exposes the conflicting demands of sex, love and security among these terminally narcissistic L.A. denizens. Cast includes: Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn, Lee Grant, Jack Warden and Carrie Fisher."
