        "Episode of Series \"Crossing Tracks Series\". Based on the Archie Weller short story, this film takes us on a journey into the discontented life of Melanie as she grapples with adolescence, rural isolation and life with her dysfunctional father. Her difficulties escalate when she is taken hostage by three young men for whom life has very little meaning and actions have no consequences. Essentially a rites of passage drama, both Melanie and her captors struggle to come to terms with assumptions of difference, indigenous and non-indigenous race relations, institutionalised injustice, and loss. Cast includes Alyssa McClelland, Peter Browne and Luke Caroll."
