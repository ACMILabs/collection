        "Set during the 1989 World Cup season when Ireland's national identity is intricately wrapped up in its sporting success, \"The Van\" follows the relationship of lifelong friends, Brendan (Bimbo) and Larry. Larry, long time unemployed and living on welfare, finds his professional friend Bimbo joining the ranks of the unemployed when he is retrenched. With the help of a dodgy associate, Bimbo purchases a dilapidated van and miraculously cleans it up to create the modest business enterprise of Bimbo's Burgers. He asks his best mate Larry to work for him, and soon Larry's daughter Diane and vegetarian son Kevin begin work with them to cater for the soccer, beach and concert crowds. As the pressure of working long hours, meeting stringent health regulations and Bimbo's dismay at Larry's work ethic weighs on them, Larry and Bimbo push the boundaries of their relationship, forcing them to choose between being partners and being friends. With a soundtrack by Eric Clapton, \"The Van\" is the final chapter in Roddy Doyle's Barrytown trilogy. Cast includes Colm Meaney, Donal O'Kelly, Neili Conroy and Ger Ryan."
