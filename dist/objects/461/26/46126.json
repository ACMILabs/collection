        "Widely regarded as Tarkovsky's finest film, this film charts the life of the great icon painter through a turbulent period of 15th Century Russian history, a period marked by endless fighting between rival Princes and by Tartar invasions. Made on an epic scale, it does not flinch from portraying the savagery of the time, from which, almost inexplicably, the serenity of Rublev's art arose. The great set-pieces - the sack of Vladimir, the casting of the bell, the pagan ceremonies of St. John's Night and the Russian crucifixion are tours-de-force of visceral film making. This is the most complete version of the film available and reported to be the director's cut. In Russian with English subtitles."
