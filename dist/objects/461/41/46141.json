        "As a man tries to sleep two animated mosquitoes buzz around him, attending to the business of blood sucking and fending off insect repellent in the process. A short film that effectively mixes live action with computer animation to convey the themes of global warming, the effect of chloro fluorocarbons and alternative therapy in brain surgery."
