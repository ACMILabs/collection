        "Episode of Series \"Crossing Tracks Series\". Harry, a Koorie, and Mitch, a non-Aboriginal Australian, are two mates who go off to fight in Papua New Guinea during the Second World War. Harry grows from a boy in uniform to a man in war. We watch as he learns of his impending death and how he faces it. 'Harry's War' is about when mateship transcends race, cultural differences and social barriers. It is a story of how war drives men to the brink and the journey becomes more important than the journey's end. Cast includes: David Ngoombujarra, Peter Docker, Glenn Shea, Bob Maza and Christina Saunders."
