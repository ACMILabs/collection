        "This is an intimate portrait of one of the century's greatest leaders told by those who have known and shared the more important moments of his life. However it is not just a narrative of Mandela's life, its purpose is to examine how Mandela has risen above his very public personal trials and kept his eye unflinchingly on a distant and noble goal. Mandela's life story and achievements are told through interviews with his contemporaries and friends and the use of archival footage."
