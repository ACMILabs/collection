        "With the distance between Canada and Russia, China and India cut by high-speed planes, new international links are being forged. In this Pacific world, British Columbia is a unit of growing importance. In a brief survey of the province, Gateway to Asia covers the people, natural resources, industries, and some of the social problems of British Columbia. Located on the Pacific Coast, it is the jumping-off place for planes bound for the Orient and Russia, and a vital link between the rest of Canada and her neighbors in the Far East. Narrated by Lorne Greene."
