        "Members of the medical profession may specialise in one or perhaps more of the hundreds of branches of medical science, according to their own choice and ability. This doctor is a children's specialist - a pediatrician - and the film is designed to show both parents and children what a typical day's work is like for him, in a big hospital, and at his private consulting rooms."
