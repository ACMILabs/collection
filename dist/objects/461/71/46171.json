        "How the helicopter was used to set up a drilling rig at Sireru in a remote area of Papua. A whole oil camp was lifted piece by piece into the middle of the jungle by helicopter, thus solving one of the biggest problems, that of oil transportation, for in a country with a rainfall of up to 350 inches a year it may take three months to build a road."
