        "The new syllabus in physical education introduced by the New South Wales Department of Education was enthusiastically adopted by teachers in primary schools. In this film, groups of school boys and girls demonstrate a variety of group exercises and show how they enjoy this new approach to physical education. The film emphasises the value of such group activity in building character and self-confidence, in developing healthy social attitudes and in providing healthy physical exercise."
