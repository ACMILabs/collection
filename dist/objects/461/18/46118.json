        "Assam is a land of rivers and mountains, famed for its natural beauty. Its industries are sericulture as a cottage industry; metal as a flourishing craft; teas as an important source of foreign exchange; the Digboi Oil Refinery, as the only one of its kind in India; and jute, a very vital product. This is an exotic insight into some of Assam's cultural aspects by focussing on social behaviour and virtue. Also depicts the fine river, Brahmaputra."
