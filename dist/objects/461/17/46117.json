        "Student mountain climbers in the Himalayas. From all over India men come to the Government Mountaineering Institute based at Darjeeling. In classes they learn about weather behaviour, glaciers and map reading. Part of the course is a nine day trek to the foothills and throughout the journey the instructors, one of whom is Tenzing Norgay, give practical lessons using various equipment, crampons, pitons, ropes and erecting tents. Finally students and instructors climb one of the ice covered peaks. Contains some very beautiful landscape footage."
