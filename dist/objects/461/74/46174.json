        "For two centuries Acadians have been reliving the legacy of exile left to them by their ancestors in 1755. Here, following a brief look at that tragic legacy, are expressions in word, song and music of the present-day struggle to maintain a viable cultural identity. They include the bitter outpourings of Acadian youth, and the humorous music of happy old-timers who sing and fiddle in the traditional style of Acadian folk music. The theme song is performed by well-known singer Edith Butler, herself an Acadian."
