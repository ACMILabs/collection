        "A stellar cast headed by Michelle Pfeiffer and Kevin Kline, bring Shakespeare's capering romantic comedy to life. When two pairs of star-crossed lovers, a feuding pair of supernatural sprites (Titania and Oberon), and a love potion gone awry all come together in an enchanted moonlit forest, the result is a delightful mix of merriment and magic. Cast also includes Calista Flockhart, Stanley Tucci and Rupert Everett."
