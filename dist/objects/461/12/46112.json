        "Poetic impression of the coming of spring to the Swedish countryside, captured in visual terms without commentary. As the sun's rays strengthen, the snowmelts and drop by drop streams trickle together forming as they gather rushing torrents cascading to the sea. Migrating birds return to Sweden, boys fly kites on the windy hillsides, wildflowers bloom on the forest floor and blossoms appear on trees, for spring has come to Sweden once more."
