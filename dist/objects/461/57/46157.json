        "Atom Egoyan's second literary adaptation (\"The Sweet Hereafter\" was the first) is a dark yet comic tale of the powerful influence of childhood and the search for contentment in life's journey. Pregnant and alone, Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) leaves her native home of Ireland in search of Johnny, father of her unborn child. Arriving in Birmingham with few clues as to his location, she meets factory canteen manager Mr Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), a seemingly benevolent gent who offers to help Felicia find lodgings and her love. Hilditchs' home is a time capsule of 1950's homewear, and he spends his evenings watching footage of his mother, Gala (Arsinee Khanjian), a successful television chef, and himself as a young child in the background. The relationship revealed throughout the footage is deliciously tinged with antagonism and pain, something that remains with Hilditch throughout his adult life and appears to have influenced his relationship with women. Felicia is not the first wayward soul assisted by Mr Hilditch, as it is revealed he has recorded the innermost thoughts of numerous other women he has picked up in his car - Felicia appears to be the next in line. Cast also includes Peter McDonald, Gerard McSorley and Claire Benedict. Based on the novel by William Trevor."
