        "Bosnian-born filmmaker, Emir Kusturica, made this farcical comedy set in a Gypsy settlement along the banks of the Danube, where three generations of characters burst forth in manic and frenetic displays of charm, confusion and chaos. The story is built around two old friends and their families who become impossibly entangled in a marriage of inconvenience. With a soundtrack of Gypsy music and songs, the funny film features numerous non-professional in the cast. In Serbo-Croation with English subtitles. Cast includes: Bajram Severdzan, Florijan Ajdini, Salija Ibraimova, Branka Katic and Srdjan Todorovic."
