        "25 years after the end of the Vietnam War, some of the conflict's most harrowing images can be seen in this documentary. Long forgotten pictures rediscovered in American Army archives, censured for their violence, or restricted by military secrecy. Unedited, identified by clapperboard, this raw material depicts war in its routine, the eye of the camera capturing a crack fighting force, from the world's most powerful nation, in disintegration."
