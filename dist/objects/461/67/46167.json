        "Along the eastern coast of the united States, fishermen gather from the ocean and bays many different types of shellfish - oysters, crabs, clams, lobsters - using lines, traps and nets. Their catches are shipped fresh to many parts of the USA, with the aid of special packing and refrigeration; canned, they are exported all over the world. This film uses dialog recorded among the fishermen in various parts of the east coast of USA, thus emphasizing the rgionals differences in speech"
