        "Monkey Goes Wild About Heaven: Mischievous Monkey is summoned to Heaven where he steals the heavenly peaches and fights with two of the Emperor's officials, after which all three are expelled to Earth. Monkey is imprisoned under a mountain, while the other two are transformed into a pig monster and a water monster. \"Monkey Turns Nursemaid\": Buddha sends Boddhisattva Huan-yin the Compassionate as messenger to find a holy man to journey from China to India to fetch the large vehicle scriptures. She chooses the boy priest Hsuan Tsang, and bestows upon him the name Tripitaka. \"The Great Journey Begins\": Tripitaka and Monkey begin their perilous journey. Along the way they encounter Pigsy and Sandy. Based on the sixteenth century book of the same name by Ch eng-en Wu. Dubbed in English."
