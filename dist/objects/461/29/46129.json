        "Jaded aristocrat, Evgeny Onegin (Ralph Fiennes), gladly abandons the decadent opulence of St. Petersburg's high society after unexpectedly inheriting his uncle's country estate. Despite feeling out of place in such a provincial setting, he manages to form an uneasy friendship with Vladimir Lensky (Toby Stevens), who introduces him to the sister of his fiance, Tatyana Larina (Liv Tyler). Tatyana becomes enamoured with Onegin and, caught up in the frenzy of first love, writes him a passionate letter expressing her feelings. However, she is devastated when Onegin cruelly rejects her and turns his attention to her sister, an action which eventually results in a duel with the enraged Lensky. Returning to St. Petersburg once again, Onegin spirals downward into a deep depression, obsessed with what might have been in this exquisitely filmed version of Alexander Pushkin's famous novel, \"Eugene Onegin\"."
