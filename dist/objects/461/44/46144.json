        "Set in Glasgow in the late 1960's, 'Small faces' is a gritty depiction of three working class brothers coming of age in an environment of gang warfare. The eldest, wayward Bobby is in the Glens, Alan, the artistic middle son is in love with the girl downstairs, and the youngest son Lex is creating the most cause for concern when he accidentally shoots the leader of the Tongs, mental Malky (Kevin McKidd), in the eye with an air rifle. The actions of Lex draw in Alan, the last of the MacLeans to be involved in the Glen/Tong animosity, setting a momentum they cannot control and forcing the brothers to question their loyalty between family and friends. Their story is set against a strong home environment, one in which their mother is acutely aware of their heritage and a time when things were better, yet also devoid of obvious male role models as Lex is torn between Alan and Bobby, and Bobby turning to the Glens without question. Cast includes Claire Higgins, Iain Robertson, Joseph McFadden and Laura Fraser."
