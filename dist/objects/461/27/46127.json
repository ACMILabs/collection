        "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be deaf? We can't really reproduce that experience for hearing people, but here is a videotape that explains sound, hearing loss and the relationship between listening to speech and different kinds of hearing loss. Simulations of what speech sounds like with different kinds of hearing loss helps us to understand how much deaf people can get from listening and lipreading. Useful hints on how to communicate better with deaf people round off an informative introduction to hearing loss and its effect on learning and understanding."
