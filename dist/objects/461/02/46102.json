        "Episode of Series \"Look at Life\". Today silver plays a new role in Britain. Since 1947 it has ceased to be used in British coinage and is put to work more and more widely in a variety of industries. Old silver coins are refined at the Royal Mint, to supply industry with more of this precious mineral, also used in the fine silver work for which Britain's silversmith's are traditionally famous."
