        "Join Greg Grainger as he explores China in the new millenium, sailing from bustling Shanghai, up the Yangtze River, in search of the mythical kingdom of Shangri-La. Experience face-to-face encounters with Pandas, and the colourful ethnic minorities of Yunnan province, with a concert of music, centuries old, performed by 80 year old maestros. Also see teams of workers carving a two million dollar jade sculpture and a military spectacle in the City of Nanjing to celebrate National Day."
