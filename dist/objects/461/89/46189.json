        "It is said that a man spends half of his life in his shoes, yet gives them less thought than any other article of apparel. Here in this film we watch the process of manufacture of footwear in a British factory, starting with the evil-smelling tannery where the hides are treated, and ending wiht someone's feet in a smart pair of finished shoes. The film shows also examples of footwear worn as long ago as the 15th century, and watch master craftsmen at work on hand-made shoes."
