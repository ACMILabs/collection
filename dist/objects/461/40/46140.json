        "With the phrase \"I'll take that one\", African tribesman Mbuti Matabuiki Lobiko finds himself sharing a household with Australian housewife Clarissa Penfold and her family. A humorous fable that looks at the way we exploit each other both consciously and unconsciously, across all levels of our relationships - cultural, national, racial, sexual and personal. Cast includes Renny Augustine, Genevieve Mooy and Neil Fitzpatrick."
