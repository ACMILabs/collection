        "Three gangsters, one teapot, all of them know the intricacies of how the tea should be poured, the way the kettle should be turned, the sequence of ingredients and they'll be damned if the process isn't followed properly. Tarantino meets high tea in this short and wicked drama. Cast includes Lech Mackiewicz, Anthony Johnson and Jed Kurzel. Contains some course language."
