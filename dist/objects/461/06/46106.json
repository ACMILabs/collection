        "Japan is a country which is both new and old. This film shows how the traditions of Japanese life are still very much part of a nation which is also modern and industrialised. The people are hard-working, for a little land must go a long way, A love of beauty and politeness is an essential part of their lives,. Festivals, geisha girls and shrines for worship are some of the traditional aspects depicted in this beautiful country."
