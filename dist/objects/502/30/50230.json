        "Explores the use of nonviolent action in the fight for human rights around the world during the 20th century. Mohandas Gandhi, inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1905, fully believed in nonviolence as a means of fighting back against any form of oppression or brutality. Three broad classes of nonviolent methods exist: nonviolent protest and persuasion, noncooperation, and nonviolent intervention. \"A Force more powerful\" presents six stories demonstrating successful nonviolent means of overcoming conflict. \"India: defying the Crown\" 1930-31 - Gandhi led the fight for independence using civil disobedience on a massive scale, challenging the British tax and monopoly on salt. \"Nashville: we were warriors\" 1960-61 - Students led by Reverend James Lawson staged sit-ins and boycotts to eliminate segregation in Nashville, a city of two races. \"Poland: we've caught God by the arm\" 1980-81 - A strike, organised by Lech Walesa, and the workers in the shipyard at Gdansk led to the birth of the Solidarity movement and the fight for recognition of trade unions. \"South Africa: freedom in our lifetime\" 1985-86 - Youth organiser, Mkhuseli Jack, brought together the various Black civil action groups and arranged a consumer boycott of the white businesses in Port Elizabeth in an attempt to end apartheid. \"Denmark: living with the enemy\" 1940-45 - Although the Danish Government proclaimed neutrality status during World War II, they were still occupied by the Nazis. A facade of co-operation covered a growing active resistance, a resistance which eventually led to sabotage and labor strikes. \"Chile: defeat of a dictator\" 1983-88 - General Augusto Pinochet's brutal dictatorship and military rule was gradually undermined by the Chilean people staging a national protest day and months and years of nonviolent demonstrations. Contains b&w archival footage. Narrated by Ben Kingsley."
