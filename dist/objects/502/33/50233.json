        "Unbreakable is the follow-up film for M. Night Shyamalan after his worldwide hit \"The Sixth sense\". Bruce Willis stars as David Dunn, an everyman character, a security guard and father of one, whose marriage is undergoing a crisis. David is the only survivor of a horrific train crash and miraculously is completely unharmed. Just after the crash David is befriended by Elijah Price aka Mr Glass (Samuel L. Jackson), a man suffering from the opposite syndrome - he is as fragile as cotton wool and has spent his entire life recovering from broken bones. Price runs a comic book store specialising in original comic book cells and has a genuine belief that superheroes exist in real life. These two men of opposing physical make-ups are brought together and discover that their destinies are strangely linked. David slowly comes to realise that he has extrasensory powers and superhuman strength that render him unbreakable. \"Unbreakable\" is a thriller, a classic good versus evil tale that explores the notion of supernatural forces at work in the world. Cast also includes Robin Wright Penn."
