        "Loosely adapted from the classic poem by one of America's most famous poets, Edgar Allan Poe, \"The Raven\" is a comedy-horror almost bordering on parody about a 16th century 'good' sorceror, Craven (Vincent Price), his presumed-dead wife Lenore (Hazel Court), the 'evil' sorceror Dr Scarabus (Boris Karloff), the Raven who is actually a magician by the name of Bedlo (Peter Lorre) and Bedlo's son (a very young Jack Nicholson). This tale of sorcery, witchcraft and 'evil' versus 'good' is full of tongue-in-cheek humor with a gothic flavour. Screenplay by Richard Matheson and music by Les Baxter. Cast also includes Olive Sturgess, Connie Wallace, William Baskin, Aaron Saxon."
