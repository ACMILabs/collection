        "Phil Green (Gregory Peck) is a single father and journalist lured to New York as a feature writer for a magazine. Assigned to write about anti-semitism, he struggles to find the right angle from which to explore this issue from a more personal perspective. Unrelenting in his quest for truth, Phil poses as a Jew and encounters prejudice first hand. Determined to expose intolerance and hypocracy, he confronts those who blatantly practice anti-semitism and challenges those close to him who support it by remaining silent. Includes original theatrical trailer and Movietone News footage. Also stars Dorothy McGuire, John Garfield, Celeste Holm Anne Revere, June Havoc and Dean Stokwell. Screenplay by Moss Hart, based on the original story by Laura Z. Hobson. Cinematography by Arthur Miller. Music by Alfred Newman. (Academy Awards: Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress)"
