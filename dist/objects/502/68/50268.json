        "Born in Cootamundra, New South Wales on 27 August 1908, Don Bradman was eventually to become an Australian icon, and a somewhat reluctant hero. His family moved to Bowral when he was only two years old and he was educated at the local Bowral Elementary School, focusing on sport rather than an academic life. Without any formal coaching, Don Bradman soon found he had a special talent as a batsman when at the age of 12 he played for the senior school team and scored 115 not out. He has played in 52 test matches and scored a total of 6,996 runs, the highest scorer ever. This documentary provides an insight into this quiet unassuming person who dislikes publicity and giving interviews. Interviewed by Ray Martin, Sir Donald Bradman talks of his background, his family and of course his amazing cricketing career, providing anecdotal stories of some of the more memorable occasions such as the Bodyline series in Adelaide in 1933. The interview is interspersed with archival footage and still photographs of past test matches, tours, famous faces such as Harold Larwood, Frank Tyson, Gary Sobers and Dennis Lillee, and brief glimpses of his personal life including his wife and family. A most interesting history of cricket from a frank and honest point of view by one of the game's highly respected players - and in his words, \"Cricket is a glorious game\" (Sir Donald Bradman died on 25 February 2001 at the age of 92). \"Don Bradman\" composed and performed by John Williamson."
