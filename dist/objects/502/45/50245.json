        "Tom Savini who has acted and performed stunts for Hollywood productions is mostly known for his blood-curdling special effects used in horror films. \"Scream greats\" takes a close look at the life, influences and techniques in 'horror' special effects that Tom Savini brought to the screen. Tom Savini is reputed to have caused the explosion in popularity of horror films since the eighties as a result of his increasingly realistic and gory special effects devised for these films. Featured are interviews with Tom and other colleagues along with excerpts from some of the horror films in which Savini's special effects and make-up design were central to the film, including: \"Friday the 13th\" series, \"Day of the dead\", \"Martin\", \"Dawn of the dead\", \"Knight riders\", \"Maniac\", \"Tales from the darkside\" plus more."
