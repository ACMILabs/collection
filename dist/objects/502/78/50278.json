        "Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as Catherine Sloper, a 'plain' and socially inept young woman with a domineering father who blames his daughter for the death of his wife during childbirth. Incapable of expressing any love or tenderness towards his daughter, Dr. Sloper (Albert Finney) is immediately suspicious of the handsome young suitor who starts pursuing her. Believing that Morris Townsend's (Ben Chaplin) interest in Catherine is motivated by her wealth, Dr. Sloper does everything in his power to forbid the liaison. Willing to surrender her inheritance in order to marry Morris, Catherine gradually realises that nobody wants her to make this sacrifice. Also stars Maggie Smith and Judith Ivey. Based upon the novel by Henry James which was filmed as 'The Heiress' by William Wyler. Screenplay by Carol Doyle. Photographed by Jerzy Zielinski. Edited by David Siegel. Music by Jan P. Kaczmarek."
