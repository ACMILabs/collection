        "It is 1966, and the Vietnam War has just erupted. After a spate of suicides at the military school on the grounds of the U.S controlled Yokota Air Force Base in Japan are attributed to chiropterans, demons who live off human blood, a top secret organisation orders the mysterious and brooding Saya to hunt down and destroy the vile creatures responsible. Armed with a special samurai sword, Saya infiltrates the school in the guise of a new student, and launches a covert investigation, which soon leads her to the source of the problem. However, one of the chiropterans manages to escape, and Saya suddenly has her hands full when the school nurse is captured. It soon becomes a race against time to slay the demons before they take over the Base and kill all the humans within in it. Based on the manga of the same name, this fast-paced film is essentially a section of a much larger story, and is the first fully digital anime ever created. Instead of cels, the film used a computer system that created frames digitally from scanned artwork, using a computer to paint each frame. Director Hiroyuki Katakubo originally started off as an animator, before getting his first gig as a director on the hentai series, Cream Lemon. He has now established himself among the top anime directors, directing films such as 'Roujin-Z' (1991) and contributing to an episode of 'Robot Carnival' (1987). This video also features a documentary detailing the making of the 'Blood: the last vampire'."
