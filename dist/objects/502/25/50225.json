        "In the 1950s, a US test pilot team, codenamed Team Daedalus, have been training to become the first Americans in space. They are passed over by NASA who decide to send a chimp instead. Over the years, Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland) and Tank Sullivan (James Garner) have been forgotten and move onto other professions - Corvin becomes an aerospace engineer, Hawkins, a freelance pilot, Sullivan, a Baptist minister, and O'Neill, an astrophysicist who designs roller coasters in his free time. The four all live a quiet life until NASA learns that a Russian satellite will crash into earth, causing a major communication blackout, unless a failure in the satellite's system can be repaired. When NASA discovers that the satellite's system is identical to one Corvin designed, they ask him for help. He agrees, but only if he can do the repairs himself and that the original Team Daedalus can come along as his crew. 'Space cowboys' was produced and directed by Clint Eastwood. Cast also includes James Cromwell, Marcia Gay Harden, Courtney B. Vance, Loren Dean and William Devane."
