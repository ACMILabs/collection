        "Mystery, Alaska is a small town where all the men in the community are obsessed with ice-hockey. They have their own competitive league which becomes the attention of a national sports magazine, this leads to someone at the National Hockey League coming up with an idea for an amazing publicity stunt. The New York Rangers are on their way to Mystery to play the local boys in an ice-hockey match. The town goes crazy with excitement, although there a few who that don't see this as a good idea, more like an opportunity to embarrass their close knit community."
