        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Buck Rogers in the 25th century\". These are the last three episodes from the first season of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. In \"Buck's Duel to the Death\", the people of the planet Katar live in fear of an evil warlord, The Trebor, who systematically steals their most beautiful women for his personal harem and eliminates anyone who stands in his way. Desperate to overthrow this tyrant, the council's final hopes rest with an ancient legend predicting that The Trebor will be defeated by the Roshon, a 500 year old man. Having knowledge of Buck's circumstances, they lure him to their world and reveal their plans to make him their planet's saviour. Sceptical of the legend, Buck decides to help them. But can he defeat a man who can command the ancient power of electricity? In \"Flight of the War Witch - Parts 1 & 2\", Buck discovers a mysterious, glowing orb containing the secrets for traveling through a space warp into another universe. Intrigued, Dr. Huer allows Buck and Twiki to make the journey, despite the imminent dangers lurking beyond. Princess Ardala, also alerted to the orb's capabilities, has one of her spies steal it, and directs the Draconia through the space warp in hot pursuit - with Dr. Huer and Col. Deering on board as unwilling passengers. On the other side, Buck discovers that the orb was really a distress beacon from the peaceful planet Pendar, who is seeking a champion to help defend them from invasion by the evil Zaad war witch, Zarina. After attempts to individually negotiate with Zarina fail, Buck and Ardala decide to consolidate their resources, and an unlikely alliance between the humans and Draconians is formed as Buck leads a collective strike against Zarina's battlecruiser. Stars Gil Gerard as Buck, Erin Gray as Col. Deering, Tim O'Connor as Dr. Huer, Pamela Hensley as Ardala. Special guest Julie Newmar (Catwoman in the 60's TV show Batman) stars as Zarina in \"Flight of the War Witch - Pts 1 & 2\"."
