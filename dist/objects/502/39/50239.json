        "A mixture of parody, horror film and fairytale, this film about a kindly old fanatic and his incompetent young assistant who take on a castle of thirsty vampires armed only with cowardice, stupidity and a sharp stake, was described by Polanski as \"a cartoon with people\". Although his film is at core voyeuristically heterosexual, Polanski makes the homoerotic aspect of the vampire film explicit. The high point is the macabrely beautiful great vampire ball. Cast includes Jack MacGowran, Sharon Tate, Alfie Bass, Ferdy Mayne, Terry Downes, Fiona Lewis, Iain Quarrier and Jessie Robbins."
