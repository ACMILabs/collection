        "Meryl Streep stars as Karen Blixen whose love affair with Africa began when she and her husband Baron Von Blixen (Klaus-Maria Brandauer) went to Kenya in 1914. Despite her disastrous marriage and the failure of her coffee plantation, her passion for Africa never died. Robert Redford is cast as her lover, Denys Finch-Hatton. Based on the books of Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen's pen name) \"Out of Africa\", \"Shadows on the grass\" and \"Letters from Africa\" by Isak Dinesen; \"Isak Dinesen: the life of a storyteller\" by Judith Thurman; \"Silence will speak\" by Errol Trzebinski. Her powers of observation and gift for storytelling revealed the empathy she felt for the people of Kenya and her attraction to the land. (Academy awards 1986: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score (John Barry), Best Art Direction and Best Sound)"
