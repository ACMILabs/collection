        "In Part One of 'The gun on ice planet zero', Starbuck and Boomer discover a small, icy planet known to the Cylons as Arcta while on a deep space mission with three cadets. A sudden beam from a laser built into a mountain on Arcta obliterates one of the cadets, and Cylon interceptors appear, forcing one of the other cadets to land on the surface. Adama becomes convinced that the Galactica is being herded toward the planet as part of a Cylon plot, and orders a team of prisoners specially recruited for the job to accompany Apollo on a mission to attack the Cylon garrison and destroy the laser cannon. On Arcta, Apollo is assisted by a group of Theta-class clones, who reveal that their \"father-creator\" Dr. Ravashol was responsible for designing the weapon. Baltar, back in charge, orders more basestars to attack the Galactica. In Part Two, Apollo must help evacuate the clones from their underground city before the weapon can be destroyed. As Cylons pour into the villages, searching for the missing landing party, it becomes a race against time to disable the Cylon command centre and demolish the weapon before it can be used against the Galactica. Stars Lorne Green as Adama, Richard Hatch as Apollo, Dirk Benedict as Starbuck, Noah Hathaway as Boxey, and John Colicos as Baltar."
