        "'Suddenly a bolt of electricity sprang forth from the screen and hit me in the head, scorching my forehead with uncanny resemblance of a burn that looked like a human eye. I could hear a buzzing in my ears, my newly formed third eye then began to secrete a special metallic-tasting liquid, as I saw visions of atomic bomb mushroom clouds.' - Ian Haig (Chicago Underground Film Fest)"
