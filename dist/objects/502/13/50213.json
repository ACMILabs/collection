        "The first of one of the classic Kung Fu films starring champion Jet Li as legendary martial arts folk hero, Wong Fei Hung. Set in a time when foreign traders and Jesuit priests were beginning to enter China, Wong Fei Hung leads the Black Army, a local militia determined to protect the town against the evil forces which operate in it. An action film which will amaze and astound as Jet Li performs a series of heroic feats, defeating any evil in his path. Restored widescreen version containing over 10 minutes of footage previously not included on video. In Cantonese with English and Chinese subtitles."
