        "Girl on a motorcycle is an erotic fantasy film starring Marianne Faithful and Alain Delon. Rebecca (Faithful) is a bored English newly wed, whose husband fails to satisfy her emotionally or sexually. On a whim Rebecca flees to France on her motorcycle to be re-united with her former lover Daniel (Delon), who taught her a love of riding and gave her sexual satisfaction. Numerous flashback sequences reveal the history between Rebecca and Daniel. Whilst riding to meet Daniel, Rebecca (in voiceover) ruminates over the motivation behind her choices and the possibilities of her future. The film was released in 1968 in an edited version that was X-rated, under the title \"Naked under leather\". This is the full length uncut version. In keeping with the times, the film features several psychedelic scenes."
