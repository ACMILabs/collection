        "Based on the biography of Nora Barnacle, who remained James Joyce's lifelong lover and the inspiration for much of his work. The film traces their sexually charged and turbulent relationship which began in Dublin in 1904 and survived through periods of poverty, jealousy, pride and betrayal. Moving to Europe to escape the confining traditions and religious attitudes of Ireland, the couple endured years of hardship and despair, interspersed with moments of extravagance, to pursue Joyce's literary aspirations. The passionate relationship between these two strong-willed individuals survived until Joyce's death in 1941. Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch star as James Joyce and Nora Barnacle. Cast also includes Peter McDonald and Roberto Citran. Screenplay, Pat Murphy and Gerard Stembridge based upon the biography by Brenda Maddox. Music, Stanislas Syrewicz. Editing, Pia Di Giavla. Cinematography, Jean Francois Robin."
