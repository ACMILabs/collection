        "After terrorists destroy a NASA project designed to transmit radio signals deep into space, and a CIA operative is found dead in the Seine with his throat torn out, French agents forcefully recruit Kousaburo Kuki to find out what the CIA's mysterious Project Dracula involves. The tough-talking former terrorist and master criminal is less than thrilled at his assignment, but agrees to gain intelligence for them in exchange for getting the cops off his back. He immediately intuits a strange connection between the CIA's Paris-based operation and Lamia Vindaw, a beautiful young film star, but his investigations become complicated by the interference of a dark-cloaked figure intent on immobilising him. Thrust into the role of protector, Kuki forces Lamia into hiding, where she soon discovers a devastating truth about herself that could explain why the CIA, French agents, and a group of expatriate Transylvanian vampires are so desperate to lay claim to her. As Kuki gets closer to solving the enigma, deceptions are revealed, blood spurts freely, and the body count escalates at an alarming pace. A violent and testosterone-charged anime adaptation of the hard-boiled science fiction novel by Kiyoshi Kasai."
