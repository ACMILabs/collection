        "This moving homage to filmmaker Jacques Demy ('Lola', 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg', 'The Young girls of Rochefort'), by his wife, filmmaker Agnes Varda, was made with his collaboration but completed after his death in 1990. Scenes enacted from his idyllically happy childhood filmed at the actual locations in his hometown of Nantes, are intercut with Demy's home movies, his recollections and clips from his films. The film presents an evocative chronicle of the teenage Jacquot's growing fascination with the cinema culminating in his departure for film school in Paris. Cast includes Philippe Maron, Edouard Joubeaud and Laurent Monnier. In French with English subtitles."
