        "Based on Henry James' novel \"The Turn of the screw,\" this made for television adaptation stars Lynn Redgrave as Miss Jane Cubberly, a young English governess who is hired to take care of two orphaned children, Miles (Jasper Jacob) and Flora (Eva Griffith), who live in an old country mansion. However, it is not long before Miss Cubberly soon discovers that things are not quite as they seem. The children's behaviour is most disturbing and at times bordering on evil, whilst the house itself appears to possess an unnatural \"presence.\" This gothic horror has been adapted into many film versions, most notably \"The Innocents\" in 1961 starring Deborah Kerr and directed by Jack Clayton. Cast also includes: Megs Jenkins, John Baron, Anthony Lagdon, Kathryn Scott, James Laurenson, Benedict Taylor."
