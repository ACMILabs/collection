        "Episode of Series \"Buck Rogers in the 25th century\". In 'Unchained woman', The Earth Defense Directorate send Buck and Wilma on a mission to rescue Jen Burton, the partner of notorious shipping pirate Malary Pantera, from a state-of-the-art underground jail where she has been incarcerated for a murder that Pantera actually committed. Masquerading as a convict, Buck infiltrates the high-tech facility, detonates a bomb, and they break out, heading to a nearby spaceport to meet Wilma and return to Earth. However, an android prison guard damaged during the explosion begins a relentless pursuit of them, determined to uphold the law. Their situation is complicated further when a traitorous ambassador informs Malary of Jen's escape and the Earth Directorate's plans to use her to gain information that will ultimately lead to his arrest. It is up to Buck and Wilma to both defeat him and shut down the obsessed android before Jen is silenced forever. In 'Planet of the Amazon women', Buck is lured to the planet Zantia after answering a distress call from two women whose space yacht is malfunctioning. Once on the planet's surface, he learns that there is a shortage of men on Zantia, and that he is to be sold off to the highest bidder at an auction. Purchased by the Prime Minister's daughter Ariela, he is surprised when he discovers what her true intentions are. With Wilma leaving delicate trade negotiations to go in search of her missing friend, it is up to Buck and Ariela to overthrow her mother's oppressive government and liberate the planet's male population from their captors before they declare another war on Zantia. Stars Gil Gerard as Buck, Erin Gray as Col. Deering, and Tim O'Connor as Dr. Huer. Special guest Jamie Lee Curtis stars as Jen Burton in 'Unchained woman'."
