        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Buck Rogers in the 25th century\". The year is 1987, and NASA launches the last of America's deep space probes. In a freak mishap, Ranger III and its pilot, William Buck\" Rogers are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Buck Rogers to Earth five hundred years later.\" It is the year 2491, and the alien flagship Draconia, on its way to Earth under to pretense of signing a peace treaty, intercepts a strange, antiquated ship floating in space. Revived by Princess Ardala and her chief advisor Kane, Buck is interrogated, with the Draconians coming to the conclusion that he is a spy sent to discover their plot to attack and conquer Earth. Hiding a micro-transmitter in his shuttle, they launch him towards Earth's impenetrable Defense Shield. With seconds to go before total annihilation, his ship is intercepted by Colonel Wilma Deering, who suspects him of being a pirate or a Draconian spy, and wants to capture him for questioning. Brought to the attention of Dr. Elias Huer and his mechanoid colleague Dr. Theophilis, Buck struggles to convince the humans of his true identity, especially when Princess Ardala denies ever having met him. Buck soon uncovers the Draconians' treacherous plot, and with the help of the mobile mechanoid Twiki proves his allegiance to Earth by helping the Directorate repel their attack. Buck Rogers first appeared as Anthony Rogers in a short space opera, \"Armageddon-2419 A.D.\" by Philip Francis Nowlan, published in the August 1928 issue of Amazing Stories magazine. Nowlan was later commissioned to turn his idea into the first ever science fiction comic strip. It later spawned a radio serial, a film serial (starring Buster Crabbe, who also starred as Flash Gordon in the film serials of the 30's), and a short-lived 50's TV serial. This episode, initially made as the feature film Buck Rogers in the 25th Century in March 1979, was later turned into the two-hour pilot for the television series of the same name that first aired on NBC in September 1979. Stars Gil Gerard as Buck, Erin Gray as Col. Deering, Pamela Hensley as Ardala, and Tim O'Connor as Dr. Huer."
