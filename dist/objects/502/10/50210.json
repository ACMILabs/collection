        "This remake of the 1956 classic takes place in the 1970s in San Francisco. Spores rain forth, unseen, from outer space, and soon strange flowers begin to bloom all over the city. One by one residents are suddenly losing thir individuality and becoming drone-like shadows of their former selves. As the phenomenon spreads, two Department of Health workers uncover the horrifying truth: that mysterious pods are cloning humans and destroying the originals. Cast includes: Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, Veronica Cartwright and Jeff Goldblum."
