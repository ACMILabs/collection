        "Episode of Series \"Gardening Australia\". A must for all \"Gardening Australia\" enthusiasts as the team explores the evolution of the Australian garden from the time of white settlement through to today's individual and contemporary designs. Gardening is an art of planning, design, colour and space. See some of Australia's most historic homesteads such as Melbourne's Rippon Lea Estate, the influences over the decades of our migrant population and the many beautiful landscapes which have been created by some of Australia's leading creative and passionate gardeners. Made up of six parts, this historical and informative documentary contains stunning visual images with lots of colour and close-up photography. Presented by Richard Heathcote, curator of Rippon Lea."
