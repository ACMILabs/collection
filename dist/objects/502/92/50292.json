        "Meet John Doe is an acclaimed Capra extravaganza, warning against the threat of fascism. Gary Cooper portrays a naive street tramp, John Doe, who becomes an unwitting tool of corrupt politicians. Journalist Ann Mitchell (Barbara Stanwyck) conveys the story of John Doe, who becomes the voice of the people and the champion of decency and fair play. Doe threatens suicide as the ultimate protest against corruption; and thousands of good citizens rally to prevent his death. Director Frank Capra weaves touching comedy into this powerful screen masterpiece. Cast also includes Edward Arnold and Walter Brennan."
