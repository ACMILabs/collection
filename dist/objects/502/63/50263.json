        "Filmed on location in Hoboken, New Jersey, Kazan's film deals with trade unionism, corruption and racketeering on New York's docks. Marlon Brando is cast as an ex-boxer who unknowingly lures a worker, planning to testify against the waterside union, to his death. His conscience drives him to redeem himself by exposing the corruption within the union hierarchy headed by Lee J. Cobb. Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint provide the emotional and spiritual support that drive Brando to persevere in his struggle to eradicate organised crime on the waterfront and to uphold a workers right to work. Rod Steiger appears as Brando's brother, torn between his family loyalty and loyalty to his union boss. Screenplay by Budd Schulbert based on articles by Malcolm Johnson. Photographed by Boris Kaufman. Music by Leonard Bernstein. Edited by Gene Milford. (Academy awards: Best picture, Best actor, Best supporting actress, Best cinematography, Best art direction, Best directing, Best film editing, Best screenplay)"
