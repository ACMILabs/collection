        "Episode of Series \"Safetycare\" How we react to hazards in the workplace is a reflection on how we react to hazards as individuals and should not be underestimated in the success or failure of a safe work site. Providing clear definitions and differences between hazards and risks, this instructional video breaks down hazards into four categories: physical, chemical, biological and ergonomic. Examples in the workplace are provided, as are road rules and vehicle safety as indicative of successful reactive responses to risk. A trainer's manual accompanies the tape."
