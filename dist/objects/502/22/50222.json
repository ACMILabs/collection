        "Joan Fontaine plays a modest and shy young woman, who meets, falls in love with, and eventually marries Maxim de Winter (played by Lawrence Olivier), a widower on vacation. When the new Mrs de Winter arrives at Maxim's mansion, Manderley, she finds a house of hostile servants, most notably the housekeeper who works with sinister cunning to keep alive the influence of her late mistress, Rebecca. Hitchcock's only Academy Award for Best Picture. Based on the Daphne du Maurier novel."
