        "Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert team up as mismatched lovers in this comedy classic. Spoiled Ellie Andrews escapes from her millionaire father who wants to stop her from marrying a worthless playboy. En route to New York, Ellie gets involved with an out-of-work newsman, Peter Warner. When their bus breaks down, the bickering couple set off on a madcap hitch-hiking expedition. Peter hopes to make a story out of their misadventures but complications set in when the runaway heiress and brash reporter fall in love. Screenplay by Robert Riskin based on the short story Samuel Hopkins Adams."
