        "Attacking the issues of established values, \"Look back in anger\" is an explosive sex-charged film based on the play written by John Osborne that managed to shock the world in its day. Jimmy Porter (Richard Burton) a university student and jazz musician married to Allyson (Mary Ure), struggles to contain his rage in a society constrained in values. His wife bears the brunt of his intense anger and abusive manner but also his passion. When Helena (Claire Bloom) enters the scene, the heady and intense lives of Jimmy and Allyson reach a powerful climax. An intense drama that beautifully examines the social morals of a culture on the verge of change. Cast includes: Richard Burton, Mary Ure, Claire Bloom, Edith Evans, Gary Raymond, Glen Blam Shaw, Phyllis Neilson-Terry, Donald Pleasence and George Devine."
