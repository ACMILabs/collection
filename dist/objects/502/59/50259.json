        "This documentary on American actor and director Clint Eastwood traces his long career from his early appearances in B-grade films like 'Tarantula' (1955) and 'Return of the Creature' (1955) and his seven years spent playing the character of Rowdy on the long running television series 'Rawhide', to his iconic performances in Leone's spaghetti westerns and the 'Dirty Harry' series. Extensive clips from the films he acted in and directed, are combined with interviews with Eastwood and his contemporaries including Martin Scorsese, James Garner, Janet Maslin, Sergio Leone, Curtis Hanson, William Goldman, Donald Sutherland and Meryl Streep. Influences on Eastwood's life and career such as his enduring interest in jazz music are also explored. Narrated by Morgan Freeman."
