        "Pop-idol Mimarin Kirigoe quits her struggling girl-group CHAM to pursue a career as an actress, despite the protestations of her agents and numerous fans. Her initial resolve is tested when she receives a fax labeling her a \"traitor\", but she stubbornly presses on, landing a small role in the sexy television murder mystery, Double Bind. When one of her agents is injured by a letter-bomb meant for her, and the website called \"Mima's Room\" starts publishing intrusively intimate details about her daily existence, Mima finds herself caught in a downward spiral of paranoid delusion and regret, struggling to separate fantasy from reality, past from present. As her world fragments into a hallucinatory nightmare, Mima must battle her own inner demons, and protect herself from an obsessed stalker, who is violently murdering her associates. Based on the suspense manga by Yoshikazu Takeuchi."
