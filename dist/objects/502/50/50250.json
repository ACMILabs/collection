        "Ay Carmela is set during the Spanish Civil War in 1938 when control of the cities and towns was continually in a state of flux as the communist Republican armies battled with the Franco led fascist forces in attacks and counter-attacks. Carmela (Carmen Maura - \"Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown\" 1987) and Paulino (Andres Pajares) along with the mute Gustavete (Gabino Diego) have been travelling on the road entertaining frontline Republican troops under the banner of the Tip-Top Variety Show. Carmela sings and dances, Paulino recites poetry and Gustavete plays guitar and together they perform and act out short comedic scenes and entertain in the true vaudevillian tradition. However when they are captured by Mussolini's soldiers on their way to Valencia, choices have to be made. Morality, loyalty, survival are put to the test for Carmela and Paulino, both on a personal and artist's level. Will they resist, or co-operate with the demands put on them to perform for the Fascist officers and a group of captured Polish prisoners who are doomed to be executed the morning after the show? And what about the Italian Lieutenant who is in charge of producing/directing the show - can Carmela and Paulino agree to the changes in the words of their songs and poetry to reflect the fascist ideology? Will they compromise themselves to save their own lives? \"Ay Carmela\" is a strange blend of farcical comedy, music, dance, and politics and may prove a disappointment to Carlos Saura fans (director of Carmen and Blood Wedding). However, Carmen Maura puts in an excellent performance as does Andres Pajares and the theme of artists and morality is an interesting one. Cast also includes Maurizio de Razza, Jose Sancho, Mario de Candia, Miguel Angel Rellan, Edward Zentara. A Spanish-Italian co-production."
