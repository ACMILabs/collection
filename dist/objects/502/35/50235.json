        "Visually rhythmic and stylish production depicting the renowned stage show, STOMP, as they take their percussion, movement and visual comedy to various settings in New York. It is a virtually wordless video clip style work which follows the STOMP troupe as they tour New York, taking their beats using everyday objects to audiences in live performances and simple to elaborate outdoor and indoor locations. The images and sounds speak for themselves as the performers unleash their energy and versatility on pots and pans, cutlery and crockery, drains, playing cards, rubbish bins, buckets and brooms to name a few and combine them with their own tap style dance and physical theatre to express the extraordinary sounds and rhythmic potential of the world around and within us."
