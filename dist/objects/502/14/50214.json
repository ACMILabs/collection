        "In the third instalment in the Crocodile Dundee series, Paul Hogan reprises the titular character of Mick Crocodile Dundee, only this time the principal action takes place in Los Angeles. Mick is living in Walkabout Creek with his wife Sue and son, when Sue is recalled to Los Angeles to take over her father's newspaper. As there is an embargo on crocodile shooting, Mick decides it would be for the best if the entire family relocate to LA for a spell. Once in LA, Mick lands a role as an extra in a film, gets a job handling animals on set, goes about solving a murder mystery and uncovers some illegal dealings in the movie business. Mick is typically chaotic with his misunderstandings of the cultural nuances of LA, holding up a freeway in order to catch a skunk and foiling muggers with his bush skills. \"Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles\" is a fish out of water comedy that relies on reviving the successful jokes of its predecessors in the series. Like the other Crocodile Dundee films, this one panders to gross Australian stereotypes as a formula for comedy. With cameos from Mike Tyson and George Hamilton."
