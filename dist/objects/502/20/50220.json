        "EPISODE ONE: In this first instalment, FBI Agent Dale Cooper continues in his investigation of the death of Laura Palmer. An autopsy reveals a few unexpected clues relating to Laura's actions on the night of her murder. Meanwhile, the first suspect, Laura's secret lover James Hurley, is released from custody, while several other people are questioned regarding their relations with Laura. EPISODE TWO: Agent Cooper turns to unconventional criminology methods, lecturing the local Sheriff's office on the wisdom of Tibet. Several important plot threads are also revealed in this episode, while a new and uneasy friendship forms between the sultry and spoilt Audrey Horne and Laura's best friend, Donna Hayward. This episode, directed by Lynch himself, ends with the much discussed surreal dream sequence where Agent Cooper encounters strange figures such as the One-Armed Man, the Magician, the dancing Man from Another Place and Laura Palmer herself. Cast includes: Madchen Amick, Dana Ashbrook, Richard Beymer, Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, Warren Frost, Peggy Lipton, James Marshall, Everett McGill, Jack Nance, Ray Wise, Joan Chen, Piper Laurie, Eric Da Re, Harry Goaz, Michael Horse, Sheryl Lee, Russ Tamblyn, Grace Zabriskie, Miguel Ferrer, Walter Oklexicz, Royce D. Applegate and Kyle MacLachlan."
