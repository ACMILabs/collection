        "Superb computer animation brings Barbie to life in this modernized adaptation of E.T.A. Hoffmann's classic story, 'The Nutcracker'. Story heroine Clara receives a wooden Nutcracker as a gift from an aunt. As she sleeps the Nutcracker comes to life to save her from the evil Mouse King, who has invaded Clara's house, unfortunately. Clara wakes and is shrunk by the Mouse King. The only person who can break the Mouse King's spell and restore Clara to her original size is the Sugarplum Fairy, so Clara and the Nutcracker set off to find her. In her first full length movie, Barbie assumes the roles of Clara and the Sugarplum Fairy. Choreographed by Peter Martins and performed for animation by the New York City Ballet. Tchaikovsky's musical score is performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. Features voices from Kelly Sheridan (Barbie/Clara), Kirby Morrow (Nutcracker/Prince Eric),Tim Curry (Mouse King), Peter Kelamis (Pimm), Christopher Gaze (Major Mint), Ian James Corlett (Captain Candy), French Tickner (Grandfather Drosselmayer) and Kathleen Barr (Aunt Drosselmayer)."
