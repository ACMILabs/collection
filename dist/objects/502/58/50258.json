        "Alternating between comedy and tragedy, this violent and kinetic re-telling of the story of Bonnie and Clyde is justifiably one of the most celebrated American films of the sixties. Set in the early thirties of the Depression, a car thief and his girl-friend commit a series of robberies which earn them a reputation as America's most feared criminals. Featuring superb production values and brilliant editing, Arthur Penn's film is an ironic exploration of the romantic roots of the counter-culture in the myths and memories of the Depression, and within Hollywood's depictions of the \"outlaw\". The film's controversial use of violence is simultaneously brutal and liberating. Cast includes Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and Gene Hackman."
