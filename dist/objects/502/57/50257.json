        "Innocent New York newcomer Violet Sandford (Piper Perabo) needs a job to support herself while waiting for her big break as a songwriter, and hears about a nightly well paying position as a barmaid in a popular bar. 'Coyote Ugly' is run by Lil, a fast talking determined woman trying to succeed in a male dominated world. Her staff of beautiful women including tough Rachel and sweet Cammie, nightly pour drinks and entertain the bars mainly male clientele. In a world unlike the one she left behind, Violet struggles to keep her head above water, by day peddling her songs to anyone willing to listen, by night dancing on a bar as a 'Coyote', and in between developing her relationship with Kevin (Australian Adam Garcia). Cast includes John Goodman, Melanie Lynskey and model Tyra Banks."
