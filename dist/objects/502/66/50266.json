        "Nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is prepared to propose to his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo), but first must ask her father Jack (Robert De Niro) for his blessing. The perfect opportunity to do so occurs when Greg and Pam visit her family for her sisters wedding. Unfortunately, Jack is still trying to re-unite his daughter with her blue-blood ex-boyfriend Kevin (Owen Wilson) and Greg must prove himself a more worthy candidate for his daughter's love. A series of unfortunate incidents and misunderstandings including flooding the backyard, setting fire to the house and losing the cat cause Greg to be rejected by Pam's entire family, in particular her overprotective father, and Greg has to fight to gain their approval and convince them of his love for Pam. Also starring Blythe Danner, Jon Abrahams and James Rebhorn."
