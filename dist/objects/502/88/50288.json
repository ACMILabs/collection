        "Cary Grant returned to England to make \"The Amazing adventure\" one of the few films he made outside of Hollywood in the 1930s. Grant plays Ernest Bliss, a man who is independently wealthy due to an inheritance but whose life lacks meaning. Suffering a type of depression exclusive to the idle rich, Bliss consults a doctor who wages Bliss 50,000 pounds that he can't last a year earning his own keep. Bliss determines to meet the challenge and sets off in search of employment. Depression era London proves to be a tough life for Bliss, whose experiences over the year shape him significantly. The bet is set awry when Bliss meets Frances - a woman being forced to marry for money despite her reciprocated love for Bliss. The film adheres to the Depression formula of a man who renounces his wealth in order to experience life first hand and learn lessons of good-hearted common people. This version is the 62-minute American release. Also starring Mary Brian, Peter Gawthorne, and Henry Kendall. Based on the book by English novelist E. Phillips Oppenheimer."
