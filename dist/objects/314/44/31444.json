        "Episode of Series \"Romantic vs classic art\". Deals with Turner's rediscovery of colour and its direct appeal to the senses, regardless of subject matter. He is considered by many to be the first \"abstract\" artist. One of the series of films written and narrated by Sir Kenneth Clark on the painters and sculptors who from 1750 to 100 engaged in the struggle between the classic and romantic ideals."
