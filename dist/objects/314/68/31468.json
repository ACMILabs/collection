        "Demonstrates the applications of basic physical principles in the oscillation of an optical maser. Explains that it is a generator of electromagnetic energy in the optical range of frequencies and is similar to standard radio and microwave oscillators. Demonstrates the use of the principal types of gas and solid state optical masers in the laboratory."
