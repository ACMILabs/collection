        "Episode of Series \"The 19th Century Novel\". After publishing Anna Karenina Tolstoy suffered a crisis in his personal and public life. The question which in Anna Karenina haunts Levin \"Why am I?\" became more and more urgent to Tolstoy and his answers became more extreme. He was a man who craved solitude, but his admirers almost made this impossible for him. Tolstoy died on 7 November 1910. Documentary also features Russian writers Godky and Chekov. Uses archival footage and stills."
