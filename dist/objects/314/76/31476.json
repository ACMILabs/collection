        "Animated cartoons show the origin and development of musical instruments. Professor Owl tells his class how all music comes from a toot (the horns), whistle (woodwinds), plunk (strings) and boom (percussion). Explains how the complex instruments of the modern symphony orchestra and brass band developed from primitive forms and the effect of various refinements such as the valves on the brass horn."
