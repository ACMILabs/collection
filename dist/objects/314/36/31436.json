        "Made as part of the Cement and Concrete Association's contribution to European Architectural Heritage Year 1975, shows the many types of Britain's old and modern architecture. It contrasts the present time, when renewal and renovation of urban environment is a matter of concern, with the past. It shows that with thoughtful use of today's materials such as concrete, old and modern buildings can be compatible with those of the past."
