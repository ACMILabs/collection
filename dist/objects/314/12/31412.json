        "A film essay without commentary about the port of Montreal as winter closes in - the last-minute scurry as ships that can make it dash for open water, while those that cannot prepare for a long hold-over. On the docks all activity seems suspended as the numbing cold closes its grip. But there is activity on the iced-in ships and in the freight sheds, making ready for the time when the icebreakers open a river channel and traffic returns. Film without words."
