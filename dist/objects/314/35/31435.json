        "The film opens with an extremely effective presentation of what it is like to have a heart attack. The structure and function of the heart are then discussed. Three most common forms of heart attack and their causes are examined in detail through an imaginative use of cinematic techniques. The relationship of cholesterol to heart attack is given major emphasis."
