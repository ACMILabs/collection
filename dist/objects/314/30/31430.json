        "Beginning with the political conflict between leaders who felt that the revolution had gone too far and others who felt it had not gone far enough, this film examines the forces that shaped the Republic (for example, the film explains the opposition of the nobles and the clergy and the sense of conflict within the king and the rise of radical groups). With the failure of committee rule the leaders turned for support to the army and Napoleon Bonaparte and the revolution ended as it began, with one man rule. However the popular idea of sovereignty lived to change the face of Europe. Narrated by Michael Redgrave ."
