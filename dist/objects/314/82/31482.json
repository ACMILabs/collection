        "An original recording of aboriginal singer Dougie Young singing two of his songs has been used as the basis of an animated film which attempts to draw the attention of whites to contemporary aboriginal issues. \"They say it's a crime\" describes an Aboriginals encounter with white law, \"The land where the crow flies backwards\" describes a displaced aboriginal culture."
