        "A profile of an enthusiast - a man whose fascination with the motion picture is equalled only by his fondness for creating instruments to make music. Maritimer Don Fletcher, ex-prison guard, now film projectionist, explains to an audience of university students how he came to make films, and also demonstrates how he built a violin unlike any other, which nevertheless pours out the real down-east country sound."
