        "A film of mystery set in a world of limbo: the world of the road. This travel album and diary--photographs on the screen, plus a woman's words--tell the story of a couple who drifts apart, of a journey with no return. An introspective, haunting mood piece about intimacy and dispossession. (Awards: Cracow; Cork; Melbourne; Yorkton)"
