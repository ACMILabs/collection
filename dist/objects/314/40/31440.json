        "Episode of Series \"Geometry\". Geometric inversion is introduced and discussed to effect the solution of an apparently difficult problem involving the inscription of a chain of circles between two given circles, one inside the other. The final result, known as Steiner's Porism, is forcefully illustrated in motion - \"pop art\" fashion."
