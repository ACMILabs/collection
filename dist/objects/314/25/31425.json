        "A helicopter was used throughout this exploration of the ten provinces. The result of this off-the-ground portraiture is a view that is big, beautiful, and continuously engrossing. Nothing here is quite the same as seen before, even Niagara Falls. Canadians will be thrilled by this Panavision view of familiar territory. The 'Beatles' appear briefly in a limousine. Made for international distribution for the Canadian centennial. Written by Donald Brittain and Derek May. Narrated by Stanley Jackson. Edited by Rex Tasker."
