        "Salt Point, California is the setting for a broad survey of three marine ecosystems; the open sea, the wave-swept, and the tidal. The open-sea ecosystem focuses on a variety of planktonic inhabitants, their adaptations to a floating environment, and the marine food chain. The coastal ecosystems (wave-swept and tidal) show organism adaptation to varying water conditions, habitats within habitats, interaction within a species and interaction between species."
