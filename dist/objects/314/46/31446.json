        "A middle-aged male jogger runs alone thorugh snow-covered Central Park as \"the metaphor\" for the break-up of a marriage. A dialogue beginning before the marriage and tracing its dissolution, is heard throughout the run. The man's adult life is traced by the dialogue and raises many questions for the viewer about life and human relations."
