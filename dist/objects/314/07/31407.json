        "Konarak is near Puri in the corner of Orissa. This temple, also called the black pagoda, was built in the 13th century in honour of the sun god, Surya. Because of its carvings, the temple is awesome and magnificent and this non-narrated film offers a magnificent glimpse into the daily and spiritual life of the period in which it was built."
