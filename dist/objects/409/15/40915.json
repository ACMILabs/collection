        "A story of Britain's contribution to the art of clock-making. The Greenwich Observatory was established during the reign of Charles II.; in 1764 a clock was made which would keep time for months on board ships, and so the problem of longitude was solved. Today, in the age of mass production, Britain's clockwork industry maintains its high standards of precision and reliability."
