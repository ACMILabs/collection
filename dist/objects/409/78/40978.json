        "The Kookaburra and the Magpie are two of our national icons. Everyone recognises the Kookaburra by its laugh, but in 'Kookaburra', its fascinating social system is revealed as well as its expert fishing abilities. The Magpie has a beautiful call but can be aggressive and territorial. The complete life cycle of this common but fascinating bird is explored in 'Magpie'."
