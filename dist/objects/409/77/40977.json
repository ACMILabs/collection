        "Charles Blackman has been described as the \"traditional Aussie battler\". Raised by his mother in a home with no books and little furniture or food, Blackman rose above the insecurity of his life to become one of Australia's most celebrated artists. A chronological look at Blackman's life and work and his unique contribution to the development of the Australian identity is provided. Narrated by Kate Fitzpatrick."
