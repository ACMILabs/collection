        "Filmmaker Thayer Soule takes us on a personal journey through Spain; capturing its colourful history and observing how that past has been integrated into the present. Soule travels through the quiet beauty of Castile, visits the Great Mosque in Cordoba with its 800 arches, treks through the snow-capped peaks of the Pyrenees and experiences the sights and sounds of a bullfight. The music, dancing and culture of Spain is vividly captured in this interesting personal travelogue."
