        "Forrest Gump touched the hearts and minds of filmgoers and scooped the 1994 Academy Awards. Forrest Gump, sensitively portrayed by Tom Hanks, has a low IQ but through the fierce determination of his mother (Sally Field), takes his place upon the stage of history as the events of three decades unfold around him. Forrest's naive perception of the world contradicts the harsh realities of the Vietnam War and the disillusionment of the \"flower power\" generation, while his \"rags to riches\" story is pure fairytale. Nevertheless Forrest's courage, his strong sense of values and his simple innocence allow him to weather adversity. The special effects editing which allows Forrest to make his mark on history is noteworthy together with strong cast performances. Cast also includes Gary Sinise and Robin Wright."
