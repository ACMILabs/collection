        "Features two episodes of the popular Mr Bean sketches: \"Back to school Mr Bean\" sees the bumbling Mr Bean wreaking havoc in an art class, a judo lesson and a science class. It is however Mr Bean's much loved Mini-minor which comes off second best. No-one in their right minds would let Mr. Bean loose with a pair of scissors, but in \"Hair by Mr. Bean of London\" he does exactly that. His perfect day of cutting and slashing is topped off when Teddy wins a prize at the fete. However at the train station Mr Bean is once again a victim of circumstance."
