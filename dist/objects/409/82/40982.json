        "Jane Fonda and Robert Redford star in this Neil Simon comedy about a newly married couple. Corey and Paul Bratter begin their marriage in a tiny one-roomed apartment up six flight of stairs with the weirdest neighbours on Tenth Street. Corey is vivacious, fun-loving and impetuous, while Paul is a rising and very serious young Attorney. Joy turns to anguish, but they kiss and make up in the end. Fonda and Redford are delightful, while Charles Boyer as the aging Romeo who lives in the attic, and Mildred Natwick as Corey's meek and mild mother are excellent. The script has the wit of Simon's New York perspective."
