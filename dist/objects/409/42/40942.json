        "Lizzie, the Librarian, lives in the small Australian riverside town of Long Flat. Lizzie is always having adventures together with her loveable dog BJ, her Murri co-worker Munro and her Mobile Library Booksy. The moral of her many tales is that the answers to problems can often be found in a book! Narrated by Noni Hazlehurst, this puppet animation featuring nine stories will delight pre-schoolers."
