        "A golden field of wheat waves serenely under a blue Montana sky. A congregation of just-plain-folks in a quaint wooden church listens intently to the preacher. Then, just when you begin to wonder if you've somehow wandered into a Norman Rockwell painting, a man steps through the door and begins spraying the pulpit with automatic pistol fire. Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges star in this offbeat saga of a colourful group of bank robbers determined to \"re-pull\" a master heist of the fortress-like Montana Armoured Depository. In his directorial debut, Cimino injects the comedy-drama with an inventiveness and unpredictability rarely seen in the caper genre. Bridges received a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance as Lightfoot."
