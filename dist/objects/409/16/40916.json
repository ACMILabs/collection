        "The story of an elderly woman who ventures into the central Australian desert to set up her home. In her attempt to recreate the beauty of the home she has left, she does not appreciate the beauty that is already there. Written and designed by author and artist Jeannie Baker, and based on her book of the same name, this animated film uses a unique collage of natural materials. It delivers a powerful message about the seemingly harmless practice of importing foreign flora, and how the Earth's delicately balanced environment is continually being threatened by human interference. Narrated by Michael Craig. Teachers notes (306347) are available as a separate loan item."
