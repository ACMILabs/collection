        "The conclusion of the \"Star Wars\" trilogy begins with the rescue of Hans Solo from the evil clutches of Jabba the Hutt. The Galactic Empire has resurrected the Death Star and plans to eliminate the Rebel Alliance once and for all. Luke Skywalker, grappling with the secret that Darth Vader is his father, who was turned evil by the Dark Side of the Force, must confront the Emperor in one final battle. From the seedy den of Jabba the Hutt, to the luscious green peacefulness of the planet Endor with its Ewoks, \"The Return of the Jedi\" is an entralling action-packed special effects adventure."
