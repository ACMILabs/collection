        "Hailed as the greatest war film and distinguished by a visual and narrative sweep rare in modern cinema, David Lean's masterpiece combines a relentless battle of wills with unparalleled action and spectacle. Based on Pierre Boulle's best seller, and starring Alec Guinness, William Holden and Jack Hawkins, this is the gripping tale of British POWs, captured by the Japanese in World War II and ordered to build a bridge to accommodate the Burma-Siam Railway. Honoured with 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Alec Guinness) and Best Director, this film continues to be one of the most memorable cinematic experiences. The bridge demolition scene remains a brilliant piece of stunt photography."
