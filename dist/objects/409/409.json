        "This is the view overlooking Plac Wielkapolski (Great Poland Square), a busy intersection of pedestrian, tram, and other vehicle traffic adjacent to an open-air market. A meditation on an unfamiliar environment by an outside observer, and a response to the work of Zbignew Rybczynski and other members of the Lodz Film Form Workshop of the 1970's. In memory of Antoni Mikolajczyk, head of the studio of video and installation, who passed away last spring, a year after this material was shot in his studio. Shot over a twenty four hour period in early Spring 1999, during my stay as a visiting professor at the Poznan' Academy of Fine Arts Studio of Video and Installation."
