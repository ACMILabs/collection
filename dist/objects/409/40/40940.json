        "Littlefoot, Cera, Spike and the dinosaur friends return for another adventure. In the beautiful, peaceful Great Valley, Littlefoot and his plant-eating friends play under the watchful eye of their parents. Cera however, wants some excitement and coaxes her friends to explore the \"Mysterious Beyond\". The trouble begins as they encounter a variety of creatures including two egg snatching Struthiomimuses, a pair of ferocious Sharpteeth and a mysterious egg that is about to hatch. To make matters worse they get caught in a landslide so that only a miracle and a great dose of courage can get them home."
