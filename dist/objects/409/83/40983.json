        "Harrison Ford immortalised the character of thrillseeker archaeologist Indiana Jones in this first of the series. From the opening sequence filled with huge crawling tarantulas, golden idols and giant rolling stones, \"Raiders of the lost ark\" is a rollercoaster of thrills and action. Jones is on a mission to find the missing Lost Ark of the Covenant and encounters evil Nazi's, slithering snakes, mummified bodies and red tape before he achieves his mission. Co-starring Karen Allen and Denholm Elliott. A great movie from master blockbuster filmmakers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg."
