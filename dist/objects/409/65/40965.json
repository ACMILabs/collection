        "Alfred Hitchcock agreed to direct this masterful adaption of the broadway play by Frederick Knott merely to fulfil studio contractual obligations but \"Dial M for murder\" became one of his most acclaimed thrillers. Anxious to inherit his wife's fortune, society playboy Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) ingeniously plots her murder. Blackmailing a former associate with a criminal record, he arranges what appears to be a perfect crime. However, his scheme is foiled when Margot (Grace Kelly) stabs her attacker with scissors. Wendice must now take his sinister web of intrigue in a different direction to cover his tracks. Co-starring John Williams."
