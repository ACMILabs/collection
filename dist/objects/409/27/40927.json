        "Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo star in this anarchic parody of college life. As the President of Huxley College, Groucho is busy keeping his eye on the students, as well as on the curves of vivacious college widow Thelma Todd. She is secretly trying to find the secret football codes to sell to rival college Darwin. \"Horse Feathers\" includes the riotious classroom war scene and the climatic football game finale where all the rules are broken!"
