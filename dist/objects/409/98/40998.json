        "Ever wonder why the moon stays up, or why sound travels through air? Boffins do. This second volume of the delightful children's series will both entertain 4-7 year olds and help explain the \"Laws of Nature.\" The episodes are: \"Upwards and downwards\" (the force of gravity), \"Life in the balance\" (the centre of gravity), \"Water water everywhere\" (how to use a syphon), \"The Disappearing water\" (the evaporation of water)."
