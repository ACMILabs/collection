        "A creative video set in rural Victoria, which revolves around two friends, Maureen and Fay, and Maureen's daughter Di. The program targets women over 50, promotes the benefits of having a Pap Smear on a regular basis and deals with the barriers women face to having them. The storyline is interwoven with professional opinions from experts and practitioners in women's health, and reveals commonly held attitudes to the subject by women in this age group."
