        "A collection of five Australian short comedy films, linked by a pizza delivery man having one of those days when nothing seems to go right. \"Bernie's Magic Moment\": a fanatical Collingwood football club supporter (Chris Haywood) is doing the ironing and gets carried away watching a football match; \"Gran's Big Adventure\": Bunney Brooke plays an old lady who becomes locked in a sofa and ends up having a ball of a time; \"Midday Crisis\": a man training to be a private investigator discovers the wisdom in not interfering in a neighbour's business; \"Environmental\": a nerdy guy (Kym Gyngell) is terrorised by a radical greenie; \"Prickly Heat\": the pizza delivery man finally loses his cool completely. A very funny and stylish collection of films."
