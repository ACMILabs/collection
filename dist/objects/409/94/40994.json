        "This is the classic horror tale of science gone wrong. Vincent Price plays the brother of a brilliant scientist (Al Hedison), who discovers how to transport matter through space. Hedison's atoms intermingle with those of a common housefly, leaving him with the insect's head on his body and vice versa. A gruesome freak of nature, he battles to return to normality, however the process slowly drains him of human will. This 1950's thriller, scripted by acclaimed author James Clavell is capped by a climax which is simultaneously eerie and touching."
