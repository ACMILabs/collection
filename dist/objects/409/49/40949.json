        "Gaston Leroux's classic horror tale stars Claude Rains as the immortal phantom who haunts the Paris Opera. As a crazed composer, he is haunted by the beautiful soprano of the company, (Susanna Foster), and is determined to revenge himself upon those who have stolen his music. Nelson Eddy plays the heroic young baritone who tracks down the disfigured madman who has begun to murder those who resist his demands. The lavish colour production moves to a terrifying climax as the phantom is chased through the catacombs of Paris."
