        "The combat Sergeant's duty is to make sure that the men under his charge stay alive. Some of them are barely out of high school and must face the mental and physical challenges of war. The First Infantry Division's insignia is named the \"Big Red One'. The men in this division battle their way through North Africa, Sicily, Omaha Beach and Belgium until they confront the horrors of the Nazi Death Camps. Lee Marvin is the Sergeant, joined by Mark Hamill and Robert Carradine in this excellent portrayal of the realities and horror of war."
