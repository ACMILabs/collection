        "A dazzling cast, with Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman playing the lead roles of the ill-fated Czar Nicholas II, and the Czarina Alexandra. Born to be one of the world's most powerful men, Nicholas ruled millions of people with an empire stretching over one-sixth of the globe. His belief in the Divine Right to rule, made him oblivious to the hardships endured by many of his subjects who were ready to embrace the powerful ideals proposed by Lenin and his followers. The Czarina, in a desperate bid to find a cure for their haemophiliac son, relies heavily on the seductive and mysterious \"Mad Monk\" Rasputin. Once Lenin and his Bolsheviks gain power, the Royal Family is doomed. \"Nicholas and Alexandra\" is filled with the pomp and pageantry of history's great events."
