        "Bubby (Nicholas Hope in a knockout performance) has spent the first thirty-five years of his life locked in a filthy room by a mother who systematically emotionally and sexually abuses him. His first encounter with his father ends in a violent confrontation which results in Bubby breaking through to the outside world. Alone and frightened, a child in an adult man's body, he begins his first tentative steps into humanity. This strange, absorbing and distressing film is a stunning investigation into the alienation lacerating urban contemporary Australia. Watching the world through Bubby's eyes challenges the viewer to re-examine our conventional ideas of what is \"normal\" and what is \"strange\". Family, sexual politics, work, art, and adulthood are questioned by Bubby's progress through the modern world. Winner of four AFI awards and the Grand Jury Special Prize at the Venice Film Festival."
