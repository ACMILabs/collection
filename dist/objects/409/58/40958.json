        "On August 22, 1972, a ninety-seven degree day in New York City, an extraordinary robbery occured minutes before closing in a branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank. As the blistering day progressed, details about two incompetent robbers and their victims emerged. In a Borough, where the absurd is commonplace, these details developed into one of the most bizarre news stories of the year. Starring Al Pacino, John Cazale, James Broderick, Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon."
