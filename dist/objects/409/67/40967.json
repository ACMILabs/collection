        "Episode of Series \"Searching for values: a film anthology\". Specially edited from \"On the Waterfront\", produced by Sam Spiegel, directed by Elia Kazan, this film explores the theme of conscience and conflicting loyalties. It tells of a young man who painfully gains a sense of himself and of his duty to society at the cost of losing his friends and a familiar way of life. As a dock worker, Terry Malloy is bribed by his bosses to suppress information about the murder of a co-worker in which he had inadvertently taken part. Influenced by the parish priest and his own conscience he makes testimony and is left an outcast by his fellow workers. Based on the novel by Budd Schulberg. Suitable for middle and upper secondary level."
