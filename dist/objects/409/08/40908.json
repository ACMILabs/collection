        "Episode of Series \"Dr. Seuss video classics\". John Cleese narrates this delightful but moral tale about a bunch of ill-fated fellows for whom nothing ever seems to go right. There's Mr. Bix whose Borfin just seems to go shlump every night and poor Herbie Hart who has just taken his Throm-dim-bu-lator apart. These hapless chaps make children of all ages realise how lucky they are. In \"Scrambled eggs super!\", Peter wants to ensure his special recipe included eggs from an assortment of weird and wacky birds. It's hard work getting the eggs, but worthwhile. Narrated by Brett Ambler."
