        "Ever wondered why the moon stays up, or why sounds travel through the air? Boffins do. The third volume in this delightful series will entertain children from 4-7 while helping to explain the \"Laws of nature.\" The episodes are: \"Let there be light\" (reflecting light), \"Feeling blue\" (prisms), \"Moving matters\" (friction), \"Miracle of life\" (the importance of light, water and soil to sustain life), \"The Pledge\" (the ability to take charge of scientific experiments and what they really are.)"
