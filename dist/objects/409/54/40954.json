        "Cecil B. DeMille blended drama with spectacle, using the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus as a backdrop. The film is a behind-the- scenes look at the triumphs and conflicts of circus performers. The magic and thrill of life under the Big Top is stunningly recreated. The all-star cast includes Betty Hutton, Cornel Wilde, Charlton Heston, Dorothy Lamour and James Stewart as \"Buttons the Clown\". Filled with romance, intrigue and high-flying acrobatics, \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" is exactly that."
