        "John Travolta and Karen Gorney star in the film that brought the \"seventies generation\" out of their homes and into the disco wearing gaberdine pants and platform shoes. After a week of work in a hardware store, Tony transforms himself into the local Disco King. His new dance partner Stephanie, and ex-priest brother, has Tony questioning the shallowness of his life. It is a fine piece of cinema, being not simply a disco dance, but a striking social commentary. The film is memorable for its great soundtrack; the original music being performed and written by the Bee Gees, for the excellence of the dancing and a fantastic performance from Travolta. A must for those who want to re-live a bygone era and connoisseurs of fashion."
