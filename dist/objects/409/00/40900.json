        "Celebrated Canadian concert pianist Glenn Gould, in the peaceful seclusion of his lakeside cottage. A view of Gould previously known only to intimates; to the collies pacing him through the woods, the fishermen resting their oars to catch the sublime echo of Bach from the distant shore, and the fellow musicians like Franz Kreemer, to whom Gould talks of composition. Edited by James Beveridge. Camera by Wolf Koenig."
