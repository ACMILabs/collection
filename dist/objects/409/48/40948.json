        "The year is 2257AD and the distant planet Altair-IV has three lone inhabitants: Professor Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), a fugitive super-scientist who has created a world of futuristic marvels; his daughter Altaira (Ann Francis), a bewitching innocent who has lived her entire life on the planet: and their servant, Robby the Robot. Then Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen) arrives, and what ensues is a spine-chilling adventure with a hint of romance. \"Forbidden planet\" became a cult classic."
