        "A parody of the Disney film \"Fantasia\", \"Allegro non troppo\" features the highly creative work of talented Italian animator Bruno Bozzetto. It transcends the genre of parody to become a beautiful film in its own right. There are six animated sequences set to classical music, linked together by live-action scenes subtitled in English. The all-female orchestra is composed of old women and directed by a mad conductor (Maurizio Nichetti). This version features ten minutes of previously unreleased music and includes the music of Debussy, Dvorak, Ravel, Sibelius, Vivaldi and Stravinsky."
