        "Episode of Series \"Dr. Seuss video classics\". Don't give up! I believe in you all! A person's a person, no matter how small! The tiny who's are in big trouble! If stout hearted Horton the elephant can't prove that his miniature friends exist, they will be boiled in Beeze-Nut oil! A charming tale of friendship and perserverance narrated by Dustin Hoffman. Thidwick, the moose is the host who \"has to put up with all kind of pests, For a host, above all, must be nice to his guests!\" but the increasing burden of 500lbs of uninvited guests nestling in his antlers is solved only when he sheds them! Narrated by Merwyn Goldsmith, Ron Marshall and Larry Robinson."
