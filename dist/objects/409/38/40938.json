        "A re-make of the 1942 horror classic starring Nastassia Kinski, Malcolm McDowell and John Heard. Irena is a beautiful young woman on the brink of exploring her sexuality. The experience brings tragic consequences and pushes her towards her bizarre destiny as her past and present collide. The orginal story held that an ancient race of women mated with big cats in the dawn of time. To become human again after mating, the \"Cat people\" must kill. Irena, who is in love with a human is condemned to repeat the patterns of her ancestors."
