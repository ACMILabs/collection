        "Ann Bancroft and Patty Duke reprised their stage roles and won Academy Awards for their performances in \"The Miracle worker.\" Blind and deaf from an early childhood illness, Helen Keller lived in a world of solitude where animal instinct and a strong will enabled her to survive the dangers of everyday life. Annie Sullivan, a poor partially blind Irish girl, comes to the Keller mansion to teach Helen. She also has indomitable courage and strength but must struggle not only with Helen's enormous will, but against a family whose love and pity for their child is so great, it keeps her locked in a prison of darkness and ignorance. A moving film with outstanding performances. Based on the play by William Gibson and the lives of two incredible women."
