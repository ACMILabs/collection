        "Miffy, Dick Bruna's lovable white rabbit is off to the zoo with her father. They travel by train and see lots of animals. The seven other stories are: 1. The Christmas book. - 2. The Circus. - 3. Another story to tell. - 4. Miffy at the playground. - 5. Snuffy's puppies. - 6. The Fish. - 7. Poppy pig. The bold colours and solid shapes of the illustrations, accompanied by simple but entertaining stories make this highly suitable for young children."
