        "Forty thousand horsemen is set during World War 1 and deals with the exploits of the Australian Light Horse in Palestine. Chauvel's uncle, who led the actual charge at Beersheba, was the inspiration for this acclaimed historical recreation. The film is unapologetically intensly nationalistic, viewed through the eyes of three Anzacs, Red (Grant Taylor), Larry (Pat Twohill) and Jim (Chips Rafferty). This internationally successful film established Chips Rafferty's laconic bushman stereotype for which he became renown and established Chauvel as a world class director."
