        "Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's novel \"Do androids dream of electric sheep\" has rapidly become a classic of the science fiction genre. In Los Angeles, 2019, Deckard, a licensed-to-kill cop is given the task of tracking down and destroying a group of intelligent androids who have hijacked a space shuttle and returned to Earth. In the process Deckard has to confront disturbing questions about what makes a human being. \"A richly detailed and visually overwhelming trip to the future which sticks with you like a recurrent nightmare.\" Starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young."
