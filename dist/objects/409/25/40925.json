        "The second of the \"Star wars trilogy\" is a blacker film than the previous \"Star Wars.\" The Rebel Alliance, defeated by the Empire on the ice planet of Hoth, must seek refuge elsewhere in order to re-group. Luke Skywalker goes to the planet of Dagobah to complete his training with the Jedi Master, Yoda. Hans, Leia and Chewbacca escape, but the evil reach of the Empire means that a confrontation between good and evil is inevitable. Luke as a fledgling Jedi, must face Darth Vader, who uses a terrible secret and the power of the Dark Side of the Force, to lure Luke to destruction. Includes a ten minute interview between Leonard Maltin and George Lucas."
