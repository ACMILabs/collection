        "The Full Moon Ceremony, a real-life Adeli Penguin ritual requires that all bachelor penguins present a special pebble to their sweetheart. If she accepts, they are partners for life. Hubie, a shy penguin with a heart of gold, finds a perfect stone to present to his true love Marina. The evil Drake, another admirer casts a plot which sees Hubie expelled from the colony. Luckily as he is cast adrift into the wide world, he meets up with Rocko and together they begin the long journey back home. A life-long friendship develops and at last Hubie gets his girl."
