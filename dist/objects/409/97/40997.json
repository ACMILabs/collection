        "Ever wondered why the moon stays up, or why sound travels through air? Boffins do. This delightful series will entertain children from 4-7 and is a fun way to help explain the \"Laws of Nature.\" In kitchen cupboards throughout the world tiny creatures called Boffins are hard at work experimenting and discovering the scientific rules that govern the universe. Aristotle and Madame Curie are very close to some of the answers but the young Boffins from the house next door, Newton and Echo, are only interested in having fun. The episodes are: \"Wrong number\" (the nature of sound), \"No entry\" (the power of the lever), \"Over the moon\" (how to use pulleys) and \"Fridgestuff\" (magnetism)."
