        "For over 70 years the story of Russia's last Tsar, Nicholas II and his Empress, Alexandra has exercised a poignant magic. Presented by His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent, this documentary delves into the imperial archives held in Moscow and St Petersberg, once sealed by the Secret Police and forbidden to all but a handful of curators. The archives reveal intimate diaries and letters of the Romanovs, their photograph albums, records of state visits and political intrigue."
