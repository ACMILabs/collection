        "The story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table has inspired people for centuries. Arthur (Nigel Terry) has removed the magic sword Excalibur from the sacred stone and sets out to reunite the land as its King. Helen Mirren is the beautiful but sinister Morganna, Arthur's half-sister, and Nicol Williamson is Merlin. This timeless tale includes the search for the Holy Grail and the tragic love of Guinevere and Lancelot. Cast also includes Nicholas Clay, Cherie Lunghi, Paul Geoffrey."
