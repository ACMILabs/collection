        "Based on the brilliant novel by John Fowles, with the screenplay written by Harold Pinter, \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" is both a classic Victorian love story and an ironic look at an age of double-standard morality. Sarah Woodruff's chance meeting with Charles Smithson, a young man-about-town who subsequently discards his pretty young fiancee in a wave of passion, sets in motion a series of events that disrupts the quiet fishing and seaside village in England, and profoundly affects the lives of its residents."
