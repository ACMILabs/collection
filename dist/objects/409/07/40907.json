        "Episode of Series \"Dr. Seuss video classics\". King Yertle is not satisfied with just being King. He wants to rule over his land from a great height. Climbing on the backs of his turtle subjects in order to expand his kingdom, turns out to be a bad idea. Gertude McFuzz is envious of her pretty feathered friends and tries to find a magical solution. A rabbit and bear bicker and boast \"The Big brag\", until a wise old worm teaches them both a lesson! The three stories are delightfully narrated by actor John Lithgow."
