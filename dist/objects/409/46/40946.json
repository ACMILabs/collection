        "Simon (Matthew Ferguson), an adolescent at an elite Canadian boarding school, is looking forward to spending his Christmas holidays with his divorced parents. When he arrives in Toronto he discovers that his mother has been hospitalised and, for the first time, is told of her schizophrenia. This intimate drama, shot in the beautiful light of a north Canadian winter, is powerfully acted by Ferguson and by Judy Davis as the mother. Simon's growing awareness of his mother's illness results in his alienation from the concerns of his fellow classmates, and he becomes close to an older boy who initiates him into the rites of adulthood. This Australian, Canadian and Italian co-production was nominated for 6 AFI awards including Best Film."
