        "This breathtakingly visual film, the first feature by Carlo Carei, captures the emotions and arouses the senses. Since 1966, due to the depressed economy in southern Italy, kidnapping has become almost an alternative industry. Men, women and children, from the wealthy north are kidnapped and used as bartering chips by their merciless captors. Feuds develop between rival gangs. Many survive...others are not so fortunate. The story centres upon Vito, a young Italian child whose family are in the kidnapping business and are brutally murdered by a rival gang. He escapes on a perilous journey with the murderers in hot pursuit. Although \"Flight of the innocent\" is fictional, similar events to those depicted continue to occur. Italian dialogue. English subtitles."
