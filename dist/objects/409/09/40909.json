        "Episode of Series \"Dr. Seuss video classics\". When our young hero has trouble making up his mind, he is meet by a big bunch of hunches. Each of these peculiar creatures - Happy Hunch, Homework Hunch and Munch Hunch tries to tell him what to do. Dr. Suess warmly tackles indecision in his classic high-spirited style with narration by Brett Ambler and Larry Robinson. Young sleepyheads will giggle and yawn as Dr. Suess tallies the Who's-Asleep-Score. This outrageous assortment of sleepers and dreamers includes Snorter McPhail and his Snore-a-Snort Band and the World-Champion Sleep-Talkers, Jo and Mo Reed-Zoff. Narration by celebrated stage and screen star Madeline Kahn."
