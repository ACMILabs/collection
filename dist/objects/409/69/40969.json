        "Peter Allen's tragic death from AIDS, left the music world bereft of one of the most flamboyant and energetic entertainers. His music, particularly the song \"I still call Australia home\", touched the hearts of millions. This documentary looks at Peter's life and includes interviews with well-known celebrities, family and friends, and brings into focus some of the broader social issues associated with his life."
