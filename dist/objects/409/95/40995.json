        "Jane Austen's famous novel is brought to life in this vibrant, fresh adaptation. Full of energy, the script, performances, sets, locations and costume design are excellent, while the overall production veers away from the formality of previous adaptations. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are Darcy and Elizabeth and they are joined by a large and well-known cast including Barbara Leigh Hunt, Alison Steadman, Julia Sawalha and Susannah Harker. The underlying initial tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, develops into love, and their faults; pride on his part and prejudice on hers, blossoms into a deep and lasting mutual respect."
