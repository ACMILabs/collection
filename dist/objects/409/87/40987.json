        "Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is a Puerto Rican drug-lord who has been released from prison and is convinced he will begin a new life and remove himself from the violence of his criminal past. Filmed by thriller-master, Brian De Palma, \"Carlito's Way\" is both a fiery and fast-paced gangster film and a powerful study of an individual attempting to come to terms with the failures of his past. Pacino is outstanding as Carlito, and so is Sean Penn, as a coke-snorting lawyer who is enamoured by Carlito's past but ignorant of the dangers involved. This film is a more baroque and expansive treatment of the themes De Palma explored in his earlier \"Scarface\". This is an adult gangster movie. The disco-tinged score (the movie is set in the late-seventies), is by Jellybean Benitez and features some great Latin and salsa disco music."
