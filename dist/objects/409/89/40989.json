        "David Cronenberg's remake of the 1958 horror classic is not for the squeamish. Jeff Goldblum brings a quirky, common touch to the role of Seth Brundle, a brilliant scientist who develops a system to transport objects in a matter of seconds. Things go horribly wrong when Seth tries to transport himself and his genes become accidentally fused with those of a fly. His personality and physical abilities change dramatically and his life becomes a living nightmare as the insect half starts to take over. This masterful thriller with amazing special effects, won an Academy Award for Best Makeup. A nightmarish journey not easily forgotten."
