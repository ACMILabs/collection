        "A sly, funny \"survey\" of evolution from the earth's beginnings till now. Sophisticated enough to entrance adult audiences, this film's rollicking, outrageous humour will delight children. An intriguing discussion starter for biology and social studies courses. Finalist, American Film Festival 1981: Humour & Satire."
