        "A Long time ago in a galaxy far far away, George Lucas's space adventure captured the hearts and imaginations of film lovers of all ages from the moment these words scrolled across the screen. The Empire's evil Death Star must be destroyed. The heroes, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Hans Solo and a pair of droids named R2-D2 and C-3PO, as part of the Rebel Alliance must pit their strength against the might of the Empire and the evil Jedi, Darth Vader. With the help of an old Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi, they battle the forces of darkness and triumph. The special effects and famous \"Star wars\" theme music has ensured that this film takes its place in cinema history. Includes a ten minute interview between George Lucas and Leonard Maltin."
