        "Louisa May Alcott's popular novel is brought vividly to life in this second screen adaption of \"Little Women.\" The March sisters are Jo (June Allyson), Beth (Janet Leigh), Amy (a blonde Elizabeth Taylor) and Meg (child-star Margaret O'Brien). Their father has left for the Civil War, leaving the girls under the watchful eye of their mother (Mary Astor). Far removed from war and safe within their New England home, the \"little women\" are a closely-knit family and a picture of happiness. When Laurie (Peter Lawford), the grandson of a rich neighbor arrives, the orderly world of the March family is disrupted. The sisters are smitten by this handsome stranger and a story of romance, rivalry, love and loss follows. As the high spirited and determined Jo, June Allyson gives one of the finest performances of her career, ably supported by the superb ensemble cast. The film is beautifully crafted and deservedly received an Academy Award nomination for its exceptional cinematography. Co-starring Rossano Brazzi as Professor Bhaer."
