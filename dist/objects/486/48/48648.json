        "Episode number 4 of Series \"New York: a documentary film\". Episode 4: THE POWER AND THE PEOPLE (1898-1918) follows New York into the new century examining the interplay of capitalism, democracy and transformation, in the wake of an extraordinary wave of immigration, the building of the subway and the birth of the skyscraper. During a single generation, over 10 million immigrants arrived in New York. Arising from the plight of the city's most exploited citizens came reform legislation that would become the template for the New Deal. Narrated by David Ogden Stiers."
