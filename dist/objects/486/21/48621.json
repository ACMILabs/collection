        "A light-hearted look at several quirks in local road law. Short scenes dramatise the consequences of such laws, providing ample humour with: the New Hampshire ruling that when tow cars arrive at an intersection, neither can go until the other has passed; the New Mexico statute that forbids cars with \"inharmonious\" horns; the California law that forbids bicycles from over-taking firetrucks; and the Milwaukee by-law that states that no vehicle can park in one place for more than two hours unless it is attached to a horse."
