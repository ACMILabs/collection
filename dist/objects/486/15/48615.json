        "Mont Blanc at 15,781 feet is the highest mountain in Europe and a graveyard to many reckless climbers. Frederick Burlingham, the director/photographer of this film, has scaled Mont Blanc four times. This film shows close-ups of Mont Blanc through the eyes of a telescope, focusing on some of the areas where many mountaineers have perished. Includes footage of Aiguille de Midi, a precipitous needle of 12,606 feet and a climbing party on some very tall crags. Interesting film from a historical point of view, notably the way the climbing party are dressed and how they are just roped together - very different from today's climbers!"
