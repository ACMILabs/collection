        "Episode number 3 of Series \"New York: a documentary film\". Episode 3: SUNSHINE AND SHADOW (1865-1898) charts New York's history during the decades following the Civil War when it continued to grow demographically, geographically and financially at a staggering rate. It explores the incomparable fortunes of the robber barons at the unabashed corruption of political leaders in an era when the expansion of both wealth and poverty- and the schism between them- built to a complex. The episode ends with the consolidation of the five boroughs to form Greater New York on January 1, 1898. Narrated by David Ogden Stiers."
