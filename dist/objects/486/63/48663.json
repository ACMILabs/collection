        "Russ Meyer made famous this b-grade exploitation style of popular culture and in his films explored the people living on the edge or outside of the mainstream culture of the day. \"Faster Pussycat Kill! Kill!\" a cult classic centres around three women who are on a wild rampage of violence and revenge, a new breed of violence where sex is it's favourite mantle and terrorizing people the order of the day. These \"homicidal go-go's\" start their journey with a drag race across the desert followed by a violent showdown with local ranchers. The film is filled with hard-line one-liners, for example in answering the question \"What's the point?\" the ringleader vixen Varla (Tura Satana) replies \"The point is of no return, and you've just crossed it\". The second film \"Mondo Topless\" equally a cult classic is a montage of kinky topless go-go dancers accompanied with voice overs from the dancers talking about thier trade, motivations and views of their sexuality, (more titillating than informative - no pun intended)."
