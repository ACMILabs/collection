        "Dave is the usual gregarious 16 year-old. Baseball, homework and Susan, his current love, take most of his time. But when Susan suspects she is pregnant, Dave won't alter his schedule to discuss the problem. As he tells his friends, \"If she does get herself pregnant, it's not my problem.\" Only Jim, one of Dave's friends, tries to convince him that it is his problem...and his and Susan's. When Susan comes to the baseball field to talk with Dave, the reality of the situation suddenly becomes clear. They have some very important decisions to make...together."
