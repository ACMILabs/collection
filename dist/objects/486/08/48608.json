        "Episode of Series \"The Researchers\". CSIRO's research on pollution from chimney stacks: fly ash (a fine grey powder produced whenever coal is bunrt). Coal power stations conventionally use electrostatic precipitators to remove fly ash before its released into the atmosphere. The CSIRO has developed a more efficient containment of fly ash effectively reducing pollution and producing more ingredients for cement manufacture."
