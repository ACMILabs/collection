        "A stack of clay, flint and stone are taken to the Mill house to be ground. Then to the strip house for weighing of the ingredients, sieving, and plugging the clay. Often the clay is passed to the potters for throwing and turning. The product is then dried and placed into an oven. This is followed by painting and glazing. Other items are passed to the gilders where only the best gold is used, and then to the burnishing shop. A museum contains many specimens up to the present day."
