        "America in the 1950's was a time of catchphrases such as counter culture, Elvis, African American beebop and the Beat Generation. This program looks specifically at Jack Kerouac and the influence of jazz music on his writing; Elvis and the influence of Memphis; the advent of the youth market, and the quest for independence embraced in film, literature and music. Features interviews with B.B King, Jim Dickinson, Billy Walker, Sam Phillips, Joyce Johnson, Sterling Lord, Michael McClure, Alfred Leslie and Maggie Warwick. Narrated by Michael Ontkean."
