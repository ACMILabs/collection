        "Episode number 1 of Series \"New York: a documentary film\". Episode 1: THE COUNTRY AND THE CITY (1609-1825) charts the development of the city founded by the Dutch as a purely commercial enterprise, first as New Amsterdam, a freewheeling enclave of trade; then as the British New York a colony fuelled by slavery and a pivotal locale in the American Revolution; and ultimately as the city of New York; the nation's capital and the place destined to define urban life in America and American ideals. Narrated by David Ogden Stiers."
