        "Adapted from the 1943 novel by Ayn Rand, this film focuses on a four-cornered conflict of egoism between architect Roark (inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright), a newspaper magnate, his daughter, and an opposed, socialistically inclined architecture critic. The combination of Rand's one-dimensionally didactic dialogue, Vidor's engagement with the theme of the spirituality of creativity, his proclivity for soaring love-hate sexuality, and an architectural vision in the design, make this a deliriously extreme celebration of individualism in American cinema. Cast includes Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, Raymond Massey, Kent Smith and Robert Douglas."
