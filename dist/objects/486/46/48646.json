        "Episode number 2 of Series \"New York: a documentary film\". Episode 2: ORDER AND DISORDER (1825-1865) chronicles New York's commercial revolution triggered by the construction of the Erie Canal that transformed it from merchant city to industrial metropolis. A massive wave of German and Irish immigration turned the city into one of the world's most complex urban environments, bringing with it a host of social problems. It follows New York's growth as a cultural centre and multi-ethnic port, concluding with the Civil War Draft Riots- America's bloodiest civil disturbance. Narrated by David Ogden Stiers."
