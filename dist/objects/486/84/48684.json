        "Set in post war small town New Zealand, \"The Scarecrow\" is a suspenseful tale told through the eyes of adolescent Ned (Jonathan Smith). He and his friend Les (Daniel McLaren) become involved in the diabolical actions of the Scarecrow (John Carradine). With several mysterious deaths and near misses, the story reaches a climax, only to leave the audience with an unexpected finale. Based on a novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson, \"The Scarecrow\" is the feature debut of director Sam Pillsbury. The film is full of telling and often comic details of life in the small community. Gothic elements are highlighted by the presence of the Scarecrow and insistence upon the eccentric. Cast also includes Tracy Mann."
