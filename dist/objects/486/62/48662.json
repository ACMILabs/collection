        "Ray is the toughest gangster in North London, although he is preoccupied with thoughts of his upcoming marriage to Sadie and his favourite pastime, karaoke. Postman Jonny, bored with his job, wants to join Ray's gang and enlists the help of his best friend, Jude, who also happens to be Ray's nephew. Jude is unenthusiastic but sets up the meeting instead. Ray takes Jonny on, using his position as postman to steal credit cards. Jonny quickly becomes bored and, desperate for some real action, starts a feud between Ray's gang and a tough South London gang. Cast includes Jonny Lee Miller, Jude Law, Ray Winstone, Sadie Frost and Rhys Ifans."
