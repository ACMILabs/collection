        "Episode of Series \"Daria\". The unlikely heroine of this offbeat animated MTV series is a cynical and quick witted teenage outsider named Daria Morgendorffer. Her cutting barbs are of course a way of coping with her vacuous teenage sister, her indifferent parents and the cliquey high school she attends which would be complete hell if it wasn't for her like minded best friend, Jane. In this compilation the focus is on Daria's begrudging affection for the swoon worthy Trent and his band Mystik Spiral. Episodes include: ROAD WORRIER; PIERCE ME; LANE MISERABLES."
