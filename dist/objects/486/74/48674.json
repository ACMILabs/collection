        "Episode number 5 of Series \"New York: a documentary film\". Episode 5: Cosmopolis (1919-1931) examines the roaring twenties, a period when New York finished assembling the components of a mass consumer society and emerged as the cultural capital of the world. In this short but dazzling period, New York became the focal point of an extraordinary array of human and cultural energies, reaching its highest levels of urban excitement and glamour. This episode also considers the African-American experience and the rise of new media industries. The series concludes with the skyscraper war, the stock market rise, the Crash, and- in the deafening silence that followed- the building of the Empire State Building, the greatest icon on the New York skyline. Narrated by David Ogden Stiers."
