        "Fascinating birds abound in India. On the water there are storks, spoonbills, ibis, pelicans which are varied as to color, size and the shape of their beaks. Quiet except during the breeding season in contrast to others which chatter constantly, such as seagulls migrating from Europe. The monsoon heralds the mating season, when storks choose partners, court each other with dances and build nests for their young in trees or on the water in the reeds or on mounds, like the flamingoes, whose chicks change color as they grow up far from human habitation."
