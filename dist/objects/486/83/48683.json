        "Four episodes of 'The Simpsons' originally screened during 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1998 and featuring the guest voices of Michelle Pfeiffer, Pamela Reed, Sara Gilbert and Winona Ryder. \"The Last temptation of Homer\" (Prods: Mike Scully, Jonathan Collier, David Sacks, John Swartwelder, Richard Raynis, dir: Carlos Baeza): A sexy new employee, Mindy Simomons (Pfeiffer), joins the plant as a dangerous emissions supervisor and token female on staff. Homer struggles to fight the instant attraction of his feminine counterpart but his willpower will be tested when they are forced to spend time together alone at an Energy Convention. Bart becomes a nerd thanks to the addition of prescribed coke bottle glasses and orthotic shoes. \"Bart after dark\" (Prods: David S. Cohen, Richard Appel, J. Michael Mendel, Richard Raynis, David Silverman, dir: Dominic Polcino): Marge, Lisa and Maggie make their way to Baby Seal beach to help clean up an oil spill, leaving Bart and Homer home alone. Bart finds himself working in a Bordello as penance for property damage and Marge leads a movement to close it on her return. The episode culminates in \"We put the spring in Springfield\" show tune. \"New kid on the block\" (Prods: Jon Vitti, John Swartzwelder, Jeff Martin, Conan O'Brien, Frank Mula, dir: Wes Archer): Bart falls in love with his new next door neighbour, Laura (Sara Gilbert), but is disappointed to hear she has fallen for Jimbo. Homer sues The Frying Dutchman for false advertising of the term \"all you can eat\". \"Lisa's rival\" (Prods: Jonathan Collier, Mike Scully, David Sacks, David W. Joseph, A Boucher, Richard Raynis, dir: Mark Kirkland): Lisa becomes jealous of new student Alison Taylor (Winona Ryder) who's younger, smarter and seems destined to win the Diarama-rama. Meanwhile, Homer tries to sell off a huge pile of sugar."
