        "Once remote from the world's mineral markets, the Canadian North is rapidly changing. This film shows what is happening as government and private interests work to develop the North's mineral resources and to build the roads, railways and airfields that will bring the wealth to market. One new frontiersman seen in the film is a young geologist whose company in Japan seeks the North's copper."
