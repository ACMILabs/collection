        "Short animation with some live action and songs. A gang of pirates hold s young damsel hostage. She is rescued when the US navy sends a convoy of warships to destroy the pirates. They then sing a tribute to the glorious red, white and blue. Story is framed by having two characters of indeterminate species reading the story of the pirate ship. The female asks the male if he would rescue her they way the story hero recused the damsel. He says he would."
