        "Based on the Thomas Harris novel \"Red Dragon\", \"Manhunter\" is the first film to feature serial killer and cannibal Hannibal Lecter who was to achieve infamy in the 'sequel' to \"Manhunter\", \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (the two films bear no relationship to each other either in terms of cast or creative crew). Mann, whose film work is infused with a highly chic aesthetic, came to prominence in the 1980s with the \"designer\" detective series, \"Miami Vice\". Like the groundbreaking series, \"Manhunter\" features sophisticated and minimalist production design as well as a glam metallic rock music score. But it also features a dazzling array of truly terrifying and memorable characters who personify the dark forces of evil and cruelty. Brian Cox is a suitably erudite and chilling Hannibal Lecter while Tom Noonan brings a perverse child-like menace in his portrayal of a psychopathic cannibal. Mann's fast paced direction never allows the pace to drag and the scenario that is unveiled makes for a truly unsettling and horrific movie experience. Cast also includes William Peterson as the hero on the cannibal's trail."
