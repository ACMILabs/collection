    "description": [
        "A memory film set in Belfast in 1981 during the IRA hunger strikes which led to the death and eventual martyrdom of Bobby Sands. Quiet and powerful, '81' contains multiple points of view, alternating between Catholic and Protestant, women and men, youth and adults. What lingers and what haunts are the vivid stark images of the prisoners' gaunt faces on the television sets; the determined set of Thatcher's jaw; Bobby Sands' eyes staring out from the posters glued haphazardly on the Belfast streets."
