        "There are estimated to be over four million guns in Australia - one for every fourth person. This documentary introduces a group of men who share a passion for guns. They revere their high powered rifles, their antique pistols and their customised hand guns. The guns are as different as their owners but these men have a common belief in their right to own guns."
