        "Episode of Series \"Blood brothers (A)\". In order to combat the influence of western culture the elders of the Warlpiri people, led by Darby Jampijinpa Ross, a noted Aboriginal artist, decided to perform a fire ceremony which tells the story of Yarripiri's journey. Yarripiri is both a real person and an incarnation of a dreamtime spirit. This video documents the preparations for the ceremony, the ceremony itself, the story the ceremony recreates and the problems the people have in performing it. Narrated by Kev Carmody."
