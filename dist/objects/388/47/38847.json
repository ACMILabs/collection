        "5% of prisoners in Australian prisons are women. 85% of these are in prison for drug-related crimes. In this film the women of Northfield Prison Complex in South Australia, prisoners, warders, psychologists, recount their experiences. The specific problems of women - the care of children, familial attitudes, low self-esteem are highlighted as is the lack of rehabilitation which leads to 65% recidivism."
