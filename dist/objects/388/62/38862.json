        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Shape of the world\". A new continent is discovered and the shape of the world is changed yet again. To begin with, the discovery of America, was merely a step in finding a new route to the east. However with Cortes and his expeditions inland, the Europeans discovered a new civilisation and new riches in the form of gold. The Spanish, Portuguese, English and French exploited this wealth and eventually settled the continent. Meanwhile the Dutch established their empire in the east, and discovered Australia. Mapmaking took a giant step forward with the discovery of longitude."
