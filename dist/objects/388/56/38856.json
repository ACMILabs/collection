        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Millennium: tribal wisdom and the modern world\". How do tribal societies maintain social order and harmony without the vast legal and Government institutions that we rely on? This program invites the viewer to contrast the western forms of state to the tribal practice of democracy through consensus. We travel to Canada to witness the struggles of the Objiwa-Cree and Mohawk tribes against the Canadian Federal Government and to understand how their visions of the world can help us refine our definitions of democracy, pluralism and the state."
