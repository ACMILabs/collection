        "Episode number 22 of Series \"Faces of culture\". Folk art is made by ordinary people. One function of folk art is to express ethnicity and this is nowhere more dramatically evident than amongst the descendants of the black slaves and the North American Indians at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Neighbourhood groups organise themselves into tribes and spend many weeks in preparing elaborate costumes which are paraded in rivalry to the main parade in downtown New Orleans. The costumes are works of art whose designs are often symbolic and confer status on the wearers. The tradition has endured for over a hundred years yet is forever evolving."
