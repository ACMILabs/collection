        "Part 3. Sex and emotion uncovers the complex interplay between hormones, experience and emotional behaviour and poses the question \"In a world past the bomb, are we still unconsciously toughening our boys for hand to hand combat? and in a world past the pill, are our girls still being reared for a lifetime of childbearing?\" \"Part 4. Sex and society\" Out in the world, as opposed to alone, the contrast between the sexes is striking. This episode traces the development of boys and girls from birth to discover how the gulf between masculine and feminine behaviour is created. The programs are interspersed with comments from ordinary people as well as experts to show the wide range of opinion from stereotype to enlightened."
