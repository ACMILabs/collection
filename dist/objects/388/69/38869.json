        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Columbus and the age of discovery\". In this episode, guided by Columbus' own logbook, a US yacht, the \"Westward\", crewed by a team of researchers, recreates Columbus' travels in the Bahamas. At dawn on October 12, 1492, the Spanish ships first sighted land, now believed to be the island of San Salvador, where Columbus first met the native people he named Indians, convinced he had reached the east coast of Asia. The voyage continues to Cuba (which Columbus believed to be Japan or China), to Haiti and to the reef on which the flagship, Santa Maria, was wrecked. Returning in triumph to Spain in April 1493, Columbus could never have foreseen the impact his voyage of discovery was to make on world history."
