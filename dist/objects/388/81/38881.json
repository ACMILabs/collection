        "Episode number 26 of Series \"Faces of culture\". In this last program of the series, anthropologist and producer of the series Ira R. Abrams, leads a discussion with two other anthropologists, Napoleon A. Chagnon and Laura Nader on the future of anthropology. Is the subject matter of anthropology disappearing or simply changing? What are the ethical consequences of the anthropologist's work? Where does the future of anthropology lie? The ideas discussed are various and fascinating, and in the light of recent developments in world power structures, and in the Amazonian jungles, timely and thought provoking too."
