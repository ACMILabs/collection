        "Episode of Series \"Blood brothers (A)\". Interspersed with video clips from his protest album \"Pillars of society\" Kev Carmody talks about his life and music. Born in Goronba, Queensland, on a cattle station, the son of an Irish stockman and his Aboriginal wife, Carmody spent his early years living off the land, but absorbing western culture through the ABC and old records. Taken away from his parents at the age of ten, he was put in a Christian school and sent home twice a year. After several years working at various menial jobs, whilst developing his music he eventually gained a Ph.D in Australian history, using oral material and methods rather than a written thesis. A fascinating portrait of a committed man."
