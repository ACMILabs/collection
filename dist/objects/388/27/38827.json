        "The tantric tradition of sensual spirituality was an esoteric and mystical religious tradition which flourished in Ancient India and China. The tantric rites of sexuality are now finding a new wave of adherents among the \"new agers\" of the post-industrial West. This video explores the sexual research and experimentation taking place in cities such as Berlin, New York, Aspen and San Francisco by western people attempting the difficult reconciliation of erotic desires and spiritual fulfilment when they have been raised in a Christian culture which fundamentally opposes the spirit and the body. From a \"Sluts and Goddess\" workshop hosted by famous dominatrix Annie Sprinkler, to a \"Rebirthing and Sexuality\" conference in Hawaii, \"Sacred Sex\" explores the new forms of pagan and Eastern philosophies being popularised in the West."
