        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Columbus and the age of discovery\". Beginning with the 1992 project to recreate the ships used by Columbus on his famous voyage of discovery, this episode takes us through the period of preparation preceding Columbus' voyage - the reason behind the development of his belief that Cathay (China) could be reached by sailing west rather than east; his training in maritime cartography in Lisbon; and his voyage to Portuguese west Africa where he experienced first hand the fabulous wealth possible from the gold and slave trades. Undeterred by the Portuguese king's rejection of his proposal for the voyage west, Columbus turned to the Spanish throne to fund his dream."
