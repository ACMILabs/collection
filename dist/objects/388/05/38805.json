        "Episode of Series \"We all have tales\". Practically anything would be improved by becoming gold, he thought, except perhaps for gold itself Thus an ill-considered wish sets in motion this classic legend of ancient Greece in which King Midas discovers that there are some things in life even more precious than gold. Narrated by Michael Caine, with music by Ellis Marsalis."
