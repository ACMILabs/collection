        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Millennium: tribal wisdom and the modern world\". What does it mean to find one's place in the cosmos? What are the different ways that western societies and tribal cultures seek to elevate their lives from the ordinary world into the extraordinary? In this program, accompany the Huichol people of Mexico on their annual pilgrimage to collect peyote, the food of the gods, and visit the house of a Navajo medicine man who invites the spirits into his world through sand painting, chanting and 'walking in beauty'. Then follow David Maybury-Lewis into an examination of why modernisation can be viewed as secularisation and what the consequences of this means to western people."
