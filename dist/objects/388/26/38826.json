        "Broadmeadows, in Melbourne's northern suburbs, is Australia's largest public housing estate, with the largest concentration of single parent families in the country. The young mothers featured in this video all participate in the activities of the Broadmeadows Women's House, a drop-in centre which provides child-care and peer support. For most of the women, who have been deserted by their partners and families, the centre provides an opportunity to regain confidence and self-esteem. The women discuss their struggles with abusive partners, a suspicious welfare system and a general community which treats single parents with prejudice and a lack of compassion. This excellent video explores the lives of teenage single mothers with clear-headed insight and on the women's own terms."
