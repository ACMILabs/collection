        "This film 'biopic' portrays the life of composer Sigmund Romberg, whose scores included \"The Desert Song\" and \"Maytime\". While Broadway swings to the jazzy beat of ragtime, Romberg chooses to play the beautiful waltzes of his native country. When Romberg is convinced by the owner of the Cafe Vienna to try his hand at ragtime he writes a hit song in no time at all. Romberg writes one smash hit after another and eventually creates a hit show that takes Broadway by storm. Based on the book by Elliot Arnold. Stars Jose Ferrer, Merle Oberon, Helen Traubel, Walter Pidgeon with special guest appearances by Ann Miller, Rosemary Clooney, Cyd Charisse, Gene Kelly and Howard Keel."
