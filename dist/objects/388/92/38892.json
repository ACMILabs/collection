        "In 1991 an ABC film crew spent six weeks following the police in Redfern, a suburb of Sydney - a predominantly working class area with a large Aboriginal and migrant population. The police in this documentary are general duty officers mainly on mobile patrols in the Redfern area. This reveals police attitudes and shows how they deal with people of different ethnic backgrounds and a range of offences."
