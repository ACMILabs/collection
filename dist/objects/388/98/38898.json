        "Episode of Series \"Blood brothers (A)\". Charles Perkins grew up in Alice Springs where segregation was the rule. Sent away to Adelaide for an education he became increasingly aware of the injustices perpetrated against Australian Aborigines. In 1965, the first Aborigine to attend university, he instigated the \"Freedom ride\" - a busload of concerned people, mostly students, who visited outback Australia, notably Walgett and Moree, to escalate the level of public awareness of racial intolerance in Australia. This video documents that journey and talks to those who took part."
