        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Shape of the world\". Heaven and earth traces the way in which mankind's earliest ideas of the world emerged - sometimes from imagination, sometimes from scientific observation, often from the need of rulers to know their domains in detail. It looks at the earliest concepts of the world's shape, from Pythagoras, Eristosthenes, and Ptolomy, whose work was rediscovered as the Renaissance flowered, to the ancient Chinese who developed quite different ideas about the shape of the world. Narrated and introduced by Patrick Stewart."
