        "Based on Dostoyevsky's masterful story of greed, vindictiveness and lust, \"The Brothers Karamazov\" brings 19th century Czarist Russia to life in a lavish dramatic production. Karamazov, is the father of four wildly disparate sons: a sterile intellectual, the saintly Alexey, an illegitimate schemer and the feckless oldest son, Dmitri who is in love with the same elusive woman as his father. They all stand to gain an inheritance from their father and together they weave a web of intrigue and murder. A wonderfully woven tale of sin and salvation, the film stars Yul Brynner, Maria Schell, Lee J. Cobb, Claire Bloom, Richard Basehart and William Shatner."
