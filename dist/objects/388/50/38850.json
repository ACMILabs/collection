        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Millennium: tribal wisdom and the modern world\". Who are you? Where does your individual identity begin and end? While Western Societies strive to answer these questions through a biological view... conception, birth, adolescence, maturity and death... tribal cultures define identity by the myths and rituals of their society, by the people who rear them and by an organic continuum to which they belong. Explore these views of life and death through scenes taken from the family life of an abortion counsellor in Toronto, a boy's initiation into manhood in a Brazilian Xavante tribe, a high school girl's attempted, suicide and an Indonesian Sumbanese tribesman's relationship to his dead relatives. Narrated by David Maybury-Lewis."
