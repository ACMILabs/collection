        "Episode of Series \"A Travellers' guide to the Orient\". The island republic of Singapore has a diverse and rich culture due to the historic importance of its port, and because of its multicultural population. This video explores the Indian and Chinese sections of the Island City, as well as taking us to the Malay fishing village of Pulan Seking. We visit the world famous zoological gardens and are taken on a lunch with orang-outangs. As well as visiting historic sites, we look at the variety of dazzling shops situated in the very modern city centre of Singapore."
