        "Set in an era rife with bloody raids, gory sword battles and brutal acts of violence, this is the saga of the loves and lusts of the fierce Norse raiders who swept over Europe bringing death and destruction over a thousand years ago. Leading an all-star cast is Kirk Douglas as Einar, hot-blooded, hedonistic son of the Viking chieftain Ragnar (Ernest Borgnine). Years before, Ragnar had molested the British Queen Enid, murdered her husband and left her with child. Enid had secretly sent the baby away to protect the rightful heir from the Viking invaders. Twenty years later, the child grows up to become the proud slave, Eric (Tony Curtis), whose true identity - and love for the Welsh princess Morgana (Janet Leigh) - forces him into an inevitable, climactic showdown with his vicious half-brother, Einar. The authentically staged raids and magnificently filmed panoramas of the Norwegian Fjords and the rugged French coast make this a spectacular and thrilling adventure tale."
