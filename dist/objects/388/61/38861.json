        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Shape of the world\". By the Middle Ages, seamen of many civilisations had sailed long distances, but had little success in accurately gauging the distances from place to place or in linking their homelands with more remote destinations. For the country that succeeded in charting and controlling the seas, the rewards would be wealth, power and empire. New maps and sea charts became secret weapons in an elaborate trade war, centred on the spice islands of Molucca and fought between Portugal, Spain and France."
