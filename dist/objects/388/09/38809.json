        "The third talkie version of Alexander Dumas famed story of D'Artagnan - a young man seeking his fortune in 17th Century France. MGM created a splashy production with an all-star cast for this swashbuckling adventure movie, filmed in Technicolor. Gene Kelly gives the impression of having a fabulous time playing the title role of a young anti-authoritarian upstart, a talented swordsman with an eye for attractive ladies of the Court. D'Artagnan joins the three musketeers, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, in order to save their beleageared queen from disgrace. To do so they much face the Machiavellian Milady De Winter and Richelieu. The film, a curious mix of melodrama and burlesque, was one of the top earning films of 1948."
