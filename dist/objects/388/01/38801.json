        "Episode of Series \"We all have tales\". Narrated by Michael Palin and illustrated with the pictures of Edward Sorel this comic version of the English folktale tells how Jack foolishly sells his family's cow for a handful of magic beans. Overnight they grow into the proverbial beanstalk that reaches up beyond the blue sky itself, leading Jack into a hilarious series of misadventures with a dimwitted ogre and his extra large spouse. Music is by Dave Stewart."
