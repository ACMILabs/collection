        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Columbus and the age of discovery\". Gold was not the main bounty resulting from Columbus' voyages of discovery. Rather it was the exchange of plants and animals between the Old and the New Worlds that were to be his most permanent legacy. In this program we see how the horses, cattle and wheat, introduced to the Americas by the Spaniards, were to transform the great American grasslands and the lives of the plain's Indians and provided the basis for the American cowboy and ranching traditions. American plants which were to transform European and African agriculture included corn, chili peppers, tobacco, peanuts, tomatoes, pumpkins and cassava but the crop which had the greatest impact was the potato which became a staple of the European poor, especially the Irish. Finally, a human import to the Americas, the black African slave, transformed the American population."
