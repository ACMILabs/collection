        "Episode number 2 of Series \"On the eighth day: perfecting Mother Nature\". The day a baby can be genetically made-to-measure is still far away, but it is rapidly moving from the realm of fantasy to that of probability. \"Making perfect babies\" offers a critical examination of the genetic technology and its potential applications and raises important questions about why the technology is being developed and how it may affect the lives of women and society as a whole. Includes interviews with scientist and feminist Ruth Hubbard and disability activist Marsha Saxton."
