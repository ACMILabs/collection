        "David Attenborough narrates this film which encapsulates eighteen eventful months in the lives of a herd of elephants, led by their matriarch, Echo from the birth of her crippled son to the end of a drought. Cynthia Moss who has dedicated many years to the study of this particular herd captures the complex rules and customs that govern the day to day existence of the elephants as they journey endlessly against the stunning backdrop of Kilimanjaro, searching relentlessly for food, water, safety and mates."
