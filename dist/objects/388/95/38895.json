        "Episode of Series \"Blood brothers (A)\". In 1958, as a result of a forced confession, an inability to read or write English and the racial intolerance of the police and the community of the time, Rupert Max Stuart, an itinerant, half-caste Aborigine, was sentenced to hang for the rape and murder of a nine year old girl. Using dramatisation, archival film and interviews with those involved, including Stuart himself, this video charts the trial, appeals and subsequent attempts to overthrow the conviction."
