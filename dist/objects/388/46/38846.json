        "Various systems of hydroponics (growing plants without soil) have been used for centuries, from The Hanging Gardens of Babylon to the vegetable growing rafts of the Aztecs. Using hydroponics, plants grow quicker, there are no soil-borne diseases and no weeds. In this video, Gary Evans, editor of Practical Hydroponics Magazine explains in detail and demonstrates the management of nutrient solutions, hydroponic growing media, transplanting from soil to hydroponics, lighting systems, circulating and non-recirculating systems and propagating from cuttings. Includes hydroponics plant guide."
