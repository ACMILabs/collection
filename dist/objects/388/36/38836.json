        "Episode of Series \"Carry on\". Britain's favourite comedy team \"carry on\" as they only know how! \"Carry on Doctor\" looks at life in a country hospital when the patients revolt against the staff. Hattie Jacques is the fearsome Matron, Kenneth Williams the cold-hearted Doctor Tinkle, while Sid James as the malingerer Mr. Roper, takes a vacation in hospital. A madcap romp of bandages and stethoscopes, Frankie Howard as Mr. Bigger hams it up while Charles Hawtrey gives an unforgettable performance as an expectant father suffering all the symptoms of pregnancy."
