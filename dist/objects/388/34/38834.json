        "Dr. Norman Swan narrates this four part series on the differences between men and women. \"Part 1. Sex and gender\" investigates sexuality and what makes people sexually attractive to each other, concluding that more than the sum of genes, hormones and upbringing is involved. \"Part 2. Sex and ability\" poses the question \"is there such a thing as a male or female brain?\" and examines the latest research on the brain. Each program is interspersed with the personal views of ordinary people as well as experts, to demonstrate the range from stereotype to enlightened."
