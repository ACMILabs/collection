        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Millennium: tribal wisdom and the modern world\". While western society relegates aesthetics to specialists, in tribal cultures, where they have no word for 'art' or 'artist', views of life and death are traditionally expressed in everyday dances, clothes, sculptures and paintings. In this episode, travel with program narrator, David Maybury- Lewis to the Wodaabe tribe of Niger and the Dogon peoples of Mali to witness the ways they celebrate life and death with acts of beauty and grace. Meet an HIV positive Canadian artist who shows us his way of connecting his art to the meaning of life and death."
