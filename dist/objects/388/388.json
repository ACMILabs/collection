        "'Hurt' is an extraordinary project in which film and video cameras were put in the hands of 250 under-privileged young people from rural regions of northern New South Wales and Western Victoria. The basic materials derived from this process comprised hundreds of poignant, beautiful, cruel and comforting stories. Filmmakers Phillip Crawford and Matthew Priestly from youth arts organization BIG hART worked with the young people to create an AFI award winning film, 'Hurt' in which fragmented, poetic and haunting stories of isolation and hardship are told through the words and images created by the young artists. In this new ACMI commissioned project filmmakers from BIG hART have turned the material into a multi-screen spatial installation that puts the viewer into the midst of this fragmented world of broken lives, beauty and bravery."
