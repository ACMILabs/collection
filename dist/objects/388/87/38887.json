        "A woman with a disability retains both her sexuality and her right to seek, develop and sustain a relationship with the partner of her choice. In this documentary, four disabled women from across Canada share their personal experiences and raise important issues including sexuality, self-esteem, stereotyping and parenting. It is their opportunity to say, \"this is the way it is and not the way you think it is\"."
