        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Shape of the world\". Science is often employed in the service of politics, but rarely more directly or more absolutely than it was in the Great Trigonometric Survey of India. In 1802 a British surveying team began a massive project to map the whole of India, which ended in the Himalayas, with the discovery of Mount Everest, fifty years later. They used methods of triangulation perfected in France under Louis XIV and employed hundreds of surveyors. The survey was instrumental in helping Britain dominate the Indian sub-continent. Narrated by Patrick Stewart."
