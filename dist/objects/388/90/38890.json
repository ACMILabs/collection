        "Against a backdrop of bookcovers from lurid lesbian pulp novels, \"Forbidden Love\" paints a compelling and often hilarious portrait of lesbian sexuality and survival in Canada in the 1950's and 60's when lesbian love was consigned to the twilight world of silence and exile. Ten women tell their own stories of first loves and life in the clandestine subculture with the candour of true survivors. Due to the explicit nature of certain scenes, viewer discretion is advised."
