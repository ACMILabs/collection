        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Shape of the world\". Modern mapping technologies enable us to compile information on everything from earthquakes, AIDS epidemics and mineral exploration to the structure of the human brain. The mapping of our planet's physical features is now complete, but its future well-being is largely in our hands. Using remote sensing technologies we can map changes in the natural world, and chart the warning signals - but will we use this knowledge to prevent disaster before it is too late?"
