        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Millennium: tribal wisdom and the modern world\". How do we balance our personal desires for romance with our societal need for stable marriages? Explore how marriages in tribal societies challenge Western ideas and sensibilities and yet are moral in the tribal world. Then through scenes of a Toronto couple's marriage, explore the uncertainties that characterise marriages in Western societies. With the thoughtful analysis of David Maybury-Lewis, understand how individuals can discover a balance between personal desires and societal needs in the context of a loving and nurturing family."
