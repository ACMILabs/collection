        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Millennium: tribal wisdom and the modern world\". All societies survive by manipulating nature, but while tribal cultures seek harmony with nature, Western societies try to control it, often with devastating consequences. Learn how the Makuna of Colombia pass on their sophisticated ecological awareness from generation to generation through complex myths and rituals. Understand how the views of tribal people contrast with the evolutionary ideas handed down to the modern world from the Bible. Then meet a gardener in Canada, who exemplifies the new attitudes Western cultures will need to ensure humanity's survival on earth."
