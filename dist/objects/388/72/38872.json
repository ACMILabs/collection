        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Columbus and the age of discovery\". Was Columbus a hero or a villain? In this final episode of the series made to mark the quincentenary of Columbus' discovery of the Americas we follow the fourth and last voyage of Columbus in 1502. Columbus was mistaken about the identity of the continent he discovered, but not about the historical significance of his discoveries. This program chronicles the later explorers who benefited from Columbus' voyage west (Magellan, John Cabot, Pedro Alvarez Cabral and Americi Vespucci) and assesses the legacy, both positive and negative, of the resulting Spanish and Portuguese colonisation of the Americas and what Columbus signifies for Americans today."
