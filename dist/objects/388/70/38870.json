        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Columbus and the age of discovery\". Columbus and the conquistadors that followed him came to the Americas armed with the sword and the cross, plus a more invisible ally - disease, all potent weapons that destroyed the ancient Indian cultures and created a new people. In this episode we follow Columbus on his second voyage of colonisation in 1493. Leading a fleet of 17 ships and 1400 men, Columbus dreamed of wealth and Christian converts, but he failed to find gold and his mismanagement of the colony led to his imprisonment and return in shame to Spain in 1500. The program then turns to a more \"successful\" conqueror, Cortes, who defeated and enslaved the Aztecs of Mexico. The program also dramatically charts the deadly impact of Spanish weapons and disease on the Indian population and the efforts by committed Christians like Bartolone de las Casas to end the enslavement of the Indians."
