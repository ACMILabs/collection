        "Tina Dalton dedicates this film \"to the gentle leviathans of the sea, whose beauty and innocence have awakened me.\" Aboard the Tall Ship \"Anna Kristina\", a team of scientists and Tina observe and interact with Humpback Whales of Platypus Bay. This video captures rare images of these giants, leaping out of the water in a spectacular display of strength and grace, interacting with Tina in a special show of trust and males fighting for mating supremacy. Share the joy with a team of rescuers as they save a stranded whale."
