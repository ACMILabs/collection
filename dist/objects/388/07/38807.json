        "Based on Sir Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte D'Arthur\", this is a tale of chivalry, honour, tragic love and intrigue. At the famous Round Table, established by Arthur to uphold peace, justice and chivalry, sits the gallant Lancelot, Percival and the evil Modred, consort to Arthur's half-sister, Morgan Le Fay, who is determined to snatch the crown and bring chaos to the realm. The powerful Merlin can do nothing to circumvent the futile love between Lancelot and Queen Guinevere, the consequences of which will not only split the kingdom, but destroy the friendship between the King and his most trusted Knight. All the pageantry and splendour of the age are here. Cast includes: Robert Taylor, Ava Gardner, Mel Ferrer, Anne Crawford, Stanley Baker and Felix Aylmer."
