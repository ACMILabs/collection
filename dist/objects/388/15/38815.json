        "A sea-going whodunit where the intrepid Miss Marple finds herself investigating events on the HMS Battledore, a navy training ship designed to give young hoodlums a chance at new lives. Miss Marple discovers some-one is training the delinquents to be good thieves instead of good citizens and is willing to kill to keep the fact quiet! Murder Ahoy features a rogues gallery of suspects and ingenious means of despatching victims including strychnine-laced snuff, a poisoned mousetrap and a noose from a yard-arm. Starring Margaret Rutherford, Lionel Jeffries and Stringer Davis."
