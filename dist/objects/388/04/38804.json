        "Episode of Series \"We all have tales\". A scary Japanese tale from this multi-award winning series. It tells the story of the smallest child of a peasant family left in the care of the local priest. \"Do not forget\" his mother said to him, \"avoid large places at night; keep to small\". With only these words to guide him, and his only talent of drawing cats, he sets out into the famine-ravaged countryside that is haunted by the spectre of a mysterious demon. Narrated by William Hurt with music by Mark Isham. Drawings and adaptation by David Johnson."
