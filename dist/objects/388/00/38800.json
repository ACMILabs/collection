        "Episode of Series \"We all have tales\". Long ago in Russia, a proclamation went out across all the land that whosoever could build a flying ship would win the hand of the Tsar's daughter. But when a country fool and his absurd crew of superhuman \"Moujiks\" arrive in their wacky airship, the dumbfounded Tsar has second thoughts. Narrated by Robin Williams with music by The Klezmer Conservatory Band."
