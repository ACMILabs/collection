        "As a young pup in Scotland, Lassie grows to be an extraordinary sheepdog. Tragedy strikes however, when her beloved master (Donald Crisp) is killed by beggars, leaving Lassie to grieve by his grave. Without an owner, Lassie falls victim to the law as her fate is debated in an Edinburgh court. It is there that her former master's friend, a tavern proprietor (Edmund Gwenn) comes to Lassie's rescue, calling upon the court to spare this unusually kind and intelligent dog. Exceedingly popular throughout the years, this, the sixth feature film in the classic series, Lassie's appeal spans generations of children and adults, making her one of the most beloved animals in motion picture history. Based on the novel \"Greyfriars Bobby\" by Eleanor Atkinson."
