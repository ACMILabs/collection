        "Episode number 1 of Series \"On the eighth day: perfecting Mother Nature\". From a high tech marketplace in Paris, to the work being done at a fertility clinic in London, Ontario and a surrogacy centre in Los Angeles, \"Making babies\" takes a critical look at reproductive technology. Through interviews with doctors, drug salesmen, infertile women, surrogates and feminist critics like Gena Corea, the film explores the origins and application of the technology and the dangers it may pose to women and to society as a whole."
