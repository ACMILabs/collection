        "The film follows the tour of Djaambi, a half Aboriginal, half white, urban band from Melbourne, under the leadership of Richard Frankland as they travel to remote Aboriginal communities in outback Australia. It explores the cultural mix within the band and the culture shock all members of the band, particularly the Aboriginal members, experience as they meet another, very different side of their culture. Towards the end of the tour the various problems and cultural confusions become focused in a radical split between the white film makers and the more vocal Aboriginal band members. A disturbing look at good intentions gone wrong."
