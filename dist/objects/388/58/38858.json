        "The first three episodes in a dramatisation of Nadia Wheatley's award winning book. Mareka would be quite happy in the milk bar in Newtown, even though it is so far from Greece, if it wasn't for the Wilson kids giving her a hard time. But her Yaya, her grandmother, has only recently arrived in Australia and feels lost and unhappy. If only Mareka could find her Yaya something to do. Then she has an idea. But it's such a big idea she feels dizzy."
