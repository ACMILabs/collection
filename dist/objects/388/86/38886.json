        "Schizophrenia is a disease shrouded in ignorance and myth. This confronting and emotional film details the story of the Martini family who had two sons diagnosed with the disease. Clem Martini, a third brother, narrates the film and through his words we come to understand the grief and pain experienced by the schizophrenics and their families and friends. Passionate and illuminating, \"Shattered Dreams\" argues for an increased public knowledge of schizophrenia and mental illness."
