        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Not suitable for adults\". This episode focuses on teenage reactions to love and relationships. Through mini dramatisations, issues such as crushes on teachers, how to be attractive to the opposite sex, romantic fiction and sex-role stereotyping, are examined in a humorous manner. This program aims at validating the experiences of teenagers rather than offering any concrete solutions."
