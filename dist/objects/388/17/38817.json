        "This animated video tells the story of ten year old Sarah, who, separated from her family by the sudden outbreak of war, hides in the woods. She gradually adapts to her wild surroundings and becomes more like the forest creatures. Believing she can end the war by sabotaging a strategic railway bridge, Sarah begins the dangerous task of prising bricks from the bridge's support columns. When her task seems hopeless and she is exhausted, spring floods bring ice floes crashing into the weakened columns, destroying the bridge. Sarah, her work done and now aware of mankind's ability to hate and kill, returns forever to the forest and the creatures of the wild."
