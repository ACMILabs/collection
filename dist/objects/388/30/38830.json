        "Roger Solomon, an Aboriginal from the north of Western Australia, narrates this history of the tribes from the Fortescue River area, who have been forced into coastal ghettoes, specifically in Roebourne, as a result of government policies, lack of work and the encroachment of mining interests. This removal from their tribal lands has led to their current problems which Solomon and the elders of the tribe would like to solve by a return to their homelands and tribal law. The video is in two parts."
