        "AIDS is the sixth leading cause of death for American youth aged between 15-24. This program interviews young men and women who are HIV positive and they discuss their experiences openly and frankly. The tape is aimed at teenage audiences and includes play performances devised by Young People Living With AIDS (Y.P.L.W.A.) which inform youth about safe sex, how to discuss safe sex and HIV status with prospective partners, and how to inform peers and family on HIV status."
