        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Millennium: tribal wisdom and the modern world\". Host David Maybury-Lewis begins the series with a visit to his Xavante brother in Central Brazil where he explains the need to find a balance between cultural diversity and the desire to be more like one another. Journey with the Millennium team into the heart of the Amazon in Peru where they seek to unravel the mystery of the Mascho-Piro who remain hidden from the outside world. Through scenes of decimation of the tropical rainforests, interviews with threatened indigenous peoples, and the narrator's reflections on the discovery of the Americas and other historical events, discover why so much is at stake when modern industrialism meets the tribal world."
