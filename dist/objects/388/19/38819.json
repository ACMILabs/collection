        "Perhaps no film in history has ever captured the languid and treacherous beauty of the jungle as has this shot on location spectacular based on H. Rider Haggard's colossal tale. Stewart Granger, Deborah Kerr and Richard Carlson are thoroughly convincing as three adventurers on a perilous quest in the wilds of darkest Africa. At her beguiling best, Deborah Kerr plays a prim English lady whose husband has vanished into the jungle while searching for the legendary mines of King Solomon. Stewart Granger's portrayal of Allan Quartermain, \"white hunter\" and reluctant leader of the danger fraught expedition, is one of the finest roles of his swashbuckling career. \"King Solomon's Mines\" offers a colourful palette of action, danger, suspense, drama and romance. Particularly exciting are the extraordinary animal stampedes captured by Robert Sutees' Oscar winning cinematography."
