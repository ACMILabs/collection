        "A biography of the English writer David Herbert Lawrence which examines the influence of his birthplace, family and sexual relationships on his writing, poetry and paintings. Born to a mining family, Lawrence's early life was dominated by his parents' antagonistic relationship which would form the basis for one of his finest novels, \"Sons and Lovers\". His own personal life was to be chaotic and undisciplined until he met and married the German Freda, who though passionate and unpredictable, was to encourage his writing and intellectual growth. Using archival photographs and documents the video explores Lawrence's travels, his politics, his battles with censors, and most significantly, his writing."
