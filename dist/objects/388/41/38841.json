        "Episode of Series \"Face the press\". Three of the most significant politicians in recent Australian history are interviewed on their visions for Australia in the 21st Century. Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke discuss what they see as the most important issues confronting Australia in the 1990's, including the question of reconciliation between white and black Australians; the importance of trade and cultural links with Asia; the increasingly debilitating effects of permanent unemployment; and the possible consequences of republicanism on Australian identity and notions of statehood. The interviewers on this episode of \"Face the Press\" are Phillip Adams, Amanda Buckley and Paul Murphy."
