        "Made for children at primary-school level, this program features Dr. Andy Answer, an animated dog, who explains to three young children some of the facts about AIDS. Using computer animation, interviews with young children who are HIV Positive, and clear and simple illustrations the video explains how the HIV virus is transmitted and how the immune system works. The video dispels many of the myths about the disease and features excerpts from the Magic Johnson press conference where the basketballer revealed his positive status and argued against discrimination and prejudice."
