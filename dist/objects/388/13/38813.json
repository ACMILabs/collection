        "Episode of Series \"Anytime tales\". Five zany and humorous tales are told in this selection of animated stories by award-winning children's author, Tony Ross. \"I want a cat\": Jessy wants a cat but her parents are not keen on the idea. \"I want my potty\": poor little princess is fed up with nappies but coming to terms with her potty is not so easy. \"Super dooper Jezebel\": being perfect isn't easy unless of course you are Super Dooper Jezebel. \"Oscar got the blame\": Oscar's friend Billy brings mud into the house, dresses the dog and puts frogs in Granny's slippers - so why does Oscar always get the blame? \"I'm coming to get you\": little Tommy Brown is terrified of scary monsters, but this monster is different."
