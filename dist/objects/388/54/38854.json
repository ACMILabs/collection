        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Millennium: tribal wisdom and the modern world\". Explore the alternative views of wealth and society that are exhibited in the lives of tribal cultures. This episode takes viewers from New York to the jungles of Indonesia and the plains of Kenya. Learn why our western views of wealth and economic needs have created a society of strangers in the midst of material riches, while tribal cultures such as the Wayewa of Indonesia and the Gabra of Kenya create economies of dependency on others and measure wealth through people, not possessions. Follow host/narrator David Maybury-Lewis as he traces the development of free market economies and explores how its characteristics contrast with tribal conceptions of wealth."
