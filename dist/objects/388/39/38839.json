        "There is no escaping stress in our world, that's why \"Shirley MacLaine's inner workout\" is such a breakthrough. It's a workout for mind, body and soul that's every bit as important as daily exercise. It's a comprehensive workout using meditation and relaxation techniques practiced for centuries in the Orient. Each meditation focuses on specific emotional areas such as creativity, control, love, sexuality, power, communication, judgement and more."
