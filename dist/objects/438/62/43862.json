        "Wide and high above Africa, the camera travels over waterfalls, rivers, plains and forests. Large groups of elephants move purposefully across the plains. One comes closer. He is the Old Bull, our storyteller, and it is through his eyes that we visit Africa's Elephant Kingdom. This is the story of one such clan and their journey across vast stretches of land in search of dwindling sources of food and water, and how they emerge triumphant in one glorious moment when the long awaited rains finally arrive. This film was originally produced for Imax giant screen presentation by an all Australian team headed by Producer, Writer and Director Michael Caulfield, and Scientific Consultant Iain Douglas-Hamilton. Narrated by Avery Brooks. Includes the making of 'Africa's Elephant Kingdom'."
