        "Steve McQueen plays the title role as Frank Bullitt, a no-glitter, all-guts cop who is assigned to protect Chicago gangster Johnny Ross (Pat Renella), who is scheduled to testify against his mob cronies in San Francisco. But after Ross is attacked and later killed at the hospital, Bullitt conceals Ross's death and begins to investigate the case himself, sensing something suspicious. One of the most memorable scenes in Bullitt is the celebrated car chase through the streets of San Francisco. McQueen, an expert automobile and motorcycle racer, does his own stunt driving as he propels his high-performance Mustang around and over San Francisco's fabled hills. Cast includes Jacqueline Bisset, Robert Vaughn, Don Gordon and Robert Duvall."
