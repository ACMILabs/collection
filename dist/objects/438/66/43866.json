        "'Show Girls' celebrates Montreal's swinging Black jazz scene from the 1920's to the 1960's, when the city was wide open. Three women who danced in the legendary Black clubs of the day - Rockhead's Paradise, The Terminal, Cafe St. Michel - share their unforgettable memories of life at the center of one of the world's hottest jazz spots. From the Roaring Twenties, through the Second World War, and on into the golden era of clubs in the fifties and sixties, 'Show Girls' chronicles the lives of Bernice, Tina and Olga, mixing their memories with rarely seen footage of the era. Their stories are told against a backdrop of the fascinating social and political history that made Montreal a jazz and nightclub hotspot for decades. It is a story of song and dance, music and pride. (Award: Yorkton.) Narrated by Anthony Sherwood."
