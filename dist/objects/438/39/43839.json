        "Harry (Woody Allen), a New York author, has just released his latest novel \"loosely\" based on the characters from his own life - his ex-wives, mistresses, family and analysts. No-one likes his depiction of them, and in an hilariously ironic mixture of flashbacks to his new novel, flashbacks to his past, and mishaps in the present, the true story comes out. In classic Allen style, this autobiographical story is a fascinating mixture of fiction and reality. The cast is another line-up of characters in itself, including Kirstie Alley, Demi Moore, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Elisabeth Shue, Stanley Tucci, Amy Irving, Julie Kavner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mariel Hemingway and Judy Davis."
