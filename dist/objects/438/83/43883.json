        "This film seeks to replace the stereotypes promoted by the non-Aboriginal history of white settlement in Australia which usually begins with the 'discoveries' of Captain Cook. Here history is re-told from the point-of-view of the colonised: 'Aboriginals discovered Captain Cook'. In Northern Australia white people are referred to as 'Captain Cooks'. The film's form is sensitive to the telling of tribal history of Captain Cook as spoken by Paddy Wambarranga of the Rembarrnga tribe in Arnhem Land. This history is also represented by images of Aboriginal art. Rembarrnga and Kriol dialogue with English subtitles."
