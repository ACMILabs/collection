        "'Life burnings desire' follows the path of dancer, choreographer and actor Paul Mercurio. Specifically, the programme focuses on Mercurio's work with CONTACT, a new dance theatre piece conceived, choreographed and performed by Mercurio and his dance company ACE (Australian Choreographic Ensemble). His relationship with this project serves as a metaphor for his wider body of work."
