        "Using footage from three classic wartime railway short films- 'Carrying the Load', 'Necessary Journey' and 'Southern on Service', this tape profiles Britain's railways during the tumultuous Second World War. It covers a gamut of wartime operations, including troop and freight trains carrying men and munitions, Luftwaffe raids on railways, mobile hospital carriages, rail mounted anti-aircraft guns on the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch narrow-gauge railway, the naming ceremony of the 'Home Guard' loco, plus many other memorable moments. Also included on the tape is exclusive footage of the North Yorkshire Moors Railway 'Steam at War' weekend. A weekend which is noted for its recreation of the sights and sounds of wartime steam on the home front."
