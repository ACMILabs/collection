        "Episode of Series \"Best of British\". Twenty years after the MG factory was closed down, its parent company successfully revived the make. This documentary takes a detailed look at every signigicant MG ever made, from the earliest Midget in the twenties through the T-types, the MG-A and the company's biggest seller so far, the MG-B. It also includes interviews with enthusiasts and designers, a visit to MG headquarters and rare archival footage of races and rallies."
