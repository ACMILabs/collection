        "This delicious comedy about an Italo-Australian girl's sexual awakening and her love for her mama's cooking is written, produced and directed by Monica Pellizzari. Through the use of a split screen which separates the food from the experience, issues such as menstruation, masturbation, lesbianism and virginity are explored, against a backdrop of broth, venetian fritters, polenta, dumplings and pizza. Cast includes Dina Panozzo and Anne-Louise Lambert."
