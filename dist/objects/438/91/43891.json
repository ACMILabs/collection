        "A group of sailors aboard a merchant ship gamble and booze their way towards the Australian Coast. Among them are handsome young Angel (Aden Young), a winner to every game that Tatt's (David Field) loses. Max (Dennis Miller), an Ancient Mariner who is close to death, instructs Angel to deliver a package to his old home in Honeyfield, Queensland, the place he remembers as paradise. He also gives him a bag of opium to appease sinister landowner Kidd (Norman Kaye). What awaits Angel is far from the tropical paradise of Max's recollecting, although the presence of an attractive woman, Catherine (Claudia Karvan), helps matters. To confound matters and add to the inhospitability of the place, Tatt's arrives to settle to settle a score. Cast includes Bill Hunter, Dennis Miller and David Field."
