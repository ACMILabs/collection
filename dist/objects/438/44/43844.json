        "Colin Garratt is engaged in a lifetime crusade to photograph and record the end of the age of steam around the world. Colin and his assistant Sarah King begin in Spain, in search of a Manchester built Sharp Stewart 0-6-OT; then on to Turkey and the last of the famous Stanier 8F's, the Isle of Man and China, making noteworthy and entertaining discoveries on the way. Reflecting on the photographs, Colin and Sarah have compiled a body or work that is a testament to the importance of steam driven power across the ages."
