        "Throughout the history of war there has been the silent presence of the army chaplain, a comforting person in the midst of atrocities, offering spiritual support and material comfort. 'In God's command' offers an intimate portrait of one such chaplain, Captain Mark Sargent, army officer, Roman Catholic priest and chaplain to the soldiers of the First Battalion; Princess Patricia's Canadian light infantry, stationed in the former Yugoslavia. The viewer follows Sargent as he ministers soldiers and civilians, arranging Mass, celebrating a baptism, and performs other priestly duties under the most trying conditions with conviction, compassion and humor. Narrated by military historian Gywnne Dyer."
