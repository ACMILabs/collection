        "The true life stories of six of the great kings and queens of ancient Egypt- Part One: The Mystery of Tutankhamen; Who was the boy king? In 1923, his tomb was found by Howard Carter intact, but to this day, we are still uncertain of his lineage. Part Two: The Real Cleopatra; Cleopatra has often been portrayed as cruel and promiscuous. Evidence now indicates she was a monogamous woman, a devoted mother, and a compassionate queen to her people. Part Three: King of the Pyramids; The Pharoah Sneferu showed the Egyptians how to construct pyramids and with his genius and determination established Egypt as an international power. Part Four: Ramses the Great; Ramses II built on a scale unequalled by any ruler in history, bragged about his military prowess, and was fond of listing the names of his two hundred children. Part Five: The Queen Who Would Be King; Hatsheput wanted to be king, not queen; and she succeeded. Pushing aside her nephew and rightful heir to the throne, Tuthmoses III, she ruled as king of upper and lower Egypt for twenty two years. Part Six: The Rebel Pharoah; At the end of the eighteenth dynasty the pharoah Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten and declared there is but one god, Aten the solar disk.
