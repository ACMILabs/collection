        "Rita Hayworth stars as Rosalind Bruce, a charismatic entertainer who, along with her showgirl colleagues, attempts to bring light relief from the ravages of war torn Britain. Romance develops between Rosalind and an RAF pilot Paul (Lee Bowman), who she meets during an air raid. Their relationship forms a delightful backdrop to the many entertaining musical numbers. Cast includes Janet Blair, Marc Platt, Leslie Brooks and Shelley Winters. Based on a play by Leslie Storm."
