        "One thing after another seems to have gone wrong for the not so bright greenkeeper Lenny (Mark Little). In his professional life he has to contend with brown grass, in his personal life his dope smoking wife (Lisa Hensley) is running up debts with her dealers. He tries to secure the affections of a waitress at the bowling club, but like most other aspects of his life, he lucks out. Things reach a crisis point when Lenny's lack of greenkeeping skills could result in a loss for the club at the forthcoming Pennant Day. Director David Caesar's first feature reflects a nostalgia for a simpler time and place."
