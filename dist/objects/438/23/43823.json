        "Captain Scott (Kenneth More), is commissioned by the British Governor of colonial India for a rescue mission to ensure the safe passage of a five year old Hindi prince and his American governess (Lauren Bacall) out of danger. To achieve this Scott must make a 300 mile journey to Kalapur. The mission is fraught with danger as they are travelling on an old and fragile train, and an assassin has made his way onto the train and is posing as an ally. Cast includes Herbert Lom, Wilfred Hyde-White and Ursula Jeans."
