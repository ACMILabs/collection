        "The gaoling of the 'Fairlea Five' was the first many Australians had heard of the Save our Sons movement; a group of women formed in the sixties to protest against the Vietnam War. S.O.S explores the motivation of this group of women, charting their progress from their unpopular beginnings in 1965, to the moratoriums and re-election of the Labour Party in 1972. The film uses interviews, original footage and news clippings to illustrate their strategies (both conventional and non-conventional), specific areas of protest (including anti-conscription and conscientious objecting), and their achievements over this time."
