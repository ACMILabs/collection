        "This is an imaginative realisation of a German occupation of Britain in July, 1940: Pauline Murray, an Irish girl working in England, joins up in 1944 with the re-emerging Resistance. On a 7,000 pound budget the filmmakers' recreated a newsreel style but did not use stock or newsreel footage, a direct reaction to fifties war movies which they felt never dealt with the nature of Nazism. A controversial sequence showed real British Nazis expressing their beliefs. The documentary style drama took eight years to complete."
