        "'Beyond El Rocco' is an affectionate look at the Australian jazz scene and its evolution through the decades from the swinging 60s through to the experimentalism of the 80s. Tony Barry plays Zoot Finster, a diehard jazz fan who takes us on a personal journey which begins at the El Rocco jazz club in Sydney in the fifties. The film looks not only at the Sydney scene, but brings in developments in Melbourne, including footage of Jazz Centre 44 which was the Melbourne counterpoint to the El Rocco in the fifties. Includes interviews and recordings of sessions with the big names of Australian jazz including Judie Bailey, John Sangster, Don Burrows, Joe Lane, Brian Brown, Bernie McGann, Mike Nock, Roger Frampton, John Pochee, Dale Barlow, Sandy Evans, James Morrison and Paul Grabowski. A must see for jazz fans."
