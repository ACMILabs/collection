        "This film is set in New Zealand's early pioneering days of the 1820's. It was a time when British settlers had to come to terms with their strange new environment and its Maori inhabitants. A group of British pioneers arrive in New Zealand with the hope for a new life down under. Philip Wayne (Jack Hawkins) and his new wife Marion (Glynis Johns), are two such pioneers. Against adverse factors, such as an earthquake, they manage to build a new settlement and garner support from the local Maori neighbours. Tensions rise when Philip becomes captivated by the wife of Chief Hongi Tepe (Inia Te Wiata), and the Maori tribes turn against the settlement in retaliation for their interracial relationship."
