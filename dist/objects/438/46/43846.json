        "100 years of Australian military nursing is celebrated in this collection of personal accounts and archival footage. The contribution of Australian nurses has spanned across many wars; the Boer War, Great War, World War 2, as well as battles in the Mediterranean, New Guinea and Vung Tau. It is from these often tragic environments that stories of hope, courage, duty, adventure and romance emerge and are shared with the viewer. Narrated by Geraldine Dooge."
