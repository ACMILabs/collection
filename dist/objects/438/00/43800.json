        "No job, no home, no family; Eddie (Richard Anconina) has hit rock bottom. One day, as he is walking through Le Sentier (the rag trade district of Paris) he is attacked by a gang of hustlers. Rescued by Victor Benzakem (Richard Bohringer), a successful rag-trader who mistakes Eddie for a Sephardic Jew, Eddie is offered a job. Only too happy to seize an opportunity to start over, Eddie (who is a gentile) tries his best to maintain the pretence of his adopted 'jewishness'. From the fabric warehouse, Eddie is given an opportunity to observe the rites and secret hand shakes of the flashy, fast talking garment district: a melting pot of race, religion and culture. His eyes also catch the beauty of his employer's daughter, Sandra (Amira Casar). In order to draw her attention, Eddie decides to cut loose and start his own business. Starting with the classic story of the stranger who finds himself in a community he knows nothing about, Thomas Gilou's film presents a seldom-seen look into the lives and customs of France's many ethnic groups. Cast includes Richard Anconina, Amira Casar, Vincent Elbaz, Elie Kakou, Richard Bohringer, and Jose Garcia."
