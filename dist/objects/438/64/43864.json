        "After pulling off a bloody Texas bank heist, notorious bank robber Seth Gecko and his homicidal, rape-happy brother Ritchie, secure a safe passage across the border into Mexico thanks to the unwilling aid of disillusioned ex-minister Jacob Fuller. After kidnapping the Fuller family, the Gecko brothers elude the authorities and reach a supposed safe haven at a pre-chosen site: a surreal and ultra-sleazy bar in the middle of the desert, where they plan to split the loot with their Mexican connection. Unfortunately, the club is actually a haven for ferocious Aztec vampires; a twist which spins the schizophrenic plot into its second phase. Cast includes George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis."
