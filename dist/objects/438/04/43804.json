        "'Happy Together' is a melancholy and bleak reflection on love and loneliness from acclaimed director Wong Kar-Wai. At the film's centre is the strained romantic relationship between two men from Hong Kong who travel to South America in hope of a reconciliation. Soon enough they break up during an aborted road trip to Iguazu Falls, with both men deciding to stay on in Buenos Aires. Though they each begin separate lives, the couple retains a powerful, if reluctant connection, and when one falls victim to a harsh beating, the couple reunites, though only briefly. The film focuses almost exclusively upon the dance of alienation and togetherness behind this tumultuous relationship, with spectacular cinematography by Christopher Doyle. In Cantonese, Mandarin and Spanish with English subtitles."
