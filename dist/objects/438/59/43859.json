        "This video gives an insight into Formula One, away from the racetrack as it goes behind the scenes during the 1998 season. Some of the best drivers are interviewed, including Mika Hakkinen, David Coulthard, Alex Zanardi and Jacques Villeneuve. The design, technical and commercial strategies of teams are analysed by talking to designers and managers. The programme shows cutting edge technology, such as the amazing Ferrari wind tunnel at Miranello. Some of the newest and best teams are profiled and there's footage of the best drivers in action, such as Mick Doohan and Tommi Makinen. Narrated by Richard Nichols."
