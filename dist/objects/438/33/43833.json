        "The setting is Malaya in the 50's, still a British colonial outpost, but on the verge of independence and a new Malaya. The major industry is rubber, and the majority of this control still lies with the British. Jim Frazer (Jack Hawkins) and his wife Liz (Claudette Colbert) have built a successful rubber plantation business. Liz is dissatisfied with her lifestyle and resents having to move from her social circle following her marriage. There are bigger issues at stake however, when their lives come under threat from Malay bandits, intent on usurping British rule. Fearing for his son's safety, Jim organizes for his wife and son to return to England. Liz misinterprets her husband's intentions for their departure and vows never to return to Malaya. She is not given the opportunity to leave however, as a surprise attack forces the family into a battle for survival. Cast includes Anthony Steel, Jeremey Spenser and Ram Gopal."
