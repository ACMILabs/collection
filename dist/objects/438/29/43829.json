        "Thanksgiving, 1973, Connecticut, and the future of the United States is in limbo. Though outwardly possessing everything a suburban family could want, inwardly, the Hoods are on thin ice. The transparent windows of the family depict a dysfunctional life of paranoid gossip and swinging key parties. Patriarch Ben Hood, barely communicates with his wife Elena. Frustrated and lonely, Elena is on the verge of an emotional breakdown, while Ben copes by having an affair with their neighbour Janey Carver. As night falls and the members of the family embark on their own sexual odyssey, clouds gather on the horizon for an ice storm that will paralyze the suburbs and transform everyone's lives for ever. Cast includes Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, James Sheridan, and Christina Ricci."
