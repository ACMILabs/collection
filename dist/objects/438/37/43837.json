She is torn betweeen loyalty and the secret love she has for the nightclub manager where she works, and leaving for the bright lights and fortune that will await her as a cover girl. She is faced with a difficult choice between love and fame, or can she have both? Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly who play the star crossed lovers are well supported by Phil Silvers and Eve Arden. (Awards: Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin for Best Musical Score)"
