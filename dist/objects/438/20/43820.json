        "After being told that he only has six months to live, Englishman Bruce Campbell (Dirk Bogarde) dedicates his last days to vindicating his late grandfather's name. His grandfather long held the belief that his land in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, or as he referred to it, 'kingdom', contained precious oil reserves; he was alone in his convictions. Bruce, who is now left with the land is determined to strike oil and comes up against fierce resistance from the leader of a construction gang, Owen Morgan (Stanley Baker). With nothing to lose and a suspicion that they are trying to prevent him from discovering the truth, Bruce has a fatalistic determination to get to the bottom of things. Based on the novel by Hammond Innes. Cast includes Dirk Bogarde, Stanley Baker, Michael Craig and James Robertson Justice."
