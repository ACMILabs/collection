        "Lange is an author of wild west novels. When the owner of the company that publishes Lange's works absconds with the company funds, Lange rallies the employees together to create their own publishing house. The publisher returns, disguised as a priest, and demands a share of the profits. Lange responds by killing him. The grateful employees help Lange to escape prosecution, allowing him to leave the country with his lovely fiancee. It is a joyous film, just as the Popular Front was a joyous movement, happy in the belief that living and working conditions could be changed for the better and fascism resisted at home and abroad. Exploitation (including sexual exploitation) are represented as the product of authoritarian capitalism, represented here by the publisher. Cast includes Rene Lefevre, Jules Berry, Florelle and Nadia Sibirkskaia. In French with English subtitles."
