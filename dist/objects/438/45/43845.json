        "When Charlie (Michael Caine) leaves jail he has the opportunity for a better future, or a sure fire way of landing back in jail when he inherits the plans to a $4,000,000 gold robbery. Things look positive when Charlie receives inside help from prison-based Mr Bridger (Noel Coward), who is the mastermind behind the plan. Central to the plan's success is staging the world's biggest traffic jam as a diversion to their shady activities. Cast includes Benny Hill, Raf Vallone and Tony Beckley. Music by Quincy Jones."
