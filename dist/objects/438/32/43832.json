        "Radio personality David Staebler (Jack Nicholson), uses his brother's life story as fodder for his radio ramblings, thus anticipating the \"talk jocks\" of the 1980's and 90's. David's brother Jason (Bruce Dern), is full of lofty ambitions but lacks the wherewithal to accomplish them. He has managed to survive for so long thanks to the help of his older brother. His latest vision for success involves building a resort on a small Hawaiian island and he intends to raise the capital by holding a beauty contest and wining and dining rich Japanese businessmen. Along with Jason's long suffering wife (Ellen Burstyn), David reluctantly agrees to support his brother one more time."
