        "This teachers information kit contains two video tapes and a thorough information exercise book. Its purpose is to enable students to gain some skills in media analysis. In this co-production between Channel 7 and renowned media teachers Barrie McMahon and Robyn Quin, soaps- specifically 'Home and Away', become the primary subject of study. Tape one covers basic production elements, characters, audiences and values. Tape two contains excerpts from 'Home and Away' for class discussion and analysis. The book contains foundation and advanced materials that can be used in a primary or secondary setting. The video's are a good starting point for media education within a classroom setting."
