        "Ibsen's feminist play set is Norway depicts Nora Helmer (Claire Bloom), a woman struggling for independence within her marriage, and against her husband's will (played by Anthony Hopkins). In the face of male obstinacy and arrogance she sets off in search of her own life and destiny and breaks the shackles which have persisted in treating her as if she were a doll. Cast includes Denholm Elliot, Ralph Richardson and Edith Evans. Another version of Ibsens's play, directed by Joseph Losey was released in the same year starring Jane Fonda and David Werner."
