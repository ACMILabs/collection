        "Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a janitor from working-class South Boston, but he is in fact a genius. Abused as a child, he has been in trouble with the law ever since, and is finally facing a jail sentence. In order to save his relationship with his girlfriend (Minnie Driver), and to stay out of jail, Will agrees to receive counselling. With his therapist Sean (Robin Williams), he starts to transform his life. This is the poignant story of both Will and Sean coming to terms with the blows life has dealt them, and the unknown future. Cast includes Ben Affleck, who features as Will's best friend and Casey Affleck. (Awards: Academy Awards, Robin Williams for Best Supporting Actor, and Matt Damon/Ben Affleck for Best Screenplay)"
