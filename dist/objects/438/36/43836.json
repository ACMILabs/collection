        "A Star Named Ayrton Senna is an insightful and intimate documentary about the Brazilian Formula 1 Champion who died tragically in May 1994. Includes interviews with Senna's relatives and friends as well as people he worked with in the Grand Prix circuit. Fans of Ayrton Senna the man and also Formula One will enjoy the many frank interviews with Senna, as well as footage of him racing (including his days of racing Go-Carts!) and also his normal life away from the Grand Prix hysteria. Senna's views on life and his professionalism are beautifully presented and the documentary also gives an interesting insight into the stresses and strains of fame. In English and Portugese with English subtitles."
