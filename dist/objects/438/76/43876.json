        "A roomful of girls share differing opinions about the motives of a peeping Tom that regularly spies on them. Their responses to how they will or won't perform reflects the different natures of their sexuality, which they are learning about during school hours. One night they lay in wait while someone poses as bait in the window; their collective power is frightening and a definite result will be achieved. Cast includes Kaarin Fairfax, Danielle Spencer and Angie Regia."
