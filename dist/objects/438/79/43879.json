        "'Buy now, die later' proposes startling questions about children, advertising and diet. Questions such as why food advertising dominates children's programs, why some foodstuffs receive more promotion than others, the issue of self-regulation, and most importantly, whether there is evidence of a negative impact on children's health attributed to advertising. John Schwartz, a dietician from the Media Department of Swinburne University as well as Deputy Director of the Australian Food Council and a spokesperson for Youth Media Australia, analyses food ads to determine their effectiveness. An activities and discussion sheet accompanies the video."
