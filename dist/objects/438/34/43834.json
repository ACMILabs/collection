        "An American woman working as a dancer in Trinidad with her artist husband (Neil Emery), is gradually drawn into a web of secret police deals and espionage when her husband is found dead, believed murdered. She, the only 'key', is used to obtain evidence against his murderers. His brother arrives to be confronted by his brother's death. Suspicious, he seeks to find out the truth, falling in love with his dead brother's wife on the way. Cast includes Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, Alexander Scourby and Valerie Bettis (who was also responsible for choreographing Rita Hayworth's dance sequences). Costume designer Jean Louis was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume."
