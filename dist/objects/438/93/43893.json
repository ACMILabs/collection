        "'Nighthawks' pictures the everyday experiences of a homosexual schoolteacher in a film which is both a subjective account of the teacher's disjointed emotional life, and a record of the gay scene in London towards the end of the 1970's. 'What can I do with a male nude?' is a witty short film showing the point of view of a gay photographer as he photographs a muscular male model."
