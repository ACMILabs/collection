        "Produced by Rita Hayworth's production company, Beckworth, 'The Loves of Carmen' is a dramatised version of Carmen which is based, not on Bizet's opera, but on the story by Prosper Merimee. This is definitely a star vehicle for Hayworth - she sizzles in the role as the beautiful and fiesty Spanish gypsy. She is joined by Glenn Ford who plays the besotted Don Jose. The film is directed by Hayworth's favourite director, Charles Vidor, and includes some colourful dance and musical scenes, although it is essentially dramatic and not a musical. Rita Hayworth's father assisted with some of the choreography and her uncle and brother also appear in the film."
