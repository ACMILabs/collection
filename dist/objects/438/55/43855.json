        "Episode of Series \"Best of British\". In the twenties Bentley sports cars built up an enviable reputation for speed and reliability, with wins at Brooklands and record-breaking success at Le Mans. More than 75 years after its conception in 1919 Bentley's original reputation for quality engineering and 'luxury with sporting character' is still intact. Using extensive archival footage, the program documents the early designs of W.O Bentley, the Bower Bentley's and the Bentley 6. Also featured are interviews with Bentley collectors and a liberally illustrated history of the Bentley's racing career."
