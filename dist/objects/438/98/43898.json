        "A revealing documentary that explores the effects of war beyond the battlefield. Through candid interviews with seven elderly women the impact of World War II on the women who were left behind and the men in their lives is constructed in a series of deeply personal and unexpected stories. Combined with newsreel footage and still photographs, the choice and sequence of the womens' stories woven together by Gaylene Preston provides a powerful and wide-ranging portrait of New Zealand society and the long repressed emotions provoked by the experience of war. (Awards: Best Film in the New Zealand Film and Television Awards, Official Selection Venice Film Festival, most popular film 1995 Sydney Film Festival)"
