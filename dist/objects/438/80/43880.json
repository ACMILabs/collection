        "Forensic science involves a multitude of other science related disciplines; dentistry, etymology, odontology, pathology and DNA testing to name but a few. This program takes a look at these areas and examines the techniques practitioners of these disciplines use, and have used sucessfully in real cases to solve crime. The \"silent witness\" of the title refers to the silent, but crucial body of evidence that has been collected. The video is accompanied by support notes which includes a glossary and suggested discussions and activities."
