        "France, 1793 and the terror of the French Revolution is at it's height. Every day the tumbrils roll more innocent people to their deaths under the guillotine, but there is one man who dares to defy the revolutionaries; The Scarlet Pimpernel. Richard E. Grant plays the foppish English aristocrat Sir Percy Blakeney, a cad with a passion only for society and clothes but who leads a daring and exciting double life - as the Scarlet Pimpernel. This vibrant three part series is full of murder, double dealing, intrigue and passion that will keep you in suspense until the very end. Cast includes the beautiful Elizabeth McGovern as Lady Blakeney and Martin Shaw as the evil, self-centered, Chauvelin, right hand man of Robspierre."
