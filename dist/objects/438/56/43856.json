        "Episode of Series \"Best of British\". An early Jaguar advertising slogan summed up the timeless appeal of this great British marque as 'grace, space and pace'. This documentary explores these legendary qualities by taking a close look at all the significant Jaguar models, from the pre-war coach-built 'special saloons' through the SS100 and XK120, the E-type and XJ models, up to Britain's first 'supercar'- the XJ220. Interviews with Jaguar drivers such as Stirling Moss and Jack Fairman, and archival footage contribute to a fascinating review of Jaguar's unique place in British motoring history."
