        "Beautifully photographed, this comedy-drama chronicles the revival of Paris' most notorious dance as it tells the story of a theater producer who turns a humble washerwoman into a star at the Moulin Rouge. Renoir's return to film-making in France after 15 years absence is an exuberant, affectionate homage to the theatre of 'La Belle Epoque' (Edith Piaf and Tatachou appear briefly as stars of the day.) It also gave him the opportunity to work with Gabin again, having made three films with him in the 1930s. Cast includes Jean Gabin, Francoise Arnoul and Maria Felix. In French with English subtitles."
