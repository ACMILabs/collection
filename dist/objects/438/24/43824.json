        "Allan Howard (Dirk Bogarde) arrives in Kenya to join his brother on the farm; tragedy awaits him when he discovers that his brother has been brutally murdered by the nationalistic Mau Mau tribe. He finds solace, and eventually love with neighbour Mary Crawford (Virginia McKenna). Alan works with the local Police Inspector (Donald Sinden), and together they suspect that the local African doctor, known only as Simba, is the leader behind the Mau Mau terrorist attacks. They must now play a tense waiting game. Based on actual events that occurred to British settlers in Kenya in the 1950s."
