        "An earlier Almodovar effort which brings to mind some of the more outrageous moments from the films of American director John Waters. Pepi, Luci and Bom's out-to-offend plot has Pepi (Almodovar regular Carmen Maura), exact revenge on the policeman (Felix Rotaeta) who raped her by having him beaten up by her punk rock pals. When that plan backfires she hatches an even more outlandish plot which involves introducing the policeman's mousy wife Luci (Eva Siva), to the world of sadomasochism and 'water sports', via her friend Bom (Olvido Gara). Of course Pepi never counted on Luci liking it so much! Unfortunately this video version is a slightly modified one from the cinema release (one of the film's funniest moments where Bom casually urinates in Luci's face is cut down), but Almodovar's provocative and endearingly tasteless humour (an ad for women's underwear that converts to a vibrator comes to mind!), still shines through."
