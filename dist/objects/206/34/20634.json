        "Illustrates the peaceful use of atomic energy in the USSR and shows the first atomic power plant in the USSR. The program explains the basic processes involved in nuclear fission and the safety procedures which protect workers. Demonstrates the use of isotopes in medicine, especially in cancer treatment and also the application of atomic energy in industry: improved plastics, oil exploration, detection of flaws in casting and welded seams, use of tracers in checking the condition of blast furnaces and quality control in metal production. The research potential of atomic installations is explored."
