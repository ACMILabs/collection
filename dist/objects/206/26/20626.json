        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Atomic physics: an historical approach\". This film shows various instruments used in research, and their diagrammatic explanations; from a very early machine for measuring ionisation, to an electric machine, built after 1932 in the Cavendish laboratory, used to bombard atoms. Includes a speech by Einstein, and an explanation of isotopes and the research leading up to this understanding. No credits available."
