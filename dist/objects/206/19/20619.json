        "Episode of Series \"A Man and His Sport\". The growth of track and field competition in AUstralia is studied, junior events as well as international competitions. We see the work being done to encourage youngsters to participate in track and field events. The film contains some excellent slow motion sequences of athletes performing at their peak, which evoke a strange sort of fluid beauty in this otherwise rather harsh world of sweat and strain. Narration is in the Greek language."
