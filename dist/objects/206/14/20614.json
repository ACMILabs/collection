        "Episode of Series \"At Your Fingertips\". Shows a number of things that can be made by children from boxes which originally held house-hold items. Cereal boxes covered with paper and coloured become a model village; milk cartons are made into cars or trains or animals. The biggest cartons, such as those in which refrigerators are delivered, appear as a truck, with two boys as the motive power, delivering to a playhouse. Suitable for lower primary level."
