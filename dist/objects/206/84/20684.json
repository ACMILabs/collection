        "Reflects the growing industry of the Barossa Valley, in South Australia - one of Australia's major wine producing areas. Settled by the Germans in the 1840's, the valley has little towns of great charm. Around these early settlements, pioneers planted vines they had brought with them and many of their descendants continue to run family wineries. Photographed by Dean Semler."
