        "Episode number 3 of Series \"War Experience\". The men who served in the Royal Australian Air Force during the Second World War. At first it was a European war - over Germany, France, and Italy, but then the allies were driven back over North Africa. The Japanese aggression brought the men back to Australian shores and Pacific islands. Joining the Air Force with a spirit of adventure, the close of the war saw broken spirits and mental and physical suffering."
