        "Episode of Series \"21st Century\". Among the peaceful uses of the atom is the application of atomic radiation in medical research, diagnosis and treatment. Radiation \"tagging and tracing\" is a valuable technique in ascertaining the sizes and shapes of various glands such as the thyroid. Treatment of cancers in localized regions of the body is one of the most effective deterrents of the disease. This film points out how continuing research hopes to improve on methods now in use."
