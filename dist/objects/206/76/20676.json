        "Two colourful magazine items set at opposite ends of Australia. The area around Mt. Gambier, South-eastern Australia is a tourist centre shown to advantage in this film with brilliant photography by Don McAlpine, some of it underwater in the Blue Lake. The second item is in Tipperary, in the Northern Territory, showing the first attempts to grow sorghum in virgin soil areas."
