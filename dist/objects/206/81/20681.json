        "The 25th Australian Jazz Convention, 1970, brought 600 musicians and enthusiasts to Dubbo, N.S.W.

Featured artists and groups were the Original Graeme Bell Australian Jazz Band, Allan Stott's Hottentots, Lachie Thompson's New Whispering gold Orchestra, Nick Polites and his New Year's Revllers and the Dubbo Corps Salvation Army Band."
