        "It is said of Origami 'the thing to be enjoyed is not the material itself but the variation that comes from using it efficiently.' This can be said of Japanese industry, in which concentrated efforts have been made to achieve more efficiency and greater economy through systematization. Examples of Japanese systems are many and varied; from the tea making ceremony to traditional and modern architectural innovations; from fan and doll making to ship construction.
