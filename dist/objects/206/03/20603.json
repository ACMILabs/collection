        "This film shows the organization of Community Aid Abroad and the work it does in under-developed countries, particularly India. Enlightened agricultural and irrigation production; a co-operative rural bank has relieved some financial pressures; and education programmes have given hope for the future. Shows the growth of a self supporting leper community. However despite development, traditional Indian cultural pursuits are strongly perpetuated. No other credits available."
