        "Australia is playing her part as a member of the United Nations family by giving a home and new life to many Europeans. But to continue to feed her growing population she has had to develop her resources to a greater extent; the Snowy Mountains project is one way in which she is doing this. Australia has also found it necessary to buy machinery and equipment from dollar countries. Dollars are in short supply, but as a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Government has been able to negotiate a series of dollar loans."
