        "Shows how nuclear and radiation techniques, such as carbon-14 dating, thermoluminescence, atomic fingerprinting, and radiography, have helped archeologists discover new facts about the past. Hitherto impenetrable barriers of time are broken, and new data about ancient civilisations revealed. Pioneer work in progress at leading research centres in the USA is shown."
