        "This film deals with the problems of accident prevention in the British iron and steel industry. Demonstrates that accidents do not merely happen- they are caused, not always by one individual or one mistake but by a combination of circumstances which could have been foreseen. Illustrations include: faulty handling of materials or tools, falling or knocking against equipment, untidy workshops, bad stacking or storing, neglect and carelessness."
