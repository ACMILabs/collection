        "Much of America's wildlife is now endangered because of hunting, trapping, poisoning, habitat destruction and environmental pollution. America's extinct mammals and birds include the Gull Island Vole, the Plains Wolf, the Sea Mink, the Labrador Duck and the Great Auk. the Whooping Crane are a dramatic example of an endangered species which came back form the brink of extinction. A simple alternative is offered and some important reasons why these endangered species are vitally important to all life on Earth are presented. Includes footage of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker which was last filmed in 1935 and is probably now extinct. Narrated by Barton Heyman."
