        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Migrant experience\". Considers the roles migrants have played in the Australian labour force. Several historical aspects are dealt with through case studies, though the emphasis is on the nature and effect of the postwar migration boom. With work as one of the most significant points of interation between migrants and hosts, this episode examines the experience of both good and bad of the new work force."
