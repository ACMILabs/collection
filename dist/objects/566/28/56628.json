        "A character called \"x\", who is neither male nor female, points out all the opportunities available to people when gender is made irrelevant. Shows how role stereotyping begins at birth and carries through into school and work. Shows men and women working and finding fulfilment in non-traditional areas. The band playing towards the end of the film features the now ABC political journalist, Fran Kelly, in an unfamiliar guise."
