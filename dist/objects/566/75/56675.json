        "Conveys an impression of the scope of reproduction in nature, using turtles, the garden snail, selected insects and spiders as examples. Considers features of sexual reproduction by studying rock oysters, a green marine alga, leopard slugs and a flowering plant. Illustrates two examples of asexual reproduction: zoospore production by a filamentous alga and the parthenogenetic production of offspring by aphids during summer. Relevant to Year 11 Biology."
