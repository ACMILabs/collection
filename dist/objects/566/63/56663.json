        "The story of Sir Sydney Kidman and his battle with the Australian land. Kidman began as a roustabout and eventually came to control over a hundred properties and owned more cattle than any other person in the world. He attempted to avoid the full effects of Australia's periodical droughts by buying up territories covering a wide area of Northern Australia. His policy was put to the test in 1901-1902 and 1926-30; his battle with the droughts of these years is dramatically portrayed."
