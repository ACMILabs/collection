Episode 7 from the interesting series \"Out of the fiery furnace\" discusses whether societies accept the environmental penalties of increased metal mining? Are there enough metals left on earth for all who want them? What will we do for energy if the rest of the world is to be carried forward into the Age of Metals? New methods of exploration and detection are shown, including earth-imaging satellites."
