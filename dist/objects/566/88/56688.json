        "Provides an overview of the direction of education in Australia today as it comes to terms with changing society. Looks at schools in Victoria and South Australia and presents the views of educators, parents and children about the best ways educators can meet the needs of individual students. Considers goal based assessment, non sexist curricula and curricula supporting the needs of girls who have not received equal classroom opportunities. Outlines the underlaying principles behind the new 'democratic curriculum'."
