        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Out of the fiery furnace\". The ever expanding American iron and steel industry spawns the railroads that help to reunify a country riven by civil war. In the aftermath of the Chicago fire on 1871, the industry creates the steel-framed skycraper. The discovery of vast reserves of oil, and the advent of mass production, mark the last quarter of the nineteenth century."
