        "Remedial reading: a family affair [22:00] deals with a research project in the Mangere district of South Auckland which aimed to clarify parental willingness to assist their children with reading difficulties, how they could be helped and whether this assistance was of lasting benefit. \"Helping you to help your child\" [23:00] introduces parents to the essential components in tutoring children: praising, problem solving, pausing and beginnings. The program is directed towards parents of older children who have reading difficulties."
