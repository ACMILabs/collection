    "description": [
        "In 37 Stories About Leaving Home, a group of Japanese women living in the Tokyo area recount personal stories of their own experiences of leaving home. In these stories one can begin to see, from very personal and individual perspectives, the societal changes that have occurred over the last three generations for women in Japan, bringing an exciting and often conflicting array of choices and positions. Many of the stories revolve around the relationships these grandmothers, mothers and daughters have with each other, filled with respect, rebellion, loss and love. The interviews are framed by a traditional Japanese folktale, a magical and somewhat shocking narrative of a mother's search for her abducted daughter, kidnapped by a monster on the eve of her wedding."
