        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Nurses\". Nurses \"was filmed by four nurses and their friends at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne to capture the real life drama of nursing from a very different perspective...their own\" Nurses are: Kerryn O'Rourke - Oncology. Trish Builic - Psychiatric (to the homeless). Jane Newham - Emergency. Cassie Steward - Theatre. Ep 3: This episode examines the kind of thoughts and coping mechanisms the nurses have developed in a job that obviously has a high mortality rate. And in particular reflects upon the naivete of the 'I am going to be a nurse to help people' idea that all four women have had to deal with. This episode elaborates upon a patient relationship that we have already seen Kerryn commit to. She talks about the way she has necessarily become more detached and that some days, especially with staff shortages the physical side of nursing of observing patients and administering medication means that you just don't have the ability to feel sad. And that the flip side to this is that ultimately patients appreciate the kindness, understanding and sensitivity given by nurses not if they got their medication on time. Trish talks about the sense of emotions being at either end of the spectrum, that when someone commits suicide or an assault occurs it's a big jolt in reminding her how crucial the job is. Jane talks about the 'controlled voice' she finds herself using when something really serious is happening."
