        "Canadian born Craig Kielburger was 12 years-old when child labor activist Iqbal Massih (who was also only 12 years-old) was murdered in Pakistan. That event changed Craig's life forever. In December 1995 Craig went on a seven week journey to South Asia including India and the Philippines, to see for himself the horrific situation of child labor and children who are sold and traded on the sex tourist market. In India, the number of unemployed adults is 55 million, whilst equally, the number of child workers is 55 million. Children are leased by their parents as collateral for a loan and remain bonded to the factory owners as the debt can never be repaid. As young as 5-year-olds can work upto 12 hours a day with no schooling, barely any food and paid a pittance, if paid at all. They are slave labor working in the most inhumane conditions. What Craig saw and the knowledge he gained turned him into a passionate, articulate and incredibly effective advocate on the children's behalf. With a group of his peers, Craig founded \"Free the Children\", a children's organization completely run by young people, that now has 10,000 members in 20 countries across the world. This documentary acknowledges Craig's dedication and testifies to the fact that even children can help bring about change through protest and involvement. Narrated by Jennifer Dale."
