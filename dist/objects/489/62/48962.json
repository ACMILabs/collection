        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Phoenix\". Episodes 7 and 8 of the television series Phoenix. `Old Rules New Games'. Jock is frustrated with the lack of hard evidence in the case so he goes to see his trusty informant (Bill Hunter), to see if he has any information as to who may have any of the left-over stolen explosives. He gets himself into deep trouble when he steals a car that has a baby asleep in the back and it's left to Jock to see if he can get him out of strife. `Fond Memories'. Megan believes the two suspects involved in the bombing are of a violent nature who would not flinch at attacking and raping anyone. On a hunch she investigates a rape case which uncovers a possible suspect that matches the behavior and patterns of the bomber. Dennis is now the number 1 suspect for the Major Crimes unit."
