        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Phoenix\". `The Return': A second attack is carried out against the Arthur's but this time Betty is viciously raped and James beaten severely, all for the sake of 6 stamps. There is a new addition to the major's with the addition of Russell Howie from Fraud and he fits in well. It appears the Arthur's knew their assailant as there was no forced entry or alarm activated. Could it be they tricked the Arthur's by saying it was one of the Major Squad members at the door? `Inside Information': Murdoch gets a tip off about a possible location for a warehouse where the stolen goods from the burglaries are and organises a warrant to raid the factory. Here they encounter Lindy (Nadine Garner), who screams sexual assault against Howie for ripping her clothes off while he tries to detain her. James Arthur is so scared from the attacks on him and Betty that he's turned his house into a fortress. Peter goes looking for Joe who receives stolen paintings and rare art and could know the identity of the burglars. Unfortunately Peter is overheard making a deal which makes him a target of Internal affairs. James Arthur is found dead in his home in a poor attempt at revenge."
