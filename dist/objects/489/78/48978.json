        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Academy\". The Killing ground looks at the physical and moral challenges in training the cadets. The cadets are starting to come to terms with the reality of the fitness training they are undertaking, training which comes before any academic study. This episode also focuses on how the female cadets are adjusting to a predominately male facility. Two girls, terrified of heights, are put to the test on an exercise to bring them to face to face with their fear. Kizzy reveals that because she has injured her foot in training and has no arch left in her left foot she may not be able to graduate. After spending three years at the academy - she may be discharged as physically unfit."
