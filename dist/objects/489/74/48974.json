        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Problem with men\". Prostate cancer is a disease that affects thousands of men world-wide. Men with a family history of prostate cancer, those over 50, and men showing symptoms should all be screened. We follow a patient having his prostate removed following cancer detection through PSA level testing. Norman Schwarzkopf and Professor Derek Llewellyn-Jones also discuss their experience with the disease - particularly the course of treatment they chose, side effects and how they've coped since then. Presented by John Clarke and Bryan Dawe."
