        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Academy\". Bedtime's over: the second year cadets get a chance to put their training to the test when they are sent out on exercise to Puckapunyal, to go over the area and determine whether anyone they may come across is Militia or friend. The Navy cadets board HMAS Tobruk for their first trip and we are privy to their experience of what life is really like at sea and how it differs from their expectations."
