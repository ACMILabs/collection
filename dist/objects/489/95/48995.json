        "Episode of Series \"Janus\". Episodes 19 and 20 of the television series Janus. \"Confess and avoid\" (48 mins) (directed by Robert Klenner) literally means confess to the lesser charges and hopefully avoid the serious charge. Michael Kidd has not lost a case in eight years but doubts start to set in when he finds himself defending a young law student, Ian Bisley (Richard Sutherland) who has been charged with culpable driving. Jenny Hanson (Jane Menelaus) as representative for the Crown Prosecution at the same time, is not looking forward to doing battle with the formidable Michael Kidd. \"A Prima facie case\" (48 mins) (directed by Julian McSwiney). Witnesses are called to give evidence at the commital hearing into Steve Hennessey's death. Allegations are being made that Peter Faithful covered up for his mates and conflicting versions by the witnesses as to whether Steve Hennessey was armed, only complicates matters further. Peter Faithful decides to confront Michael Kidd's allegations of persecution and corruption by taking the witness stand. Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast also includes Chris Haywood, Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Louise Siversen, Felix Nobis, Tamsin West, David Bradshaw and Steve Vidler."
