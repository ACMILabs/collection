        "Episode of Series \"Janus\". Episodes 23 and 24 of the television series Janus. \"Breach of bond\" (48 mins) (directed by Robert Klenner). Shane Hennessey (Jonathan Kernut) has broken his 12 month bond and finds himself remanded in custody on charges of robbery causing injury intentionally, theft and possession of a drug of dependence. Once again he faces Glenda de Bono (Louise Siversen), the same magistrate who put him on a bond for his previous offences. Glenda de Bono also hears a case against a family of gypsies involving crystal balls, curses and large payments of cash. \"An Unnatural act\" (50 mins) (directed by Julian McSwiney) focuses on a disturbing case of incest where a father has allegedly raped his 10-year-old daughter. Michael Kidd acts as Defence Counsellor for the father with Tina Bertrum prosecuting on behalf of the daughter, Evie (Leah de Niese). Meanwhile an escaped prisoner who has been recaptured could be Peter Faithful's answer to the final missing link in the murder case against Mal Hennessey. Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast also includes Chris Haywood, Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Tracy Mann, Paulene Terry-Beitz, and Ezra Bix."
