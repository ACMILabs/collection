        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Phoenix\". The final episodes of the television series \"Phoenix\". `Snow Job': Chris is dealing with Sergio, her drug contact, and organises to buy 90% pure cocaine which indicates the drugs are probably off the boat. The Federal Police plant a camera on the boat to monitor activity but make mistakes in doing so. They send in two undercover cops to act as Customs agents but the crew realise there's rat on board, resulting in dire consequences for Peter's informant. Now that Peter does not have an informant on the ship, it is up to Chris to lead the squads to the drugs. `Hit, Shit and Scatter': Due to the continual mistakes made by the Major's, a crisis meeting is called to discuss their future and they realise they will have to go after the crooks before the unit ceases to exist. Flannagan delivers drugs to Sergio in a hotel and they have enough evidence on him to charge him with intent, plus murder, thanks to the phone tap at the Food Plus store. Murdoch is brought in to tell the squad some devastating new about their future."
