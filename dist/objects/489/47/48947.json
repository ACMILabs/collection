        "Part two of a 2-part documentary about four young female Paralympians in the pursuit of excellence. Retraces footage from part one where the focus was perhaps a bit more on Christie and Holly to focusing on Angie and in particular, Louise, whose motivation and leadership enables the younger girls to be confident and mentally prepared for the big event. Two of them, Angie and Holly, had not even ventured overseas, let alone had the chance to experience the heat of international competition. But their lack of experience didn't prevent these young Australian women from reaching for their dreams. Their immediate goal: win Australia's first gold medal in the World Championship event. The second goal: break the world record. Presented and narrated by David Goldie."
