        "Bill McCoy (Tony Martin) has come back to Sydney after a four year absence, working throughout South East Asia after retiring from the police force due to the level of police corruption and his inability to turn a blind eye. His return is triggered by a phone call from his friend and crisis worker, Syd, that his son Nick is in some kind of trouble. McCoy pays a visit to his ex-wife after having no luck locating Nick, only to be told Nick ended up in a youth detention centre, unbeknownst to Bill - his wife has no idea where their son is. In his venture to locate Nick, Bill meets Dr Maxine Summers (Rachel Blake), who runs a drop in centre for delinquent youth and is treating a young boy named Joe. Joe is a suspect in a ram-raid and car chase that ended with the death of two police officers, while at the same time the body of young boy turns up; tied, raped, tortured and his throat slit."
