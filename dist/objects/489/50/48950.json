        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Waterworks\". Episode 4, 'Taps and toilets', deals with how human usage plays a role in the water cycle. Areas of human usage (both industrial and domestic) are discussed from the source point to the processes used for the purification of waste-water. Increased demand for water has highlighted long-standing problems with water supply including pollution. Forms of pollution discussed are tree clearing, salination and rainwater (carrying pesticides etc to our bays). Also discussed are unconfined aquifers (which explains our Billabongs), and confined aquifers like the Artesian Basin. Narrated by writer and producer Dick Beilby, this program creates relationships between our use of water and broader climatic environment beyond the taps and toilets - \"the part of the water cycle that mostly connect with our lives\"."
