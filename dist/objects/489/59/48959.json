        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Phoenix\". Episodes 3 and 4 of the television series Phoenix. \"A Bunch of Girls\" (directed by Ian Gilmour). This episode brings a new member to the Major Crime Squad, Senior Constable Megan Edwards (Susie Edmonds), the first woman in the squad. Her task is to help with the ever increasing information coming in about the bombing, to see if there are any solid leads, or if it's just useless crackpots hampering with valuable police time. Megan's first day on the job does not go well when the accident prone Constable crashes Lochie's car. \"On The Edge\" (directed by Kate Woods). Snr Det Lazarus Carides joins the task force. For the last two years he has been working undercover with the Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) looking into a stolen car racket. Inspector Brennan believes the bombers and the car scam are connected and requires Laz's assistance with some engraved chassis numbers. However, Laz has a hard time fitting in due to his stint as an undercover cop and decides to disappear to do some of his own investigating. A move that does not strengthen relations with his co-workers who view his actions as untrustworthy."
