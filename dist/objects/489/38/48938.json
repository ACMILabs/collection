        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Waterworks\". 'Episode 2: amazing H2O' starts with the story of Henry Cavendish (Mark Allen), a rich scientist in the 17th century who made it his mission in life to discover the properties of water. His persistence gave us the H2O chemical name. With 70% of the earth covered in water, it is surprising to learn that scientists know more about the qualities of ice than water itself. Exploring both the realm of the known and unknown, this episode covers the following topics; surface tension, anti-gravitational behaviour, solutions, emulsions, ice, gas, evaporation, crystals. Presented by series producer Dick Beilby."
