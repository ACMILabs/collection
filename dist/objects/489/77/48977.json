        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Problem with men\". This episode in the \"Problem with men\" series traces the movement to increase awareness of men's health. In Daylesford, Victoria, we witness a successful men's health night presented by GPS's, chemists and dignitaries. Meanwhile, in Dallas, Texas, we visit the first Male Health Centre - the layout of the building, the clientele they attract. The centre is also involved in the regular, on-site health screenings for all male American Airlines employees, a process which has proved very successful in identifying major illnesses such as cancer. Presented by John Clarke and Bryan Dawe."
