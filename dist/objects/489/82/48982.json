        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Academy\". The Academy looks at life as a new cadet at ADFA - the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra. \"Full bottle now\" introduces Ilana Napier, a new cadet who leaves her family and home to spend three years training at ADFA and the struggles and challenges she experiences. This is also an important time at ADFA because they are undertaking a new experiment with training whereby new cadets will be trained by staff instead of by third year cadets. Kizzy Hyde shares her experiences and takes the viewer on a tour of the barracks as a third year cadet."
