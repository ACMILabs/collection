        "Instructional film which uses psychologist Abraham Maslow's \"Hierarchy of needs\" model to explore how to increase worker productivity. The model posits five levels of need - physiological, security, social, esteem and finally, and most importantly, self-actualisation. Film uses short, fictional, badly acted scenarios to illustrate how each need can be satisfied in the workplace, and how damaging it is if each need is not satisfied. The point is made explicit that we don't satisfy worker needs for their benefit, because it is humane and civilised, but because a happy worker will be more efficient and productive, thus more profitable."
