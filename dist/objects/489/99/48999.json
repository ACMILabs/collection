        "Episode of Series \"Janus\". Episodes 21 and 22 of the television series Janus. \"Demands with menaces\" (50 mins) (directed by Mandy Smith) finds Peter Faithful in the hot seat again. Rhonda Hennessey's (Victoria Eagger) husband, Darren Mack (Nique Needles) is to stand trial at a committal hearing for attempted extortion on a fellow inmate at Pentridge. Allegations are made about Peter Faithful's involvement with the victim, Zoglin (Raj Sidhu) at the police interview and Faithful offering support to Zoglin in a bail application. Michael Kidd argues on the premise of the Hennessey connection, that Darren Mack is part of the Hennessey family and subsequently a target for Peter Faithful's ongoing investigation into the Hennessey's. \"Fit to plead\" (52 mins) (directed by Kate Woods) follows two separate court scenarios. One involving Darren Mack attending his sentencing hearing and the other, an Aboriginal prisoner, Ray Crundall (David Ngoombujarra) being tried for assault. Defence Counsellor, Kathy Tainsh (Glenda Linscott) finds herself fighting the system for justice and understanding on behalf of her Aboriginal client, and Darren Mack decides to fight the system himself, sacking his Defence Counsellor and going it alone. Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast also includes Chris Haywood, Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Louise Siversen, Felix Nobis, Steve Hardman, Tracy Mann, and Alex Scott."
