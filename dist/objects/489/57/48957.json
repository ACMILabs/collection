        "Lauded a national hero in the 1950s due to his skills at his trade, Mateusz Birkut has fallen into the shadows. In making a film of the bricklayer's life, documentary director Krystyna Janda discovers that he used his fame to become involved in politics - resulting in the government wiping out all traces of his accomplishments. Excised by the Polish censors when first released, 'Man of marble' uses reconstructions of old black and white newsreels and matches the stylistic tenets of the documentary genre. (Awards: Winner of the FIPRESCI award, Cannes Film Festival, 1978). In Polish with English subtitles."
