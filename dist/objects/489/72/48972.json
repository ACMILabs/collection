Following his father's funeral, Vusi's mother informs him that his brother Steven is missing, feared to be in trouble with one of the major drug baron's's, Muki (Ving Rhames). Along with his girlfriend, Karin (Elizabeth Hurley), Vusi sets out to find his brother in Johannesburg. Together, they discover Stephen has become addicted to crack, owes Muki $45,000 and the debt needs to be paid or else Vusi will end up burying his brother as well."
