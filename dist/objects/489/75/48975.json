        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Problem with men\". This introductory episode in \"The Problem with men\" looks at why males die younger than females. It attempts to find answers in youth (we follow the goings on at a B & S Ball in Derrinallum), how men live life more dangerously, what behaviour means about the nature of being a man, and how it impacts on health. It looks at what happens to men - health wise - in the under 10's, 20's and 40's age brackets, as well as outlining what's involved in a check up. Presented by John Clarke and Bryan Dawe."
