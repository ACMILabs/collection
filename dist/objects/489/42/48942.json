        "Episode of Series \"For the juniors\". This educational video for children explains the mysteries of the wind from a child's point of view - being scared of the wind at night. It tells of the importance of wind for sailing, gliding, balloonists and the use of the winds currents by birds in flight. There are wind storms, wind breaks, named winds, and the usefulness of wind which can carry seeds and clouds. The video ends with the statement of wind, \"it can be heard, felt but not seen\"."
