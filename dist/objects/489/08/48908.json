        "Glassmaking is an art that was practised by the ancient Egyptians. Made since 1680 at the White Friars Glass Works, England, the practice is still carried on by craftsmen in the works of James Powell & Sons (White Friars) at Wealdstone. Film demonstrates the art from the clay preparation through to the finished object."
