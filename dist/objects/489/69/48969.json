        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Phoenix\". `Shuffling Deck': Now that the case has intensified from aggravated burglary to drug importation, the Federal Police are brought in and want to take over the investigation. There is no way the Majors will allow this to happen, so they decide to work together as a joint task force to try and catch the crooks. Ian and the forensics team has a breakthrough in the identity of Betty's rapist with the discovery of very high lead levels in his blood. `Under Siege': Victor Flannagan is seen at a market talking to another character whom the Majors follow. He turns out to be Gary McKinnon and the Majors think he may be one of the burglars. They keep a trace on Gary's flat and end up with enough evidence for a raid. It eventuates that Gary's flat is rented out under the same name of the stolen Medicare card that was used to sell James Arthur's Rolex to the pawn shop. The raid does not go well; firstly, they have trouble breaking the door down, then they lose Gary who escapes out a window, his terrified girlfriend also jumps out of a window and may never walk again. All the squad members are interviewed over the ensuing investigation into whether someone pushed her, which brings bad light on the Major crime Squad, again. Peter tracks Gary down to his ex-girlfriends house where he is taken hostage in a very violent situation."
