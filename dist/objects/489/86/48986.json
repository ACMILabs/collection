        "This film follows on from Nobody's children\", an expose of homeless youth in inner Sydney. Seven years later, the producers have located two of the children from the original film in order to discover if things have improved for them and what impact being homeless had on their lives. The strong message that emerges is that even though the homeless person may experience a change in their socio-economic status at some point, this does not change the person they are inside. They still face the same emotional issues and burdens they had while they were homeless; unless they receive help, they will simply perpetuate the same situations over and over."
