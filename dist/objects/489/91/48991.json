        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Nurses\". Nurses \"was filmed by four nurses and their friends at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne to capture the real life drama of nursing from a very different perspective...their own\" Nurses are: Kerryn O'Rourke - Oncology. Trish Builic - Psychiatric (to the homeless). Jane Newham - Emergency. Cassie Steward - Theatre. Ep 2: Opens with wonderfully honest scene about the difficulties of getting up in the morning, and the way the twenty-four hour, year round demands of nursing that throw your body and personal life out. Jane, who has been in a relationship for five months talks about the cycle of crankiness that comes whenever she works nights. And the difficulties of getting a partner, used to a nine to five work day, to understand. Trish, who has just been proposed to (lots of drama) says upfront that she chose to specialise in psychiatric because she didn't think she could work nights relentlessly, and even so she still carries responsibility beyond working hours. Kerryn takes the audience through a night shift and we see that its the little things that get you through, brushing your teeth, coming home to clean bed sheets. And in theatre there are some gory scenes, before Cassie takes us out the back for a cigarette..."
