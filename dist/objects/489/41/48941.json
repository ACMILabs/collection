        "Episode of Series \"For the juniors\". This video is mostly a visual exploration of rain as it falls on a rain forest. There is a child with yellow rain coat and rain hat walking through the rain and speaking of the rain and how things can be appreciated differently as it falls. The water rushes and runs gathering in streams. The child visits the zoo to watch the animals in the rain who don't seem as fussed about the rain as humans do, drinking from the sky. The child ends up in the playground enjoying the rain here also."
