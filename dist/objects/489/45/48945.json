        "Episode of Series \"For the juniors\". An educational series aimed at 6-8 year olds which covers a variety of subject areas such as weather, transport, space, people and celebrations. When it is hot outside, people wear shorts and t-shirts, drink lots of water, and modify their usual activities to help keep cool. The question is why do we do this? Suitable for children aged 3-7, this video describes how changes in weather affect people, plants and animals differently and the different methods each use to adapt and cope with the heat; what a thermometer is and what it does; how to observe and monitor changes in the weather; and why it is important to dress appropriately when it is hot outside. Also briefly discusses the sun as an energy source."
