        "The third and bleakest of George A. Romero's 'Living dead' series (which consist of 'Night of the living dead' and 'Dawn of the dead'), is also the most goriest. Essentially, society has collapsed and the living dead have taken over the world. The film picks up on a small group of survivors, made up of scientists and a small band of soldiers who have barricaded themselves in an abandoned missile silo. The scientists desperately search for a solution to the zombie plague, while the military become increasingly agitated at their lack of results. Like Romero's previous outings into the world of the undead, the varied groups are microcosms of human nature and not surprisingly, the most unpleasant characters in this film are not the zombies but the humans themselves. Cast includes Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, Joe Pilato, Richard Liberty and Howard Sherman."
