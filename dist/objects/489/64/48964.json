        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Phoenix\". Episodes 12 and 14 of the television series Phoenix. `Hard Ball'. Now that the majors know the identity of the bombers they have Pat, Dennis and Nick's house under surveillance. In order for this to be carried off without incident, they use the neighbour's house to keep an eye on the boys who are ready to do a runner. Once the raid goes down, Ian from forensics will have only six hours to find evidence to use against the bombers, so timing is crucial. `Deal or Play'. Two elderly people are pistol whipped and burgled in their own home. The Majors are desperate to find the intruders and see who they sold the stolen goods to - if they can find the buyers, they will find the suspects. James Arthur is so traumatised from the ordeal he starts to give everyone a hard time, including the gas meter reader."
