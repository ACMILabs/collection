        "Episode of Series \"Janus\". Episodes 25 and 26 of the television series Janus. \"Mute by visitation\" (50 mins) (directed by Mandy Smith). Glenda de Bono is listed to preside as Judge on a retrial of a rape case. This is her first major trial since becoming a County Judge. The unusual aspect of this trial however, is that both the victim, Colleen Maitland (Danni Wright) and the alleged rapist, Tim Lester (Mike Canfield) are profoundly deaf - so are their families and the witnesses. Meanwhile, application for Mal Hennessey's blood sample for DNA testing is granted and Peter Faithful gets a bonus when \"Gazza\", during his interview, puts Shirl Hennessey in the picture as the one to organise the disposal of Patrick Clancy's body. \"Elements of murder\" (51 mins) (directed by Kate Woods) is the final episode of Janus. Mal Hennessey and Shirl Hennessey face a commital hearing - Mal for murder and Shirl for accessory after the fact to murder. The use of DNA as corroborating material, and Sandy (Mal's ex girlfriend), Gazza and Tomlinson as witnesses for the Prosecution, make it almost impossible for Michael Kidd to get Mal and Shirl off. And the internal investigation into Steve Hennessey's death is closing in on Peter Faithful and his team. A dramatic conclusion to this brilliant Australian television series. Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast also includes Chris Haywood, Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Felix Nobis, Louise Siversen, Brett Swain, Paulene Terry-Beitz, Leverne McDonnell, Belinda McClory and Victoria Eagger."
