        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Waterworks\". 'Floating, sinking and swimming', the third in the series, primarily deals with physics principles that explain the nature of water in relation to our use of it. The rules for floating and sinking are discussed, with Archimedes' Principle that went further to describe the physics of buoyancy. Pressure, force and density are explained with examples (like the construction of wetsuits and submarines) that differentiate how water pressure relates to solids and liquids. Presented by series producer Dick Beilby."
