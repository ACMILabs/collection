        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". On February 10th, 1964, the destroyer HMAS Voyager was sliced in two when it collided with her flagship aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne in Jervis Bay, off the coast of New South Wales. Voyager sunk with the loss of 82 men. This program attempts to piece together the final minutes before the fatal collision and the years of bitter neglect for the survivors of Voyager who are still fighting for justice and compensation. Their burden has been one of broken careers, sometimes broken marriages and often broken mental and physical health. Although two Royal Commissions have taken place, responsibility for the collision still remains unanswered, counselling and support have never been provided to the survivors and a certain amount of suspicion still exists about high-ranking naval personnel cover-ups. Reporter: Andrew Olle."
