        "Episode of Series \"Janus\". Episodes 11 and 12 of the television series Janus. \"Without prejudice\" (50 mins) (directed by Kate Woods) gives an insight to jury selection procedures and the workings of a jury during a trial. Steve Hennessey (Leon Teague) and Darren Mack (Nique Needles) are finally being tried for \"trafficking of drugs of dependence\" with Dale Cassidy (previously a Prosecution witness at the commital hearing) now appearing as the main witness for the Prosecution. Peter Faithful and Rob Griffin are slowly mounting evidence against Mal Hennessey for the murder of Patrick Clancy. \"Improper influences\" (48 mins) (directed by Julian McSwiney). Judge Grossman (Denis Moore) is determined to see the Steve Hennessey drug trial through, despite growing concern about his health. Defence's case focuses on the questionable quality of the police surveillance video-tape of the drug deal. Peter Faithful's unrelenting pursuit of evidence to get Mal Hennessey for murder leads him to Mal's ex-girlfriend who is serving time in Fairlea Women's Prison. Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast also includes Chris Haywood, Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Felix Nobis, Grant Piro, Sheryl Munks, Damian Foley, Greg Fleet and Pepe Trevor."
