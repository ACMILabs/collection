        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Problem with men\". Bryan Dawe and John Clarke introduce the delicate areas of impotence and testicular cancer. Testicular cancer can be treated early if picked up through self examination - if left, removal is the only option. Men who have had a testicle removed discuss if, and how the surgery and treatment has affected their lives. They also postulate on why self examination does not receive the same coverage that women's self examination does. Meanwhile, impotence sufferers and their partners describe their experiences and medical professionals go through the pros and cons of vacuum pumps, self injection and where impotence treatment is heading. We are also shown how to examine for testicular abnormalities."
