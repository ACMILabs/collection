        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". Today one in three people will come down with cancer before the age of 74 - 60% will survive. But it is the survivors who have to face life after cancer. Their victory over cancer is just the beginning of a long journey, where the survivor feels lost once treatment has ceased, that their life has changed and that they will always carry the fear of recurrence. Their psychological state of mind also impacts on the carers, often destroying close and longstanding relationships. This program examines the psychological after-effects for such patients and provides hope for the future for cancer survivors in the area of counselling and support. Contains some scenes in b&w. Reporter: Wendy Page."
