        "On Sunday 9th August, 1987 at approximately 9.30pm a mass killing took place in Hoddle Street, Clifton Hill, a suburb of Melbourne. Julian Knight killed seven people and injured nineteen others in a shooting spree that was to leave a devastating and lasting effect on, not only the local residents of Clifton Hill, but on all Victorians. Melbourne lost its innocence that night. This film is told in three parts. Part one: the build-up - covers Julian Knight's background and his obsessions and fantasies of being a soldier in combat. Part two: the night - retraces Julian's route on the night of the shootings, and the events that took place according to the survivors, the police and witnesses. Part three: the aftermath - relates the disbelief, anger and distress felt by all and the formation of support groups for the victims and their families. Deals with the rise of the Anti-Gun Lobby, and the cry for tougher gun laws. Television footage, police interviews, interviews with victims and their families and forensic psychologists have been compiled to produce this compelling documentary. Written and narrated by Jonathan Holmes."
