        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Phoenix\". Episodes 21 and 22 of the television series Phoenix. `In On The Joke': IID are focusing on Peter as he has had $20,000 go into his bank account which is unaccounted for, consequently he becomes the target of an investigation, especially after Internal Affairs hear him make a deal with an informant. Stanley - a not so trusted informant - gives the Majors information about the stolen jewelry, that it is being melted down into gold blocks to make it easier to handle. Stanley gives them the name Victor Flannagan as the head leader of this racket, but not before giving the Majors a chase across the states where he is wanted for all sorts of offences. `Give A Dog A Bone': Now that the squad has a name, they have to start their own surveillance as the toe cutters upstairs have reduced their surveillance services to the squad. They discover Flannagan is using the phone at a Food Plus store to discuss his criminal activities and they are going to have to tap the phone to try and find out about a huge drug importation coming in, luckily Peter has an informant at the wharf to help them with their investigation."
