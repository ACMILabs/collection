        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Nurses\". Nurses \"was filmed by four nurses and their friends at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne to capture the real life drama of nursing from a very different perspective...their own\" Nurses are: Kerryn O'Rourke - Oncology. Trish Builic - Psychiatric (to the homeless). Jane Newham - Emergency. Cassie Steward - Theatre. Ep 4. With Christmas and the Millenium coming up there are conclusions and last comments. There are holidays taken, shopping to be done and religion and beliefs are reflected upon. Jane demystifies the bed pan. One of Kerryn's patients has rapidly deteriorated. Cassie becomes a patient. And Trish gets frustrated at the outpouring of good will on Christmas day and wonders where it all goes for the rest of the year."
