        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Phoenix\". Episodes 19 and 20 in the television series Phoenix. `Safe as Houses': The Major Crime Squad and Criminal Intelligence lock horns over an informant, Carlos, who might have information about the identity of the two burglary suspects. When Peter and the boys find the safe house, they don't realise Chris is in drug squad, nor that Peter's wife is there staking him out. `Aladdins Cave': Peter interviews John Reece who was found at the safe house regarding the stolen property, although he does have a connection to the robberies, it doesn't look likely that he is Betty's rapist. The 6 stamps belonging to James Arthur are found in John Reece's house and the majors find out that the burglaries are related to drug importation - a much bigger deal than what they first thought they were dealing with."
