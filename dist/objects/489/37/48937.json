        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Waterworks\". 'Waterworks' is an in depth series produced by the ABC on water and covers areas such as; human usage, molecular properties and the role of water in the ecology. 'The Water planet', first in the series, details broadly the concepts that govern the function of water and investigates the presence of water on earth and in space. The film starts with the premise that all life on earth is based on water and digresses to detail this relationship. The following subjects are covered from the presence of water in space, water cycles, water ecology, function of chemical parts in water, weather patterns and its relationship to water, water and plantlife, the oceans. Presented by series producer Dick Beilby."
