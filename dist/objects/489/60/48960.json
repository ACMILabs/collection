        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Phoenix\". Episodes 11 and 12 of the television series Phoenix `Hair of the Dog', opens with the scene of a body found in a river, the apparent cause of death a gun shot victim. Contrary to their first impressions, Ian from forensics discovers the victim died of a heroin overdose and things start moving again for the Majors. The upstairs brass decides to cut surveillance so the detectives start their own off duty surveillance, watching Nick's house. The discovery of hair fibres found at the bombing reveals that a dog is connected to the robbers, all they need to do now is find the dog that connects Nick, the house and Dennis. `Paradise Tomorrow'. Under continual pressure the bombers are beginning to make mistakes. Dennis screws up a robbery of a disposal store and his identity matches the majors sketch. While the garage is under surveillance Nick steals a car and takes it to there to have chassis numbers drilled out, just like the bomb car. The majors feel they are closing in."
