        "Episode of Series \"For the juniors\". This educational video for children covers the topic of cold weather. There are scenes of frosty mornings and the reasons why nights can be so cold, especially when they are cloudless. There are ways and reasons to stay warm and how animals like sheep and horses keep warm during the cold months. The video explains how penguins and whales stay warm, mentioning migration and hibernation as ways animals survive the cold weather. Cold weather and seasons are also important to explain why you can't buy vegetables all year round."
