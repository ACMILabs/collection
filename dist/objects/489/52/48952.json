        "Episode of Series \"Big picture\". A look at the life of Abdurrahman Wahid, the first democratically elected President of Indonesia and the many challenges he faces in governing this highly fragmented society. Shows the pressure Wahid faces from the Army, which is reluctant to hand over powers it gained under the 30 years of General Soeharto's dictatorship. Follows Wahid on a foreign trip while back in Indonesia General Wiranto, the Indonesian military leader, has been accused of human rights abuses against the East Timorese people. An interesting and insightful documentary of President Wahid, his family, his Islamic beliefs and philosophy, and his political diplomacy with foreign leaders and the international media. Includes images of some personal and upfront moments in Wahid's daily rituals."
