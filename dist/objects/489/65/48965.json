        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Phoenix\". Episodes 15 and 16 of the television series Phoenix. `Deal or Play': Due to the recession, aggravated assaults are increasing, especially against the older community. Ian from forensics is trying to match a soil sample from the boots the burglars were wearing at one of the aggravated assaults. The rolex watch that was stolen from Betty and James Arthur's house turns up at a pawn shop so they desperately try to find the identity of who sold it. `Married to the Job': Chris Faithfull (Peter's wife) is an undercover drug squad cop. She survives the harrowing experience of having a gun put to her head in an attempt to sniff out the big dealers. Carol and the drug squad hide out in a paddock where a young university student has set up an elaborate drug lab inside a caravan, unfortunately he is not as experienced as first thought as he manages to blow the caravan up, along with the evidence the drug squad needs to charge him."
