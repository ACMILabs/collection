        "A safety education film presented from the point of view of a red bicycle, owned first by a boy who obeyed the traffic rules and then by one who brought himself and the bicycle to a sad fate. The first boy is seen riding sensibly on the road and passing a police cycling test. The bicycle is then stolen by a lad whose reckless riding leads to a serious accident to himself and the bicycle falling into the river to rust. The film brings out a number of specific points about safe and dangerous cycling."
