        "American teenage scouts visit Philmont Scout Ranch in Texas. In rugged beautiful natural surroundings they enjoy rough trail hiking, camping, shooting, fishing, archery, cattle work, forestry, riding and learn about rocks, gold and the early history of the area. The twenty-one camps in the ranch provide these boys with a taste for life in the wilderness as it was lived by early American pioneers. No credits available."
