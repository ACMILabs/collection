        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Boss Class\". This film shows how up-to-date British managers achieve their objectives. Typical management problems are explained by case histories - exporting and takeovers by the Leyland Group (Sir Donald Stokes), Marks and Spencer's philosophy of marketing, and then a small manufacturer (Jim Houston) talks of his experience with a new highly technological product."
