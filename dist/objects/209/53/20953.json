        "This film shows how, in Malaya, a modern prison is not a place of punishment, but a place of reconstruction. Reveals through the eyes of a newly convicted man under sentence of ten years imprisonment, exactly what lies before him and how the prison system of progress and privileges works. At the outset, it is explained to the prisoner what opportunities may be his, so that when he leaves prison he may be a more skilful, better educated man and a valuable citizen of Malaya. No other credits available."
