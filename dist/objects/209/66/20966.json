        "Reveals some of the animal and plant life not always visible to the naked eye, and shows the fascinating creatures which can be found in rock pools and shallow waters among the breeding grounds of Britain's sea-birds. The film brings to light a wealth of pictorial information in the best traditions of the nature documentary film and was awarded prizes at a number of international film festivals between 1958 and 1960."
