        "Every switch is a demand for instant electricity. Shows how this demand is met in Victoria. The Latrobe Valley brown coal provides four-fifths of electricity. Shows work at Yallourn and Morwell and progress on the new Hazelwood power station. Use of electricity in industry, at home, for transport, and entertainment. Increasing demands are a measure of the State's growth and rate of development. Emphasis on ability to meet future demands."
