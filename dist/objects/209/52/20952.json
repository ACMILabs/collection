        "Produced for Cyclone fencing, this film looks at the value of tubular steel and wire mesh in farm buildings, fencing and gates on dairy farms, especially the savings in labour and maintenance costs. The uses of steel fencing and prefabricated steel sheds are described, followed by a complete milking unit in operation. The film closes with an analysis of capital costs, savings and earnings from increased yields."
