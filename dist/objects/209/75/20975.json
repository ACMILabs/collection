        "A film of marvels, an amazing view of the living, pulsing universe contained in a single drop of water from a fish aquarium. Colour film and a microscope, and the infinite patience of the filmmakers, reveal life that no-one would ordinarily see. This is a view of creation, of birth, life and death, of the laws of nature that apply even to the smallest of living things. It is a film that will add knowledge and insight to the pleasure of any audience. Photographers: Eric Chamberlain, Claudia Overing. Narrated by Sharry Plett and Albert Martin. Awards: Tehran; Belgrade; Melbourne."
