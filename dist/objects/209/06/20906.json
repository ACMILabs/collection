        "An introduction to the fundamentals of pottery. Wheel throwing is simplified by using the clock dial as a means of reference. Techniques shown making a cylinder are sticking, mastering, centering, opening, raising and finishing. The potter's rib is demonstrated. The needle point tool is used to level and to test for centre bottom thickness. Similar techniques are shown for bowl and plate forms."
