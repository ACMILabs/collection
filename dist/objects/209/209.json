        "Barry McQueen recounts how he moved from radio to television - starting with regional radio in NSW, moving to ABC in 1952, and finally arriving in Melbourne to cover the 1956 Olympic Games. Originally working at ABC for 2 years, McQueen describes the work atmosphere of the station, the management style of the day, and his involvement in news, current affairs and continuity announcing. Moving on to Channel 9, McQueen draws comparisons between the stations' work ethic, management styles, and focuses on his involvement in \"In Melbourne Tonight\". Following his stint at Channel 9, McQueen moves to Channel O (now Channel 10) where he became involved with programs such as \"The Pacemakers\" and \"Dateline\". McQueen's discussion about his time at Channel 0 is centred on the early days of the stations inception and branches into his views on the industry today. In 1973 Barry McQueen went freelance and has now moved into production, voice overs and training videos."
