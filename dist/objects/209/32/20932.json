        "This live action film takes place in the Canton of Grisons in Switzerland and illustrates an old custom; when spring comes the village boys chase away the winter with bells, rattles and cracking whips. Ursli, unhappy with his tiny bell, remembers a big bell in his father's chalet high above the timber-line and sets off to get it."
