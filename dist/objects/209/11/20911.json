    "description": [
        "At the annual Begonia Festival, Ballarat becomes a city of flowers, music, dancing and drama centred on the famous begonia display. Mr. Tom Beaumont, the curator of the glass house in the Botanic Gardens, tends the many blooms. He is a world authority on begonia culture. Highlights of the display are a thousand double blooms and six hundred distinctive single varieties. In the gardens we see a fine display of salvias, gladioli and dahlias. Young and old admire the wonderful colour and variety of the Botanic Gardens and also the open air art exhibition. Commentary by John Morgan."
