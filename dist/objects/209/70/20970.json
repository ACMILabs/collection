Follows a new student from class to class and shows how the deaf are simultaneously taught lip-reading and sign language in the course of enrollment in a regular four year college curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. Explains that hearing students from other countries receive instruction at the Gallaudet Graduate School in the art of teaching the deaf."
