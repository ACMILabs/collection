        "Discusses the economic and political progress of a region in West Africa now known as Trans-Volta Togoland. Points out that once local government was set up, steps were taken to provide the region with a system of roads and bridges, and adequate water supply and hospitals and clinics to help in the fight against leprosy and other diseases prevelant in tropical countries. Advances in industrial and agricultural fields were also made; these included re-establishment of the palm oil industry and the introduction of modern methods and machinery. Progress is being made in the educational field by the establishment of technical colleges and universities."
