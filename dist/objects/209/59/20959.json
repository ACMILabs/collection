        "This film shows how researchers and seed-growers combine their efforts to raise output from grasslands. In the laboratories, strains of alfalfa, clover and other fodder crops are bred which are more resistant to disease, and more nutritious. Rigorous dampness tests, etc., eliminate all but the hardiest plants, which are then multiplied on specialist seed-farms, carefully inspected to ensure purity of the resulting seed. Reveals many other aspects of scientific farming. No other credits available."
