        "This 1960's film is about the communication gap between two generations: teenagers and young adults on the one hand, and the generation of those over thirty - \"the establishment\". The teenagers' use of LSD and other drugs is only one of the symptoms of this communication gap. A group of parents desperately seek help in order to understand what has gone wrong. The film is an attempt to go \"beyond LSD\" and is intended to stimulate discussion amongst high school students, college students, teachers and parents. Ample involuntary hilarity can result from viewing this great hysterical/historical document. Starting as a raucous celluloid freak-out, the film presents its square's-eye view of the \"Generation Gap\" through the fictive device of a round table of pod people, each alike in their helmet-hair and cat's eye glasses. The production crew of this film was primarily made up of teenagers and young adults. Music by \u2018The Stayns.\u2019 A minor masterpiece of psychedelic cinema."
