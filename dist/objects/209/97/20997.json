        "The average man, in ignorance and confusion, has an optimistic view of his future. The expert, wrapped in his knowledge and expertise, is pessimistic. It is this disparity of belief that the political cartoonist and humorist, Bruce Petty, animates in his film. Petty sees the world and its problems as complex. He shows Man as a lonely figure on a unicycle, pedalling hard towards disaster. Awards: Golden Reel Award, AFI Awards 1971."
