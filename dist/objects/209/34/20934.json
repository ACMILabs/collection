        "About social interaction in a small New South Wales country town. Through the lives of four men the film reveals how newcomers to a community create a network of friends and acquaintances which gives them a sense of belonging. Records discussions in various clubs and associations, and suggests that in country towns there are clearly those who \"belong\" and those who don't; women, aboriginals, the poor, the unemployed."
