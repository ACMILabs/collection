        "Describes the State Electricity Commission's hydro-electric scheme in north-eastern Victoria as seen by those who live on the job and those who find their recreation in this playground area of the 'Australian Alps'. Set against a background of mountains, rivers and picturesque reservoirs in the mountain valleys, it is a documentary with a strong human element, describing in non-technical language the construction and operation of this major electricity undertaking. The film shows the alpine region in summer and winter, and the wide range of sport and natural attractions it offers the tourist."
