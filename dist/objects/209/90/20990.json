        "Throughout Australia aluminium is being used more and more in a multitude of industries and particularly in transport. Across vast tracts of country aluminium road transports, buses, railway carriages, and aeroplanes fly daily. Fishing boats and pleasure craft, caravans and land are all now produced in aluminium. Tip trucks, plank floor trays and wheat hoppers, as well as domestic items such as foil have all been affected by the \"aluminium revolution\"."
