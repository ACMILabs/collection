        "West Berlin is an outpost of freedom in the Russian dominated sector of East Germany, encroached on all sides by Soviet armed strength. Reporting factually on the current Berlin crisis, reviews the main events since World War II which have lead to the present situation. Thousands of refugees have fled from East to West Berlin in a desperate bid to escape the tyranny of the Communist regime. The threat by Russia to change the status of Berlin has become a problem of world proportions. No other credits available."
