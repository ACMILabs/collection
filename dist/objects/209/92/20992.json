        "The film conveys a vivid impression of the extent of the vast engineering project being undertaken to enlarge the Eildon Dam to nine times its former storage capacity. Working night and day, heavy earth moving equipment is transforming the countryside, building a dam which will provide irrigation water for the Goulburn Valley and hydro-electric power for use throughout Victoria.
