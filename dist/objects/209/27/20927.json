        "Episode number 9 of Series \"What Do You Think\". Departing from the norm, from accepting patterns of dress or behaviour, can bring down on the head of an erring teenager the unqualified disapproval of his gang. Is this attitude valid? The film cites the case of a thirteen year old boy who has developed an interest in collecting butterflies - a hobby that his friends laugh at. Should he pursue his genuine interest, or should he conform?"
