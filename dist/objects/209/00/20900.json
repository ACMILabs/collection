        "By using the remains of things made and built by prehistoric man to reconstruct a prehistoric dwelling, this film ambitiously attempts to tell the story of what happened in the ages before the period at which most history books begin. The co-operation of many world famous British museums, societies, and foundations has helped to make this reconstruction, (especially the Iron Age farm), authentic. No credits available."
