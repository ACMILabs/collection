        "Episode of Series \"PSSC physics\". The Brownian motion as applicable to smoke particles is shown by photomicrography and compared with a mechanical analogue. Animation is used to develop a model for gas pressure based on chaotic molecular motion. This chaotic motion is contrasted with the orderly behaviour of gases as shown by an experiment illustrating Boyle's Law. Suitable for upper secondary level."
