        "A lively interpretation of jazz music played by the Oscar Peterson Trio. The music is visually represented in a series of abstract lines and shapes, hand painted directly on to the film, culminating in a fast and furious explosion as the tempo quickens. One of the high points of jazz in cinema (and of McLaren's career)."
