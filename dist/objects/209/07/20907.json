        "A driver obeys traffic signs even when there is no one in sight because he has a conscience, instilled since childhood by his daily life at home, school, and work. The socialization process is analysed in terms of the life of an \"average\" boy. Shows influence of parental approval or disapproval, peer acceptance or rejection, and forms of discipline in various social situations. In a nutshell, this film implores the \"educational aspect of punishment.\" It explains that without socialisation, and without the sanctions used to achieve it, there would be no basis for moral order in human society."
