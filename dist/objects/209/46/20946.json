        "Fender has worked as a clerk for many years in the cold warehouse of Ranting & Co., and wants one of the warm sheepskin overcoats stacked around him. Ranting refuses, and Fender asks his friend Morry the tailor to make a coat for him. However, Fender is fired and dies of cold before the coat is finished. His troubled ghost returns to Morry, and persuades him to help him take what he feels is his due - a sheepskin coat from Ranting's warehouse."
