        "Scientists study nature and experiment to discover the basis of evolution. By tracing the history of the element carbon, the evolution of organic matter from cosmic matter to unicellular and multi-cellular organisms is known. Experiments synthesizing complex organic matter from simple substances prove the importance of carbon in the evolution of life; amino acids can be synthesized which are linked with proteins and important to life.
