        "Describes the 'turn-round' of a ship - S.S. Bravo - which plies with freight and passengers between Hull and Gothenburg. For an army of men, from river pilot to Stevedore, each 'turn-round' is a test of professional skill, and a race against time if tides are to be caught and schedules kept. The film tells the story of what this means to George Moore, a foreman docker, and to a Swedish passenger who comes to England as a buyer of British goods."
