        "December 1953 was the 50th anniversary of heavier than air flight. This film compares the early flights by the Wright Brothers in America and W.E. Hart in Australia, with the highly complex organization of a modern international airline in Australia. The film illustrates the many activities of airline personnel, all of whom play their part in keeping aircraft in the air. Commentary by Harry Dearth, photography by Syd Wood."
