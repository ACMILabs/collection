        "A young boy wanders through bushland enjoying nature's beauty. Carrying a slug gun he initially shoots at a paper cup, however images of TV western gunfights go through his mind and on impulse he takes aim and shoots a bird. Realising what he has done the boy runs away as scenes of real life violence flash before him - scenes of war and innocent killing. The boy makes the decision to return to target shooting. A non-verbal film with b&w sequences. Suitable for middle and upper primary and lower secondary levels."
