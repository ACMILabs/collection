        "Australian waters are an exciting setting for big game fishing. Not only are the fish big and full of fight, but the Great Barrier Reef provides a setting of unequalled beauty. This film captures the excitement of a world record marlin catch by New Zealander Sir William Stevenson in the waters off Cairns, in Northeast Australia. It weighed 1231 lbs."
