    "description": [
        "Set against the industrial backdrop of a post-World War II Australian steel manufacturing town, multimedia artist Debra Petrovitch's semi-autobiographical work Uncle Bill is a dark and disturbing narrative that explores a young girl's memories of growing up in a harsh and at times violent environment. A cross-platform interactive CD-ROM, Uncle Bill takes the viewer on a journey that investigates memory, catharsis and child abuse through the interface of interactive, non-linear technology.Raw and unrelenting, Uncle Bill is an unsettling work that investigates the ways in which interactive technology can be used to explore complex, emotional and highly charged subject material."
