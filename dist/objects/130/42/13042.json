        "A look at everyday life in one community and how it transforms waste into a valuable commodity, from one individual's discarded object to another's newly claimed prize possession. Several residents offer their personal insights to curbside recycling or as one discerning person calls it \"free-ranging rubbish\", adding that there is a definite rubbish etiquette to be followed. Music composed and performed by Irma Frieda."
