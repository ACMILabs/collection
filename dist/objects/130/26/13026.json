        "This experimental music video was developed for Melbourne art-rock band, Greyn, with the assistance of the Australian Council for the Arts. A non-commercial film, it breaks down the generic film conventions of commercial music video production by not promoting the band as sexy, as rock gods, or as exceptional musicians, but by telling the story of inner balance. The two performers, Sangeetha Jane and Daimon Barry, move through an experimental yoga/dance sequence that sees them grow and evolve over the course of a hauntingly beautiful track entitled \"Beckher\".
