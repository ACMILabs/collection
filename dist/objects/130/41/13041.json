        "An intriguing and entertaining piece of work about an emu and her chick as they meander their way through urban streets in outback Broken Hill, NSW, confronting various challenges along the way. With no narration and using a music soundtrack this appealing doco captures the endearing qualities of these amazing Ozzie birds. Camera, editing and music by Sean O'Keeffe."
