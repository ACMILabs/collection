        "Using 2-D animation this short film captures the filmmaker's childhood experience of an eye injury which not only caused a temporary loss of sight and distortion of vision, but also a sense of fear and loneliness. His father too suffered a similar fate as a child but circumstances were such that he became permanently blind. The story explores family relationships and reflects on life's unexpected turns. Narrated by Roberto Salvatore.  \"Living in the dark\" recently won the best cinematography in the 2005 Bondi Short Film Festival in Sydney and was selected for the Electronic Theatre Program at the Graphite 2005 Conference, Dunedin, New Zealand."
