        "Inner city Richmond (Victoria) celebrates its 150th birthday. Local residents, shop-keepers, community leaders including Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum and Peter Norden have their say about their beloved Richmond. Whether born there or a recent newcomer, Richmond it seems, is a place of community, fierce loyalty and respect for your neighbour. Includes some wonderful images of past and present including the MCG, Punt Road, Bridge Road, Swan Street, remains of old factories such as Rosella and archival stills of local street scenes. Narrated by Rob Clancy."
