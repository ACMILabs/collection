        "Jem Cohen talks with Emma Crimmings about his relationship with cities and curating a secret museum of unseeen human activity. He describes the qualities and significance of Super 8 film and cameras. He talks about attempts to categorise his work and the limitations of terms such as 'poetic' or 'experimental'. Works such as 'Lost Book Found' and 'This is a History of New York' are discussed as well as his methodology as an independent film-maker. The discussion also touches on his work with music video and shooting the conflict between the regional and global in Melbourne."
