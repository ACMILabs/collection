        "A student production making a clear statement of the conservationists viewpoint of clearfelling and woodchopping of valuable native forests. It examines the history of the Otways and argues strongly against current practices. This film could be used in conjunction with films and resources giving the alternative viewpoints to stimulate debate on resource management."
