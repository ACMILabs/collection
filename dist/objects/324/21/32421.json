        "Episode number 21 of Series \"The Australian eye IV\". A study of the painting \"The Mining town\" by Arthur Boyd. Arthur Boyd, as an artist, has developed his own personal imagery to express the universal themes of love and oppression of life and death, regeneration and metamorphosis. The film is centred around one of his most complex allegorical paintings. He speaks of the effect of his upbringing and family background upon the style and content of his work and the influence of Brueghel on his art."
