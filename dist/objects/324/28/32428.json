        "Using clips from newsreels and surf movies, notably \"Crystal Voyager\", made in Australia over the last fifty years, and interviewing filmmakers and others involved in the multi-million dollar Australian surfing industry, this documentary shows the close relationship between surf movies and the sport that usually see Australians as the world champions. Contains some b&w footage."
