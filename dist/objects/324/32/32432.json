        "Our hero dreams of winning a lot of money, buying new clothes and a car, then having a grand party. Short animated satire on the desire for personal wealth. The moral of the film is that the idea of suddenly gaining personal wealth is very attractive, including the delusion that it will bestow power and influence. However, desires are only dreams: it is more realistic to build one's happiness on one's true situation."
