        "Looks at some potentially stressful family situations for the child, such as the arrival of a baby, entry into a new school, and puberty. Indicates that, although stress is inevitable in children's lives, once the causes are realised by parents, it can be utilised as a stepping stone towards emotional growth and family unity."
