        "Episode number 18 of Series \"The Australian eye IV\". Margaret Preston was one of the few artists who have attempted to absorb the spirit of Australian aboriginal art into Modernist painting. \"Flying over the Shoalhaven River\" is one of the best of her paintings influenced by the ancient art of this country. The film examines some of the artist's work, and her thoughts on \"National Art\", design and theories of light and colour are also elaborated."
