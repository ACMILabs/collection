        "In 1952, after only 13 years of operation, the Australian Government closed the Glen Davis Shale Oil Works due to floods, numerous industrial accidents and huge financial losses. The large mining community was forced to leave the valley and the town died. The miners and their families return annually to their beloved town and talk of old times, the curse of Glen Davis and the morning they woke up to find there was \"no such a place\" Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
