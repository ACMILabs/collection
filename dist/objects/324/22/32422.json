        "The increased incidence of shoplifting has meant increasingly sophisticated security and surveillance systems are installed in retail stores. The popular myths about shoplifting are examined and negated. This film contains six vignettes emphasising that shoplifting is a real crime with real consequences. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
