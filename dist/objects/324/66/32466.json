        "Warrah was filmed in the coastal sandstone bush of the Hawkesbury River area in NSW. It is a film of rock, foliage, angophoras, rock pools, the movement of shadows, light reflected from water and reflections of trees and clouds in rock pools. The soundtrack of this 3-colour separation film is an unaltered recording of insects and choruses of kookaburras."
