        "Solrun Hoaas'avant garde poetic tribute to Noh mask maker Taniguchi Akiko emphasises the relationship between the mask maker and her mask. It experiments with the visual and dramatic potential in Noh and in the mask, moving towards abstraction as the mask appears and re-appears in the reflection of a tree, its original substance."
