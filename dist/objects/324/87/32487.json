        "A humorous animated story about a prisoner and a warden who share a desert island. As the warden attends to the needs of his prisoner it becomes increasingly obvious that they are both dependant on each other. At times their roles appear to be reversed posing several questions about who is actually free. Music by Stefan Dimitrov, animated by Dimitar Petkov."
