        "In good citizenship where does a person's duty to the community end? Where does obligation to oneself or one's family begin when apportioning one's spare time and energy? These questions come under vigorous discussion when a member of an urban community is approached by two of his neighbors to head a worthwhile community project. He declines on the grounds that one such commitment leads to another, to the extent of infringing on his personal freedom. One of his neighbors feels he is shirking responsibility in refusing; the other thinks perhaps he is right in resisting community pressure. The audience is invited to discuss the matter."
