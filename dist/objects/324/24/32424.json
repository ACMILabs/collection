        "Serious hearing loss perpetrated in the industrial workplace is irreversible. This program portrays the peer pressures on the shop floor that might discourage workers from using protective devices - but at their peril. We see one factory worker who is teased about wearing his ear muffs, but his fantasies convince him that the consequences are worse than the flak he cops. A light-hearted drama which emphasises the necessity of using the correct protective gear at work. Stars Bryan Brown."
