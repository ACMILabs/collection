        "Episode of Series \"Introduction to History\". A discussion between four academic historians about the ways in which the discipline of history, as they study and teach it, makes demands which sharply differentiates it from other kinds of history. They relate these points in the first place to the virtues and defects of some of the work of G. M. Trevelyan. Then B. Dodson of York University, discusses a newspaper series called \"The Making of the British\" and shows five points at which it departs from what he would consider professional standards of history."
