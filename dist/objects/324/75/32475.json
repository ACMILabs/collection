        "Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby demonstrates how to execute four basic gymnastic routines - the vault, floor exercises, uneven parallel bars and the balance beam, and explains her personal philosophy about gymnastics. Slow motion and stop action techniques and film clips of Olympic Medal Winners, Olga Korbut, Nadia Comaneci and Nelly Kim make this film particularly useful as a teaching tool for beginning gymnasts of all ages."
