        "Episode of Series \"Path of the Paddle\". The joy and poetry of paddling solo are illustrated in this film, as are all the basic strokes used in maintaining complete control of the canoe. With the aid of animated lines, the path of the paddle is clearly defined so there can be no mistaking what the paddle is doing. The use of the various strokes in rapids is demonstrated sufficiently to whet the appetite to move on."
