        "The controversial history of the Jews from the time of the Patriarchs to the destruction of the Temple and the dispersion to the fourn corners of the earth. In exile the Jews kept their faith alive, through persecution and ppgrom, until the fateful events of World War II ultimately led to the re-establishment of Israel as a nation. Includes documentary footage from 1900-1948, animated footage, and concludes with a colorful spectrum of present day conditions (1965). Animation sequence designed, written and directed by Philip Stapp."
