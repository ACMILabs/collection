        "A dramatic film about generational differences that almost split a family apart. Anna, fifteen, dates Bill. Her parents don't trust her. Jack, her brother, committed suicide a year ago. Her parents disguised it as a car accident. Tension builds between Anna and her parents until she attempts suicide. The magnitude of their problems prompts a family reconciliation. Dramatic, realistic, fast-moving, this film sounds an alarm on the subject of teenage suicide. Cast includes Murray Berg, Warren W. Sulatychy, Judy Wood, Robert Galbraith, Tommy Banks, Jana Lapel Millman."
