        "Episode of Series \"Take Six\". A creative collaboration between Laurens C. Postma and gifted actor and one-man show performer Tim Thomas, this light-hearted entertainment is the story of a possible person in the not too distant silicone/micro-processor future. It is a future that gratifies every conceivable wish but fails to meet the basic need for human contact."
