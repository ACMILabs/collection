        "Deals principally with the spiritual references that music has for the Lake Chambri people, featuring the sacred talking flutes that are played and seen only by men. Shows also songs of ceremonial and everyday nature, and other instruments, including the \"talking\" slit drums, panpipes, and a most unusual instrument in the form of a sago beetle. Produced with assistance from Australian Film Commission, Australia Council, Dept. Foreign Affairs and PNG National Cultural Council."
