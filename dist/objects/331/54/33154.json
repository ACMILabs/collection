        "Filmclips of American jazz performances and interviews with musicians are used to discuss why America has failed to appreciate its most prominent, indigenous art form. Why have so many artists left and settled in Europe and why have some gone home in the last few years? Musicians featured: Dexter Gordon, Johnny Griffin, Steve Lacy, Randy Weston, Phil Woods, Art Farmer, Richard Davis, Gato Barberie, Carla Bley, Freddie Hubbard, Mal Waldron."
