        "This is the first feature-length film to deal with the idea and purposes of the UN. It is a film about two forces which co-exist in humankind; power to build and power to destroy. Man prides himself on being the builder of civilisations. He cannot deny that he is an equally effective destroyer. The film leaves the viewer with the knowledge that it is up to man himself to make the choice. In sequences filmed in Italy, Haiti, Norway and Canada the film shows how man's abilities have been put to use and how his powers have been applied. The positive need for human beings to find lasting solutions to the problems of controlling their destructive power is dramatically illustrated."
