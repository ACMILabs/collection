        "Using archival film, aerial photography, stills, prints and contemporary footage, this documentary presents the city of Melbourne and its lifestyle. Looks at the unique Victorian architecture that transformed Melbourne from a tent city during the Gold Rush to a modern and prosperous city. Captures the vibrant streetscapes, the trams, the elaborate arcades and some of the institutions that cater to Melbourne's elite such as the Georges store and the Melbourne Club. Highlights the range of sporting activities available, showing John McEnroe, Dennis Lillee and Greg Norman among others. Visits the Separation Tree in the Botanical Gardens planted to commemorate Melbourne's independence from NSW, the bustling Queen Victoria Market, the suburbs of St Kilda and Brighton, its beaches and the Arts Precinct. Shows crowded restaurants and pubs with rock band performances that contribute to Melbourne's nightlife. Also includes footage of areas and buildings which have disappeared or undergone major transformations since this film was produced: the docklands; the city square; Swanston Street; Foster's Brewery; ports. The following Australian identities are also shown: Barry Humphries, Ian 'Molly' Meldrum, Bob Hawke, Andrew Peacock, Phillip Adams, Dick Hamer, Joan Sutherland, Jon English, Derryn Hinch, Mike Brady, Lindsay Thompson and an assortment of VFL footballers."
