        "An animated version of a short story by Quebec author Roch Carrier, set in the rural Quebec of his childhood. Carrier recalls the passion for playing hockey which he shared with other boys of his community. It was the time of Rocket Richard, the Canadians' greatest star. A funny, poignant story animated in a style that evokes the period of the late 1940s. Awards: fifteen including Ottawa; Calgary; Yorkton; Toronto; New York; London; Les Menuires. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
