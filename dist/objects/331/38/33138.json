        "Archetypal film noir of the forties, brilliantly filmed and incisively written by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, perfectly capturing the decayed Los Angeles atmosphere of a Chandler novel but using a simpler story and more substantial characters. The hero/villain was almost a new concept. Stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. Based on a novel by James M. Cain."
