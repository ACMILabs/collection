        "Episode of Series \"Ageing in the New Age\". Looks at an experiment where the community is benefitting from utilising the previously wasted skill and wisdom of its old people. The results have two-way benefits: the older people feel happy to be contributing, and those helped are grateful for the assistance coming from the aged. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
