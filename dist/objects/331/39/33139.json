        "Based on the story \"Stage to Lordsburg\" by Ernest Haycox. Passengers on a stagecoach heading for Lordsburg, New Mexico have a rough trip, during which Curly, the sheriff who is riding shotgun, arrests the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), who has broken out of prison to shoot it out with the Plummer brothers. Enroute, one passenger, a young officer's wife, gives birth, with the aid of the Dr. Boone, an alcoholic and Dallas, a beautiful woman of questionable repute. Shortly thereafter, the stagecoach is attacked by Apaches. When they finally arrive in Lordsburg, Curly allows Ringo to settle his dispute, and make a getaway with Dallas, with whom he has fallen in love."
