        "A critique of the representation of women in psychoanalytic discourse is linked, in the form of an 'essay', with modes of representation of women's sexuality in the visual media. Sigmund Freud's case history of Dora ('Fragments of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria' published in 1905) is 're-read' in three sections: an argument over the politics of psychoanalysis; a thematic linking of psychoanalytic discourse/pornographic film/advertising; and questions, in the form of post cards from Dora, posed about the way women look at themselves. Warning: sexually explicit."
