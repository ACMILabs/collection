        "Created in honour of the International Year of the Child, film director Faith Hubley interprets the world of childhood - as it was, as it is now, and as it might be. Distinctive animated children of every race and nationality appear on the screen, accompanied by the voices of children chanting in Spanish and French, with key phrases spoken in English. Viewers see the bleakness of childhood throughout history, the full range of childhood experiences - from poverty to plenty, work to leisure, and the possibilities of the future when the basic rights of children are recognised by us all. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
