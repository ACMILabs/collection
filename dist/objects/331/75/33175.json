        "A new look at a centuries-old fairy tale. Using a medieval style of illustration to animate the story of Cinderella, the film gives the leading role to a mistreated romantic penguin- with hilarious results. A story without words, set to a wide variety of musical selections, this spoof of the traditional tale will delight young and old."
