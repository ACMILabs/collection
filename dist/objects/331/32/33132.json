        "Episode of Series \"The Story Behind the Story\". Who was King Arthur? Was he the romantic king of Sir Thomas Mallory's traditional stories, or a leader of the British tribes in the Dark Ages? Did he in fact exist at all, and why does the Holy Grail come into his story? John Craven, with the help of archaeologist and historian Dr. Ralegh Radford, looks at the story behind the legend of King Arthur."
