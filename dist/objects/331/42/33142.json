        "Many years ago there was a popular song suggesting that each time it rained it rained pennies from heaven. Today's reality is that when it rains, it rains acid from heaven. By re-enacting a case study of a person whose income was cut off as a direct result of acid rain, this presentation, composed of still photo montage, provides in laymen's terms some basic information about this little-known form of pollution."
