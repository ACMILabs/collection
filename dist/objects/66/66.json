        "Baldino takes the theory of 'Nano-technology' as her jumping-off point to explore the connections between science, magic and wonder. Nano-Cadabra is composed of forty abstract narratives, each lasting five seconds or less. In these mini-events, an array of ambiguous objects interact, eerily suggesting movement on the molecular level. Nano-Cadabra also exists as a four-channel installation."
