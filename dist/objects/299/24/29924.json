        "Episode of Series \"Union Representative\". A migrant worker in a factory needs time off to take his sick wife to hospital, but the union representative does not see this as a sufficiently important matter for him to deal with. Raises the question of prejudices and principles of justice and fair play in relation to the union's responsibility to the individual worker."
