        "The do's and don'ts for a receptionist/secretary in a large organisation. Betty, as secretary for several people in a university department, is untidy, inefficient and frightened to ask questions which would help in her work. After one particularly muddled day she decides to change; she finds tidiness aids efficiency, questions save valuable time and she learns to schedule the work as priority dictates."
