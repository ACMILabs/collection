        "Episode of Series \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\". This shy sea mammal is fighting its way back to an ecological niche after two centuries of being hunted for its fur. But again the otter is under threat, both from abalone divers (who say it is destroying their supply) and from pollution of the coastal waters off Alaska and California. Suitable for upper primary and secondary levels."
