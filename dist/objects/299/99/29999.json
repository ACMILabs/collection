        "A remote alpine community in Southern Switzerland is used as a case study to provide a background to the changing geographical characteristics which are common to many of the mountain areas of Western Europe. The traditional economic pattern is analysed, then recent modifications examined, notably improvement of access, the development of hydro-electric power potential and tourism."
