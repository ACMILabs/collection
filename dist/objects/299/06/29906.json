        "A round table discussion between a number of teenagers, a venereal disease specialist and Granada's compere, is designed to inform teenagers about VD. Specifically informs on the types of VD, their known incidence in Britain, how to recognise symptoms, what should be done about it and where treatment may be obtained. The doctor states that early treatment is most necessary. The young people feel that information on VD should be given in schools as well as information on sex."
