        "The charming story of how a group of senior citizens managed to transform a useless vacant lot in Montreal into a garden of delights - vegetables, flowers, and parties. But the garden means much more to them than what it produces. It has completely changed their attitude about inactivity and retirement. Narrated by Patrick Watson."
