        "Episode of Series \"Union Communication\". A change in working hours upsets the workers at a factory and Dixon, the Union delegate, is asked to report the change to the union office. In his report to the organiser, Dixon manages to bring in all sorts of irrelevancies but is very short on accurate information. This film manages to pinpoint an area of possible confusion if union delegates fail to get the facts straight."
