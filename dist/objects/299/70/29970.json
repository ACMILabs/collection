        "An open-ended dramatisation that explores different lifestyles - lifestyles through which the central figures try to adjust to disappointments and frustrations. For two young men pills offer an escape from life, in contrast Charlie, an old man who objects to being retired, pours his energies into a derelict boat. Designed to stimulate discussion of the type of decisions young people must make."
