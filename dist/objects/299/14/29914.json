        "Based on a short story by James Thurber, this is a gentle reminder that people do not always see things as we do. A poor henpecked husband sees a unicorn in his garden and excitedly tells his wife. She calls the police and a psychiatrist, wanting him to be committed, but in the end it is she who is taken away. Suitable for middle and upper primary and lower secondary levels."
