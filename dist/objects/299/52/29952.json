        "An industrial accident-prevention film illustrating that an accident usually has several causes. A situation is portrayed in a large machine shop, where a series of unsafe acts, combined with unsafe conditions, led to an accident in which a man's arm was caught in an unguarded machine. A film to stimulate discussion among managers, supervisors and safety professionals, as well as for all industrial employees. (Awards: Belgrade; Poznan.)"
