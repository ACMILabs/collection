        "Here is the village of St. Justine as one gifted man, novelist and playwright Roch carrier, remembers, it. In this small corner of Quebec there is space in the landscape and in the vast spread of forest, but the fringe of rocks around every field speaks of the back-breaking hardship that was the lot Carrier's father and his grandfather before him. This is a nostalgic view of rural Quebec and its people, from a man who feels and cares. Narrated by Roch Carrier."
