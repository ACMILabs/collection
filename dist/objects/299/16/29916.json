        "Episode of Series \"College Physics\" Uniform circular motion is defined and demonstrated. Changes in velocity vector are shown and used to explain why this is accelerated motion. Expression for magnitude of centripetal force is explained in general and illustrated in connection with a body whirling on a string, a car on a loop-the-loop gravitational attraction and motion of electricity charged particle in a magnetic field."
