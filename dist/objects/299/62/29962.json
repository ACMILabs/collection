        "The work of five contemporary Australian sculptors - Tony Trembath, Ian Bracegirdle, Ross Grounds, Paul Stevenson-Ryan and Ray Woolard. The sculptors talk about their avant-garde sculptures, and see them as reflections on today's society. They cite ecology, conservation and preserving the past as being important motivators in their work, and see their art as a way of living out their fantasies"
