        "Explains by animated drawings, the operation of a radio vacuum tube in terms of its filament, plate, and grid circuits. Illustrates the three functions of the vacuum tube in radio:  how it serves as an amplifier to operate the loud-speaker, as a rectifier in detection, and as an oscillator to generate the carrier wave."
