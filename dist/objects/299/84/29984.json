        "Some of the New Zealand rivers and the ways in which they serve the interests of the country. There is water transport on the Wanganui River taking the Northland coal supply to Whangarei by scows. In the rivers of the West Coast, whitebait is harvested, and in the highlands the Cobb River serves a mountain power station."
