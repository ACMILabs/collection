        "Some of the ways in which educational motion pictures can contribute to teaching. Film clips, including films using microphotography and time-lapse photography, illustrate the value of motion pictures in portraying phenomena invisible to the human eye, and in explaining the interrelation and interaction between widely separated events, as well as in showing scenes of historical events, far-distant countries and present day events."
