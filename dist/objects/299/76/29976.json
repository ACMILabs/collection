        "This film is a colourful statement on the destruction of nature, city planning, aimless construction and rebuilding, pollution and the revamping of natural life styles that comes with a mechanised society. Modern jazz music and subtle sound effects are used in this entertaining film. This film was included as the finale in the main pavilion of Expo '67 in Canada and later screened at the 43rd San Francisco International Film Festival, April 20-May 4, 2000."
