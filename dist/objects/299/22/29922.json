        "An examination of trade unionism in Australia, the United States and Britain. Includes a visit to the English village of Tolpuddle, the cradle of unionism. Sixty per cent of Australian wage earners are union members, including stock riders and shearers in the outback as well as the two million city unionists. Prominence is given to the notorious waterside workers - a report on working conditions won by them over the years; a typical stop-work meeting; a lecture by a union official."
