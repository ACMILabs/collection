        "A dramatised account of the work of UNRRA and later the International Children's Emergency Fund providing food, clothing and medicine for children in war-devastated areas. The film tells the story of three Polish children, orphaned by war and living under extreme conditions of poverty. Relief is provided by UNRRA, but with the disbandonment of this organisation, supplies are cut off. UNICEF is established by the UN General Assembly and once more food and medical supplies are brought to the needy children of the world."
