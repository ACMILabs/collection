        "The official story of the Textile Workers Union of America. Working through 800 locals, involving a membership of 450,000, the union carries out an extensive program of work bringing many benefits to its members. Filmed in the mills, on the picket lines, in union halls and in the homes of members, the film not only underlines the benefits of union membership but also stresses the rights and obligations of working people everywhere. Narrated by Joseph Julian."
