        "Peter Travis sees kite-making as an art form and himself as a sculptor. The complex strings of geometric pieces that he assembles to form his large kites, he calls \"flying colourfield geometric constructions\". Travis is shown flying his kites and talking about their making. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
