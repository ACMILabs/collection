        "An animated film for in-service work and the classroom. Two strategy games are played, one of co-ordinates, the second where two players take turns to erase a specified number of marks. Once the children have learnt these games they can progress to other games related to \"rim\", eg games that use matches, or boardgames with counters. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
