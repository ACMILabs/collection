        "Episode of Series \"The Explorers\". Depicts the events leading to the destruction of the Inca civilization by Europeans. In the wake of the civil war there was little to stop the invasion of Pizarro and his conquistadores and the Inca civilization fell because of Pizarro's greed for power and wealth. Written by Ian Thorne and presented by David Attenborough."
