        "Inflation traditionally has resulted from excess demand pushing prices up when the economy is not operating at capacity. However, when the \"production machine\" is producing all that it can, increased demand cannot result in the production of more goods. Instead, the increased demand simply pushes prices up. As a result of viewing this film, students will be able to discuss what an inflation is, what its causes are, and how inflations can differ. They will also be able to understand the role of government with regard to business and the economy. Narrated by Edwin Newman. Suitable for upper secondary level."
