        "A grim animated satire on politics and the media - man's general lack on knowledge on one and his dependence on the other. An allegory on the dangers of political apathy demonstrating that people who lack knowledge of their political affairs are ripe for manipulation or takeover by special interests or totalitarian governments. Animated by Willy Verschelde, background by Norbert Deseyn. Non-narrated."
