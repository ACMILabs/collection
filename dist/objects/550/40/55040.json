        "A far closer view, and a more complete one, than even the hardiest and most patient of visitors is likely to get of the bighorn mountain sheep of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. \"Bighorn\" is a film distinguished by its camerawork (Bill Schmalz). It catches the characteristic behavior of the bighorns from birth to mating time. Few animals are more arresting in appearance or activity than these dancers of the high ledges. Awards: Novi Sad; Spindleruv Mlyn; Philadelphia; Tarbes."
