        "A detailed study of the life cycle of the Codling Moth: the laying and hatching of the eggs; the larva burrowing to the centre of an apple and feeding; larva leaving the infected fruit for hibernation; spinning of the cocoon; changes taking place in the pupal stage; emergence of the adult moth. A diagrammatic section summarises the main stages of the life cycle. No narration, only music."
