        "This is a magical animated version of the classic Australian children's novel by Norman Lindsay. Featuring the vocal talents of John Cleese, Sam Neill, Geoffrey Rush, Hugo Weaving, Jack Thompson, Toni Collette and Mary Coustas, the film cannot fail to delight children of all ages. Come join Albert the Magic Pudding, Bunyip Bluegum, Bill Barnacle and Sam Sawnoff as they fight off the attempts of pudding thieves Possum and Wombat (directed from a distance by Buncle), and try valiantly to solve the mystery of the disappearance of Bunyip's parents."
