        "Is cannibalism part of human nature? That is the question posed to us in this documentary that looks at cannibalism from ancient human history to modern day incidents. Society's dual fascination and revulsion of the subject has made cannibalism a continual taboo. Psychiatrists believe it is human nature and when the mind adapts and survival depends on it - we accept it. The practise of cannibalism is one of survival, tribal ritual and madness. We look at the factors affecting the Donner party in 1846, a group of pioneers heading to California who became stranded in a snow storm and had to partake in cannibalism for their survival. We are introduced to Ed Gein, one of America's most notorious serial killers who used to boil up parts of his victim's bodies to eat, and learn about the religious rituals practised by tribes of New Guinea, as related by anthropologist Fitz John Poole PD who lived with the tribes for three years. The documentary looks at the various reasons behind why people become cannibals and poses the question, \"why is it such a psychological taboo?\"."
