        "This film was made to encourage economy in the use of fuel through efficient boiler house practice. Points mentioned include: correct tools, methods of hand-firing, control of air-flow, care of mechanical stokers, regular cleaning of heating surfaces, the necessity for careful maintenance generally. Particular emphasis is placed on the part of the fireman."
