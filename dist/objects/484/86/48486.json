        "Eager to prove he is more than just another soap star, James Van Der Beek agreed to the title role of Jonathan \"Mox\" Moxton in this coming of age film set in Texas. Mox is a reluctant gridiron fullback in the West Canaan Coyotes who discovers his brilliance for the game after being called in to substitute for injured star player Lance Harbor (Paul Walker). Mox is not thrilled at being pushed into the limelight as it means undue attention from masochistic Coach Kilmer (Jon Voight) - eager to win the 23rd district trophy, increased pressure from his father who is using Mox to live out his own unfulfilled sporting aspirations, and grief from his girlfriend who says that Mox is deluding himself by being a football hero. Things come to a head on the eve of the final when Mox is blackmailed by Coach Kilmer into play the game \"his way\" or face the prospect of remaining in their one horse town when he sabotages Mox's chance at taking up his university offer. Cast also includes Ron Lester, Scott Caan, Ali Larter and Amy Smart."
