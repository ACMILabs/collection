        "In the southern part of France there is a part which is stark because of the lack of water, and almost impossible to live off. But one man, Phillippe Lamour bought a farm in the area. During the war he cultivated his vines and made a success of it. Other Langadock farmers came to look upon him as a leader. After the end of the war he lobbied government to provide funds for an irrigation project. After 12 years of frustration the project finally started - irrigation enabled farmers to produce extra goods, their standard of living increased by 40%-50%. Lamour's vision of agriculture, industry and tourism is now being realised."
