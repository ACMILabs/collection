        "A steadily paced thriller from director Kathryn Bigelow starring Jamie Lee Curtis as Megan Turner, a recently graduated New York cop who is stalked by the same murdering mad man that she is investigating. An outcast in her family and in constant difficulty when it comes to relationships as a result of her occupation, suffering chastisement even within the career path she has devoted herself to, the start of a new passionate romance with Eugene Hunt (Ron Silver) has all the appearance of a turn around in her fortunes. However, little is as it seems and with the help of a fellow officer she is forced to confront her obsessive nemesis and her own self-doubts and fears. This film is a suspenseful and psychological drama with an unexpected and insightful angle on the nature of human needs and desires and the complexities of human relationships in the contemporary and ever anonymous city. Kathryn Bigelow develops a dream-like perspective on the characters and turn of events in the film, an early example of her fluid style of direction."
