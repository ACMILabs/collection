        "A highly underrated science fiction produced in the wake of the Star Wars phenomenon, \"The Last starfighter\" is another supreme example of outer-space/fantasy that was the trend in Hollywood in the early 1980s. Lance Guest is Alex Rogan, who lives and works a dead-end job in his mother's trailer park. His only escape: a video-game called \"Starfighter\". When a mysterious stranger explains to him that \"Starfighter\" is more than just a game, Alex is thrust centrestage for a conflict that threatens not only Earth but the entire universe. With production design by Ron Cobb (of 'Alien' and 'Star Wars' fame) and a scorching soundtrack by Craig Safan, \"The Last starfighter\" is formulaic Hollywood at its most entertaining. Cast also includes Robert Preston, Dan O'Herlihy, Catherine Stewart and Barbara Bosson."
