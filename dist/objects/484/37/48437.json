        "A jet-liner spans the miles, sheering through clouds to open sky and scenic vistas of the provinces below. Glimpses of town and country, of people of many ethnic origins, of a resourceful and industrious nation - impressions it would take days and weeks to gather at first hand - are brought to you in this vivid 1800 kilometer panorama. Narrated by Christopher Plummer. (Awards: Montreal; Marseille; Grignasco)"
