        "An independent off-beat cult classic about an aspiring rock musician with a complicated love life and an obsession for suede and his own carefully cultivated self-image. Johnny (Brad Pitt) is a naive but endearing musician who models himself on the 1950s pop legend, Ricky Nelson. After a pair of black suede shoes fall on him from the sky one night, he adopts the name Johnny Suede and spends his time composing inspired love songs on his guitar that add greatly to the comic and somewhat bizarre quality of the film as he dreams of rock 'n' roll stardom. He meets the sensuous painter Yvonne (Catherine Keener) and begins a journey of self discovery that will never quite leave his carefully fabricated image the same again, or will it? Written and directed by Tom DiCillo, who followed this genuine and beautifully odd ball effort with 'Living in Oblivion'(1994), said to be inspired in part by his experiences in making this film, and including a cast that features Nick Cave and Tina Louise. (Awards: Golden Leopard Award for Best Film, 1991)"
