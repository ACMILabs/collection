        "Jesse Martin is a testament to living out your dreams. With little more than 3 hours solo sailing experience and having never sailed beyond Port Philip Bay, Jesse headed out of Sandringham on an 11 month journey to fulfil his dream of sailing single handed around the world. Featuring interviews with Jesse, his family, sailors, meteorologists, business advisors and friends - post journey, interspersed with live footage, Jesse explains what motivates him and how he sustained himself during the challenging experience."
