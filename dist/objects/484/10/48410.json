        "A quirky and absurdist comic thriller from writer/director, Hal Hartley. Isabelle (Isabelle Huppert) is an ex-nun awaiting an expected mission from God while making a living writing stories for pornographic magazines. She meets the kind and confused Thomas (Martin Donovan), who is suffering from amnesia and wandering the streets of New York in search of clues to his past, a past of viciousness and exploitation that only the appearance of his traumatized porn queen ex-wife, Sophia (Elina Lowensohn), begins to unravel. Intertwined with suspenseful thriller qualities and the subtlety of an unlikely romance, this film quietly spirals into a poignant tale of the pursuit of the reality of identity through memory and engagement with the past which leads sensitively to the inevitable tragedy of the final showdown."
