        "This film centres around Xiao-kang, an unemployed youth, and his dysfunctional family. Living with his parents in Taipei, there is little communication in the house, where his mother is having an affair with a hawker of pornographic videos, and his retired father frequents a gay bathhouse. Although unmotivated to do anything to alter his life, things change for Xiao-kang when he encounters an old friend from the past, who is currently working on a film shoot near a river. She convinces Xiao-kang to work as an extra in the film, which entailed floating in a polluted river, after which he develops a mysterious and agonising pain in his neck. In Mandarin with English subtitles. Cast includes: Miao Tien, Lee Kang-sheng, Lu Hsiao-ling and Anne Hui"
