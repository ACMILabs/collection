        "Relying heavily on one of the most famous escape movies of all time - \"The Great escape\" (1963) - Aardman animations first feature length film has plenty to offer adults and children alike. Set on Tweedy's poultry farm in the 1950's, most of the inhabitants grumble about their lodgings but are paralysed by apathy, everyone that is except for Ginger, a feisty chicken who has come up with ingenious but ultimately unsuccessful escape plans. Their sheltered world is altered drastically when their is a new addition to their midst - Rocky, the flying rooster. Ginger, believing Rocky to be their salvation due to his capacity to fly (despite his gender), manages to convince him to whip the chickens into shape for a communal great escape. It turns into a race against time when the Tweedy's plan to switch from egg production to chicken pies, which leaves little room to the imagination for how it will affect our poultry friends. Voices supplied by Mel Gibson, Julia Sawalha, Miranda Richardson and Timothy Spall."
