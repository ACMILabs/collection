        "In this crazed live-action cartoon story of sorcery and supernatural vengeance, legendary director Yuen Woo Ping orchestrates a manic martial arts fantasy extravaganza. A young disciple of some elderly 'miracle fighters'--martial arts instructors who also possess magical powers--is mistaken for the long missing crown prince. The emperor dispatches a eunuch named Sorcerer Bat to apprehend the boy but first he must get rid of his elderly guardians. The climatic set-piece, an amazing sequence of pure kung fu action, takes place in hell where the eunuch and the young disciple are forced into a contest to determine who is more powerful. Filled with eccentric characters and comic moments as well as a succession of battles, this film spawned four sequels. Cast includes Yuen Yat Choh, Leung Kar Yan, Yuen Cheung Yan. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
