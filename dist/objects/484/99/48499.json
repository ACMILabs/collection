        "The National Film Board of Canada filmed the table tennis competition between teams of young Canadians and Chinese that took place in the People's Republic of China in the summer of 1973, the first time in twenty-five years that such filming was made possible. Shown are highlights of play at the China-Canada Friendship Meet, as well as some of the sightseeing taken in by the young Canadians - a visit, for example, to the Great Wall of China. A film without commentary."
