        "This documentary examines the contemporary fascination with vampirism and vampire culture. Bram Stoker's famous novel, Dracula, has spawned a multitude of fictions since it's debut in 1897. This documentary examines the contemporary fascination with this literary vision of vampirism, and focuses on the subculture that has evolved around it, questioning whether it reflects a desire for immortality, or if it is simply another way of making contact with the darker side of humanity. In an effort to understand the appeal of this movement, the documentary delves into the history of Vlad Tsepes (Dracul), the 15th century warrior-prince whom Stoker based the character of Dracula upon. To explore this phenomenon further, there are interviews with Nicholas Strathloch, who claims to come from a long line of vampires and drinks human blood, Kathy and Dale McKinley, who claim to be able to channel the spirit of Vlad Tsepes, and Catrina Coffin, who lives like a vampire. Opinions are also sought from a diverse array of people including a theologian, a psychiatrist, an author, a member of the Transylvanian Society of Dracula, a hypnotist and a psychic."
