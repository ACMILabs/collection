        "A light-hearted operetta composed by Oscar Straus and adapted for the screen by Rudolf Bernauer based on a supposedly true story that took place in the early part of the 19th century. It is a tale of forbidden music where no instruments or singing is allowed in order that the townsfolk can concentrate on more serious things such as making money to pay off the town's debts. Stars Richard Tauber as Mario Carlini and features Jimmy Durante (Schnozzle) as Jonah J. Whistler. Cast also includes Diana Napier (Princess Regent), June Clyde (Sadie Whistler), Derrick de Marney (Rudolpho Strozzi, Esme Percy (Austrian Ambassador)."
