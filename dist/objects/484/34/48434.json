        "This film documents the achievements of men who forged into the harsh, untamed wilderness of northern Quebec to lay the line of steel which brought to market the rich iron ore of the Ungava region. It is a story of strength and determination since every man, machine and piece of equipment had to be airlifted in or transported by tractor caravan over the 575-kilometer route. Bit by bit we follow their progress through forest, over muskeg and across rivers until at last the first ore train snakes its way to the seaport of Septiles."
