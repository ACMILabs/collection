        "Digging tunnel for underground railway, shows principle operation. In 1957 Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Ltd. Designed and built their first mechanical tunnelling machine fitted with a rotary cutting head. This was used in tunnels being built by the company as part of the Nuclear Power Station at Bradwell, Essex. This film demonstrates the 'mole' being used in Toronto in 1962 where 2250ft. were constructed in 130 days. In 1963 the London Transport Executive bought four of these machines from McAlpine for use on the new Victoria Underground Railway. Editor Ross McConnell. Script and narration Win Berran. Photography Bob Brooks."
