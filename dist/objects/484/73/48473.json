        "Fleur, a courtesan in her former life, returns as a ghost to Hong Kong in the 1980s. She had failed to meet her lover, Chan, in the afterlife following their double suicide fifty years earlier. It seems that Chan, then heir to a fortune, did not die and is now a failed opera actor and film extra. The film is a portrait of Fleur - 'one more addition to the long line of abused women in Chinese cinema' (Tony Rayns), who, nevertheless is not a passive victim. Kwan elegantly constructs, through flashbacks, mildly satirical parallel visions of Hong Kong in the thirties and eighties creating a sense of the transience of things including love. Cast includes Anita Mui, Leslie Cheung, Alex Man. Based on the novel by Lee Bik-Wah. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
