        "Ralph, a country boy who has just left his parents farm to seek fame and fortune as a country singer in Nashville, hitches a ride with a drug dealer, Boyd, and his girlfriend Patsy. Within 24 hours Boyd and Ralph are arrested and locked up in a country jail. Set against a background of country music and shifting between the present and Ralph's daydreams, in which he fantasises about finding success in Nashville with the alluring Patsy, the film embraces the bittersweet pathos that characterises the country music genre. Cast includes Richard Roxburgh, Miranda Otto, Matt Day, Tony Barry and Kiri Paramore."
