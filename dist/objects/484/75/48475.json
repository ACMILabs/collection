        "The Arthur legend has all the tenets of a literary classic - tragedy, love, passion, war, adventure, bravery, chivalry, heroes, villains and mortals, which is probably why the world continues to be fascinated by this man created by fact, fiction and folklore. This program discusses the evolution of the legend from Geoffrey of Monmeith's manuscript to the \"Morte D'Arthur\", we follow the development of the Arthurian story and how history and the introduction of new characters altered the values behind the legend."
