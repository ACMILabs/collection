        "Shows the fight against the codling moth, a pest which costs Australia about $2,000,000 each year. The film illustrates the life cycle of the moth; eggs laid in the calix of hard fruit become larvae, eat into the fruit, and finally enter the dormant chrysalid stage. Metamorphosed into moths, they lay eggs to complete the cycle - twice each year. Shows the ways in which the moth is introduced into unaffected areas."
