        "This program centres around the work of Bill Henson and the exhibition of his work at the Venice Biennale in 1996. Through interviews with Henson himself, colleagues, critics and gallery convenors, his unique, dream-like style of work and exhibition practices are presented and discussed in critical detail. The program touches on many issues related to his work and its presentation including interpretations surrounding the borderline soft pornographic elements to his pieces. Diverse opinions about such issues are drawn from the attendants of the Venice Biennale as well as from the range of interviewees already mentioned, including Henson. It is a visually dense and thorough analytical program offering an interesting insight into the work of this critically acclaimed Australian artist."
