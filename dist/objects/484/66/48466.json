        "A color film showing the relationship between the activity of bees and the fertility of field and orchard crops. Much of the film is in close-up so that the process of cross-pollination of flowers by bees can be clearly observed. The life of the hive is similarly illustrated, including the peculiar dance by which a successful bee tells the others where its source of honey is located. The film warns that indiscriminate use of chemical sprays may destroy bees, with consequent loss of fertility in crops."
