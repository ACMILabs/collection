        "During every growing season in Canada millions of acres of farmland and garden plots become a battlefield where weeds try to crowd out cultivated crops. This film is an ecological study of the relationship between weeds and crop plants, showing the life cycle of specific weeds, with reference to their susceptibility to cultural and chemical control. New developments in chemical weed killers are shown."
