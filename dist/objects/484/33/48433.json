        "An animated refresher course on Canadian history for people who may be a little rusty on what happened in the centuries preceding Confederation. Cartoon animation gives life, substance and humor to the characters who have crossed the stage of Canadian history, from Columbus to Macdonald, treating them with a satirical wit that would be impossible in any learned treatise."
