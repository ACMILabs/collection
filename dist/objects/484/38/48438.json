        "A study of many British mainland birds - coots, swans, geese, great-crested grebes, snipe, bittern, moorhens, yellow wagtails, bearded tits, reed warblers, and harriers. Their mating, nesting and the hatching and rearing of their young are studied in detail. These birds represent two main types of marshland birds: island builders, and shore builders, according to where they build their nests."
