        "A simple ecological study of common animals whose structure and habits enable them to live in the sand of the sea-shore or the sea-bed. The following animals are seen: Astropecten burrowing and turning over; the heart-urchin burrowing (time-lapse under-water cinematography); the weever fish; the plaice; the masked crab burrowing; various worms either actively burrowing or living in tubes and collecting their food. The whole series is related to the fall and rise of the tide."
