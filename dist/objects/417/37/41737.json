        "From an artist's sketchbook and a poet's memories, a recollection of life in a country school, a place now derelict and vacant but alive with past associations. The film employs various forms of animation to give life and activity to the old building, looking in through the broken windows at the old desks, the clock on the wall, and looking out at the countryside and what a child might remember of what happened there."
