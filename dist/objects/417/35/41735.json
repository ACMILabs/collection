        "Produced at the invitation of the United Nations Organisation to celebrate UNICEF's Declaration of Children's Rights, this film is the Canadaian contribution to the hour-long feature film consisting of ten six-minute segments in celebration of the Year of the Child. This six minute segment illustrates one of the ten Principles of the Declaration, namely that every child is entitled to a name and a nationality. It is the story of a baby who appears mysteriously on the door of a busy executive, and who is subsequently bounced from household to household down the block. Nobody in the community is interested in caring for the baby without a name. (Twelve awards, icluding: Ottawa, Varna, Milan, Oscar) Also available on DVD [319319]."
