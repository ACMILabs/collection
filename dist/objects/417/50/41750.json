        "This animated short makes the point that oxygen is the stuff of life whether on land, in the air or water, but that it is becoming scarcer as man-made pollutants crowd it out. It is a film without words in which plants, birds, fish and, finally, man come to the same 'breathless' end. (Awards: San Francisco, Belgrade)"
