        "This film presents the problems confronting the safety supervisor in relation to both management and labor. It cites the case of Mr Gilchrist who found himself at loggerheads with management over apparent indifference toward safety protection, and with labor because of frequent negligence. The camera accompanies Mr Gilchrist and the manager on an inspection tour of the plant and records their observations on a number of typical accident hazards. As a result of a bandaged head acquired on the tour, Mr Gilchrist is able to reiterate with renewed emphasis the need for adequate safety measures."
