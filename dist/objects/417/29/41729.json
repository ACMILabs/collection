        "This film is based on an Inuit legend and performed by the Inuit people themselves. There is no dialogue, but the action is punctuated by 'katadjak', or throatsinging, a traditional form of singing once widely practised by the Inuit but now mostly confined to the Eastern Arctic. Camera by Andre Dupont, editing by J. Richard Robesco, Eskimo sound effects by Aikimie Novalinga and soapstone carvings by Paulosie Sivuak."
