        "Although not as bleak as the first in the series, the conflict between cultures and the rapidly changing values of the late 19th. century is the theme of this martial arts film starring asian champion Jet Lee. He clings to tradition in a China weakened by the invasion of imperialist forces while others like Sun Yat-Sen adapt to the change. There is plenty of hair-raising action and the final showdown in the Temple of the White Lotus will amaze. In Cantonese with English and Chinese subtitles."
