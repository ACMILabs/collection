        "Caninabis is an animated film about a dog whose brilliant career on the drug squad collapses when he mistakes a truckload of fertilizer for marijuana, causing an uncalled-for \"bust\". He is the victim of \"burn-out\", brought on by protracted smoking of drugs. The film's message is clear: smoking marijuana is definitely not good for dogs. Award: Zagreb."
