        "The photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson were the first ever to be displayed in the Louvre, Paris. In this film the world famous photographer turns his lens on the Quebec scene, finding there the same fascination with form and movement that gives his work a mark of individuality. Here, in town and country, are young people, old people, streets and fences, homes and edifices captured in a moment of time to give a composite representation of the world of Quebec."
