        "Episode number 10 of Series \"American cinema\". While many of the old rules are still in force, independent filmmakers often add their dissineting voices to the forum. This program looks at some alternative visions from new talents including Spike Lee, Joel and Ethan Coen, Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Tarantino. With limited budgets, they are challenging the stylistic status quo of the Hollywood film."
