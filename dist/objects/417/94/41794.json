        "Episode number 7 of Series \"American cinema\". These cynical and pessimistic films from the 1930's and 1940's touched a raw nerve in Americans. Historians link the genre's overriding paranoia to Cold War related angst over the nuclear threat and the Hollywood blacklist. Additionally, a cinematographer demonstrates the creation of lighting which gives these films their peculiar look thus emphasising the themes of corruption and urban decay."
