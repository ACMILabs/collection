        "This live-action adapted version of Dodie Smith's classic children's story will delight and amaze the whole family. Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) is a woman with a passionate obsession for fur coats. Her quest is to have a coat made from the skin of the sweet dalmation pups owned by Anita and her husband Roger. The pups are kidnapped by two bumbling henchmen and Pongo and Perdita, the pups' parents, enlist a canine army to execute a daring rescue. The special effects are outstanding as are the performances by an excellent cast, particularly Glenn Close. Co-starring Joely Richardson, Jeff Daniels, Joan Plowright and Hugh Laurie."
