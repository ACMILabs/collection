        "A little good will goes a long way--between persons, and between nations. That is the lesson to be learned from this animated film. It begins with a confrontation between a man who grows flowers and a technologist who operates computers. A flower pops up in the computer room; a computer tape appears in the garden. Each man destroys the \"foreign object.\" When they come face to face they discover that understanding is better than distrust, respect better than hostility. Without dialogue."
