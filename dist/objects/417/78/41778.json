        "This film is an excellent introduction to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, one aspect of his General Theory of Relativity. Dr. Banesh Hoffman, a friend, collaborator, and biographer of Einstein, explains the theory's development. Realistic animation illustrates the principles involved, facilitating their comprehension. Dr. Hoffman's recollections of Einstein's personal philosophy of life add a human dimension to an otherwise scientific exposition."
