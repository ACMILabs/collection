        "One of the most unusual musical instruments around, 'the mighty steam calliope' runs on steam produced by a ton of 'gofer' wood and needs a team of eight horses to pull it. Owned by the Minnie Thomson Memorial Museum of Stratford, Ontario, and fired by Duncan MacDermid, this calliope is one of the last of its kind. Taking in its energetic performance is a great way to spend a summer afternoon."
