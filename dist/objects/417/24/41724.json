        "A film combining a tuneful ballad with an equally engaging kaleidoscope of pictures, some relating to the story of the song and some not, but all most cheering and amusing to the eye. The soft focus of the live photography and the pleasing patterns of abstract designs combine with the relaxed mood of the ballad to produce an agreeable interlude of sights and sounds. Spawned from the hippy experimental culture of the time."
