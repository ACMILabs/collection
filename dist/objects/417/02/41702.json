        "The first of one of the classic Kung Fu films starring champion Jet Lee as legendary martial arts folk hero Wong Fei Hung. Set in a time when foreign traders and Jesuit priests were beginning to enter China, Wong Fei Hung leads the Black Army, a local militia determined to protect the town against the evil forces which operate in it. An action film which will amaze and astound as Jet Lee performs a series of heroic feats, defeating any evil in his path. In Cantonese with English and Chinese subtitles."
