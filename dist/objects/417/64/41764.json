        "Ukranian-Canadian Ted Baryluk's grocery store has been a fixture in Winnipeg's north end for over 20 years. In this black and white photo study, Ted talks about his store, the customers who have come and gone, and the social changes his multi-cultural neighbourhood has seen. But most of all he wonders what will become of his store when he retires. He hopes his daughter Helen will take over, but she wants to move away. The film is a wistful rendering of a shopkeeper's relationship with his daughter and a fascinating portrait of a neighbourhood and its inhabitants. (Awards: Yorkton, Chicago, Toronto)"
