        "Episode number 8 of Series \"American cinema\". Television arrived in American homes just as the Hollywood studio system was collasping. As the new medium took hold, so did a new era in motion picture entertainment. Renown directors, film scholars and actors trace the influence of each medium upon the other; from the live and fresh dramas of the Golden Age of Television and the growth of Hollywood spectacles to the modern day megalithic entertainment industry."
