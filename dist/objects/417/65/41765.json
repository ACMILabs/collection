        "Based on a legend of the Tsimshian Indians of British Columbia, this film is about a spirit called Raven who takes the shape of a man. One day, as he is searching for food, he meets Salmon Woman who embodies the Spirit of the Salmon. Their life together unfolds in harmony until Raven forgets his happiness and turns on his wife in anger. Underlying this simple tale is the timeless reality of how fragile are the links between people and how easily they can be ruptured. This film is partly animated by Howard Pedlar and stars Frank Austin as \"Raven\" and Darlene Malczewska as \"Salmon Woman\"."
