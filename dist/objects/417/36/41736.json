        "The St Lawrence Islands National Park, located in the Thousand Islands, Ontario, is an area of great natural beauty and historic interest. Geography and weather have created a greater variety of plant life here than anywhere ales in Canada. The film points out the park's main features while reminding the audience that conservation must be practised to protect the fragile balance of nature. Narrated by Cy Stranger, camera by David M. Ostricker."
