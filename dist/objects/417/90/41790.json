        "Episode number 3 of Series \"American cinema\". Greta Garbo, Cary Grant, Dustin Hoffman - these amongst many others are names synonymous with Hollywood. Early on, Hollywood saw that recognisable talent could minimise the financial risks of film production. Critics, film scholars and studio publicists view the stars from many angles, as marketing tools, cultural icons and products of the industry. Joan Crawford is used as a case study."
