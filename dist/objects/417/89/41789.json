This program surveys Hollywood's industrial past during the era of contract players and directors, studio police forces and colourful movie moguls. It also overviews the modern film-making environment with studio heads Michael Eisner, Howard Koch and others. Paramount Pictures, one of the oldest and most successful of the Hollywood studios, serves as a case study."
