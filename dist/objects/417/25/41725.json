        "A film without words, a sort of tone poem where the natural sounds of the road and the view from the cab of a long-distance truck create a sense of a man in a world apart. The movement of the speeding truck and the optical manipulation of what the driver sees have a mesmerising effect. Clouds seem to gather and break like a flock of sheep. The horizon beckons elusively. The driver seems a prisoner of space and time."
