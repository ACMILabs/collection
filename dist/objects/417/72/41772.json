        "A documentary about the National Film Board of Canada made to commemorate the Board's 40th anniversary in 1979. It is a montage representing the work of over 400 people whose dedicated efforts have garnered over 1800 international awards for the Board. Sometimes majestic, sometimes whimsical, the film is a revue of a nation's sights and sounds."
