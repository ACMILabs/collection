        "A women's basketball team, the underdog \"Lady Gorilla's\", play a win-or-die game and in doing so attack some of their personal demons. They talk and play tough because this is how life has treated them and and now with their sponsors threatening to pull the plug, the game takes on a bigger significance. They face \"The Sharks\" who are at the top of the ladder in what will be the game of their life."
