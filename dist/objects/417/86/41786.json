        "Trout fishing in Tasmania. Trout were released into Tasmanian streams a century ago, and anglers fish in many places with historical associations. Trout are caught, stripped and the young raised in hatcheries to re-stock streams. Shannon Rise during the caddis moth season and the lonely lakes in western Tasmania are favourite haunts for anglers."
