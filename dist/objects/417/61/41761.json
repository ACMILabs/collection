        "A film on the life of Canadian concert pianist Marek Jablonski. He is seen at a concert debut in Spain, on a visit to his native Poland where he began his piano studies at the age of four, in Montreal playing to an audience of school children, and in Edmonton, where he lives. This is a memorable portrait of a man who lives for music. Note: no reference to music performed. Anecdotal interest only. Photography by Jean-Pierre Lachapelle."
