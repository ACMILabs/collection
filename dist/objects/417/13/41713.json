        "Anne Bronte's novel of an unhappy marriage deals with the themes of self-sacrifice, adulterous passion and redemption set amongst the rugged but beautiful landscape of the Yorkshire Dales. Helen Graham, a widow with a young son, is the new tenant of Wildfell Hall. Her radical views and her aloofness attracts the local young squire Gilbert Markham but despite the attraction, Helen has a secret which prevents their love from blossoming. Starring Tara Fitzgerald, Toby Stephens and Rupert Graves."
