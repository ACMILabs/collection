        "A ticket to entertainment at the Royal Brothers' Circus - the only Canadian tent circus in Canada. Filmed during a hectic summer season, with the Big Top up, in transit, or being erected, it vividly captures the 24-hour-a-day brand of circus magic and observes both the men and mechanics behind it. Like the circus itself, it hovers between comedy, sentimentality and the grotesque. An abridged version entitled 'Little Big Top' is also available. (Awards: Yorkton, Los Angeles)"
