        "The subject of this film is unmistakable: how to make a fool of oneself easily and effectively. Two men are involved: one who wishes to read his newspaper and another who insists on performing acrobatic feats. Although the outcome is surprising, the message is clear; the film points out the futility of going to great lengths to impress one's neighbor."
