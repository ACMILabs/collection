        "The epic voyage of the giant American oil tanker, the U.S.S. Manhattan, and the Canadian icebreaker, the John A. Macdonald, through the Northwest passage of the Canadian Arctic to test its navigability as a year-round commercial sea lane. Filmed from the ice, from a helicopter, and from aboard the two ships, this film captures the natural drama of the journey as the ships batter and buck their way through the heavy sea ice."
