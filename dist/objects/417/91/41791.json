        "Episode number 4 of Series \"American cinema\". The Western is an American myth that has been translated by other cultures and re-interpreted time and time again but never dies. With film clips and critical commentary on Westerns, from John Ford's \"Stagecoach\" to the work of Arthur Penn, Sam Peckinpah and Clint Eastwood, the program traces the aesthetic evolution of the genre as well as its sociological importance."
