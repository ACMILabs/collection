        "Based on the cult novel by Irvine Welsh, \"Trainspotting\" is a black comedy which looks at a group of junkies in Edinburgh. Mark Renton, \"the hero\" of the film takes the viewer on a journey of discovery. Heroin is his mistress and the need to find and use it dictates the course of everyday events in his life. Renton's friends share the same passions and needs as they lie, steal, cheat, and go \"off their faces\" in order to procure the next fix. As they edge towards self-destruction, the film never loses sight of their vulnerability or their very human weaknesses. At times graphically squalid and bleak, the film is undeniably hilarious, although not for the weak-stomached. A great soundtrack is featured together with excellent performances by Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Kelly Macdonald and Robert Carlyle."
