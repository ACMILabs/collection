        "Drawn directly on black and white 35mm film stock, this early Norman McLaren film is a play on the theme of hearts. Two hearts cavort, change shape, shoot arrows at one another, give birth and finally become one heart bearing the message 'Will you be our Valentine?'. This short clip greeted NBC Television viewers on Valentine's Day, 1940."
