        "The uncut colour version of the cult Sci-Fi film that established McQueen's star quality. A small town becomes engulfed in terror when a meteorite crashes in a lonely field. McQueen and his girlfriend must convince the townsfolk to action but face total disbelief and ridicule towards what seems a fabrication by confused kids. A slimy alien gel begins swallowing people and growing larger. Classic scenes include a packed cinema screening a horror movie when the slimy gel seeps from the projector window causing an unforgetable exit of panic. Starring Steve McQueen, Aneta Corseaut and Earl Rowe. Co-starring Olin Howlin, Steven Chase and John Benson. Includes rare career highlights of Steve McQueen including famous film and television roles such as \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\", \"The Great Escape\" and \"The Defender\" (with an early William \"Star Trek\" Shatner) and a very brief interview in relation to his off-screen dare-devil motor bike racing."
