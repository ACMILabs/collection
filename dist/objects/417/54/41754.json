        "Twenty-eight degrees above zero was the temperature below the sea ice, although surface temperature dipped to 50 below at Resolute Bay within the Arctic Circle when the MacInnis Expedition made its first organised winter dive in the polar sea to test the ability of man and his equipment to function in that extremely hostile environment. Commenting on the expedition is Dr. Joseph B. MacInnis himself, in brief conversation with astronaut Scott Carpenter. There is underwater footage of the dive and of Sub-Igloo, the plastic spherical habitat which was anchored to the ocean floor. (Awards: Milan)"
