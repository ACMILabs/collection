        "Among the examples of colloidal suspension studied in this film are: fog (liquid in gas); whipped cream (gas in liquid); clay and india ink (solid in liquid); smoke (solid in gas); and mayonaise (liquid in liquid). Failure to settle is explained by Brownian movement, protective films, and charges on particles. The Cottrell process of smoke precipitation concludes the film."
