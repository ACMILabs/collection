        "Two men are each determined to purchase a colonial chair on sale at Sydney's Salvation Army's Collection and Waste Products Depot. After a short argument the victor carries off the chair on his motorbike. Filmed on several Saturday mornings, we see bargain hunters assembled outside the gates until 7.30 a.m. opening time. As the gates open there is a rush for the choicest lots in stoves, refrigerators, furniture and bric-a-brac. Photography: Ron Lowe"
