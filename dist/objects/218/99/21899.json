        "Film uses two PMG trainee staff as a link to the various activities which take place at the Seventh World Rover Moot at Yarra Brae, Victoria, in January 1962, attended by 1000 rovers from fifteen nations. Countries represented included Sweden, Ceylon, Japan, Papua and Canada. The painted tents of the Canadians depict how they travelled to the moot to join in the many tasks, games, tours and service activities undertaken during the fortnight. The spontaneous songs, the final ceremony and church service shows the fun of rover scout activities and the fine spirit of community service developed."
