        "Mallacoota - There is boatloads of nostalgic charm in this short black and white 1950s film of men taking a fishing trip at Mallacoota. Photographer Athol Adams has captured a sense of fun in this footage, made more entertaining to modern eyes because of the formal clothes the fishermen are wearing. A wonderful glimpse of a different generation at play. Athol Adams footage is courtesy of Jenny and Owen Peake."
