        "Episode of Series \"Interaction in the Multicultural Classroom\". Co-operative behaviour enables groups of people to achieve a common goal. Firstly, a common goal must be decided on, and then behaviour co-ordinated between individuals to achieve this goal. Looks at co-operative behaviour in the classroom, and warns against confusing conformity and obedience with co-operation."
