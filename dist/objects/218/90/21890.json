        "Four case histories exploring an area of communication. The Case of the tuned-out mind: Communication is a two-way exchange in which the situation alters as each party responds to the other. The Case of the wrong wave-length: The ability to find and use the particular approach that will be most effective with each different individual. The Case of the chain-reaction: How we communicate is as important as what we communicate. The Case of the silent yell: Unspoken communication and its effect on goals and on our relationship with other people."
