        "Four sub-regions are determined by the topography of these two South American countries; the climate, the industries, and the population of these are studied - farming, shipping, mining and agriculture - with stress on the contrast between cities and countryside. The different types of people and their work, and the world trading economy of these countries are simply represented with the aid of animation."
