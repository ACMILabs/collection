        "The early Japanese learned from the Koreans how to fire and glaze white ceramics, and the art of color glazing from the Chinese. Introduction of these advanced techniques from the Asian continent helped the Japanese to develop their own methods and styles in ceramic art, including those of the uniquely Japanese vessels, the colored Nabeshima ware."
