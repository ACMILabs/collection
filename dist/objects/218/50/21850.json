        "Explains the reason for variation in skin color of people of the different nationalities. The film describes how in prehistoric times humans living near the equator could not protect themselves from the direct ultra-violent rays of the sun, and did not survive unless they developed a protective pigment in their skin known as melanin. Similarly those living away from the direct ultra-violet developed a fair skin which permitted the rays to penetrate, for a certain amount of ultra-violet light is essential for life. Narrated by Robert Doubleday."
