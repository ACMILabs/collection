    "description": [
        "In 1912, Dandy Hams and Bacon commenced at premises located in Dandenong, Melbourne. This short film is a rare record of Dandenong's first major industry and features reminiscences by Maurie Jarvis (filmmaker Sue Jarvis's father) who worked at Dandy from the age of 15 until he retired, first as a truck driver and then as a Sales Manager. Now aged 86 Maurie remembers quite fondly of his time at the Dandy Bacon Factory and talks about its operations and processes to a background of rare archival images of the factory buildings, its machinery and its workers. Sadly none of these buildings now exist."
