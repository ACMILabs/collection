        "At the end of the war in 1946, Horrie Vernon and his brother set up a eucalyptus oil distillery in the small town of St Arnaud in Victoria. In this excerpt (which is part of a longer sequence) Horrie, who is still working the distillery, talks about how the eucalyptus oil is produced:  from the collecting of the leaves, to the boiling of the leaves, the collecting of the steam and allowing it to condense, and  finally, to the skimming of the oil off the surface. This process which is still carried out in the same way today. is demonstrated in the film."
