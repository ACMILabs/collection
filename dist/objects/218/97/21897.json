        "A college student reports on the work of the Community Chest movement in the city of Yonkers, USA. The film explains that the Community Chest is a central fund-raising and administrative organization through which various social welfare agencies receive funds according to their needs. Finance for the Community Chest is obtained from a yearly drive among all sections of the community. In this way individual agencies are relieved of the work of fund-raising, thus enabling them to concentrate on their welfare activities."
