        "Marlborough House in London was the scene of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference, June 1965. A Commonwealth Peace Mission to end the war in Vietnam was the main topic discussed. Prime Ministers took the opportunity of fulfilling other engagements - Mr Holyoake saw a test cricket match between England and New Zealand; Sir Robert Menzies attended a ceremony commemorating the signing of the Magna Carta 750 years ago; all attended a dinner party at 10 Downing Street."
