        "A cartoon film on the Colombo Plan which links a number of countries throughout the world pledged to improve each other's economic conditions. To increase prosperity and make the earth fruitful, technical knowledge and experience, equipment and funds, are essential before progress can be made. This cartoon shows how, in the past ten years, the people of Colombo Plan countries are benefitting from co-operation."
