        "Episode of Series \"Psychology\". A painter working in a classroom makes a statement about the French race and Latin temperament. A professor, over-hearing his remark, tries to correct his misconceptions. Among other facts, he points out that a nation is not a race, that members of a group are never \"all anything\", that group behaviour cannot be judged by isolated cases."
