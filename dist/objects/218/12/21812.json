        "This feature-length documentary film gives a dramatic account of the activities of the Coastal Command of the Royal Air Force during World War II. The organisation of the Command is seen at the control base, and the work of the Sunderland flying boats and Catalinas on patrol. The film shows a number of encounters with enemy ships, submarines and aircraft culminating in the sighting and sinking of the German raider \"Bismarck\" by Sunderlands of Coastal Command."
