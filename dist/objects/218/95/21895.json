        "Traces the origin and development of Communism, covering the early doctrines of Karl Marx, the roles of Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin and the more recent growth international Communism. Shows how the Western nations are combating the spread of Communism in under-developed countries by supplying food, clothing and industrial machinery and by forming military defence alliances. Typical of Cold War propaganda films in the 50's, attempts to justify US defence strategies and spending."
