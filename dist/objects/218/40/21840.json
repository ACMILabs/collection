        "Episode number 8 of Series \"The Commonwealth of Nations\". How the British colonial empire grew is a story as full of adventure as it is of contrast. This film takes us to British colonies, protectorates and protected states to see the impact of industrialization on colonial people, and their awakening desire for self-determination. Narrated by Edgar McInnis."
