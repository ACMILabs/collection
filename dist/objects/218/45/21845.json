        "Demonstrates by use of a glass prism that white light is actually a combination of several colors, which can be reproduced by pigments. Shows how the three primary colors can be mixed to make secondary colors and, in turn, intermediate colors. A color solid shows the three dimensions of color - hue, value and intensity, and examples illustrate how combinations of colors can create pleasing effects and different moods and feelings."
