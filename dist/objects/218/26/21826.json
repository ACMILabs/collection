        "Impressions of the life and times of Colette (1873-1954), French novelist, who probed deeply into the life of the senses and into human, particularly physical, relationships. Colette was born Sidonie Gabrielle Claudine Colette in Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye, Bourgogne. She collaborated with her first husband, writer Henri Gauthier-Villars on the four novels of the Claudine series (1900-1903), using his pen name (Willy); they were largely her work. Writing under the name Colette, she established her reputation as the leading woman novelist of France. She was also a journalist, critic and playwright. The film includes a short interview between Colette and Jean Creteau. Extracts from old feature films and newsreels afford glimpses of Colette when whe was a dancer in a Montmartre music hall. French language with English captions."
