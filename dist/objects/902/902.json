        "A woman finds an unidentified root growing out of her kitchen sink plug hole. The umbilical like vine grows into an adult male covered in hair from head to toe. The woman shaves the catatonic man and the two begin to play out a primal scene of lust and longing. Alison Maclean's perverse horror recasts desire in its most primordial and visceral guise."
