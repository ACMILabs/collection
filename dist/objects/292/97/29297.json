        "Episode of Series \"Ages and Stages\". A film appraisal of the typical behaviour of three teenagers in the everyday life of an urban family. Two boys and a girl demonstrate in their attitudes and actions the basic similarities of teenagers of the ages thirteen and fifteen and, at the same time, the individual differences deriving from their developing personalities. The age of adolescence, is a time of adjustment during which the buoyancy of youth is moulded into the more mature forms of adulthood."
