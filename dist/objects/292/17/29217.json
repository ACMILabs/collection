        "Tamara is an artist in a field both ancient and modern - tapestry. She is a world-renowned Polish Canadian whose works are hung, from the National Gallery of Canada to the Hermitage in Leningrad. This film is not a 'how to' film as much as a portrait of one of the century's most brilliant artists."
