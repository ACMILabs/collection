        "A children's fantasy where building blocks and musical effects do everything. Blocks represent the make-believe city and the two children who play in it. Blocks act out the story when an angry dragon appears on the scene and the music underscores the action. This puppet theatre is so colourfully presented that everyone is absorbed and entertained. Film without words. (Awards: five including London; Annecy)"
