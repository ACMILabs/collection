        "A swamp was formed when sand shaped a land bridge between Wilson's Promontory and the mainland. Shows the draining and cultivating of the Red Swamp, the addition of chemicals to the original peat, and the sowing of a seed mixture of several grasses and clovers. Dairy cattle now feed here on some of the best red clover in the State."
