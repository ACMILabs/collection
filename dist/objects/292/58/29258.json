A map shows the tea-producing areas of the world; Assam is taken as an example and scenes show workers planting out the young seeds and plants. Pruning, weeding and plucking are seen, and the factory processes described by animated diagrams. From Assam the tea goes to Calcutta and London, where it is blended with tea from other countries."
