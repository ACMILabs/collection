        "Episode of Series \"Tales from Hoffnung\". A cautionary tale told by a father to his teenage son. He is revealing with great embarrassment to himself, the facts of life. However it seems the father is without knowledge himself, and at the end has managed to say very little. Based on the cartoon drawings of Gerard Hoffnung. Narrated by Peter Sellars with animation by Tony Guy."
