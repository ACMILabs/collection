        "In 1961, freedom bells rang for independence for the Tanzanian people and the country faced great developmental problems. President Nyerere sought to unite the people to work together as a nation. With government approval, Mary Knoll Missioners established an experimental village project that became a model for a new, communal lifestyle. Whereas in the past isolation was the common denominator, the people are now experiencing their first glimpse of \"ujamaa\", African socialism or familyhood. Together, husbands and wives study agriculture, nutrition, animal husbandry, baby care; families help each other manufacture bricks and build homes."
