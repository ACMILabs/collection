        "This film deals with infant teaching as a vocation. It is designed for girls between the ages of 16 and 18 years; two girls are introduced, and their two-year course of study at an Infant Teaching Training College in Britain is followed, showing how, both in the college, and in teaching practice, their understanding of children aids them in teaching and at the same time advances and expands their own general education and social consciousness."
