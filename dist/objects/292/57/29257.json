        "A complete story of the growth, cultivation, and preparation of tea. The plantation sequences, shot in Nyasaland, East Equatorial Africa, show how the tea plant is grown and cultivated, how the leaves of the tea plant are picked, fermented, dried, cut and packed for bulk shipment. The London sequences show how the bulk tea is received, sampled, blended, and packed for retail to the consumer."
