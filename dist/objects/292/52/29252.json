        "Tells the story of the hardy taxi to Rumdoodle, which takes passengers over the snow and ice to Mawson base from the airstrip at Rumdoodle in Antarctica. Shows how the car stands up to the cold weather, and rough conditions, saving the snow-cat and tractors for other work and maintaining speeds of 40-50 m.p.h. on sea ice. Shows the penguins, seals and huskies, typical scenery and the men of the A.N.A.R.E. at work at the base and on inland expeditions."
