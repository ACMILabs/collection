        "Taronga, which is an aboriginal name for beautiful view, is the home of the extensive collection of animals and birds of the Zoological Trust on the North Shore of Sydney Harbour. The film follows a party of children on their tour of the grounds and shows koalas, emus, kangaroos and Australian birds as well as the larger animals from overseas. Amusements available to the children include being allowed to hold and feed baby animals in the nursery and to go for rides on elephants and miniature trains."
