        "Indicates that in the broadest sense general semantics is concerned with the factors in communication that lead to misunderstanding, tension and conflict. The film identifies and discusses four elements generally associated with most human behaviour. Makes the point that, in terms of resultant behaviour, we ought to be able to distinguish between assessments that make sense and those that do not."
