        "The measurement of roundness in millionths of an inch plays a vital part in modern industry. Instruments like the Talyrond make it possible to attain precise measurements of roundness which help to produce increased mechanical efficiency. Use of the Talyrond illustrates the importance of roundness accuracy in bearings, cylinder bores, and splined shafts, and their applications in industries which include aircraft manufacture, ball bearings and watchmaking."
