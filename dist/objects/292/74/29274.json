        "B.F. Skinner explains the theory of programmed learning; Arthur Lumsdaine describes its application in machines and materials available; and Robert Glaser speaks of the implications of these for education. The advantages of the method are that individual students work at their own rate, progress is made apparent and the ease of learning gives encouragement."
