        "Shamba is Swahili for small holding, and this is the story of two East African farmers. Joseph, who is part of a co-operative, prospers, but Peter, who neglects his farm for a job in the city, requires help from Joseph and the local bank. The services of the bank and the importance of co-operative farming in Kenya are emphasised."
