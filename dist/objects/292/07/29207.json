        "American architect, Frank Lloyd Wright had two homes. Talisen East, near Madison, Wisconsin and Taliesen West, near Phoenix Arizona. These homes illustrate Wright's fundamental architectural principle, that buildings must blend with and seem to grow from their natural settings. Both structures reveal a conscious return to nature as inspiration for their design. 'Awareness of environment' says Wright 'permits sustained original creation'. Taliesen East is a graceful structure, predominently in wood."
