        "Talking about \"Belonging\" is a follow-up of a three-part series, the first two parts being \"Belonging...the first week\" and \"Belonging...the second week\". The series is a study of social interaction in the town of Wellington, New South Wales. Through the lives of four men, it shows how in country towns there are those who \"belong\" and those who don't - women, Aboriginals, the poor, the unemployed. \"Talking about Belonging\" is a discussion between the four men and their families with the filmmaker Philip Robertson and sociologist Kate Gillen when they first saw the completed film. Shows how the men see themselves. Also explores the creation of a \"sense of belonging\" in an Australian country town."
