        "During the emergence of the \"angry young man\" stereotype in the 1950's, this classroom film attempted to instruct the young on the evils of non-conformity and rebellion. By addressing such a complex issue in 8 minutes, the film's main purpose was to promote discussion. Shows examples of various types of juvenile delinquency and makes a shallow attempt to illustrate some of the causes including crowded schools, negligent parents and tenement neighbourhoods."
