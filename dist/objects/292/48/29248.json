        "A musical cartoon produced for the Department of National Revenue, Canada. It is about the most misunderstood servant of us all, the income tax collector. But in this film he no longer remains unloved, unsung, once people understand that the money he collects is really for everyone's benefit. A bright, amusing film for any time of year, tax time or not."
