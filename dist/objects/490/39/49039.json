        "In a moment of grief American Diplomat Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) swaps his stillborn son with a newly born orphan, unbeknownst to his wife, Katherine (Lee Remick). What they both don't know however is that the child was born at 6am, on the 6th day, of the 6th month (666), fulfilling a prophecy in the Bible that the coming of Armageddon will begin with the birth of Satan's son. As their son, Damien (Harvey Stephens), grows older, it becomes apparent that this is no ordinary child. Sure enough, evil nannies, vicious dobermans and tormented priests begin to plague the family, while mysterious and gruesome deaths occur around the boy. This popular film spawned two sequels (\"Damien: Omen 2\" and \"The Final conflict\"). This 25th anniversary edition contains a documentary on the making of the film called \"666: The Omen revealed\", a feature called \"Curse or coincidence\" about the mysterious incidents surrounding its production, interview clips and the original theatrical trailer. Cast also includes David Warner, Billie Whitelaw and Holly Palance."
