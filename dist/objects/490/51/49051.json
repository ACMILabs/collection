        "Cinemagazine item on French perfumes. Shows the travels of perfume from Gras to Paris. First the flowers are picked, the essential oils pressed out then distilling in a warehouse. In the laboratory these are mixed by \"the hose\". We then see bottles being bvlown ready for the perfume. Each designer has a perfume and we see the dress and the finished bottle. However it takes 160 people to produce 9,000 bottles a day. Designers appearing on film include Dior, Givenchy, Guy La Roche, Chanel etc."
