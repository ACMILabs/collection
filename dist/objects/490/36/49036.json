        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". Change, particularly technological change, has become an unavoidable facet of daily life. In this changing world of work, to accept change has become a business - \"being motivated to be motivated\". Teaching \"change\" is the new profession and trained psychologists are now moving into the area of business coaching - they are the highly skilled agents of change. Manufacturing and agricultural industries have decreased and have been replaced by the service industry which currently employs over 70% of the entire workforce in Australia. Professional people who have more money than time are increasingly outsourcing services, eg house maintenance and cleaning, pet care (professional dog walkers). Corporate, big business, and government agencies use Call Centres to centralise their customer service facilities. This program discusses motivational coaching as a means of helping people deal with change. Reference is also made to Frederick W. Taylor's theory on organisational change, or Taylorism.
