        "Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) is a real ladies man. Raised by his mother, a Las Vegas showgirl, he has a somewhat distorted perception of what women really want, and an enormous ego. When he is passed over for an executive position in the advertising agency for a woman his chauvinistic attitude worsens. A freak accident while trying to brainstorm ideas for a new advertising campaign, leaves Nick with the ability to hear what women think. Amazed by his new talent Nick seeks the help of a therapist (Bette Midler) who suggests he think of it as a gift and not a curse, and to use this to his advantage. Nick sets his sights on Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), the new creative director in the agency. At first his plan works, and he undermines Darcy at every opportunity, until he realises Darcy has feelings for him, and that he feels the same way about her. Cast also includes Marisa Tomei, Mark Feurstein, Lauren Holly, Valerie Perrine, Delta Bourke and Alan Alda."
