        "World War 2 has ended, but former prisoners of the Nazis are left with emotional scars. Life outside the camp is now unknown and unimaginable. A small group of survivors wait for their futures to be decided in an old army barracks. Two members of the group begin an affair, until the woman is accidentally killed by an American guard. Based on the stories of Tadeusz Borowski, an Auschwitz survivor. An examination of life after witnessing and living through the holocaust. Nominated for the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1970. In Polish with English subtitles."
