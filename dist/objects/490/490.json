        "'The Cute machine' is an exploration into the morphology of cute characterisation and iconography and its relationship to the biological world, seeking to analyse this 'Cute ideal' by correlating it with the Zoological process known as Neoteny  The CD contains two sections that had already been exhibited as installations (Sorry! and Activity Station) but were then adapted to a screen version. The remaining sections elaborate on the themes of cute iconography and its analysis.  The Cute Machine proposes an environment where cute iconography and user friendliness have rampantly accelerated, and reduced computer interface design to the look and sophistication of an infant toy, while also taking the premise, Cute = young to the extreme, where the 'Cutest', becomes an abstracted mutation of the original sentiment."
