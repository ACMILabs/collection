        "Kenneth Branagh is Lee Simon, a media obsessed journalist who is obsessed with celebrities and whose one aim in life is to bed as many famous media people as he can. This surprisingly light hearted satire by famous misanthrope, Woody Allen, sends up the lavish decadence of the famous and our perennial fascination with their sex lives and bad habits. Many Hollywood stars play themselves or versions of themselves, including a hilarious cameo by Leonardo Di Caprio as a self-obsessed drug addled superstar. Judy Davis plays Lee's long suffering wife, who can't compete with the famous starlets who come Lee's way, and Branagh himself is excellent in a role which sees him spookily take on Woody Allen's persona and quirks."
