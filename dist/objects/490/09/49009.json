        "A 9 part television serial about Australian author Alan Marshall, from his childhood and his diagnosis with Polio to his adulthood as he struggles to become a writer. Based on his three autobiographical novels \"I can Jump Puddles\", 'This is the Grass\" and \"How Beautiful are thy Feet\". Growing up in rural Western Victoria, young Alan Marshall loves running, writing and horses. When Alan is diagnosed with Polio and becomes bedridden, his family do all they can to help him, including straightening his legs with force. When 3 months of home treatment makes no change to his condition, Alan is sent to hospital, to have his legs operated on. While there, Alan's friendly nature and good spirits quickly capture the love of the nurses and the camaraderie of the men in the ward."
