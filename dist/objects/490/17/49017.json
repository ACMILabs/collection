        "All Andy Barclay wants for his birthday is a Good Guy doll, regrettably his mother can't afford one. Upset at being unable to deliver her son's greatest wish, Karen goes to work only to discover a man selling Good Guy dolls in the alley behind the department store. She approaches the man, and for $30 the Good Guy doll is hers and she takes it home to Andy. However this is no ordinary doll. Following a police chase, serial killer Charles Lee Ray aka the Langshore Strangler, is shot and takes refuge in a doll factory. Before dying he uses voodoo to transfer his soul into a doll, the exact doll Karen buys for Andy. When Andy unwraps his new toy, 'Chuckie' continues to kill, his first victim, Andy's Aunt Maggie. Andy tells the police 'Chuckie did it', but no one believes him and he is taken away to a psychiatric institution for children. When the murders continue, Karen discovers that Chuckie is battery-operated, and she forgot to insert his batteries. Detective Norris meets Chuckie and together they try to stop the doll's killing spree. From an explosive start to an even more explosive ending, Child's Play has become a cult film, spawning many sequels. Cast includes Catherine Hicks, Chris Sarandon, Alex Vincent and Brad Dourif as Chuckie."
