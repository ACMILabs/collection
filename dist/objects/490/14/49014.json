        "Elle McFeast (aka Lisbeth gore) presents this celebration of male sexuality with some of Australia's pre-eminent males; Nick Giannopoulos, Greg Chappell, Lex Marinos, Mikey Robins, Hung Le, Rex Mossop, Mike Whitney, Ian Rogerson, Damien Lovelock, the Oarsome Foursome, Doug Mulray, Neil Murray, Piet Collins, Darren Baxter, Paul Hudson and Clive Robertson. Collectively, they discuss issues such as whether size really matters, self control, naming conventions, how they learnt about sex, the first time, condom wearing and what it feels like, what makes for sensational sex, performance anxiety and one night stands. Judith Lucy and Deborah Conway also contribute."
