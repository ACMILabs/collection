        "In this 60's espionage classic (a follow up to \"The Ipcress File\"), Michael Caine reprises his role as British secret agent, Harry Palmer, who reluctantly takes on a job in Berlin where his task is to organise the defection of a wily Russian military commander from East Berlin. Using his local underworld contacts, he arranges for the border crossing to take place in a coffin, as part of a mock funeral. Pursued by a glamorous Israeli agent and hindered by double dealing within his own organisation, Harry Palmer brings his own Cockney cunning to the fore to survive when his plans are thwarted and the wrong body arrives in the coffin. Based on a novel by Len Deighton."
