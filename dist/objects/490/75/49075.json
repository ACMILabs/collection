        "Graham Marshall (Michael Caine) is a middle-aged New York advertising exec recently passed over in a sure fire promotion to a younger subordinate (Peter Riegert). Suffering the effects of this crushing oversight, Graham inadvertently pushes a panhandler into the oncoming path of a subway train, killing the man instantly. Charged with murder, Graham is released on manslaughter. This leads him to speculate on the possibility of repeating his actions - murder, camouflaged as accident - and plots to get back at some of his enemies, starting at home with his shrewish wife (Swoosie Kurtz). The downtrodden suit has turned into a likeable avenger. This parable of corporate greed in post 1980s Wall Street is a curious mix of thriller and black comedy. Cast also includes Will Patton as the obligatory gumshoe and Elizabeth McGovern as the sympathetic co-worker and love interest. Based on the novel by Simon Brett."
