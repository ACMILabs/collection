        "This is the dramatic story of the newsreel cameramen who lived and worked in Australia during the golden era of the newsreel from 1948 to 1956. Len Maguire is a top cameraman whose devotion to his work and loyalty to his company creates conflict with both his colleagues and the people he loves. Amy is a production assistant working in a predominantly male environment and Len's brother, Frank, heads the Australian branch of an American newsreel company in competition with Len's company."
