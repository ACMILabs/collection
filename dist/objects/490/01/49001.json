        "Episode of Series \"Janus\". Episodes 15 and 16 of the television series Janus. \"Suicide by cop\" (52 mins) (directed by Kate Woods). Steve Hennnessey is dead and Peter Faithful and his men in the Tactical Response Squad, particularly Danny (Steve Vidler), are now under investigation by the Homicide Squad. Matters become further complicated when new evidence is brought to light implicating both Peter and Danny not following police procedures at the scene of the crime. Extra pressure is also put on Danny when he takes the stand as an informant for a 2 year-old assault case which Tina Bertrum (Tracy Mann) is prosecuting. \"Intent to permanently deprive\" (49 mins) (directed by Julian McSwiney). Shirl Hennessey is charged with shop-lifting and in possession of a lighter-pistol and appears to want to go down for the crime, much to the bewilderment of Michael Kidd, her Defence Counsellor. Vic Manoulis finds himself involved with a disturbing child abuse murder case. Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast also includes Chris Haywood, Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Louise Siversen, Paulene Terry-Beitz, Robert Wallace, John Arnold and Frank Gallacher."
