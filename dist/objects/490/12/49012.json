        "Episode of Series \"Janus\". Episodes 3 and 4 of the television series Janus. \"Not on the merits\" (52 mins) (directed by Kate Woods) continues on the story of the Hennessey's and police endeavours to convict, in particular, Mal Hennessey. After a protracted police surveillance of Mal Hennnessey, and using a police undercover operant, Peter Faithful and his squad finally video a drug deal, arresting Mal Hennessey and Kirsty Nichols, Steve Hennessey's girlfriend. Kirsty, under pressure by the police, turns informant/witness for the prosecution. \"A Rare crushing reversal\" (51 mins) (directed by Julian McSwiney) involves once again another arrest of Mal and Steve Hennessey and Darren Mack on drug charges. However Peter Faithful's witness, Dale Cassidy (Grant Piro), a drug addict who was supplied by the Hennessey's and who the police offered to put under the witness protection scheme in exchange for information finds that it's not so easy \"dobbing in a mate\". Even more so when he is faced with the continual barrage from the Defence Counsellor, Michael Kidd (Chris Haywood). Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast also includes Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Tracy Mann, Louise Siversen, Paulene Terry-Beitz, Brett Swain."
