        "A 9 part television serial about Australian author Alan Marshall, from his childhood and his diagnosis with Polio to his adulthood as he struggles to become a writer. Based on his three autobiographical novels \"I can Jump Puddles\", 'This is the Grass\" and \"How Beautiful are thy Feet\". Alan is determined to ride his pony Katie again, however his father forbids it, as he says there is too great a chance of Alan getting hurt or killed, as his legs are no longer strong enough to grip the horse and he has trouble maintaining his balance. At school, Alan overhears a classmate complaining about exercising his pony at lunchtime, and quickly volunteers to do it, despite his father's warnings. Although his riding is belittled by his school teacher, who tells him to focus on learning, as he is destined for a desk job, Alan continues, and eventually shows his father what he can do."
