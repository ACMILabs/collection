        "Give me your soul is a compelling documentary that explores the ins and outs of the porn industry in California. The documentary focuses on five main characters whose lives are entwined through porn. Luke Ford is a Jewish reporter who reports the goings on in the industry full-time, including disclosing which actors have contracted the HIV virus. Bill Margold, an ex-porn actor is a chaperone for new women wanting to get into porn. His latest debutant, Katie June, arrives from Tennessee determined to make it as a porn star with the blessing of her mother. The stories of Kimberly Jade and JD Ram are the real life tragedies that can strike some of those who enter the world of porn. This documentary is a fascinating and often disturbing look at the porn industry. It attempts to present a real life picture of how the industry operates, and the kinds of people who work within it."
