        "In the north-west of Tasmania is one of the largest areas of temperate wilderness left on earth, the Tarkine. This documentary looks at the region, the flora and fauna, pristine rivers, landscapes and ecology including excellent footage of Tasmanian devils, quolls, echidnas, platypus etc in their natural habitats and gigantic Huon pines which are over 3,000 years old. However, change could be on the way - the Tarkine area is being surveyed for its commercial worth and with only a small part of the Tarkine coming under the Parks and Wildlife protection, this ruggedly beautiful and isolated piece of wilderness could be under threat. Narrated by Michael Balson."
