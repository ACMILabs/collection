        "Episode of Series \"Janus\". Episodes 5 and 6 of the television series Janus. \"Judgement amongst short men\" (47 mins) (directed by Mandy Smith) focuses on two court cases, the first one relating to a rape case involving a prostitute and a questionably lenient sentence given to the rapist and the other case, Rhonda Hennessey standing accused for attempting to pervert the course of justice. Rhonda Hennessey's trial follows on from her attempts to threaten Kirsty Nichols (Steve Hennessey's pregnant girlfriend) when Kirsty, turned police informant, was to give evidence against the Hennessey family. \"Reckless indifference\" (47 mins) (directed by Michael Carson) revolves around the youngest son of the Hennessey family, Shane Hennessey (Jonathan Kernutt) and his refusal after being charged with attempted murder, theft of a stolen vehicle, reckless conduct etc to admit his identity to the police or to the Court. Rather than being afraid of police reaction, Shane is far more concerned and frightened of his brother Mal. He chooses to face the charges alone, rather than go to his family for help. Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast includes Chris Haywood, Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Tracy Mann, Louise Siversen, Belinda McClory, Leverne McDonnell, Jane Menelaus, Frank Magree, Ezra Bix and Jonathan Kernutt."
