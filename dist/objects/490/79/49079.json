        "A screen adaptation of Jim Cartwright's London play, 'The Rise and Fall of Little Voice', by Mark Herman that recreates the tale of the silent LV (Little Voice played by Jane Horrocks) in a working-class English town who spends her days in her attic room listening to her late father's record collection of the great divas like Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland and Billie Holiday, while at night impersonates the singers in a private performance for her visiting father's ghost. Her loud mouthed mother, Mari (Brenda Blethyn), a tragicomic figure of drunkenly rowdy proportions is on a constant and painful cruise for new lovers and impossibly trying to ignore her intensely shy daughter. That is until Ray Say (Michael Caine), a local unsuccessful talent agent and Mari's perceived chance for love, overhears LV in full swing and stunned by her skill begins a desperate process to foster LV into becoming his chance at the big time. Meanwhile, LV meets Billy (Ewan McGregor), an equally shy pigeon-racing telephone engineer and they begin a tentative friendship that stands in quiet contrast to the ambiguity of the kindness she receives from Ray in his grand scheme and motivates a process of self-awakening from her long and anguished silence. When Ray gambles everything to schedule her first public performance in a local seedy night club, books the band and even brings in a big talent agent from London, all seems set for the road to success. That is, perhaps, all but LV."
