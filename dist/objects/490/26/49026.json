        "Perhaps one of the world's most famous and enduring characters, Godzilla first appeared on Japanese screens in the 1954 release \"Gojira\". In this version, the monster lizard has been created on a remote island somewhere in the South Pacific by nuclear testing, and she is heading to America, land of plenty, to hatch her offspring. Fantastic special effects make this the ultimate monster movie - a 20 story tall lizard with one thing on her mind."
