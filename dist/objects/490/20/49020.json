        "Gigi (Leslie Caron) is a young tomboy being transformed by her Aunts in the hope of her becoming a beautiful and successful courtesan - just like themselves in their hey day - to become the mistress of Gaston (Louis Jourdan). Inevitably, Gaston falls in love with Gigi, captivated by her innocence and child like manner. The protagonist of the film is provided by Maurice Chevalier as Gaston's Uncle, who was once in love with Gigi's aunt. Considered the last great film in Minelli's career, the story is based on a story by Colette. Cast also includes Hermione Gingold, Eva Gabor and Isabel Jeans. (Awards: 13 Academy awards, including Best Picture, 1958)"
