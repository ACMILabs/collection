        "Set in 17th century Austria during the Thirty Years' War, \"The Last valley\" adapted from J.B. Pick's novel was written, directed and produced by noted novelist and occasional film director, James Clavell (Shogun, The Great escape). This is a story of war and peace, of soldiers and villagers and a beautiful hidden valley which lies protected from the ravages of war going on around it. Vogel (Omar Sharif), once a school teacher but now on the run, has the fortune to stumble across the peaceful village where he is given lodgings in return for protection. The peace and calm soon erupts into conflict and violence however, when an exhausted army of soldiers led by \"The Captain\" (Michael Caine) also discover the hidden valley. A truce with the village community and \"The Captain\" is arranged through the mediation of Vogel, pledging to protect the people of the valley from invasion in return for food and shelter over the cold winter months. Filmed in Todd A-O and on location in Trins in Tirol, Austria. Cast also includes Florinda Bolkan, Nigel Davenport, Per Oscarsson."
