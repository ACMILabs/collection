Gary Cooper plays Robert Jordan, an American who has joined a guerilla group and has been assigned to blow-up a Falangist controlled Bridge. He meets and falls in love with a young woman, played by Ingrid Bergman, who joined the group after her brutal treatment at the hands of the enemy. Written by Dudley Nichols, based on the novel by Ernest Hemingway, which was unanimously voted the best novel of the year in 1941 by the Pulitzer Prize committee, but was vetoed for political reasons.
