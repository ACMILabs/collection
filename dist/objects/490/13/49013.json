        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Janus\". A feature length episode sets the scene for this extraordinary courtroom drama series. The Supreme Court of Victoria provides the location for the opening shots of the four accused - Ken Hardy (Mathew Crosby), Steve Hennessey (Leon Teague), Darren Mack (Nique Needles) and Mal Hennessey (Brett Swain). The Hennessey's are well-known for their notorious criminal activities and this time they are facing trial for an armed bank hold-up where one police officer has been shot dead and another seriously wounded. Lack of evidence and a technicality relating to the record of interview with Ken Hardy leaves the jury with no choice but to acquit the four men. This result shatters Det-Sgt Peter Faithful (Simon Westaway), who after the abandonment of the Major Crime Squad, spends time working in public affairs and a suburban CIB unit. Twelve months after the acquital Peter Faithful leaps at the chance to become involved with the Tactical Response Squad. Several intense months of surveillance on the Hennessey family finally begin to reap results for the frustrated Squad. Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast also includes Chris Haywood, Jeremy Kewley, Tracy Mann, Louise Siversen, Paulene Terry Beitz, Belinda McClory."
