        "A comprehensive and personal documentary about the life of one the most renowned painters of the Australian landscape, Hans Heysen. The program centers around interviews with his surviving children, including the Archibald Prize winning artist Nora Heysen, and focuses on the regions around Hahndorf, South Australia, and the Flinders Ranges where his painting was most prolific. It provides a reflective portrayal of his artistry, his concern for the Australian environment, his wide network of supporters and friends, and his influence on others intertwined with a sensitive study of his personal history."
