        "A 9 part television serial about Australian author Alan Marshall, from his childhood and his diagnosis with Polio to his adulthood as he struggles to become a writer. Based on his three autobiographical novels \"I can Jump Puddles\", 'This is the Grass\" and \"How Beautiful are thy Feet\". When a story he submits is rejected, Alan, age 20, returns to the city to work. Quickly applying for a clerical position, Alan is offered the job, on the condition he accepts less than the award wage. On the condition that if after 6 months, his employer, Mrs. Smalpeck, is pleased with his work, she raise his wage to match those of equal capability, he agrees. Boarding at a local boarding house run by the eccentric Mrs. Birdsworth, Alan continues his observation of the world around him."
