        "In this World War II tragicomedy, writer/director Roberto Benigni portrays Guido, who moves during the 30s from the country to a Tuscan town, where he falls in love with schoolteacher Dora. Dora likes Guido, but she remains faithful to her pompous fiancee, causing Guido to come up with inventive ways of wooing her. Meanwhile, anti-semitic attitudes lead to attacks against Jewish members of the community, including Guido's uncle. Leaping ahead five years, during World War II, Guido and Dora are married with a son Giosue. After they are imprisoned in a concentration camp, Guido goes to elaborate lengths to keep his son from understanding the truth of their situation. In Italian with English subtitles. Cast includes: Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giustino Durano and Giorgio Cantarini."
