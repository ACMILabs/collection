        "A 9 part television serial about Australian author Alan Marshall, from his childhood and his diagnosis with Polio to his adulthood as he struggles to become a writer. Based on his three autobiographical novels \"I can Jump Puddles\", 'This is the Grass\" and \"How Beautiful are thy Feet\". Following his operation, Alan is in extreme pain, although at first his anguish is dismissed by the nurses. The doctor prescribes sunshine as medicine and Alan ventures into the world for the first time in months. Quickly learning to get himself around on his crutches, Alan goes home, and despite being pushed around in a modified pram, returns to school, and falls in love with Maggie Mulligan. When he is challenged to a fight by another classmate, and wins, Alan earns the respect of his classmates."
