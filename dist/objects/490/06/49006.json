His father's friend Mr. Radcliff learns of Alan's ambition to become a writer, he encourages Alan to start keeping a notebook, to note down good stories and yarns, and to constantly experience new things, as all these things will help him to become a great writer. When a family friend invites him to go camping, Alan takes along his notebook and goes along to experience 'life'."
