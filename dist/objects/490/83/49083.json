        "This comedy caper film set in the 1890's (the period meticulously re-created by art director Harry Horner) features James Caan and Elliot Gould as a vaudeville song and dance team who, after being thrown into jail on a petty theft charge make the acquaintance of a big time crook (Michael Caine). Together they devise a plot to execute a major bank robbery - with disastrous results. Cast also includes Diane Keaton."
