        "A detailed documentary examining the works and background of Australian artist, Rupert Bunny, focussing on the factors which made his work so admired by both collectors and fellow artists. Born in Melbourne, Bunny was one of the few Australian artists painting between the Romantic and Modernist periods to achieve international success by selling works all over the world. While his subjects ranged from mythological characters, seascapes, fairytales, and the spiritual, they all shared a common thread in that their purpose was to appeal to all of the senses. The concept of synthaesthesia - that one sense can be evoked by another - is strikingly evident in the sensuously elegant content of his paintings. A number of art critics offer their opinions on why they believe Bunny is one of the most masterly painters that Australia has ever produced."
