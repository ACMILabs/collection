        "For as long as there has been the Olympic Games there has been the participation of African Americans and the sporting arena has provided them with an important avenue for expression. This program traces some of the key achievements and milestones of athletes at the Olympics (both Winter and Summer Games): the first male and female medal recipients; first individual gold; first team event, as well as placing the success of groups and individuals into the wider context of their success in sport in general, especially in relation to boxing and basketball. Involvement throughout each game is mentioned, with emphasis placed on some of the names synonymous with African American athletes: George Pogue; Jim Thorpe; Alice Coachman; Mae Fagg; Arthur Ashe; Rafer Johnson; Anite De Frantz and Wilma Randolph to name a few."
