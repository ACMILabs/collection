        "In 1998 the Space Shuttle \"Endeavour\" left Earth with a crew of seven - six American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut to join the aging space shuttle Mir. On board was astronaut Andy Thomas, a space engineer born in Australia who trained in Russia to prepare for the mission. His stay on Mir would be for 4 1/2 months and his main function was to be the subject of research on the psychological and physiological effects of being in space. This research was used in developing the International Space Station Program; 15 nations working together to construct a permanently occupied laboratory in space."
