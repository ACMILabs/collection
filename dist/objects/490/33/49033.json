        "Based on Tom Wolfe's best seller, \"The Right Stuff\" recounts the development of the American Space programme. Spanning 15 years, the film begins with Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier and moves on to concentrate primarily on the original seven Mercury astronauts. The film relates the perils and frustrations of the astronauts, their arduous training and complex personal lives, and the absurd lengths to which they must go to satisfy the public's demand for real heroes. Cast includes Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward and Barbara Hershey."
