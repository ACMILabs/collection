        "Spy thriller inspired by the true story of British intelligence officer and Soviet spy Kim Philby (1912-1988). Having defected to Russia in 1979, Sir Philip Kimberly (Michael Caine), Cambridge graduate and former Director-General of M.I.6 is called upon by the Russians to carry out one last mission. With a different identity and a face altered beyond recognition by plastic surgery, he is sent back to England in the guise of a Soviet citizen to retrieve a secret dossier of names he supposedly hid there several years ago. When he decides to defect a second time the viewer is drawn into a complex web of espionage, counter-espionage and counter-counter-espionage where nothing is as it at first appears. Cast includes Laurence Olivier, Susan George and Robert Powell."
