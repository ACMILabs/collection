        "Episode of Series \"Janus\". Episodes 9 and 10 of the television series Janus. \"A Mischievous offence\" (50 mins) (directed by Mandy Smith) has the eccentric DPP Prosecutor Clyde Martin (Douglas Hedge) at his witty best in the court room scene, playing to the jury, annoying the Defence and humoring the witnesses. The case being handled is a horse ring-in trial and the star witness, an 8 year-old boy. Steve Hennessey is still missing and Peter Faithful offers to do a deal with Kenny Hardy (being held for the armed bank robbery) in exchange for information leading to Steve's whereabouts. \"A Familiar utterance\" (50 mins) (directed by Michael Carson). The irony of it all - Michael Kidd, the Hennessey's barrister, is asked to defend two police (formerly of the Drug Squad) who have been charged with assaulting a bouncer in a night club. Rob Griffin, following a tip off from Prosecutor Clyde Martin, links up with Peter Faithful in tracking down a brief of a 10 year old unsolved murder of Patrick Clancy, best mate of Mal Hennessey. Contains some scenes in b&w. Cast also includes Chris Haywood, Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Louise Siversen, Felix Nobis, Jack Finsterer, Elizabeth Welch, Tracy Mann, Jane Menelaus, Michael Edward-Stevens, Damian Foley and David Cotter."
