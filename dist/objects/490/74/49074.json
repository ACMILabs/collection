        "What if the most famous detective of all time - Sherlock Holmes (Michael Caine) - was a drunk, gambling, womanizing, one time actor, created in the mind of his previously overshadowed but vastly superior assistant, Doctor Watson (Ben Kingsley)? Such is the premise of \"Without a clue\". Fed up with Holmes' bad form, Watson attempts to branch out on his own as the 'Crime Doctor', only to be told that it's Holmes the people want. Thus, Holmes and Watson are forced to join sides again on a case involving counterfeit 5 pound notes. All is progressing well until the appearance of Holmes/Watson's nemesis, Professor Moriaty, then Watson disappears into the canal - presumed dead, and it's up to the oft inebriated Holmes to solve his first case, unassisted, and prove his crime solving capacity to the dubious Inspector Lestrade. Cast also includes Lysette Anthony, Jeffrey Jones and Paul Freeman."
