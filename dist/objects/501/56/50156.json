        "A haunting feature debut from Craig Monahan which explores the complex psychological exchange between Detective Sergeant John Steele (Tony Martin) and nervy suspected murderer Eddie Fleming (Hugo Weaving) during the hours of a claustrophobic police interrogation.The apparently ordinary Fleming is asleep in his apartment when his door is broken down and he is accused of nameless crimes. He is the only lead the tough, world weary Detective Sergeant Steele has and so begins a bewildering sequence of interviews where the crime and the many forces at work between the characters and their situation gradually becomes apparent. The nature of guilt, innocence and who or what to believe is rendered uncertain in this film as we are presented not with any concrete answers but with the fluidity of perception and the difficulties of defining truth. (Awards: Winner Best Original Screenplay, Best Film and Best Actor (Hugo Weaving) Australian Film Institute Awards, 1998)"
