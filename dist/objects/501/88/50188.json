        "Episode three of a 4-part documentary series which follows events over a year in the lives of several police officers as they keep law and order in the remote Kimberley area of Western Australia. In this episode it is the end of the wet season and tourists are flocking into Wyndham. For the Kimberley cops life just gets busier and busier. First they have to release a crocodile that has been caught in a trap. Crocodiles are a protected species but are becoming a threat to the tourist industry as their numbers increase. Then the police are called in to investigate the cause of a crash of a cattle truck which has come off the road and rolled over 150 kilometers west of Wyndham. And finally two tourists out on a walk have gone missing from Digger's Rest Cattle Station requiring a co-ordinated search party to find them. Narrated by Peter Turnbull."
