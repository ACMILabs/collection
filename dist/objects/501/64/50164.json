        "This is a film about the impact of the oppressive adult world - a rich conservative family in Franco's Spain - on children. The premise is that childhood is \"a stage where nocturnal terror, fear of the unknown and loneliness are present with at least the same intensity as the joy of living and that curiosity of which pedagogues talk so much\" (Saura). Unusually, the adults are seen in a double perspective reflecting the consciousness of both the 9 year-old Ana (brilliantly played by Ana Torrent) and the adult Ana (played by Geraldine Chaplin who also plays Ana's mother). The title comes from a Spanish proverb - \"Raise ravens and they'll pluck out your eyes\" - expressing a repressive Francoist myth. Cast includes Ana Torrent, Conchi Perez, Maite Sanchez, Geraldine Chaplin, Monica Randall and Florinda Chico. In Spanish with English subtitles."
