        "This four part mini-series (which was also released as a feature film in a condensed form) is based on the autobiography of Carlo Levi, writer, painter, doctor and avowed anti-fascist. In 1935 Levi was exiled to Lucania in the extreme south of Italy for his political activities. In this remote peasant land so cut off from the domain of history that even Christ never arrived, so the locals say, Levi discovered a way of life which transformed him. He felt more strongly the weight of age-old injustices and went back to the roots of these injustices. 'This film is a journey through my own conscience and through that of all men who carry a Lucania in themselves' (Rosi). Cast includes: Gian Maria Volonte, Paolo Bonacelli, Alain Cuny, Irene Papas. Written by Francesco Rosi, Tonino Guerra, Raffaele la Capria ; photography, Pasqualino De Santis ; music, Piero Piccioni. Italian dialogue with English subtitles."
