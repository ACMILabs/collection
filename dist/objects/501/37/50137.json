        "'The Bill' is a UK police drama that explores both criminals and police. These three mid-nineties episodes are good examples of the series' true to life stories of crimes, criminals and the police that have to deal with the seedier side of life in East London. 'Beg borrow or steal' (1994, produced by Pat Sandys, directed by Gill Wilkinson): vagrants are targeted, in particular a drunk and a young beggar mother. The episode explores what can happen when the police are forced to become involved with people who don't appreciate their help. 'Street life' (1995, produced by Pat Sandys, directed by Paul Unwin): an embarrassed married businessman confesses to being mugged whilst in the company of a prostitute. The undercover operation ensues involving C.I.D. officers. The unsavoury lives of prostitutes and their pimps are revealed whilst the businessman becomes increasingly reluctant to help the police. 'When opportunity knocks' (1995, produced by Richard Handford, directed by Laurence Moody): when a dodgy door to door car cleaner may be connected to a string of burglaries turns out to be a ladies man, C.I.D. use a new WPC undercover as bait."
