        "This film is regarded as a milestone in filmmaking as Walt Disney's first full-length animated feature. Adapted from Grimm's Fairy Tales, the film is the fairytale of Snow White, the beautiful princess whose life is threatened by the jealous Queen. Snow White finds safe haven with the seven dwarfs: Doc, Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful and Dopey until a mysterious old woman arrives with a poison apple. Three years in the making, this feature propagated new developments in animation, using an unprecedented amount of man-hours in the creation of realistic movement on screen. This film is imbued in bountiful humour and music and of course striking animation. Originally billed as a children's film, \"Snow White and the seven dwarfs\" is a film that from the outset had the ability to appeal across age brackets."
