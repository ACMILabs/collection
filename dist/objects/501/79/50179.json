        "One of the most memorable Godzilla movies, \"Ghidrah, the Three Headed Monster\" was rushed into production and was released in Japanese theatres the same year as Godzilla vs. Mothra. It featured the debut of Godzilla's soon-to-be most popular foe: King Ghidorah (changed to Ghidrah for the US release). It was also the monster Rodan's debut movie in the Godzilla series. When Ghidrah, a three headed extra-terrestrial, threatens the well-being of the planet, desperate humans invite friendly monsters Mothra, Rodan and Godzilla to help them fight the space creature. Ghidrah is an important Godzilla film because it created a major turning point in the Showa Godzilla series. From this movie on, Godzilla would undergo a slow transition from an evil monster into a savior of the world. This transition would also mark the decreasing popularity of Godzilla in both the U.S. and Japan. Cast includes Yosuke Natsuki, Yuriko Hoshi and Hiroshi Koizumi. Special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. Dubbed into English."
