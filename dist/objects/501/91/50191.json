        "Makin Pitchas is a compilation of four short films made by young Kooris who are a part of the Ballarat and District Aboriginal Cooperative (BADAC). The project was an initiative funded by VicHealth to encourage young Kooris to explore and articulate their experiences of mental health issues, most particularly family issues, grief, conflict, racism and bullying. The final product is intended to promote discussion of mental health issues among young people in Indigenous communities as well as acting as a tool for cross cultural education in mainstream organisations. \"Believe in Yourself\" (dir. Tim Stares) is the story of Dave, a koori youth who feels alienated and discouraged by his parents who would prefer he drop out of school and lay bricks for his father rather than follow his dream to be a filmmaker. \"A World of Colour\" (dir. Myles Walsh) focuses on a mediation session, after a basketball game turns into a racial slagging match. \"Goodnight Irene\" (dir. Tim Stares) tells the story of Ruth, a young girl who has to do a history project about family's pastimes. Unfortunately she cannot report anything to her teacher because the memories her mother has of her past are too painful to discuss. In \"Verandah Dreaming\" (dir. Myles Walsh) Verna loses her husband in the war and her son to drugs. Hope seems further lost when her grandson is sent to prison for stealing a car. However, with the help of the Aboriginal Legal Service, Sammy joins an Aboriginal Dance group and finds direction to his life."
