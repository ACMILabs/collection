        "Tony Allcock, British and international indoors and outdoors bowls champion since 1976, explains and demonstrates the basics of lawn bowls which, in his opnion, is all about line, length and luck. Dispelling the myth that bowls is a game for the \"oldies\", Tony is assisted by his much younger colleague, Andrew Wills, who represents the growing interest by young people in this game of skill and patience. Forward swing, backward swing, estimating line and length correctly, use of body weight and movement, judging the pace of the green and speed of follow through are all examined in great depth. To demonstrate the various techniques, the pair then play two ends - a short jack and a long jack. This step by step guide all takes place in an indoor bowls club."
