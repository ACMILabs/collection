        "Will one of the most mysterious crimes perpetrated by a notorious unknown serial killer ever be solved? Who was Jack the Ripper and why did the killings end with the fifth victim? All will be revealed in this documentary - or will it? Based on Stephen Knight's book of the same title, Ray McGregor travelled to London, to Whitechapel, where the infamous murders took place and managed to obtain an interview with the author himself. Many theories exist about who Jack the Ripper was and why his victims were all women prostitutes. Stephen Knight in his book and in this interview attempts to dispel the myths and put forward factual evidence. It would appear that the five victims were all women in their 40's, living in extremely harsh conditions and working as prostitutes. The victims were: Mary Anne Nichols murdered on 31 August 1888, Anne Chapman murdered on 8 September 1888, Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes murdered on 29/30 September 1888 and Marie Kelly murdered on 9 November 1888. Queen Victoria expressed deep concern to the Prime Minister at the time of the first murder and the Royal link is explored even further by Stephen Knight. Includes still photographs, drawings and newspaper articles of the time."
