        "'The Bill' is a UK police drama that explores both criminals and police. 'Gentleman Jim' contains three episodes of 'The Bill' featuring Jim Carver (Mark Wingett). Wingett wrote the first of these three episodes. 'Saved' (1995, produced by Pat Sandys, directed by Jeremy Silberston): back in his drinking days Jim Carver is loosing his faith in the police force and in particular, his usefulness. To combat his so called \"desk fatigue\", he is called to help in a raid on a crack house. Jim helps a prostitute - restoring his sense of worth. 'True to life player' (1997, produced by Chris Clough, directed by Simon Meyers): focuses on a once local boy's rise to fame as a footballer who is accused of rape by an underage girl. Is she lying, or is he? As the story unfolds the audience is in doubt while Jim Carver plays his role as investigating officer. 'Gentleman Jim' (1997, produced by Pat Sandys, directed by Mike Vardy): Jim is teamed up with an overly enthusiastic uniformed officer on secondment in C.I.D. Her drive and initiative conflicts with the slightly stale and crabby Jim. Experience wins over enthusiasm and Jim reveals himself as the decent man and policeman that he is."
