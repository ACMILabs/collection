        "'The Bill' is a UK police drama that explores both criminals and police. 'A Bunch of fives' (1997, produced by Michael Simpson, directed by Chris Lovett): one of the Sunhill officers is found beaten unconscious in an alley at the back of a Chinese restaurant. This causes a zero tolerance stance from the rest of the officers while they try to find the culprit. Does a policeman need to be beaten before the police do any work at Sunhill? 'Death of a nobody' (1996, produced by Chris Clough, directed by Simon Meyers): a man is found murdered. A mystery unfolds when he's identified as a choir singing, onion growing taxi driver. Have they killed the wrong man? A polaroid, an answering machine and a suspicious private investigator are the only clues in this mysterious one hour episode."
