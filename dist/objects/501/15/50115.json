        "More than words is a series which follows Rosa, a young girl, and her friend, a little green creature from another planet. Using Rosa's imagination, they explore the English language in different circumstances through a number of different texts. In this episode Rosa and the creature explore cartoons and how they are produced. When the little creature believes that cartoon events can translate into real life, Rosa sets out to show him this isn't the case. They contact a cartoonist who, using current popular cartoons such as \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Flintstones\" as examples, explains the characteristics of cartoons, cartoon stereotypes, the basic formula for a storyline, the role music and sound effects play in creating an effective cartoon, and the way cartoon violence cannot translate into actual day activities."
