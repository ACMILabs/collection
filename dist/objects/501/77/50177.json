        "In this hauntingly loose transposition of Charlotte Bronte's \"Jane Eyre\" to the West Indies, a nurse, summoned to look after a sick woman, falls in love with the brooding husband and encounters voodoo. An ambiguous combination of horror fantasy and psychological thriller, the film blurs the distinction between good and evil, poetically depicting tribal customs without condescension and stereotyping. Beautifully shot by cinematographer J. Roy Hunt, the shadowy night world pervades everything and everyone.' I Walked with a Zombie' stands as the zenith of director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton's wonderful horror collaborations. Cast includes James Ellison, Frances Dee and Tom Conway."
