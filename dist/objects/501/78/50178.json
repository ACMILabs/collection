        "Is it an escaped leopard or something more sinister that is responsible for some grizzly murders in a New Mexico border town? Teaming up with producer Val Lewton for the third time, director Jacques Tourneur has fashioned an eerie, economical and atmospheric film noir thriller. Based on the Cornell Woolrich novel \"Black Alibi\", 'The Leopard man' utilizes to great effect, a subtle, moody soundtrack and expressionistic lighting to suggest rather than show, proving that the imagination can sometimes be more terrifying. Like their previous collaboration's 'Cat People' (1942) and 'I Walked with a Zombie' (1943), the film is made up of a series of chilling set pieces that unnerve and linger rather than shock in their disquieting tone and atmosphere. Cast includes Margo, Dennis O'Keefe, Jean Brooks, Isabel Jewell and James Bell."
