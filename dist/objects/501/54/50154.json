        "In 1789 an idea forged by America's first President, George Washington, received Congress approval. Washington's aim was to build a new capital city and a President's House away from New York on the river Potomac. Construction began in 1792 with the foundations being dug by slaves and half the workforce made up of immigrants. Built of iron and stone this magnificent building became a symbol of the American people and a symbol of power to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, George Washington died before the building was completed. This documentary takes you into the world of the White House and its day-to-day running, including the huge entourage of staff who serve the House - plumbers, electricians, maids and butlers, chefs and kitchen hands, event co-ordinators and managers. You will see a State Dinner being organised and prepared for 150 guests with the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, as the distinguished State visitor, as well as rare shots of the living quarters where Presidents and their families have resided for over 200 years. Also includes historical footage, photographic stills and anecdotal stories from past Presidents, their families and employees at the White House. Narrated by Morgan Freeman. Contains some black and white footage."
