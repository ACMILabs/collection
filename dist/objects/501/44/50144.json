        "The Fifth Element takes an amazing glimpse into the future, with wonderful visual effects from the people who gave us \"Titanic\", \"Nikita\" and \"The Professional\", and unique costumes by visionary designer, Jean-Paul Gaultier. If the four elements are fire, water, earth and air, what is the Fifth element? What does it do? Who has control of it? These questions and others are answered as the film unfolds at a breath taking pace. This film takes you on a sci-fi thrill ride of the decade. Bruce Willis, a taxi-driver in New York city in the 23rd Century is selected as our hero. He will travel to the end of the galaxy to decide the fate of our universe. Cast includes Gary Oldman, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm and Chris Tucker."
