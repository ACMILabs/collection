        "Another instalment in the \"Star Wars\" series - with a difference - director George Lucas choosing to trace what happened prior to the \"original\" \"Star Wars\" film, rather than following on from \"The Return of the Jedi\". Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), a young Jedi knight, is training under his mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). When the planet Naboo is cut off by the Trade Federation, the Jedi Council orders Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon to settle the problem. They arrive in Naboo and meet Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) who joins them on the trip to Coruscant to meet the Trade Federation. Unfortunately, they encounter difficulties with their spacecraft and are forced to make an emergency landing on Tatooine. While there, they meet Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a slave boy, who will eventually father Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader. Qui-Gon becomes convinced that Anakin is the leader the Jedi's have been seeking and makes a bet to free Anakin from the slave contract he is bound to. On return to Naboo, war breaks out and the Jedi's must fight against Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid), leader of the Trade Federation and his deadly henchman, dark Jedi, Darth Maul (Ray Park). One of the most anticipated films of the 90s, \"The Phantom menace\" includes cameo roles from Samuel L. Jackson and Terence Stamp."
