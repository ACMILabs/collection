        "Better than sex is a light, playful, Australian comedy of sexual manners which traces the awkward path of a seemingly random one night stand which blossoms into the beginnings of a relationship. David Wenham and Susie Porter star as Josh and Cin respectively, two thirty something professionals who meet at a party one night and decide to have casual sex with each other. Josh has just come back from England and is only in Australia for three more days, which makes the prospect of the sexual encounter developing further, slim. When the one night stand moves onto the second day however, they both begin to question the nature of their apparently casual one night stand. Jonathan Teplitzky uses this mostly two hander as a way to explore the nature of intimacy and the varying differences between the sexes when it comes to love. Cast includes Catherine McClements, Simon Bossell and Kris McQuade."
