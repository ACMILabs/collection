        "Santa Fe primary school teacher Dex (Donal Logue) is a success with the ladies and he owes it all to Steve - Steve Austin, Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett - the prototypical cool American male, he never has to impress the women but always gets the ladies. Dex and his entourage of single male friends (one is happily married), subscribe to the tao of Steve, valuing such ideals as suppressing that which you desire and doing something excellent in front of the ladies. Dex's comfortable, philandering existence is thrown into turmoil when he meets Syd (Greer Goodman) - a conquest from his thinner, college years - whom, to his surprise, he discovers he is falling in love with, causing him to question the code by which he has lived his life thus far. A surprise sleeper at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival, Goodman's directorial debut saw Donal Logue awarded with a Special Jury Prize."
