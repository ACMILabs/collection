        "Steve Martin is Rigby Reardon, the best private eye of all time. Juliet Forrest (Rachel Ward) comes to his office with a case. Her father, a noted scientist, philanthropist and cheesemaker has mysteriously died. A complex trail of clues leads Reardon to \"Carlotta's lists\". Reiner has captured the essence of 1940's detective films and presents an exciting but \"fun\" film. Reardon's special \"friends\" include Alan Ladd, Barbara Stanwyck, Ray Milland, Burt Lancaster, Humphrey Bogart and Charles Laughton."
