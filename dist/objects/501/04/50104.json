        "The original \"Planet of the apes\" film and the five sequels it spawned about a future world of intelligent apes, and their interactions with humans. \"Planet of the apes\": in the year 1972, Taylor and his crew set off to colonise the nearest habitable planet. Crash-landing two millennia later, they awake in a world dominated by intelligent apes, where 'primitive' humans are used for experimentation and sport. \"Beneath the planet of the apes\": following Taylor's crew into the unknown, Brent finds himself stranded in the same mad world. Struggling to stay one step ahead, he stumbles into the crossfire of an ape offensive against a race of telepathic humans. \"Escape from the planet of the apes\": escaping the fiery end of the their world, three apes travel back in time, to a past where mankind rules over all. \"Conquest of the planet of the apes\": as Caeser, a baby ape, grows into maturity, he discovers mankind's cruel mistreatment of primates. It is the flash point setting for the upheaval of society as both apes and humans know it. \"Battle for the planet of the Apes\": Caeser's dream has come true; the emancipation of apes from the tyrannical rule of human society. Cast includes Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, Linda Harrison, Ricardo Montalban, Natalie Trundy, James Franciscus, Don Murray, Claude Akins, Severen Darden. Music: Jerry Goldsmith (original, 1971), Leonard Rosenman (1969, 1973), Tom Scott (1972)"
