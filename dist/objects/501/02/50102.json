        "One of the finest disaster/adventure movies of the 1970s, \"The Poseidon adventure\" is set on an ocean liner, capsized by a ninety-foot tidal wave one New Year's Eve. With the boat upside down in the water, a dozen survivors make a desperate dash for the bottom of the boat - their only way out. The camaraderie of the group is tested as they face constant danger of flooding and explosions, struggling through six levels of the boat, headed for the bowels of the ship. Aside from impressive special effects, the film essentially boils down to a battle of wills between two rival leaders of the posse - a no-nonsense reverend (Gene Hackman) and a hothead detective, Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine). \"The Poseidon adventure\" was nominated for seven Academy awards, and won two, for Best Song and a Special Achievement Award for visual effects. Adapted from the novel by Paul Gallico."
