        "Just like you is a comprehensive guide for people who are unsure of how to act around people with disabilities. The program answers questions such as, can you say \"look\" to a person who is blind? Do you offer to push someone in a wheelchair? Presented by people with disabilities, we are shown the preferred etiquette that can make interaction easier for both parties."
