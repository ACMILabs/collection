        "A compilation of movie trailers and excerpts from many of Bela Lugosi's horror films dating from the 1930s to the late 1940s. Born Bela Ferenc Dezso Blasko on 20 October 1882 in Lugos, Hungary, Lugosi began his acting career on stage performing with the Budapest Academy of Theatrical Arts and as a leading actor with Hungary's Royal National Theatre. By 1920 Lugosi had moved across to Germany where he began appearing in films. He emigrated to America in 1921 playing bit parts in obscure films until finally in 1931 he broke into the Hollywood scene, cast in the title role of the horror film, \"Dracula\". Numerous other films of similar genre followed, including \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1932), \"The Invisible ray\" (1936), \"The Wolf man\" (1941), \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" (1942), \"Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man\" (1942) and \"The Body snatcher\" (1945). Trailers of these films, along with interviews and appearances by Lugosi on American television programs \"Tribute to a star\" and \"You asked for it\" are contained in this video. Includes scenes with Boris Karloff, Frances Drake, Claude Rains, Betty Boop and many other stars of the time."
