        "An intense psychological thriller about violence amongst teens starring Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, Alyssa Milano, William Petersen and Amy Brenneman. Nicole Walker (Witherspoon) is a typical high school student who lives with her affluent and overprotective father (Petersen) and his new wife (Brenneman). Rebelling against him, Nicole sneaks out of the house with her best friend Margo (Milano) to a club, where she meets attractive bad-boy David McCall (Wahlberg in one of his first lead roles). Despite her father's reservations about her first serious boyfriend and his questionable friends, Nicole falls head-over-heels for him and is shocked when his true possessive and violent nature is revealed. Ending their relationship, she tries to move on with her life. David has other plans, stalking Nicole and terrorising her family and friends, culminating in an attack on Nicole's home. Set in Seattle, 'Fear' shows just how easy a seemingly perfect lifestyle can be altered by violence, with Nicole's wealthy, privileged lifestyle overlapping with David's underworld grunge life."
