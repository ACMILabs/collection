        "This program looks at the large range of African violets and Streptocarpus (Cape Primrose) available, and their care. British gardening experts Rev. Tony Clements and Anne Swithinbank demonstrate propagation by leaf cuttings and division. Correct potting techniques as well as hybridisations by cross-pollination are shown. The common pests and diseases affecting African violets are discussed, as well as the watering techniques and best growing conditions to encourage abundant flowers on these popular plants from Tanzania."
