        "Malena interweaves a coming-of-age story with the rise and fall of fascism in Sicily. On the day that Mussolini addresses a nation about to go to war, young Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro), receives his first bike, subsequently climbs the ranks of a local boy club, discovers the silent, beautiful Malena (Monica Bellucci), and has his sexuality suddenly awakened. Instantly enamoured, Renato dreams of Malena day and night and claims her as his own: secretly watching her every movement and despising any town gossip or male desire directed toward her. However, supreme beauty is a sure curse for Malena, and with the news from abroad of her husband's death, her new availability only leads to arguments and scandals in the town. With the war in full swing and severe rations, hard times fall upon the townsfolk. Renato's excruciating yearning continues until his desire is finally met, Sicily is freed by the Allies, and Malena suffers public humiliation at the hands of the local women for her conduct during the war. Director of the highly successful, \"Cinema Paradiso\", Giuseppe Tornatore delivers an amusing and engaging film with \"Malena\". Strictly from the male point of view, however, it suffers a slightly conservative view of woman and overall translates key moments in history with heavy-handed metaphor so that Malena could easily be read as the lure of fascism. However, its air of comedy, seductive imagery, and perceptive portrayal of just how malignant small-town gossip can be keeps \"Malena\" entertaining. In Italian with English subtitles."
