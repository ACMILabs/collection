        "Episodes 15 (A Day in the Life) and 16 (For Him the Bell Tolls) from the second series of the groundbreaking television series about Xena, a tough female warrior struggling to come to terms with her evil past, and Gabrielle, her devoted sidekick. As a physically strong, independent woman, the character of Xena has been adopted as a feminist icon of popular culture. The implication within the subtext of the show that Xena and Gabrielle might be more than 'just good friends' has led many adult viewers to read the couple as lovers. \"A Day in the Life\" follows Xena and Gabrielle as they spend a typical day together defeating giants and warlords and fighting off potential suitors. Heavy in \"lesbian subtext\", the interactions between the two women in this comic episode has been likened by fans to the banter between long term couples like Tracey and Hepburn in their classic screwball comedies. \"For Him the Bell Tolls\" sees Joxer, the foolish wannabe warrior who follows Xena and Gabrielle around, transformed by Aphrodite into a dashing war hero tasked with stealing a princess's heart away from her betrothed. Gabrielle must intervene to reverse Aphrodite's mischievous spell. This episode is a homage to \"The Court Jester\" featuring Danny Kaye."
