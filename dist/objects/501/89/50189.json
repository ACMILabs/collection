        "Final episode of a 4-part series which follows events over a year in the lives of several police officers as they keep law and order in the remote Kimberley area of Western Australia. In this episode, the Hall's Creek Fishing Competition or the \"Barra Bash\" is taking place, creating quite an amount of organisational work for the Kimberley cops. One boat requires assistance when it breaks down in the Gulf, and another requires a marine search and rescue when it is reported overdue and missing late in the evening. Also shown is the community spirit which exists in the small isolated township of Wyndham, the network and support amongst the police wives, and the gnerally good relations which exist between the police and the Aboriginal community. Narrated by Peter Turnbull."
