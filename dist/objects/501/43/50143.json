        "Episode 7. 'Tidal seas': looks at the impact of tides on the feeding habits of ocean creatures and land predators. As tides retreat, organisms dwelling in the exposed sand and rocks must act quickly to find food or seek refuge. As the tide returns, plankton supplies are replenished, creatures re-emerge from their shelters and land predators return to their natural habitat. Episode 8 'Coasts': explores the turbulent frontier between land and sea. During the breeding season, many sea creatures return to the land for a short duration to raise their young. As they negotiate the coastal surf to access the land, they are vulnerable to attacks by predators. Episode 9. 'Making waves': focuses on the work by cinematographers involved in capturing 'The Blue planet' footage. Shows the camera operators as they worked, in collaboration with scientists, to track and record the elusive sea creatures. Presents the methods and cutting edge technology used by research scientists as they study the breeding and migratory habits of their chosen subject."
