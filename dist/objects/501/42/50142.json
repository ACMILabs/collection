        "Episode 4. 'Frozen Seas' looks at the seasonal changes that affect the Arctic and Antarctic regions, particularly the impact on sea mammals. When the surface of the seas between the Arctic and the surrounding continents freeze, sea mammals rely on the unfrozen pools of water scattered throughout the region for air. Land predators such as Polar bears travel across these ice masses to prey on these mammals as they surface for air. Unable to travel far from these pools in search of food, the mammals survive on their reserves of fat to sustain them until the ice breaks in the summer. In Antarctica, sea creatures are not threatened by land predators, but penguins must negotiate rough waves and preying seals as they leave and enter the sea during the reproduction season. Episode 5. 'Seasonal Seas' explores the temperate parts of the world where conditions change throughout the year. Looks at the role that sunlight plays in encouraging the production of plankton and seaweed, providing a rich source of food for fish and mammals. Explains how food becomes scarce during the winter as sunlight becomes dimmer and the water chills forcing fish to seek shelter and to survive on their reserves of fat. Turbulent waters during the winter stir up nutrients and replenish minerals providing the sea with an opportunity to renew itself. Episode 6. 'Coral Seas' looks at the perpetual struggle for space and survival in tropical seas. Explains how creatures forming reef communities become increasingly dependant on each other to protect and sustain their environment. Shows that coral polyps, far from being passive organisms, adopt aggressive behaviour when their space is invaded by another polyp, secreting enzymes which digest their rivals. Describes the sexual behaviour of coral which is synchronised with nature to maximise the chances of reproduction."
