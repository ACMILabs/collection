        "Eamon is a nerdish love-lorn 24-year-old virgin who lives with his mother and works for a dating agency. In love with a local girl who works in a funeral parlour, Eamon is depressed about his prospects of getting a date with her, given his dowdy physical appearance and bumbling nature. One night Eamon is picked up in a bar, and despite protection makes the girl pregnant. This leads to the discovery that Eamon has an unnaturally high sperm count which makes him an ideal donor for childless couples. Eamon's talent is soon turned into a thriving small business as he reaps in money from impregnating women all over Ireland, with the sanction of the Catholic Church. When Eamon manages to get lucky with the girl of his dreams, their future together is threatened by his past. The debut of director Dudi Applteon, \"The Most fertile men in Ireland\" is a mostly harmless comedy about love, sex, honour, parenthood and sperm. Cast includes: Kris Marshall, James Nesbitt, Bronagh Gallagher and Kathy Keira Clarke."
