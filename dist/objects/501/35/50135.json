        "'The Bill' is a UK police drama that explores both criminals and police. 'Waiting for Frank' (1996, produced by Mike Dormer, directed by Robert Del Maestro): some of Sunhill's C.I.D. police officers spin a tangled web playing the part of petty criminals at a dog racing track. The aim is to catch a man who thinks he's in luck, helping with a counterfeit money deal. 'Cast of shadows' (1998, produced by Michael Simpson, directed by Chris Lovett): an attempted abduction of a schoolgirl leads two C.I.D. officers to Manchester where they are on the trail of a protection racket. A surprise for everyone when the infamous Frank Burnside appears connected. Burnside, a former Sunhill officer is now on the wrong side of the law, or is he?"
