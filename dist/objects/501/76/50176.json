        "Based on Alex Raymond's newspaper feature \"Flash Gordon\" and the serial \"Flash Gordon's trip to Mars\", this condensed version of the serial provides a fascinating historical look into the sci-fi films of the past, minus all the special effects and computer animation of today's blockbuster sci-fi films. The story revolves around the universal theme of good vs evil, of enemy planets trying to destroy Earth. When strange unexplained phenomena start occuring on Earth, Flash Gordon (Larry \"Buster\" Crabbe), Dr Zarkov (Frank Shannon) and Dale Arden (Jean Rogers) jump to the rescue and take a space flight to Mars, crash-landing in the Valley of Desolation. There Flash runs into his old enemy Ming the Merciless of Planet Mongo, and Ming's ally, Queen Azura of Mars, whose attempts to destroy Earth with a deadly ray are eventually thwarted by Flash and his companions with the help of The Clay King and his Clay Men. Flash, Dale and Dr Zarkov return to Earth to a hero's welcome, ticker-tape parade and all. Cast also includes Charles Middleton, Beatrice Roberts, Donald Kerr, Richard Alexander. NB: \"Due to unique material contained herein, fluctuations may occur in picture and sound quality.\""
