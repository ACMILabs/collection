        "A dark but brilliantly realised adaptation of Henry James' gothic horror tale 'Turn of the Screw'. A 19th century British governess (Deborah Kerr) arrives at a bleak mansion to take care of the wealthy household's two children. Gradually, she begins to believe that there is a malevolent force in the children despite their beatific appearance. While Henry James' novel leaves little doubt that they have been possessed by the demonic souls of the previous governess and her valet lover, who had died on the estate after an illicit sadomasochistic relationship, the film entertains the possibility that the supernatural events experienced by the governess are merely the product of her vivid imagination. Clayton cleverly uses startling imagery and nerve-bending sound to terrify the audience. Through its use of decor and lighting, and the impressive performances of Kerr and Michael Redgrave as the uncle, the film effectively conveys a claustrophobic sense of repressed hysteria. Cast also includes Megs Jenkins, Pamela Franklin, Martin Stephens and Peter Wyngarde."
