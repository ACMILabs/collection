        "'The Bill' is a UK police drama that explores both criminals and police. 'In on the game' (1995, produced by Mike Dormer, directed by Pip Broughton): its the early hours of the morning and a car has suspiciously stopped. Two Sun Hill officers investigate. They find drugs, money, cards and razor wire - a sophisticated lady and her male companion end up in the cells. An undercover operation is in jeopardy and a keen young policeman is confused. 'Spill' (1996, produced by Chris Clough, directed by John Strickland): its action stations in this one hour special episode when a tanker overturns, causing a strange smelling liquid to pour out into the nighttime suburban streets. The appropriate police training comes into play as the area is cordoned off and the surrounds evacuated. Police work hand in hand with the fire brigade and ambulance officers. After the dramas die down it is up to Sun Hill to find the cause of the accident. The story becomes intriguing as the investigation leads them to the haulage company and the dead truck driver."
