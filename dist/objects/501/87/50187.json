        "This episode of \"Kimberley Cops\", a documentary series that relates the hardships and hazards for police stationed in isolated parts of Australia, focuses on the experiences of Hills Creek police officers. The rain season has arrived and we follow them as they travel to areas which will soon become inaccessible by road. The program captures the efforts of police to rectify past relations with Aboriginals in the area, particularly children, in developing mutual trust and respect."
