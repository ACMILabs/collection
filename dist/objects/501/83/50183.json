        "Things to come is the famous film adaptation of H.G. Wells' prophetic novel and futuristic exploration 'The Shape of Things to Come'. Wells' futuristic vision of impending global war (chillingly) begins at the outbreak of World War II in 1940. The film shifts to the mid 1960's to Everytown, a place in ruins ruled by a makeshift warlord on the brink of insanity. The film's closing act begins in 2036 Everytown, at a time of peace but also uninspiring technological Utopia. Run by scientists the townsfolk eventually resist the directives of the scientists and rebel against their imposed staid futuristic lifestyles. With extraordinary set designs by Vincent Korda. Cast includes Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson."
