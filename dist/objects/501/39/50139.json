    "description": [
        "Writer and presenter of this epic television series of fifteen episodes, Simon Schama - University Professor at Columbia University in New York, internationally acclaimed for his best-selling books including \"Citizens\" (1989), \"Landscape and memory\" (1995) and \"Rembrandt's eyes\" (1999) - manages to make what could be a dull and laborious story into a fascinating, informative and historical biography, enriching and expanding our knowledge of the history of Britain from circa 3100 BC through to the present day. Schama uses the art of story-telling, actual locations of historic importance, paintings, stills, artefacts and architecture, superb photography, vivid re-enactments and some of Britain's ancient and atmospheric landscapes in the production of this brilliant series. This video contains the following episodes: \"Beginnings\" (circa 3100 BC to 1000 AD) - Covers the 4000 years that precede the Battle of Hastings, including the Roman invasion, the building of Hadrian's Wall, King Alfred and Anglo-Saxon England. \"Conquest\" (circa 1000 to 1087) sees the end of Anglo-Saxon England by the Normans, the rise of Anglo-Norman England and King William's commissioning of the Domesday Book in 1066. \"Dynasty\" (circa 1087 to 1216) - Tells about the Angevin dynasty with Henry II bringing in a system of laws and civil service after the chaos and carnage of the Conquest. Also features two of Henry's sons, Richard the Lionheart and John, whose failure encouraged his Barons to publish the Magna Carta. \"Nations\" (circa 1216 to 1348) - Finds England at the centre of the Welsh, Scots and Irish nations search for identity and independence. Also follows the rise of Edward I as he leads England to war against these nations and begins to develop his own system of empire building. See: www.bbc.co.uk/history for more information on this series."
