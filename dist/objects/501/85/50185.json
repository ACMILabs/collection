        "Paul Morrisey's Blood for Dracula is an outrageous re-telling of the Nosferatu myth, combining a heady dose of sex, gore and comedy. Cult German actor Udo Kier plays the Count as a sickly anaemic aristocrat who can only drink the pure blood of virgin's in order to stay alive. His trusty assistant Renfield (Arno Juerging) suggest's that the Count pack up his coffin and move to Italy where families hold onto strict religious virtues, an ample enviroment for corruptible innocents. However Count Dracula begins to discover that the virgin maidens he encounters are not as pure as they say they are. To make matters worse, a young communist servant (Joe Dallesandro) begins to suspect that all is not right with the mysterious Count, paving the way for a titanic battle between the decadent upperclass and the proletariat worker. Cast includes Vittorio De Sica, Maxime McKendry, Milena Vukotic, Dominique Darel, Stefania Casini."
