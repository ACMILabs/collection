        "Himalaya is a story about the struggle between two men to hold power in a small village in Nepal. Tinle is the old chief who loses his son in the annual salt caravan. Tinle holds Karma responsible and refuses to allow him to lead the next expedition to sell salt to buy much needed grain to survive the coming winter. Karma has some support in the village and decides to leave four days before the date decided by the village elders. Tinle is furious and sets off with his own team including his daughter in-law, grandson and some other elders. The cinematography in this film is amazing, Barratier having previously been a photographer for \"National Geographic\"."
