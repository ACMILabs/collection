        "When T.S. (Jeremy London) arrives to pick up his girlfriend Brandi (Claire Forlani) for their planned vacation, she cancels their plans to be a contestant on her father's game show. Hurt by Brandi's rejection, T.S. visits her neighbour and his friend Brodie (Jason Lee), who also has just been dumped by his girlfriend Rene (Shannon Doherty). The two head to the mall in an attempt to console themselves. When they discover that Brandi's father's show is being recorded in the mall that very day, they enlist the help of troublemakers Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (director Kevin Smith) to stop the show. The sequel to Kevin Smith's hit film \"Clerks\", and the second film in his 'New Jersey' series. Cast also includes Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Renee Humphrey, Ethan Suplee and comic book tycoon Stan Lee."
