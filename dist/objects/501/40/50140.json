Also covers the Peasants Revolt, Richard II's attempts to quell the revolt, Henry Bolingbroke and the Wars of the Roses. \"Burning convictions\" (circa 1500 to 1558) - Sees Henry VIII assert himself as Head of the Church of England triggering the English Reformation and the demise of the Catholics. Edward VI and Elizabeth I lead the way for Protestantism and patriotism. \"The Body of the Queen\" (1558-1603) - Is about two queens, Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots and the rivalry for religious power between them. Intrigue, plots, the Spanish Armada and at the heart of it all, Elizabeth's dream of a \"great Britain\" see Elizabeth surviving and Mary executed.
