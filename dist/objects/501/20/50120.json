        "When maverick truck driver \"Bandit\" (Burt Reynolds) is approached by a father and son team at a Truck Rodeo, it sparks the beginning of a wild ride from Georgia to Texas. The challenge is for Bandit to drive from one state to the other, collect a truckload of Coors beer, and return with the precious load within 28 hours. The challenge has been laid before but never completed. The reward is $80,000, the danger lies in the fact that his actions qualify as bootlegging (taking beer across state lines without a permit is illegal). Bandit enlists the help of his buddy, \"The Snowman\" (Jerry Reed), while Bandit rides shotgun in a 1976 Black Trans Am - Bandit One. Before long a damsel in distress joins the small crew when Bandit picks up hitchhiking runaway bride Carrie (Sally Field). Carrie was supposed to be marrying Junior, and her future father-in-law, Sheriff Buford T Justice (Jackie Gleason), aka \"The Bandit\", is soon in pursuit of his son's intended. Whilst it didn't receive much critical success, this slice of 70s nostalgia is laden with silly and sexist one liners, impressive car chase sequences, a fondness for the culture of CB radios and an anti-authoritarian stance. Having said that, it also took $126+ million at the box office."
