        "Joe Dante's 'The Howling' is a witty and frightening update of the classic Universal Studio werewolf movies. Aided by a heavily referential screenplay by John Sayle's and Terrence Winkless, (adapted from the Gary Brandner novel) it pays equal amount homage as well as being a fresh reinvention of the genre. Dee Wallace plays Karen White, a feisty reporter on the trail of a serial killer (Robert Picardo). After a frightening confrontation with the killer which leaves him dead and her traumatized, Karen's doctor (Patrick Macnee) recommends her to take some time off. Under his advice Karen heads off to the 'The Colony', a secluded hideaway full of very strange residents harboring a terrifying secret. Joe Dante peppers the film with plenty of horror film references (many of the characters are named after Werewolf movie directors) and includes a slew of sly cameos like John Sayles and B-movie mogul Roger Corman. Cast includes John Carradine, Dennis Dugan, Christopher Stone, Belinda Balaski, Kevin, McCarthy, Slim Pickins and Elizabeth Brooks."
