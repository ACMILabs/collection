        "An explanation of how we can control our habits and make them serve us. Fred Jones realises his behaviour is a series of habits - some good, some bad. He would like to change some, like over-eating, but never bothered to try. The owl convinces him that if you want to, if you know how, and if you're willing to work at it, habits can be changed."
