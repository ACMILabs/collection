        "The preparation of a \"kitchen area\" in a winter wilderness camp is described in detail. Subsistence diets are not an automatic part of roughing it outdoors and here ways are shown of using nature's natural resources to aid in personal comfort. The preparation of fish and birds for the open fire is shown and the proper method of cooking over an open fire - slowly and turning the meat regularly."
