        "A children's odyssey, from the story by Holling C. Holling. A film about a little Indian in a canoe, hand-carved in the northern forest and, in the spring, launched towards the sea. There are many adventures, all photographed with great patience and an eye for the beauty of living things. The film gives vivid impressions of Canada's varied landscape and the life of its waterways. Commentary by Stanley Jackson. Awards: ten awards including Philadelphia; Oscar nomination, Hollywood."
