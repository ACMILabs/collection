        "Deals with a typical problem of young adolescents; teasing or ridicule which can be prolonged to the point of being damaging. The film considers the case of a girl student whose life is made miserable from the teasing by boys in her class. Teacher and students discuss the problem and suggest ways of overcoming teasing. The film deliberately omits providing a solution to the problem; the aim of the film is to stimulate students in arriving at their own conclusions."
