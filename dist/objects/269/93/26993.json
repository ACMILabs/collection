        "This is a film about the postwar New York art scene featuring interviews with de Kooning, Rauschenberg, Stella, Poons, Johns, Motherwell, Warhol and others. It was a scene that de Antonio knew intimately. In line with his oeuvre, de Antonio saw this film as political. It was made with enthusiasm for the artists and their art but also with an awareness of the contradictions: commodification involving a network of two or three thousand people - the painters, the collectors, the owners and the dealers - although this is no more than implicit in the film."
