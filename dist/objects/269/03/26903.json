        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". Documents the ideas of E.F. Schumacher, a British economist who is deeply concerned with dwindling fuel supplies, myths about modern technology, and the loss of human worth in 20th-century consumer production. Emphasises his idea that many modern machines use too much energy and that there is a need to develop an intermediate technology of machines that consume less energy. Commentary by Ian Holm."
