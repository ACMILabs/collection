        "This is the first of a series of films made in collaboration with Eliot O'Hara, distinguished American art teacher and artist. We see O'Hara painting the complete sketch, from blocking the composition in charcoal, applying water with a broad brush, until finally the artist has painted a bright picture that seems as \"wet\" as the harbour where it was painted, so naturalistic is O'Hara's technique. This is a \"how-to-do-it film\", the purpose of which is to demonstrate one particular artist's technique not to indicate critical principles or aesthetic standards."
