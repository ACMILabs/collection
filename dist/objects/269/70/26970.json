        "The owl and the lemming in this animated film are short-legged, plumply stuffed puppets made of seal skin by Inuit artists. The accompanying song and voices are in Inuktitut, although the legend is narrated in English. It is a story that all audiences, especially children, will enjoy. Moreover, it preserves on film an example of Inuit folklore they may in time disappear."
