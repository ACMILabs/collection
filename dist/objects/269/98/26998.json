        "In a series of watercolor demonstrations, Eliot O'Hara shows how to create impressions of crowds without defining individuals. He suggests various modes of interpretation - ways of capturing the patterns, colors, mood, and movement of crowds without details that might distract from the rhythm of a composition."
