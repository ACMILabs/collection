        "Episode of Series \"Life Around Us\". This film summarises the knowledge that scientists have gathered about the planets, covering such subjects as the seasonal changes on Mars, the atmosphere of Venus, the motion of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, the discoveries of Neptune and Pluto. Through computer animation, viewers are taken on a \"grand tour\" of the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) simulating a trip actually planned for an unmanned space ship in the late 1970s."
