        "North eastern Victoria, a land of rugged mountains and fertile valleys takes on a variety of aspects with changes in weather. As the winter snows melt, cattle are taken to graze on the lush plains of Mount Dargo and Bogong, under the supervision of the Soil Conservation Authority. The Kiewa hydro-electricity plant harnesses the waters of the mountain rivers. In winter it becomes a popular playground for ski enthusiasts."
