        "Richard McRoberts and Gary Kinnance begin the discussion with a brief survey of Albert Camus' life and philosophy to set a background for a fuller treatment of the book. Specific passages are used as springboards for the analysis and explication of Camus' themes. The meaning and place of \"The Outsiders\" as a piece of existential literature is discussed."
