        "Over 300 years old, the modern sport of trotting was established when the English stallion, Messenger, was imported into the U.S.A. in 1788. About the turn of the century, quality stock arrived in Australia and New Zealand. With skilful breeding, these trotters and pacers rank among the world's best. In this transformation into a trotter from birth, to breaking school, to racetrack debut, is followed. Filmed at Carlton Stud, Picton, N.S.W., and various Sydney trotting tracks. No narration."
