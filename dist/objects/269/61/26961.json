        "This film describes a less familiar application of Marshall Aid - visits to America by teams from many countries to study productivity. In Britain such teams are organised by the Anglo-Amnerican Productivity Council which, in 1950, assembled the team from Britain's hosiery industry and trade unions, whose tour of the United States, followed by the preparation of its report, is here recorded."
