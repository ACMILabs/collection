        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Critic and the Film\". Dilys Powell, a film critic of the London Sunday Times, analyses the editing of a series of sequences in the Ealing Studio's 1946 production of \"The Overlanders\", directed by Harry Watt. Using the cattle stampede sequences as an example, she shows how the editor obtains his effects by the selection of images and sounds, and points out that the order and length of the shots create a narrative rhythm especially suited to the subject matter of the sequence."
