        "A compilation of newsreel footage on the life of Nehru, late Prime Minister of India, who was known all over the world as a symbol of the blending of old and new India. Under his guidance, the country was transformed, and although holding great power he was always accessible to all people. He visited all parts of India and many countries of the world; in turn Delhi became a meeting place for world leaders due to Nehru's dynamic foreign policy and his belief in the goal of a peaceful world. A portrait of a man of charm, simple tastes and fine intellect who led India in times of strife and in a manner which earned the love and respect of millions."
