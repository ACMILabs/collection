        "The production of Malayan postage stamps in Britain. Working from a basic design selected in Malaya, British craftsmen prepare and print the perforated sheets of stamps. Intricate printing processes and skilled workmanship go into their creation. Locale sequences in Malaya reveal the relationships between the symbolic designs on the stamps and the landscape, industries and crafts of the country."
