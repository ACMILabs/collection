        "A documentary report on a people's flight to freedom and of the problems Hungarian escapees face in finding a new home and a new land. Shot in Austria by UN cameramen, the film contains scenes of actual escapes across the border. The film is a moving document, telling the story of a mother and two boys and their search for a new homeland. Powerful and dramatic use of music which was recorded in one of the ninety refugee camps in Austria and haunting images combine to capture the danger and the desperation faced by these people."
