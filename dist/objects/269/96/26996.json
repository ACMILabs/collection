        "Eliot O'Hara, American artist and teacher, presents his own technique of \"abstracting\" desired elements for a water-colour painting. He emphasises the careful arrangement of planes and colour in a unique pattern. The same subject - treated in the film \"Painting reflections in water\" is used to show how purpose influences choice and technique."
