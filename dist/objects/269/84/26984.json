        "A visual interpretation of Arthur Honneger's symphonic poem 'Pacific 231' originally written to accompany a silent film. The music was inspired by the thunderous power of a locomotive roaring through the quiet French countryside. The action of the film begins in a roadhouse in Paris as the engine is being prepared for its run. The natural sounds in the train yard gradually merge into Honneger's music which then provides the only commentary to the visuals. Throughout the film, shots of the locomotive, tracks, fleeting scenery and the patterns of moving pistons and wheels create abstract designs synchronised with the music. (Award: Prize for editing at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival)"
