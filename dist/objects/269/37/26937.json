        "Episode of Series \"Our Vanishing Wilderness\". Examines the controversies behind the 2 million gallon oil leak in the Santa Barbara Channel, off the coast of California in 1969. Shows how smog created by oil is killing pine trees high above sea level. The film asks why a society places such a high value on oil that it willingly endangers its own life. Based on the book \"Our Vanishing Wilderness\" by Mary Louise and Shelly Grossman and John Hamlet."
