        "An insight into the life of Constable Robert Darken of the Northern Territory Police Force. Every mid-summer, Constable Darken leaves home for a two to three month turn-around of his beat, several thousand square miles of rugged and barren country of the Territory. Here, he inspects cattle, water towers, mines, registers births and marriages, even acts as postmaster, duties which are a far cry from the usual conception of police duties."
