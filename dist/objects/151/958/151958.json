        "Trevor Larner first discovered the Victorian high country as a teenager. He initially wanted to get to the highest point, but then fell in love with the vegetation and beauty of the Alpine region. Eventually he started working there maintaining infrastructure, building ski lodges and repairing the huts of the early pioneers. When Trevor went back to visit in 2008, it felt like he was coming home."
