        "In 1939, Prime Minister Menzies announced that Britain was at war with Germany and that, as a result, Australia is at war with Germany. Joan Rossi talks about how she joined the army in 1941 and subsequent training, her work as a Syphon Officer, moving to Brisbane and tells of how she decoded the sinking of the ship Centaur. Post war, Joan still helped out at RAAF, helping other women find work before finding her own job and settling into post war life"
