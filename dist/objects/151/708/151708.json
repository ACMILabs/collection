        "Graham Shirley, Senior Curator at the National Film and Sound Archive, introduces and discusses these restored fragments from the famous and historically significant Australian silent film 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' (Charles Tait, 1906).  Lost to Australia and the world since the 1940s, these film fragments have been restored by the National Film and Sound Archive from footage discovered by chance - in various locations, including a rubbish tip - since 1976. This edition includes footage that was only rediscovered in the UK in 2006, and is the longest surviving section of the original film. The NFSA's restoration work has ensured that this valuable piece of Australia's film history can now be enjoyed in the closest possible form to the one seen by audiences a century ago.  Visit the NFSA website (www.nfsa.gov.au) for the full story of the film, its rediscovery and restoration."
