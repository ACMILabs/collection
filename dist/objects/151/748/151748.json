        "The story of the McGillivrays takes place in Gunbower on Saturday morning at the Gunbower Football Complex. This is a portrait of a family that has always worked the land, either as farmers or sheep shearers. They share their love of sports and concerns about the effects of the drought on small regional towns. All with a sense of humour and a never give up attitude that families need to survive in the current climate."
