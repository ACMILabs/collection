        "Pi and Bec are asked by Alex to design a game to appeal to girls. The game, 'Boyfriends' is about the tribulations of teenage romance. The trouble is Bec and Pi have very different ideas about what it means to be a girl. The game is a mess and when Mike tries to use it to bring his separated parents closer, everyone realises they've got a lot to learn about emotions and life. Stars Frances Wang as Bec, Damien Bodie as Ram, Cassandra Magrath as Pi, Paul Pantano as Marcello, Nikolai Nikolaeff as Mike and Nicki Wendt as Alex."
