        "This small rural Primary School of 26 students is at the heart of Nanneella and its residents. With a motto of 'A School and Community Together' the Primary School is an integral part of all town events and social gatherings. The students are engaging and fun young individuals with clear ideas and hopes for the future.  This film also features a performance from 'Power Wars', a musical piece that incorporates science and drama and won Nanneella Primary School the 2009 Archimedes Award."
