    "description": [
        "The 'Bush Mechanics' comprise a group of five young Warlpiri men from Yuendumu in the Northern Territory who can face any challenge when it comes to fixing cars, no matter what condition the car may be in! They will use the bush as a resource for spare parts and do whatever it takes to keep a car on the road. Their inventiveness, wonderfully offbeat humour and crazy antics, provide an insight into both contemporary and traditional Aboriginal culture. In the style of a road movie, the 'Bush Mechanics' series follows the men across the central desert, through their many mechanical mishaps, challenges and exploits. In Episode 4, these involve covering thousands of kilometres across the west to Broome to search for pearl shells for the rainmaker. The Bush Mechanics are: Simeon Jupurrula Ross, Steven Jupurrula Morton, Errol Jupurrula Nelson, Junior Jupurrula Wilson and Randall Jupurrula Wilson. Also features Jack Jakamurra Ross, and Francis Jupurrula Kelly. In English and Warlpiri with English subtitles."
