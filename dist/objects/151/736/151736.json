        "'The Great Outdoors' premiered on Australian TV in 1993, and recorded over 600 episodes. The program features a team of reporters who travel around Australia and overseas, reporting on travel destinations, tourist attractions and accommodation.  In this episode, Frankie J. Holden experiences hang gliding in Bright, and visits Bendigo's Shamrock Hotel, while Bridget Adams shows us how to holiday in Vanuatu. Anne-Maree Biggar tries her hand at cattle mustering in South Australia's Clare Valley, and Ernie Dingo explains the joys of visiting the top end during the wet season."
