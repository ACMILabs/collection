    "description": [
        "In this episode of the ABC's international current affairs program 'Foreign Correspondent', reporter Shane McLeod explores the current role and dealings of Bougainville secessionist leader, Francis Ona. One of the most volatile and reclusive figures in Papua New Guineas recent history, Francis Ona has re-emerged from his mountain hideaway. Ona is the man who created the secessionist Bougainville Revolutionary Army in 1989. In 2004 Ona claimed to have been made King of Bougainville in a coronation ceremony, and is now making another bid for political power. This time he comes armed with loudspeakers, not guns, but he still wants independence from Port Moresby. Episode 36 from Series 14 of Foreign Correspondent, first broadcast on 17th May, 2005."
