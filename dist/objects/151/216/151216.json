    "description": [
        "On 26th December 2004, a massive earthquake in the Indian Ocean caused the tsunamis that devastated many nearby coastal areas, with no area more profoundly affected than the province of Aceh in Indonesia. Over 150,000 people were killed, many of them school students, their parents and teachers, and many schools were partly, or completely destroyed. Governments all over the world offered money and aid, but even small organisations can have a big impact. The International Baccalaureate Organisation set up its 'schools to schools' program especially to connect schools in tsunami-affected regions with schools in Australia and other countries. This documentary shows how schools in Indonesia have started to pick up the pieces, and how the IBO is helping to rebuild."
