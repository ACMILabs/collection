        "Alex's valuable necklace goes missing at Catalyst and everyone is a suspect. Pi feels particularly that she needs to prove her innocence although Virgil's idea of helping by downloading Detective Stories from the Net is making things more difficult. When Marcello's little sister Sam is lost on the streets, the kids have two demanding cases on their hands. Stars Frances Wang as Bec, Damien Bodie as Ram, Cassandra Magrath as Pi, Paul Pantano as Marcello, Nikolai Nikolaeff as Mike and Nicki Wendt as Alex."
