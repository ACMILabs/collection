        "I love angels. They are very peaceful. When I look at an angel sitting at home with all its scars, it reminds me of all the people who have guided me. Clarissa Hall gives an open account of her life, from leaving school early, to the degrading sheltered workshops and, eventually, to becoming a Big Issue vendor. She talks about her battle with mental illness and recovery and her hopes for her future."
