    "description": [
        "These three short films explore aspects of the history of work in Australia, using contemporary documentary resources. They provide a fascinating study of some historically under-explored areas of labour history, including the participation of Aboriginal Australians, and the lot of Australian women in the workplace.  Open Channel productions have created these three short films from archival resources contributed by trade unions, Australian government departments, Screen Australia (formerly Film Australia), the National Film and Sound Archive, the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, and Cinesound/Movietone newsreels."
