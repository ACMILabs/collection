        "The ABC produced 1693 episodes of 'Bellbird' and the series ran for 10 years, until 1977. The series was a huge hit in rural and regional Australia because it dealt with the concerns of people living on the land and the dynamics of small country town life. Episode 205 was broadcast on 1 January 1967."
