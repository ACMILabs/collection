        "When Thomas Ladgrove started work at Brintons carpet factory in 1967, he was a ward of the state. He eventually started working with the loom and became the youngest weaver in Australia and England at age 18. He describes his work on the loom as well as staff morale when it became clear that Brintons was suffering, the subsequent rumours and worry and then the closure when the announcement to cease operations was made."
