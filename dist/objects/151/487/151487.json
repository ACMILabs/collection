        "A computer virus invades Catalyst and it's a fight against the clock to save Alex's game 'Trillin' and indeed, the whole of Catalyst. The kids are not at their best as there's friction between Mike and Bec. Bec believes he should have stood up for her when his friends made racist comments to her. No matter how much Mike apologises, the team is edgy. Stars Frances Wang as Bec, Damien Bodie as Ram, Cassandra Magrath as Pi, Paul Pantano as Marcello, Nikolai Nikolaeff as Mike and Nicki Wendt as Alex."
