    "description": [
        "The Culgoa Primary School closed its doors for the last time in December 2008, after over 100 years of service, due to the low student intake for the coming year. This film captures moments from a reunion organised to bring together students and teachers in celebration of times past. The town and its people are evidence of the strength and fragility of modern day living in small rural towns. The real, everyday struggles that farmers face and the heartbreaking decisions that families make, whether to stay and \u201ctough it out\u201d or move to a larger satellite town."
