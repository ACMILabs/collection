        "From bubble-wrap insulation to a Buddhist stupa, experience alternative living in Mt Best. Meet Dr Chalko and his environmentally sustainable house and see how he converted a freezer into a fridge that uses less power per hour than a light bulb uses per day. Michael and Mary moved to Mt Best to find peace and to live in harmony with their surrounds, in the process they built a Stupa and a labyrinth in their backyard and invite anyone who wishes to come and contemplate a moment of their time."
