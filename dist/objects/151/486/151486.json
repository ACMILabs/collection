        "When Virgil goes missing after confiding in Ram, it's obvious to the kids that Sunijim has somehow 'captured' him. Marcello sees this as a way to redeem himself in Alex's eyes and, with his friends' help, infiltrates Sunijim in an attempt to rescue Virgil from Brad Kane. When Marcello gets into difficulties, the team use all their computer skills to save Marcello and Virgil, reuniting the Crash Zone team. Stars Frances Wang as Bec, Damien Bodie as Ram, Cassandra Magrath as Pi, Paul Pantano as Marcello, Nikolai Nikolaeff as Mike and Nicki Wendt as Alex."
