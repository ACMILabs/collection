        "Nearly 19 years after he presented the first ever ABC TV nightly news bulletin (on 5th November, 1956) newsreader James Dibble presents the first ever ABC TV news bulletin in colour.  In this bulletin, the news includes coverage of a serious rail accident in the London underground, ongoing conflict in Cambodia, and French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. A young Jeff McMullen investigates the U.S. amnesty program for draft resisters and deserters; while Jim Revitt reports on the progress of Darwin's recovery following Cyclone Tracy."
