        "After the worst fires in Canberra's history in 2003, ABC TV gave four families small video cameras to record their lives after the fires.  Filmed by the families themselves, together with their friends, these short portraits of life in the months following this devastating event have now been edited into a moving one-hour documentary. Told from the families' own perspective, the film captures milestones as they work towards regaining a semblance of normality in their lives. Introduced by George Negus, this is a poignant story of paradise lost and paradise regained."
