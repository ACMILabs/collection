        "This film focuses on the young people of Maffra. Eight students from Maffra Secondary College were interviewed, representing all the year levels, and asked to talk about life in a regional town, their hopes for the future and issues that affect them and their world. The end result is a portrait of young rural Victorians who are thoughtful and engaging, with concerns about the environment, world politics and the survival of small towns."
