        "In 1994 park rangers in the Wollemi National Park, New South Wales, discovered a grove of ancient trees thought to have been extinct for 60 million years. The location of the thirty-eight adult trees, identified as a genus of the family Araucariaceae, has been kept a secret from all but a handful of people to protect them from sightseers and those who would collect seeds to sell on the black market. Three years later Cathy Johnson is the first and only journalist to have been to the site of the Wollemi pines - but not without having been blindfolded during the helicopter journey in and out. Broadcast on ABC-TV 10 July 1997 as part of the program 'Quantum' and produced with the assistance of NSW National Parks and Wildlife service."
