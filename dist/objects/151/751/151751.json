        "This film takes us on a tour of Colbinabbin and surrounds from the point of view of a number of locals. From the Old Cellar and Community Well to Chinaman's Bend and Marian's old family home that is covered in writings from the past, this story is full of historical facts and current realities. It also includes the story of the short-lived but successful Colbinabbin Tractor Pull and the once vibrant Lake Cooper which is now dry and has been for some years."
