        "Andrew Swift was raised in a small mining town in the foothills of the Victorian Alpine country. The more he learnt about the history of mining in the region, the more his interest in the remote areas of the Alps increased. Andrew's exploration of the area has unearthed evidence of the long forgotton gold mines and the stories of the people who worked there."
