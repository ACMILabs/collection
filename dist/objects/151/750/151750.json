        "This provocative short documentary combines a song written by JR Williams about the plight of the dairy farmer with images of farmers at work in the Gunbower region. JR was inspired to write this song in response to the pipeline development that is set to take water from the Campaspe area to Melbourne. The song is to inform people, especially those living in the city that farmers are doing it tough and that taking water away from regional towns is not a sustainable solution for the city\u2019s water shortage."
