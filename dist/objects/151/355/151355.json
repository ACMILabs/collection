        "The Australian accent has long been regarded as the most significant identifier of our cultural DNA and is arguably the most Australian thing about us. 'The Sounds of Aus' tells the story of the Australian accent, how it came about, how it has evolved over two hundred years of colonial and cultural history and how it is used in contemporary Australia. The accent reveals much about our identity, as individuals, as communities and as a nation. The Aussie accent has regularly been the battleground over which conflicts on identity have played out. Presented with dry irony by raconteur John Clarke, 'The Sounds of Aus' debunks many common myths about the accent as we hear from a wide range of experts, from dialect coach Victoria Mielewska, phonetician Dr Felicity Cox, Oxford Dictionary editor Bruce Moore, and historians Michael Cathcart and Joy Damousi, to actors, comedians, and media performers such as; Rachel Griffiths, Bert Newton, Denise Scott, Santo Cilauro, Akmal Saleh, Max Gillies, Barry Crocker, Mary-Anne Fahey, and film director Bruce Beresford."
