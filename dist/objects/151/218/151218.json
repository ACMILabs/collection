        "Before 'Underbelly' there was 'Blue Murder'. Part Two of the controversial ABC mini-series about police corruption and gangland criminal activity in 1980s Australia."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Based on the events that led to the Royal Commission on Police Corruption in New South Wales, 'Blue Murder' is a riveting and exceptionally well executed thriller about police corruption and gangland criminal activity in 1980s Australia. Richard Roxburgh is outstanding as Roger Rogerson, the larrikin police chief who built a lucrative 'alternative' career based on bribery, drug money and murder. Tony Martin is Neddy Smith, one of Australia's most notorious underworld thugs. Rogerson and Smith's activities are threatened when a young police officer, Michael Drury (Steve Bastoni), declines a bribe offered to him by Rogerson. From that moment on, 'Blue Murder' depicts how Drury's involvement in acting as an informer on Rogerson's activities led to increasingly desperate and murderous acts by both police and crims. Acclaimed internationally as a landmark television mini-series, 'Blue Murder' was for years unable to be screened in NSW or available for view on video in Australia due to elements of the story being seen as prejudicial to legal trials in NSW and Federal Courts. Cast also inlcudes Alex Dimitriades, Peter Phelps and John Hargreaves. First broadcast (outside NSW) September 21st, 1995."
