        "Canada runs the largest system of experimental farms in the world. The headquarters of this system is the Dominion Experimental Farm in Ottawa, whose staff of experts is shown at work. Experts in plant nutrition, soil research, food preservation, animal husbandry, cereal improvements and the use of farm machinery are seen at work. In brief scenes we are told something about the aims of the Cereal Division, where scientists are working to produce better grades of wheat. Experiments in poultry breeding to increase egg production, tests of different varieties of commercial seed, and the development of better breeds of livestock are among the activities shown in other divisions. Farmers visit the farm and are given practical demonstrations of improved methods."
