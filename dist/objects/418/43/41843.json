        "In the early 1970's, Barker made two powerful and disturbing short films which have never been seen before and provide important insights into Barker's creative process. \"Salome\", an 18 min. silent film with soundtrack was made in 1973, starring Anne Taylor, Graham Bickley, Clive Barker, Doug Bradley, Phil Rimmer, Lyn Darnell, Susan Bickley and Julie Blake. \"The Forbidden\", a 36 min. silent film with soundtrack was made between 1975-78 and provides glimpses into Hellraiser. It could almost be seen as Hellraiser's prologue, showing a \"puzzle-book\" and a skinning and flesh removal sequence. Starring Peter Atkins, Clive Barker, Doug Bradley, Phil Rimmer, Lyn Darnell and Julie Blake. This compilation includes the added bonus of selected interviews with Clive Barker and the casts."
