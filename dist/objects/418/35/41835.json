        "For the first time in Canadian dance history, eight of the country's leading dance companies gathered to perform on a single stage. The time, May 1981. The place, the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. The event, billed as the Canadian Dance Spectacular, offered a rich program of classical and jazz ballet, modern dance, gymnastics, pantomime and theatre. As well as recording this outstanding performance, Gala went backstage to capture the pre-performance jitters and post-performance elation. A film that showcases Canada's cultural heritage. Film without words."
