        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Dancing in the street: a rock and roll history\". In 'Hang onto yourself', this episode features an in-depth look at the many faces of David Bowie, particularly as the glam phenomena Ziggy Stardust. The rise of performers such as Alice Cooper, Lou Reed and Ziggy is seen as a response to the hangover from the summer of love where rock developed theatricality. The rise of Reggae and Punk music is the subject of the episode entitled 'No fun' and features clips and interviews with pivotal figures such as Malcolm McClaren, The Sex Pistols, Bob Marley and Talking Heads."
