        "A far-reaching, all embracing picture of the new China that few outsiders have seen in such close detail. For the Canadian film crew the magic name of Norman Bethune, China's hero doctor of the war years, opened many doors and ensured a smiling welcome. The result is an illuminating view of the people's republic of Mao Zedong, whose monuments dominate public halls and squares. In Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing and Shenyang, in streets, factories, homes and schools, wherever the film turns it witnesses the same selfless dedication to the cause."
