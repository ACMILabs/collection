        "This film deals with the mass-production of eggs for commercial marketing, and illustrates the technological devices used to speed up the output of eggs per day. Correct feeding and care of the hens in the laying houses, the gathering of eggs from both open and trap nests, the cooling and automatic handling, grading, cleaning, and packing of the eggs for the market are studied."
