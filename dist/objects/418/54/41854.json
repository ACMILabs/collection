        "Episode of Series \"Mr Men\". Mr Clever and all his friends from Mister Land are going on an adventure with a difference - a very special bus trip. This fully animated video tells the story of the day the Mister Men and Little Misses set off on an exciting Alphabet Hunting Trip. Along the way they discover something for every letter of the alphabet. There are apples, a cake, spaghetti and spinach, even a violin and a vase. All the favourite Mr Men and Little Misses join in the search. Based on the original Mr Men stories written by Roger Hargreaves this video provides an educationally sound introduction to the alphabet through an entertaining and lively story. Using the phonetic approach to learning the alphabet, this video is a perfect introduction to the abc for pre-school children."
