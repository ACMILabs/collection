        "A dramatisation of the early life and imprisonment of Nelson Mandela, made even more relevant since his release. Twenty five years ago in the bloody aftermath of the Sharpeville massacre, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was arrested, tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. His visionary struggle culminated in a worldwide crescendo of protest. A film of many dimensions, it is one of a yearning for justice and freedom not only of black South Africans, but of all peoples fighting injustice worldwide. Starring Danny Glover as Nelson Mandela and Alfre Woodard as Winnie Mandela. Co-starring John Matshikiza, Warren Clarke, Allan Corduner, Nathan Dambuza Mdledle and Julian Glover."
