        "Animator Aleksandar Marks is a master of several graphical styles. Philosophically, he feels at home in the world of Kafka, Camus, the Bauhaus, Kathe Kollwitz and German expressionism. His favourite topic is the increasing loneliness of human beings in the industrial society. This particular animated film tells the story of a small boy and an older man fishing together by a river. Later the boy catches a huge carp in a sweet shop where the fish proceeds to produce lots of sweets for the boy. Finally the boy floats away pulled along by a balloon. Animated by Alexsandar Marks and Vladimir Jutrisa."
