        "This American assessment of Australia gives special attention to our migrant programme and the subtle ways immigrants are changing Australia's way of life. The question of the White Australia Policy, the contrasts of great cities and desolate interior, and to the arts and sports. Australia as it appears to a newcomer is seen through the impressions of a migrant girl in her unrehearsed discussions with her Australian boyfriend. Film includes interviews with swimming coach Don Talbot, filmmaker Tim Burstall."
