        "Samantha is a young Victorian woman suffering from schizophrenia and the stigma associated with the condition. Her courage and determination to emerge from the dark tunnel of her illness is apparent by the way she discusses her experiences. Schizophrenia affects 27% of Australian families and Samantha's revealing and honest story does much to dispel the many misconceptions society has about the illness and is a testimony to her extraordinary strength and courage."
