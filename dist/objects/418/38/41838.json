        "Filmed on location in Australia, New Zealand, Venezuela, Scotland and Italy, Tom Gleisner and Rob Sitch allow their passion for fly fishing to take them around the world, visiting some of the most remote and beautiful waterways. Using a variety of transportation methods including vespa and post van, the two fishermen are determined to catch their dinner and cook it in the local style. \"A River somewhere\" is a viewing treat and with the wry wit and humour of Sitch and Gleisner, the program is both entertaining and visually breathtaking."
