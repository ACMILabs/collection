        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Dancing in the street: a rock and roll history\". The Blues crosses the Atlantic and reaches Britain where it finds a new direction. Groups like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones invade America and somewhere in the process Heavy Metal is invented. In this episode entitled 'Crossroads', interviews and performances by legendary musicians such as The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck are featured. In the second program 'Eight miles high' the whole phenomenon of Psychadelia is explored, including interviews and clips from The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin and Pink Floyd. This episode captures a landmark era in the development of rock music in the 1960's."
