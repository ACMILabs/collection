        "The program was produced to mark the centenary of Menzies' birth and traces his political career and the changes which occured in Australia during his long leadership. The presentation uses archival material, personal home movies and photographs as well as newsreel and television footage spanning from the 1930's to his death in 1978. A fascinating tribute to Australia's longest serving Prime Minister."
