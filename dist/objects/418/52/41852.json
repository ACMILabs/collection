        "Narrated by Jonathan Kydd and illustrated by Stephen Cartwright these are animated stories about dragons, witches and giants. Dragons - depicting stories of legendary dragon slayers and adventurous Knights, this section tells children all they could want to know about Dragons their history and the 'old wives' tales surrounding them. Witches - long ago, people thought witches were horrid old women who wore black clothes and put bad spells on them. This section tells children about the good witches as well as the bad, their helpers - the imps, as well as sayings and customs about them. Giants - There are many stories about giants, some good and some bad, dating back as far as history itself. With giants such as Atlas, Norwegian Trolls, Desert Sand Giants and Jordan the Swiss Giant, this section is full of fascinating information about the world's largest people."
