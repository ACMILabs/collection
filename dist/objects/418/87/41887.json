        "Considered to be one of the most important anti-war films ever made, Abel Gance's 1939 film is a remake of his original 1919 silent film. With the prospect of World War 2 imminent, gabel reconstructed his original to challenge the world. Jean Diaz is a research scientist who dedicates his life to ending war. When he discovers that his work is being exploited by the military, he summons up the ghosts of the war dead to make the world come to its senses."
