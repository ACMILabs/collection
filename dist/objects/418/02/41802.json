        "Georgina Oliphant commissions her friend Lily to create a sculpture for a new wing at the National Gallery. Her father sees it as an opportunity for a healthy tax deduction. Karl Heinz, who is chosen as the model for the sculpture, sees it as a chance to buy a cottage in Handover. His wife Celia, who is heavily involved in a New Age religious group, isn't so thrilled. Everyone wants something but who will ultimately win? The film twists and turns towards its hilarious conclusion. Nominated for Best Director in the 1996 AFI Awards, \"Lust and Revenge\" is a biting satire on the arts world and the financial imperatives driving it. However, the most powerful element of the film is the development of the characters as they are drawn into this Machiavillian power game. Look out for some wonderful cameo roles, particularly from Wendy Hughes and John Hargreaves."
