        "An examination of some of this Century's significant acts of censorship. The emphasis of the program is how film has been manipulated to support political propaganda including Nazi Germany, the Vietnamese Conflict, during Stalin's reign in the Soviet Union and the anti-communist trials in the United States. This is an invaluable program for showing how history and the media can conspire to make the process of seeking the truth more difficult."
