        "One of a series in which Dr William Glasser presents a problem solving approach for individuals in therapeutic situations and which can be applied to discipline in schools. Glasser combines his discussion of the Schools Without Failure concepts, and examines the ways in which motivation can be encouraged - laughter and fun, and the importance of self expression give a child recognition that will motivate him to work. Suitable for tertiary level and teachers."
