        "This program explores the controversial issue of euthanasia and probes the ethical issues involved when terminally ill loved ones ask a physician or family member for assistance in ending their life. It profiles individuals who want to end their pain through suicide, as well as others who seek pain relief through medication - or through programs which will allow them to die with dignity. This documentary invites us all to examine more closely conceptions of personal rights and responsibilities."
