        "A unique exploration of the most incredible natural wonder on earth, Australia's greatest living treasure, the Great Barrier Reef featuring both the microscopic and majestic creatures of the undersea world - giant whale sharks, ferocious moray eels, soaring manta rays, reef sharks and hatchling turtles. It reveals the beauty and behaviour of tiny reef creatures filmed in intimate detail; the clownfish, poisonous anemones, blind shrimps, goby, farming damsel fish and the bizzare sexual rituals of sea slugs. The climax is the incredible phenomena of mass coral spawning as the reef erupts in a frenzy of creation. Over 24 hours we experience the natural daily rhythm of the reef, from the quiet dappled dawn, the frenzied afternoon feeding, to the slow creeping danger of evening and the surreal beauty of the reef at night."
