        "Episode of Series \"Goosebumps\". Based on the book by R.L.Stines. While visiting London, Sue and her brother Eddie, are out on their own for the day while their parents attend a business conference. At first bored, they are delighted when their bus stops at Terror Tower. But the fun turns to fright when the kids see the wax statues in the Tower's torture chamber moving as if they are real....and ghostly images start calling out warnings to them. Suddenly, Sue and Eddie are running for their lives as they travel back in time to the Middle Ages to escape the dark fate of Terror Tower."
