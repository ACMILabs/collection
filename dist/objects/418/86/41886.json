        "'Une Affaire de Femmes' has been hailed as one of Chabrol's finest films. Based on the true story of Marie-Louise Giraud, a wartime mother and abortionist. Since the age of fourteen, Marie has been married to Paul, and has been a devoted and dedicated wife. When Paul returns from the war, he finds that life has changed. Marie-Louise has kept the home and family together and has plenty of money from her illegal business. She decides she no longer needs or wants Paul. The film exposes hypocrisy in its political and personal manifestations. Isabelle Huppert and Francois Cluzet star in this film which won an award for Huppert at the Venice Film festival and which was voted best film at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 1989. Cast also includes: Marie Trintignant, Nils Tavernier"
