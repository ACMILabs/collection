        "This film explodes some of the myths that provide the foundation for homophobia. It offers insight into the world of several gay and lesbian youth and looks at the people in their lives, identifying some of the difficulties gay youth face. The film attempts to break the damaging silence surrounding sexual orientation and sexual differences."
