        "Gerry Conlon, a petty crook in Belfast during the 1970's, gets in trouble with the IRA. His father sends him to England where a twist of fate puts him in the wrong place at the wrong time when a pub in Guildford is bombed. Gerry and three of his friends, although innocent, are charged and convicted. Gerry's father joins him in prison and despite years of a strained relationship, Gerry learns to regard his father's gentle spirit as a strength. Enlisting the aid of a lawyer, Guiseppe Conlon is determined to prove his son's innocence, and when he dies in prison, Gerry is determined to take up the cause. Evidence is discovered which implicates senior police officials in a massive cover-up, and the 'Guildford Four' are finally set free. Daniel Day-Lewis, Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson are brilliant in their roles."
