        "A delightful animation without narration about a group of happy vacationers who are lounging on a beach enjoying a lazy afternoon, but under cloudy skies things soon take a disturbing turn. This was the first animation by Tali who won the contest Cineastes Recherches du Studio d'Animation du Programme Francais de l'ONF in 1994."
