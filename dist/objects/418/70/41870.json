        "Within the great eucalypt forests of Australia, the unexpected story of wild koalas unfolds to reveal astonishing facts about koala behaviour that shatter the misconception that they only sleep and eat gumleaves. The secret lives of wild koalas are full of drama, adventure and danger as we intimately watch a group engaging in strategic espionage, violent battles and daring love quests. Predatory pythons, savage dog packs and housing developments threaten wild koalas and we are introduced to a passionate biologist and a koala carer who are fighting to rescue these remarkable animals. Awarded the 1st Prize International Wildlife Film Festival 1997 - Environmental Category (France) and the Gold Camera Award U.S. International Film and Video Festival 1997 - Documentary (USA)."
