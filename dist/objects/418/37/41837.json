        "Peace in the rainforest is disrupted when two chameleons get \"stuck\" in a conflict, with catastrophic results. Luckily for the lizards, a frog observing the fracas turns into exactly what they need...(no, not a prince)...a mediator. \"Dinner for two\" tackles conflict in lively, humorous and provocative ways. It shows that amidst the chaos that differences create, there are still paths to reconcilliation. This animated film without words is designed as a flexible tool to explore conflict resolution. Young children to senior executives can identify with the characters, and gain an insight into how to deal creatively with conflict and anger at school, at home, in the workplace and in their communities."
