        "Screenplay written by Harold Pinter. In a shabby seaside English boarding house, a man's inability to cope with his fears and guilt comes to the surface. At first, in typical Pinter style, the conversation is trivial and banal but deepens and erupts from the commonplace and comic into terror. Stars Robert Shaw, Patrick Magee and Dandy Nichols."
