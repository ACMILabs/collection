        "The coati (or coatimundi) is a small Central and South American animal related to the raccoon, and rather like an Australian opossum, but with a very much longer nose. In this film, two baby coatis, because of their inquisitiveness, get into all sorts of mischief in a scientists' camp in Mexico; coatis are quite fearless, and make good pets."
