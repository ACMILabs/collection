        "An unemployed man is offered work as a bill-sticker provided he has his own bicycle. After retrieving his bicycle from the pawnbroker, it is stolen on the very first day of the job and he spends a day with his small son, desperately trying to find it. Hollywood offered to finance De Sica's film, but he refused as he wanted to use non-actors in real settings. 'The Bicycle thieves' is an important film which explores the dignity of the ordinary person. It's simplicity and underlying social criticism are part of its wide appeal."
