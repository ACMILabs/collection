        "Although the art of tracking is diminishing worldwide, the skill survives and traditionalists are making efforts to revive it. There are pockets of indigenous people who still rely on their skills to hunt animals for their livelihood. Amongst the Aborigines of arid Australia, the Kalahari Bushmen of Africa and the Inuit of the Arctic, the ability to read the earth survives. This program examines the skills of these people from vastly different environments and is the story of the skill not the kill; the story of \"nature detectives\". Awarded the Certificate for creative excellence, USA International Film and Video Festival 1997."
