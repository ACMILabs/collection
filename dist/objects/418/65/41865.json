        "This post-industrial version of the famous fariytale is given a Kafkaesque feel. Employing pixillation techniques which combine human, model and plasticine forms, the directors create a unique visual style. Leading a bleak existence in a nightmare city, a poor childless couple is suddenly and bloodily blessed with a tiny boy. their joy is short-lived for the Ministry of Sinistry agents kidnap Tom and whisk him off to the laboratory of a thousand terrors, a centre of terrifying and sadistic experiments. In this netherworld of pain, Tom finds himself among bizarre creatures, part fur, feather, bane and flesh. To escape is fraught with danger, but to stay is fatal. Technically flawless in the evocation of its grim and apocalyptic world, this film fuses its many influences, from the Quay Brothers and Svankmajer, to the short films of Starewicz, into a superbly integrated and coherent vision of evil and innocence. WARNING: Not suitable for children as some scenes may disturb some viewers."
