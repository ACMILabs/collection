        "This short film is about telecommunications, silicon technology, and the E-phone and Bell's role in its development. The E-phone is the world's first fully electronic telephone. Chips utilized in it were designed by Bell Northern Research in Ottawa. Northern Telecom makes 256 phones an hour, on one production line alone. As Canada changes, the telephone changes with it and this film includes historical glimpses with a montage of shots from a telephone museum."
