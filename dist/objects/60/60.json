        "LDTV, refers to the artist's term for 'low definition television'. This work is a collection of television fragments videotaped directly from the TV screen in an array of countries in which Asher has travelled. On the one hand LDTV reflects the nomadic character of Asher's work, but at the same time it reproduces the effect of a satellite fixed in space, giving unlimited access to a homogenised world. With vitality and humor, LDTV traces the speed at which Western culture is transmitted globally."
