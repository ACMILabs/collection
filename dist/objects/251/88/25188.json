        "In skiing, the beginner is wise to learn the right technique at the outset so that he has nothing to unlearn. This film shows the best techniques, as recommended by the Canadian Ski Instructors' Alliance and the Canadian Amateur Ski Association. Every movement is clearly demonstrated in action and, where necessary, in slow-motion."
