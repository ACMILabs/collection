        "Episode of Series \"This Modern Age\". For more than 200 years cotton, grown on the other side of the world, has been coming to Britain to be spun and woven. A moist climate, money for the development of mills, and inventors whose machines taught mass-production to the world - Lancashire had all these. But today one-third of Lancashire's spindles and looms are idle. The memory of past booms and slumps has resulted in a grave shortage of operators. Schemes to improve working conditions and wages have been put into operation."
