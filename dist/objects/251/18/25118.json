        "This film is an extract from the film directed by Alexander Mackendrick which includes stars such as Alec Guinness, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, Peter Sellers, Frankie Howerd and others. The Professor (Alec Guiness) is making a last minute check on the bank's procedure for transferring money while the rest of the gang are still at Mrs. Wilberforce's keeping up the pretence that they are musicians at rehearsal...then working with military precision and split-second timing the gang successfully effect the robbery."
