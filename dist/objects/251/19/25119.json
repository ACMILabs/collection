        "Tells the story of a boy convicted as a pick- pocket in London in 1792 and transported to Botany Bay for seven years. Consists entirely of graphics from the period using sepia-tint photographs and contemporary ballads and suggests that a convict in Australia was better off than a coal miner in England, at least up to 1836. Historical adviser, A.T. Yarwood. Voices by John Krummel, Norman Hodges, Alan Edwards. Written by John and Henrietta Clark and filmed by George Pashuk."
