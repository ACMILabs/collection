        "This documentary concerns the struggle of rural people in the Third World. The film takes us into the rural communities of Senegal, Kenya, Mauritius, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, where foreign and local aid programs, combined with imaginative community projects, initiate small but significant changes. The brilliance of local dress, the traditional songs and dances, and the beautiful green images fail to mask the very real difficulty of finding a day's food."
