        "Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of Radiation: this is the laser, the new wonder tool that can bore holes in steel, perform delicate eye operations and carry thousands of simultaneous telephone conversations and television channels. Communications with men on the moon may well be by means of a laser beam, and there is speculation about their use as \"death rays\" to bring down missiles in flight."
