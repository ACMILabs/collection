        "This film follows the progress of a Chinese pilgrim through the blessed land of Bihar, \"The Land of Englightenment\", which was once the centre of learning and worship for students of Central Asia, China, Burma and Ceylon; the land where Buddha was born. Every pillar, arch and relic from Sarnath, Sonapur and Patna, Nalanda and Vaishali, Pavapuri, and Bodh Gaya to Rajgir, speak of the message of Sakyamuni to the devout pilgrim."
