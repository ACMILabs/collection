        "A thriving industry in Western Australia is the production of lambs for the meat export trade. These lambs, which are slaughtered at 16 weeks, are specially bred for the purpose. They are yarded and sent to Fremantle. Great care is taken to prevent injury. After slaughtering, the carcases are carefully inspected, then graded and passed through various processes until they reach the freezing chamber. From there they are taken as expeditiously as possible to the ships which transport them to the United Kingdom, USA, Canada and Hong Kong."
