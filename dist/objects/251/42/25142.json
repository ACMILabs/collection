        "Episode of Series \"Watch Your Language\". Intended primarily to emphasise the diversity and complexity of language in the life of a 12-year-old. This film focuses on two 12-year-olds who are involved in a school language project. Shows their interaction with a sufficient number of significant people in their lives for us to gain an impression of how the demands upon their speech shift. Suitable for upper secondary level."
