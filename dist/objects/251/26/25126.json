        "Records the use of aircraft as an aid to farming in the hill country in New Zealand. From the early days when pilots made hazardous trips in old air force planes - landing and taking off from any strip of paddock, aerial topdressing has today developed into a well organised industry restoring dangerously eroded hill country. Planes are now used extensively for other farm work such as spraying and rabbit poisoning."
