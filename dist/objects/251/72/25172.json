        "Conflict is inevitable in life and each individual must give up some of their freedom in order to live peaceably in proximity with others. This film looks at some of the origins of law in earlier cultures, their mode of enforcement, and examines also a range of human actions subject to social censure - from abuses of custom to serious criminal offences."
