        "The major increases in food productin required to feed a rapidly increasing world population must come from raising crop yields on existing cultivated land, although much of the world's land has become exhausted by endless use. This land can be made fertile again provided that there is sufficient moisture and by the introduction of the right balance of nutrients, such as that provided by chemical fertilisers."
