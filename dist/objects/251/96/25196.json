        "Pictures the activities of a modern girls' school for 900 pupils, one feature of which is the provision of ample opportunities for social development. Each student is encouraged to develop her own interests and to find a goal before leaving school. The film shows learning by informal methods of class discussion and dramatisation. Re-enacts the entire school life of three senior girls, illustrating how in kindergarten they began to live and work together and how, as they grew older, each developed her own particular interests and abilities as a result of social learning - of doing things together."
