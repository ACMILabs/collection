        "This film tells of an operation in the United States to dispose of solid waste with a minimum of danger to the environment and people. Refuse is transported to a site away from the cities where several large steep gullies have been excavated for the purpose of holding the waste material. When filled with refuse, the gullies are covered avoiding infestation by flies, rats and seagulls."
