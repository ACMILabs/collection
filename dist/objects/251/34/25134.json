        "Dakar, the capital city of the West African country of Senegal, is a magnet for thousands of farmers who flock into town and then cannot find work. The country has a one-crop economy - but peanuts are particularly vulnerable to market price fluctuations, so the Government of Senegal has asked for United Nations help in diversifying agriculture and training a new class of craftsmen and skilled cultivators."
