        "The Yalumba Winery in the Barossa Valley, South Australia. Aboriginal legends of a sleeping giant surround the country where Samuel Smith planted the first vines in 1849. His descendants now own a large modern winery in Anguston. Many varieties of grapes are harvested, and the whole process of making, blending and bottling the various wines and spirits is shown. Scientific tests are carried out throughout and the brandies are subject to Government inspection. Narrated by Charles \"Bud\" Tingwell."
