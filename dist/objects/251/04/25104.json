        "Travelogue on Kyushu, the southern-most of Japan's four main islands. While drawing brief attention to Japan's expanding industrial capacity and intensive agricultural practices, the film is designed with the purpose of encouraging western tourists. Thus, it catalogues a wealth of familiar recreational pursuits, eg golf; the medicinal benefits of the numerous thermal springs and the exotic charm of Hakkata porcelain."
