        "Episode of Series \"21st Century\". The laser is a revolutionary invention which produces a useful form of light. The light we usually see is a combination of many frequencies, directions and phases. The laser however, produces coherent light; that is, all the light waves travel simultaneously in exactly the same direction and at exactly the same frequency. One day, laser light may have as many uses as electricity does today. Reporter: Walter Cronkite."
