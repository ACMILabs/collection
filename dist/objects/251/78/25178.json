        "Filmed in various locations throughout England and Wales, this documentary shows real barristers and solicitors in their chambers and offices and in the Inns of Court. There are no actors. Ninety practising lawyers (necessarily anonymous) make frank comments as the film shows how the two branches of their profession work. The solicitors are seen as forming the greater part of the profession and doing all the legal business which does not reach the courts. Only barristers may appear in Court and they may not refuse a brief."
