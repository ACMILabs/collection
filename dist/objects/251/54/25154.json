        "Describes the contribution of Dr Arthur Schawlow, head of the Department of Physics at Stanford University to the development of the ruby laser. An electronic organ coupled to an oscilloscope helps show why getting light \"in step\" is so difficult. A working model of atoms demonstrates how ordinary light is produced and how laser light is generated and controlled."
