        "Episode of Series \"Psychology\". In an analysis of the learning process, this film demonstrates that the learning of a skill by any organism involves two basic and integrated processes: discrimination between stimuli and application of this discrimination in the making of selected responses. Laboratory experiments with pigeons are used in the demonstration."
