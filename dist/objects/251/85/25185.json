        "Colonel Hyde, retired from the Army, launches a new company \"Cooperative Removals\" dedicated to helping ex-servicemen adjust themselves to civilian life. He recruited seven men into the \"league of Gentlemen\" who carried out his master-plan. Shows how they succeeded in relieving the Army of enough arms for their purposes. The final robbery required detailed planning, coordination of forces and split-second timing. The group retired one million pounds richer, but they made mistakes and the police finally closed around them. Cast includes Jack Hawkins, Nigel Patrick, Roger Livesey, Richard Attenborough, Bryan Forbes and Keiron More. For film studies students."
