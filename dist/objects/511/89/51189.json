        "Late sixties comedy about two young heterosexual men who pretend to be a gay couple in order to dodge the draft. Although the Army rejects the two, the recruiting officer questions their story and they are forced to move together into an all-gay L.A. apartment complex to add weight to their lie. Humour revolves around the comedy of misunderstandings that ensue involving the stereotypically 'campy' residents of the apartment complex. Though based on a homophobic premise, and aimed at a straight audience, the film is of interest as a naive camp curiosity and contains a few genuinely funny moments (and many unintentional ones). Along with \"Boys in the Band\" this was one of the only American 1960s mainstream films to feature homosexual characters. Cast includes Kevin Coughlin and Larry Casey."
