        "Two successful writers--a promiscuous heterosexual novelist and a brooding lesbian sex therapist--are assigned a cabin together on a writer's retreat for women. The two women are total opposites and argue constantly about their different philosophical and sexual orientations. Yet underlying their animosity is a growing sexual tension which, after much angst and rhetoric is finally consummated. Overly earnest in its intellectual attempts to explore female sexuality, \"Claire of the moon\" fails to engage the viewer on an emotional level. The long-awaited 'climatic' sex scene at the film's conclusion only partially makes up for the tiresome talk-fest that precedes it. Cast includes Trisha Todd and Karen Trumbo."
