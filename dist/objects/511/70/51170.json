        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Empires\". Part one of a three part series about Egypt's \"Golden Empire\". In 1560 BC Egypt was in crisis, occupied and divided and on the verge of extinction. To the north, the Hyksos tribes had invaded and claimed the delta around Avaris, and in the south, the Nubians were threatening the Egyptian borders. Two warriors - Theban Princes, Ahmose and Kamose, avenged their father's death by leading Egypt back to a united place of power and influence in the region. After Ahmose's death two decades later, Hatshepsut became the first female Pharaoh to rule Egypt, thus creating an environment of freedom for women to be involved in commerce and other aspects of public life. Her son Thutmose III eventually became Pharaoh after his mother's death and when faced with new threats to his kingdom from a group of Middle Eastern princes, Thutmose III waged war at Megiddo and went on to strengthen and extend his regional influence, bringing much of the ancient world under Egyptian rule to become the first true \"empire\". Features artworks, sculptures, architecture and re-enactments, along with commentary by historians and academics. Also includes Teacher notes. Narrated by Keith David. Suitable for secondary school level."
