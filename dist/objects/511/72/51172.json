        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Empires\". Final part in the three part series about Egypt's \"Golden Empire\". \"For over 3,000 years Egypt was ruled by Pharaohs...one Pharaoh stood out. He reigned for 67 years...his name was Ramses.\" Tutankhamen died without an heir and so began a period of uncertainty for Egypt. A new enemy emerged from the north, the Hittites from modern day Turkey. It was imperative that the richest and most powerful nation in the world find a new pharaoh, and so it was that Ramses II, commoner by birth, but with a military background, won his place on the throne (he was only 15 years of age). Five years later Ramses II went to battle with the Hittites and more by luck than military prowess, he managed to snatch victory from near defeat. Through a well managed propaganda campaign, Ramses II was able to rewrite history with himself the god-like hero. Upon a peace treaty being signed with the Hittites, Ramses II then focused on his life after death. He turned two mountains into temples - one for his wife Nefertari and one for himself. A new capital for a new regime was created, and a temple called The House of Life became the intellectual centre for the empire - or in reality a Ministry of Propaganda for the Pharaoh. Ramses II died at the age of 93 in 1213 BC and with his death, Egypt's empire once again faced invasion - this time from the north by the \"Sea People.\" Combined with a gradual crumbling of the eastern states alliance, Egypt's empire eventually collapsed. The great tombs of the Pharaohs were systematically looted and civil war ensued. It was finally up to the priests of Karnak to re-inter the bodies of the past kings in caves in the surrounding mountainside. Features artworks, architecture and re-enactments, along with commentary by historians and academics. Also includes Teacher notes. Narrated by David Keith. Suitable for secondary school level."
