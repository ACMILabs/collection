        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Empires\". Part two of a three part series about Egypt's \"Golden Empire.\" Egypt's empire continued to strengthen over the century but change was about to take place. Military rule was to be replaced by diplomacy as a means of maintaining power. In 1391 BC Amenhotep III came to power, his reign spanning a period of peace and wealth and a whole new attitude. By using diplomacy Amenhotep III earned the respect of neighbouring rulers but when he died in 1352 BC, his son and successor, Amenhotep IV (who later changed his name to Akhenaton) was to completely transform the religious and artistic traditions of his father's reign. Akhenaton created his own religion that proclaimed Aton, the visible sun, to be the only god and himself the only priest. In his monotheist belief, Akhenaton even went so far as to develop a new capital in the desert, abandoning Thebes in order to eradicate his father's past. He married the beautiful Nefertiti, and along with their six daughters, proceeded to have what was almost considered a normal family life. Upon his death in 1336 BC however, his people returned back to Thebes and the traditions of previous times. Tutankhamen, Akhenaton's son from one of his minor wives, at the age of nine inherited the declining empire and became the puppet of powerful priests and military leaders. His early death at the age of nineteen marked the end of the Ahmose dynasty. Features artworks, sculptures, architecture and re-enactments, along with commentary by historians and academics. Also includes Teacher notes. Narrated by Keith David. Suitable for secondary school level."
