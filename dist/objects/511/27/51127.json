        "After witnessing the landing of a flying saucer, a young boy finds his parents changed and alien in their behaviour. This film's cult status is based on the art direction by director-designer Menzies who designed the sets to enhance events as seen through the boy's eyes. A long expository dialogue-bound scene and the producer's insistence on inserting stock footage of army manoeuvres weakened Menzies' concept. This is the full-length version with the original ending that was cut from the version previously released in Australia. Menzies' film was the first of the alien invaders genre to be made in colour. It was originally intended to be a 3-D release but the idea was dropped before production began."
