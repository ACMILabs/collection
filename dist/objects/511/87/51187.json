        "There's a garbage war going on between private contractors with swish automated machines and local council workers - the automated vehicles cut out the work of the middleman who collects the bin manually. Two such middlemen are Steve and Neill, dedicated waste disposal workers on the garbage truck named \"Garbo\". The comraderie of council garbage collectors is evident as the automated Sanicleanse workers have the support of police, who turn a blind eye to such shenanigans as the theft of Christmas presents left out by thoughtful clients. Plot twists include the theft of the truck and a seaside holiday with the shrewish, overbearing, agoraphobic Freda after Steve mishears a woman he helps out at work talking on the phone inviting her friend on a holiday. This love interest proves to be the local copper's daughter and to complicate matters Steve hasn't been honest about his profession. Written by Stephen Kearney and Neill Gladwin (Los Trios Ringbarkus), \"Garbo\" is an amusing if inconsequential lightweight comedy. Cast also includes: Max Cullen, Simon Chilvers, Gerard Kennedy, Moya O'Sullivan, Imogen Annesley, Michael Veitch, John Brumpton."
