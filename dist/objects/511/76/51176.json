        "Two short American films about adolescent homosexual experiences. In \"Pool days\" (prod/dir: Brian Sloan), a young man begins work at a neighbourhood pool and dormant gay feelings are stirred being around nude, attractive men. In \"The Dead Boys Club\" (prod: Mary Weisgerber, dir: Michael Christopher) a young man goes to visit his cousin, whose lover has died from AIDS. When the young man puts on the dead man's shoes he is transported into the disco era of the 1970s where sex and relationships were free of the fear of disease. These two films are light and joyous celebrations of queer life."
