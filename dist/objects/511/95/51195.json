        "Using real interviews and mock footage, this short film explores the issue of unwanted pregnancy with a slight slant towards pro-choice. Marion, Linda and Jody, three women of varying ages and from different backgrounds, talk candidly of what it was like to find themselves unexpectedly pregnant, the choices they made; abortion, adoption, keeping the baby, and how it has affected their lives today. Doctor Carolyn Russell discusses the emotional and physical phases of pregnancy as well as a brief overview of what goes on in an abortion. A guide accompanies the video to promote discussion."
