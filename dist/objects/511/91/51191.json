        "Redball is rife with some extreme black humour, violence, several corrupt, rather nasty detectives, and one dedicated and honest detective, \"JJ\" Wilson. JJ (Belinda McClory), along with her partner Robbie Walsh (John Brumpton), have been assigned to investigate a serial child killer codenamed Mr Creep. JJ is particularly upset by the horrific nature of the murders and becomes totally obsessed in her desire to put Mr Creep away. Surrounded by corrupt colleagues and not knowing who to trust, JJ feels more and more alienated and emotionally on the edge. When evidence begins to point to Mr Creep being a member of the police force, it seems that nothing will stop JJ from tracking him down and seeking vengeance. Throughout the film there are subplots interwoven with the central story keeping it fast-paced, darkly humourous, brutally chilling. This low budget film was shot on digital video in the streets of Melbourne and backed with some great original music by Neil McGrath. Cast also includes Frank Magree, Peter Docker, Anthea Davis, Neil Pigot, Paulene Terry-Beitz, Daniel Wyllie."
