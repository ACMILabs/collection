        "This psycho-thriller with sexual overtones is the only directorial effort by acclaimed cinematographer Gordon Willis, who photographed many of Woody Allen's films. Emily (Talia Shire) is a painfully introverted woman whose confidence has been further shattered by a rape attack. Her neighbour Andrea (Elizabeth Ashley), is a lesbian with a murderous past who harbours an obsessive attraction for Emily. With a highly homophobic script that provides no logic or motivation for the character's actions, only the camerawork (by Willis) and score (by Ennio Morricone) redeem the film."
