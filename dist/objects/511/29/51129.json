        "A beautiful woman by day - a lusting queen wasp by night. Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot), cosmetics entrepreneur and former model approaching middle age, teams up with an unemployed research scientist who has just developed a youth serum derived from wasps. Starlin volunteers to be a human guinea pig, to the horror of her employees and corporate advisers. The serum cuts eighteen years off her age and makes her radiant, but Starlin learns that there are a few flies in the ointment. The epitome of B-films, Corman quickly pushes aside trivial matters such as logic and science to create a great yarn, although his treatment of the story written by Leo Gordon and Kinta Zertuche, confuses the audience as to whether this film concerns bees or wasps. Music by Fred Katz."
