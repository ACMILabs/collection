        "A detailed documentary on the resistance to Hitler in Germany before and during World War II. The network of anti-Nazi activity in Germany that was active in the military and within the SS ranks from Hitler's rise to power and into the war is profiled through discussion, first of the efforts by military leaders to gain the support of foreign nations in overthrowing Hitler's government, and then of the range of assassination attempts and networks to smuggle Jews and other persecuted groups and individuals from the country. Through a collection of interviews including those with surviving members of the resistance and the families of those they helped, archival footage, and a critical commentary the program is a thorough exploration of the principles behind the movement as well as their activities."
