        "Written and performed by Rikki Beadle Blair, \"Captivated\" is a one-man theatre piece that tells the story of Shane, a gay black man imprisoned for murder. The monotony of his daily routine is broken by letters from a \"pink\" pen pal, a gay Asian man who writes to Shane as an act of charity. Their correspondence charts Shane's personal journey from self-hatred, which has manifested in a personal history of violence, to agonised self-reflection, and finally a new found gratitude and respect for his unseen friend. Dynamically staged and produced, with a bravura performance of isolation and redemption by Blair, an award-winning actor and writer on British TV."
