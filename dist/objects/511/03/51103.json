        "Controversial director Derek Jarman talks one on one with John Cartwright at Dungeness about his work. Throughout the beautifully shot interview, Jarman discusses various issues including being labelled a director as opposed to a painter, film technique in the 1980s (especially working with Super 8), the incorrect assumption that his work is avant-garde, public reaction to his films \"Sebastiane\" (1976) and \"Jubilee\" (1978), \"The Tempest\" (1979), \"Caravaggio\" (1986), \"The Garden\" (1990), \"Last of England\" (1987), the film he forgot he made - \"War requiem\" (1989), and the film he remembers most fondly - \"The Angelic conversation\" (1985). Jarman also talks about converting \"Edward II\" (1991) to screen and his selection of images (or lack thereof) in his personal tribute to his experience of battling with AIDS; \"Blue\" (1993)."
