        "Along with the mystique of the bush and a fascination with the interior, the beach holds a resonance for many Australians, be it a place of relaxation, inhibition, spectacle, or the site of a rite of passage. This documentary looks at the icon of the beach, how it was introduced and has been represented through art, poetry, prose, film, music and choreography, as well as the history of beach culture - including cossies, codes of conduct and surfies. Key art works and literature are identified and reflected upon, with readings from \"beach literature\", stills from paintings, photographs, film posters, plus footage of people at the beach. Includes interviews with numerous artists who talk about what the beach means to them and how it has influenced their work. Those interviewed include: Tim Winton, Juliana Engberg, Ken Done, Les Murray, Graham Murphy, Gabrielle Carey, Peter Sculthorpe, Doreen Mellor, George Ganyibala, Anne Zahalka and Philip Drew. Narrated by David Wenham."
