        "This genre-defying, gender-bending, no-budget, experimental feature draws its inspiration from such diverse sources as cyberpunk, anime, splatter films, sci-fi, Hong Kong action flicks, feminist theory, and queer underground cinema. Dandy is a \"cyborg techno-human of fluid gender\" who participates in a series of surreal, fetishistic sexual encounters whilst travelling across time and space in a bizzare futuristic universe. Extreme, visceral and visually inventive, the film gleefully upturns conventional notions of narrative, sex, gender and family, in its irreverent exploration of the relationship between body and machine, and the interplay between violence, eroticism and ritual. Cast includes Tre Temperilli, Hans Schierl and Svar Simpson."
