        "Dr T & the women tracks one tumultuous autumn in the life of Dr Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere), a gynaecologist running a successful, if chaotic private medical practice in Texas. Dr T's life is beset with women troubles: his daughter, Dee Dee, is getting married and the preparations are under way; his other daughter is a Kennedy conspiracy theorist who suspects her sister is a lesbian; his wife has been committed to an insane asylum; his sister (estranged from her husband) has moved in with her three small daughters in tow; his secretary is making a play for him; and his new golf coach is a self-assured woman to whom he is greatly attracted. Travis finds himself unable to cope with a personal life being thrown into turmoil by forces beyond his control. Directed by Robert Altman, this comedy is written by Anne Rapp who had previously collaborated with Altman on \"Cookie's fortune\". In \"Dr T & the women\" Altman employs his characteristic flourishes such as overlapping dialogue, ensemble acting and intersecting storylines. Starring: Helen Hunt, Laura Dern, Shelley Long, Kate Hudson, Liv Tyler and Tara Reid."
