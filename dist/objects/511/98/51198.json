        "Directed by Wim Wenders (Wings of desire, The Million dollar hotel, Buena Vista Social Club) \"Paris, Texas\" won three awards at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984, including the Golden Palm. Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is travelling aimlessly through Texas, having left behind his son in LA with his successful brother Walt (Dean Stockwell). Found half dead in the desert, Travis decides to go back for his son and take him on a journey in search of the boy's mother (Nastassja Kinski). Their search ends in a cheap strip-joint and Travis and his ex-wife confront each other about lost dreams and past betrayals. Visually striking, and intellectually stimulating, \"Paris, Texas\" is scripted by Sam Shepard and based on his own volume of short stories, \"Motel chronicles\". The haunting musical score is by Ry Cooder."
