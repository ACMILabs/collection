        "Based on a true story and made for television, this film starring Glenn Close and Judy Davis garnered the film 3 Emmys, including Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing for a miniseries or Special, in addition to Best Actress (Close) and Supporting Actress (Davis). It tells the story of successful army nurse Margarethe \"Grethe\" Cammermeye who, after disclosing her sexual orientation, inadvertently closes the door on any avenue for promotion, thus earning her the dubious status of being the highest ever ranking officer dismissed for being a homosexual. Executive producer - Barbra Streisand."
