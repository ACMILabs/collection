        "A documentary on the Kindertransport children of Hitler's Germany and the German occupied countries of Austria and Czechoslovakia whose parents were faced with the decision to send their children away, mostly to Britain, as conditions for Jews in Germany and later elsewhere increasingly deteriorated. Collected with archival footage, discussion of the Kindertransport program and interviews with resistance members and families involved in the initiative this program contains the reflections of the now aged children themselves. They discuss how their families were effected when the Nazis came to power and what led them to be sent from all that was familiar to new lives in a country with a strange language and an unknown culture. Their moving stories are detailed with a view to their own lives and how the experience effected them as well as what happened to the families they had to leave behind. Includes interviews with Lord Attenborough and actor Warren Mitchell, whose families took in Kindertransport children."
