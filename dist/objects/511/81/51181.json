        "Two friends - Romy and Michele - are ten years out of high school when they are invited to a class reunion. The two women have escaped their hometown for Los Angeles but things haven't turned out quite as planned. Pouring over their high school yearbook provides the opportunity for a series of flashbacks about their (at times) gruesome school days. Four bitchy women - the A group - played a key part in Romy's teenage angst, compounded by her crush on the boyfriend of the ringleader. Michele is a more blithe character who sees the school days as glorious fun, blissfully unaware that she and Romy were the butt of many jokes. Other characters are Heather (Janeane Garlfalo), a depressed and lovelorn chain-smoking teen who has become a wealthy inventor; and Sandy (Alan Cumming) a science nerd in love/lust with Michele who has become a self-made millionaire. Pre-reunion the girls start to panic that their lives are fruitless, so decide to make up histories that will supply them with more appealing profiles. \"Romy and Michele's high school reunion\" is a comedy and buddy film that draws heavily on a 1980s soundtrack and fashion and has an appealing duo in the two leads."
