        "This is a short documentary film, purportedly to be the last film of Andy Warhol before he died, which combines an insight into the world of Andy Warhol along with a travelogue of Hong Kong and China. Alfred Sui, an American educated Chinese who has lived in Hong Kong for twenty years, created the \"I Club\", a glitzy disco nightclub located in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district in the Bank of America building and fashioned in the western style of the New York nightclubs. The \"I Club\" represented modern western architecture and design and featured paintings by world renowned artists, including many of Andy Warhol's work. Alfred Sui invited Andy Warhol and his entourage to open his new night club in 1985 which was to be patronised by the wealthy and famous, who wish to see and be seen. In the following days after the opening, Andy becomes a tourist visiting Peking, the Great Wall of China, Red Square but all the time comparing eastern culture with western culture and appearing to be mildly disappointed in the lack of westernization in China (no McDonalds!). Andy's egocentricity also begins to surface as he realises that the Chinese really do not know who Andy Warhol is, that it is only American tourists who recognise him and want to take his photo. A strange but interesting doco with rare footage of a relaxed and open Andy Warhol."
