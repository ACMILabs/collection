        "Isaac Mizrahi is a talented New York fashion designer, who, after receiving negative reviews for his 1994 Spring collection, is in need of a successful season. This documentary tracks the evolution of Mizrahi's next collection - from fledging moments of inspiration to final parade. \"Unzipped\" is a frank examination of the fashion industry at work - the superficiality, demands, personalities, exhaustion, frustrations, setbacks, camaraderie and creativity of it all. Supermodels take centre stage and the precociousness of this elite group is in evident abundance. Mizrahi seeks guidance from a diverse range of sources (including a ouija board) as he aims to evoke the look and style of an Inuit, mixed with 1950s cheesecake aesthetic, meets Mary Tyler Moore. Mizrahi's mother is interviewed and gives insights into her son's precocious talent, recognised and nurtured by her. Directed by Douglas Keeve, \"Unzipped\" is a candid examination of the sparks that fly when creative urges seek to ally financial interest. Features appearances from Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen, Richard Gere, Eartha Kitt, Sandra Bernhard and Kate Moss. Winner of the Audience Award at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival."
