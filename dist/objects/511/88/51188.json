        "This camp, affectionate spoof of B western films, features drag-queen and cult-movie star Divine (1945-1988) best known for her performances in the films of John Waters. Basically a series of comedy skits that draw heavily on stereotypes of the western genre, the plot revolves around a group of mis-assorted characters that converge on the frontier town of Chile Verde in search of buried gold. Soon the town is turned upside down as lust, greed, and passion are driven to a fever pitch. Divine plays Rosie Velez, a voluptuous barmaid who encounters Clint Eastwood-esque gunfighter, Abel Wood (played by veteran actor Tab Hunter) in the desert. The performances of the cast of seasoned comic actors make up for the shortcomings of the script in this silly but fun, raunchy romp through a very wild Old West. Cast also includes Geoffrey Lewis, Laine Kazan, Cesar Romero and Henry Silva."
