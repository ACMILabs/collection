        "Director Paul Bartel (Eating Raoul, Lust in the Dust) brings a breezy, sophisticated touch to this outrageous sex farce set in Beverly Hills. The plot centres on the sexual antics that ensue when a snooty divorcee (Mary Woronov), her withdrawn teenage son, her pretentious playwright brother and his sassy black wife move in with their next door neighbour, a widowed ex-soap star (Jacqueline Bisset) while their house is being fumigated. Adding to the 'upstairs-downstairs' mix is the soap star's precocious daughter, her campy friend and the women's respective houseboys. When the two servants challenge each other to sleep with their respective employers, the stage is set for a wild weekend of bed swapping."
