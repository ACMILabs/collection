        "Three short films from Australia and New Zealand featuring gay male characters. \"Bad news bachelors\" Set in Sydney, this short film follows thirty-something Stuart as he roams the city's cafes, bars and cruising areas looking for a man to love but finding only sex with a series of likeable men - none of whom offer the likelihood of a relationship. \"Resonance\" This short experimental dance film opens with a vicious gay bashing, then pieces together the relationship between the victim, the basher and his girlfriend. Homophobia and misogyny are linked in the character of the basher. The plot is deliberately ambiguous. The basher resembles the martial arts instructor who is the rescuer of the victim. Gesture and dance are used as a form of interior monologue exploring the way this act of violence resonates through the lives of the characters. \"Beyond Gravity\": Richard spends his time fantasising about outerspace and the cosmos, an activity which antagonises friends and family. Then one day he meets Johnny, a handsome Italian man, with an enormous appetite for life, who offers him love and an escape from the monotony of work. This short New Zealand film is a joyous celebration of the love between two eccentrics. It is also a refreshingly matter-of-fact and comic treatment of a romance between two men who both have their sights aimed firmly amongst the stars."
