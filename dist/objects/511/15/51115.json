        "Gruff, homophobic, retired security guard Walt Koontz (Robert De Niro) has, what he considers to be, the unlucky fortune of living opposite flamboyant drag queen Rusty Zimmerman (Philip Seymour Hoffman). However, after suffering a debilitating stroke in a fatality involving Rusty's friend Amber, a tenuous link is formed between them. On advice from his physical therapist Walt asks Rusty for singing lessons to improve his speech - the constant taunting between them also helps the vocal chords. They slowly become involved in one another's personal lives, if only playing out who faces the worst adversity and trotting off predictable homophobic and heterophobic comments. The subplot involving the retrieval of the stolen money that Amber lost her life for provides the film's climax which is littered throughout with the usual tenets one expects from Joel Schumacher (slow-mo, image distortion), with a passing nod to \"As good as it gets\" in its intolerable male come good scenario, and a touch of humour. Cast also includes: Barry Miller, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Wanda de Jesus."
