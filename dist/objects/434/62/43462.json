        "Nine years in the making, this is the definitive tribute to the complex personality and musical genius that was Charles Mingus. Director McGlynn has unearthed a wonderful array of previously unseen or extremely rare film and television clips of Mingus in performance, and combines these with contributions from his friends, fellow musicians, and family to create a unique insight into the creative process, and a life full of trauma, frustration and joy. Includes musical performances by Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell and many more."
