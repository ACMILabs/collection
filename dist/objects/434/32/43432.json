        "Produced in collaboration with the Ambulance Service, this dramatised first aid video details the steps involved in Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (or CPR). A work team operating in a remote area respond to the apparent electrocution of a work mate. No pulse, no breathing. Initially shocked by the event, the workers must remond themselves of the steps involved in both raising the alarm and reviving their workmate. Intended as a reminder of the steps involved in CPR, this video can be used to highlight the importance of the use of CPR in an emergency situation."
