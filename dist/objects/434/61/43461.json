        "This affectionate observation of life in a small country town follows the events of a lazy summer's afternoon in Pyramid Hill, Victoria. A car load of local lady bowlers flips over on the way home from a tournament. Confusion escalates as word about the accident spreads around the town. Husbands go astray searching for their wives; helpful passers-by take the women involved in the accident in all directions; the ambulance gets lost; and the local policeman misses the accident all together. The film is the first feature for the director/ producer/writer team after several years of documentaries and short films, many of them award-winning."
