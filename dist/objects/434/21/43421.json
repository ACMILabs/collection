        "While on a voyage Daniel Fogarty is promoted to Captain; Elisabeth is pregnant but still unsure of who she wants to marry. James' first mate - trustworthy Baines - is kidnapped by Americans. The \"Charlotte Rhodes\" is also in trouble, doomed to be lost by sinking and it is not insured. With Fraser's first trial steamboat, James and Robert race against Callon to salvage the \"Charlotte Rhodes\". James and his wine merchant strike a deal to import 100,000 vines from America, to James' advantage. An old beau of Anne's returns to Liverpool to find her situation much changed."
