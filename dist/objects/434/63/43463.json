        "This video presents the man and the musician who with his wonderful sound touched the hearts of so many people around the world. Of all the leaders from the big band era, Miller is the most long lived and powerful. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, when he had literally dozens of popular hits, his public reception was as intense and frenzied as it was later for Frank Sinatra, Elvis and the Beatles. This is the first documentary produced about this musical legend. His life story is told through clips of the Miller band in their heyday, rarely seen home movie and newsreel footage, along with stories from numerous eye witnesses including fellow musicians, journalists and confidantes, as well as Henry Mancini and James Stewart who share some anecdotes about the making of the very successful motion picture \"The Glen Miller Story\"."
