        "Director David Vaisbord allows to viewer to share his search to unravel the mystery of his enigmatic Uncle, the violinist Mischa Weisbord. In his prime Mischa was synonymous with fine music, performing throughout Europe and America at the most prestigious venues. In later life Mischa faded into obscurity, a shadow of his former self. When he died he died in poverty, his body laying undiscovered for days because of his reclusive nature. David Vaisbord attempts to reconcile Mischa's tragic ending to his prolific youth by travelling throughout Europe, Russia, Israel and New York, speaking to family, friends and admirers of the famous musician."
