        "Callon is forcing Robert to sell his shop. One of James' ships explodes and the insurance is deemed invalid. In desperation a shady deal is hatched to regain losses. A mysterious well-paying passenger is aboard the \"Charlotte Rhodes\" for safe passage home, but Baines and his trusty crew are not sailing this journey. More problems on the horizon, with one of James' ships in a state of mutiny. Daniel Fogarty arrives home to find his Elisabeth wed to Albert Fraser and pregnant with his baby."
