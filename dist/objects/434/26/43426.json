        "The Beatles are now number one all over the world. Success, well earned is assumed a natural state. They are as happy and polite as can be but their music tells a different story: Help!, I'm a loser, Yesterday, I'm really down. Episode 3 starts with the 1964 American tour, live at the Hollywood Bowl, the Beatles meet Bob Dylan, they discover herbal jazz cigarettes, suffer tour craziness, the making of I Feel Fine film clip, filming of Help! origins of Yesterday, George's songwriting, the Beatles receive M.B.E.s, live at Shea Stadium with pre-show excerpts. Songs included: I Feel Fine, All My Loving, Kansas City/Hey, Hey, I'm A Loser (John plays harmonica a la Dylan), Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby, You're Gonna Lose That Girl, You've Got Hide Your Love Away, Yesterday, I'm Down, She's A Woman, Act Naturally, Ticket To Ride and If You've Got Trouble."
