        "The year is 1860 in Liverpool in England, Captain James Onedin is tired of working for shrewd ship owner Mr. Callon. A ship for auction the 'Charlotte Rhodes\" owned by a determined woman Anne Webster, gives James the chance of ownership. An unusual contract is made ; with Robert (James' brother) - and the Onedin Line is begun. However owning a ship and finding trade is not as easy as it would seem. James' sister Elisabeth has two men competing for her attention - wealthy ship son Albert Fraser and seaman Daniel Fogarty - she must decide soon."
