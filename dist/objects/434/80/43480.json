        "The Chelsea Flower show is a triumph of man, and his gardening skills, over the potential disasters of nature. The 5 day 1998 Chelsea Flower Show, held in the grounds of the Royal Hospital, saw a record number of entries with 770 of the world's finest horticulturists vying for the prestigious R.H.S. Gold medal. This video is the official souvenir video and offers behind the scenes interviews with entrants and many of the visitors to the show that was broadcast daily on live television. Presented by Alan Titchmarsh."
