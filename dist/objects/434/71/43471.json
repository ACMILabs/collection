        "This documentary traces the history of America's most popular 60s band from their humble surf band beginnings at the end of the 50s, through to their 80s and 90s career as a nostalgia act. The interviews are surprisingly candid and the band's own footage (some previously unseen) from live concerts, promotional videos and behind-the-scenes tour moments will be of interest to fans. The band talk about the late 60s/early 70s period during which leader, Brian Wilson, suffered breakdowns and the band was considered irrelevant to the psychedelic \"Flower Power\" era."
