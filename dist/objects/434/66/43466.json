        "Every January thousands of country music fans flock to the mecca of Australian country music; Tamworth, for the annual Country Music Festival when the population swells with people united by their love for music. Hot on the wish list of performers is winning a Golden Guitar but sometimes just making an impression and being noticed is enough. This programme, previously screened on ABC, explores the phenomena of Tamworth by interviewing fans, recognised country singers such as Graeme Connors, Lee Kernaghan, Gina Jeffreys, Tommy Emmanuel, Reg Lindsay and many other up and coming stars to the country music scene."
