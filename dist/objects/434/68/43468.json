        "Johnnie Byrne (Peter Finch) is a man with the political ambition to ascend to number one in the Northern country industrial town in which he was raised. Although his party is successful and is voted into office, Johnnie is overlooked for selection. Returning home, dejected, he discovers his wife, Alice had secret political ideas of her own and has left Johnnie to pursue her own ambitions. He begins an affair with a photographers model, but this too, like his political career is absent of love. A strange turn of events sees Alice attempting to rekindle her relationship with Johnnie and his good fortune seems to continue as he is offered a position in cabinet. To Johnnies horror he discovers that the reason why he wasn't offered the position before was because of Alice's connections to the Communist Party and Johnnie must ultimately decide between love and his political ambition. Cast also includes Mary Peach, Stanley Holloway, Donald Pleasence and Billie Whitelaw."
