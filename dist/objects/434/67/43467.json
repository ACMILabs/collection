        "Dr Alec Windom (Peter Finch) is a resident doctor on the island of Selim in South East Asia. He is a committed and dedicated doctor to both his patients and the wider community which is currently experiencing unrest. It is into this environment that Windom's estranged wife, Lee (Mary Ure) arrives. Because of his prominent and respected position in society, Windom attempts to act as mediator between the exploited natives and the Government to prevent a native uprising but is thwarted by betrayal from the authorities. Disillusioned by his inability to reconcile the situation and by the betrayal that occurs, Windom prepares to leave the country with his wife. Cast also includes Natasha Parry, Robert Flemying, Michael Horderna and Marne Maitland. Based on a novel by James Ramsay Ullman."
