        "This video offers an insight into the background, aspirations, influences, thoughts and dreams of country singer Gina Jeffreys. Born and raised in Toowoomba, Gina moved away from her family to settle in Sydney and further her musical career which began when she won the Star Maker award in 1991 (although she does have fond memories of busking at the local Mexican restaurant). Since then Gina has been awarded the Golden Guitar at Tamworth for Best Female Vocalist three years in a row. Gina relates memories of her rise to fame and footage is provided from the launch of her latest album, \"Somebody's daughter\". Full music clips are provided of \"Dancin' with Elvis\", \"Josephine\" and \"I haven't got a heart\"."
