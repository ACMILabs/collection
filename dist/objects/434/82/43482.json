        "The life of plants and animals, living contently in a large garden, is threatened one night by predators who steal their food and destroy vegetation. The garden is left inhabitable and our garden friends are forced into a war with the balance of the ecosystem at stake. A timely tale about our delicate ecosystem, presented through diverse imagery that will delight and educate. Suitable for lower secondary level. A guide accompanies this video."
