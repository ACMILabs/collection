        "This now classic Italian spoof on the caper film, about a group of incompetent amateur crooks who plan an elaborate but misguided robbery on a store, was hugely successful in both Italy and the United States. Primarily a take-off of Dassian's 'Rififi' (1955), its comedy of errors is firmly rooted in social conditions of deprivation. Moncelli uses the conventions of the heist film to maximum effect and adds a steady stream of sight gags played out by an impeccable cast featuring Vittorio Gassman, Renato Salvatori, Claudia Cardinale and Marcello Mastroianni, with hilarious results. The jazz score by Piero Umiliani is also notable. From a story by Age Scarpelli. Credits: Director, Mario Monicelli ; writers, Age Scarpelli, Suso Cecchi D'amico, Mario Monicelli ; photography, Erico Menczer ; music, Piero Umiliani. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1958."
