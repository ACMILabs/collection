        "A man's obsession with control manifests itself in the manipulation of his gadgets and his practice of a science which dissects and reduces. Despite his meticulous nature he is not beyond longing, but has his crimes and fears pushed him beyond redemption? This film provides the viewer with a surreal eleven minute experience."
