        "A mock documentary about how not to prepare for the Sydney Olympics, or any Olympics for that matter. This tape includes four episodes from the popular television satire. Incidents arising from the episodes include; accuracy, in particular the construction of the 100 metre track; the importance of flying with approved airlines and what happens when two international figures arrive on a non official airline; John appears on television defending Australia's position on the environment while Bryan and Gina hear a proposal from rural Australia regarding the opening ceremony; there are moves to bring in an infallible drug test to the Olympics, but will it bring more harm than good? Cast includes John Clarke, Gina Riley and Bryan Dawe."
