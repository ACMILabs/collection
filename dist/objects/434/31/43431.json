        "Produced with the supervision of the Ambulance Service and St John's Ambulance first aid trainers, this dramatised didactic first aid video details the steps involved in the DRABC system of managing the Unconscious casualty. The video aims to educate the inexperienced about the crucial steps in this emergency response. No previous first aid training is required although this video can be used effectively for 'refresher' training."
