        "This tape discusses the history of state execution across countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Nigeria, France, Afghanistan, China, the Phillipines and Saudi Arabia. Interviews are conducted with historians, families of those executed, legal personnel and executioners. Issues covered include; the disproportion of poorer people and non-whites on death row in America, the transformation from hanging processions to a search for more humane ways to end death and distance executioners from their actions, a case study of David Lawson who died by lethal injection, the abolition and reinstatement of the death penalty in America, and the case of capital punishment in Trinidad. This documentary contains graphic scenes of execution methods including the guillotine, firing squad and hanging. Suitable for upper secondary level."
