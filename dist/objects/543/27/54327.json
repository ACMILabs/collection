        "In the past two decades, performances in sport have improved greatly. Athletes are running faster, jumping longer and higher and have more endurance. It is mainly due to the increasing application of science through the result of devising better methods and longer periods of training. This scientific and systematic approach to getting fit and keeping fit is called Sports Medicine."
