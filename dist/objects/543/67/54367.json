        "Victoria converts brown coal to power and light at Yallourn in the Latrobe Valley. The mechanisation of Australia's wheat farms from harvesting to transporting wheat to the silos is shown as the country celebrates a bumper crop. Army Minister revies a parade of school cadets from high and public schools at Ingleburn Camp near Sydney. Fairbridge Farm School at Molong in New South Wales helps new migrants create a future in their adopted country."
