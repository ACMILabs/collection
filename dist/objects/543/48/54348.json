        "A film for classroom teachers. Presents three different teachers in three different schools who have their own special way of incorporating Threads and Textiles into their program of Art Education. These teachers do not represent a random sample of teachers involved in using the course, but were simply selected because they were eager to introduce Threads and Textiles in to the classroom."
