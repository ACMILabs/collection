        "This film depicts varied means of communication such as spoken, unspoken and written language: pictographic, ideographic and phonetic. It discusses phonemes and the history of the alphabet. It shows the power language has for good and evil, and stresses the need for humans to use this great gift for worthy and constructive purposes."
