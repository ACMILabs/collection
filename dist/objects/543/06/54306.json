        "The challenge of Australia's water resources - a problem, as good rainfall suited to agriculture occurs only in coastal regions. Describes government schemes for irrigation, hydro-electricity, reservoirs and other sources of water, including artesian bores. Indicates the widespread research which has made possible a better understanding of our climate today; includes work on evaporation control, artificial rain-making and sea-water utilisation."
