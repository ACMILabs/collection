        "The setting of the film is a bicycle repair shop, presided over by a mechanic who is surrounded by bicycles waiting to be repaired. Direct teaching is avoided by making various parts of the bicycle talk, in children's voices. They tell the repair man about the treatment they have received from their riders and the accidents and near-misses in which they have been involved. As they talk, scenes show how badly maintained bicycles can be the cause of accidents."
