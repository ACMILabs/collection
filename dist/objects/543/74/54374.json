        "Scientists make strange finds in Arnhem Land during the American-Australian Scientific Expedition. They studied birds, fish and the culture of local Aboriginal peoples. A potter from Melbounre demonstrates a variation of the coil method of using clay. Koalas are born and reared in a sanctuary along with kangaroos and dingoes at the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary near Brisbane."
