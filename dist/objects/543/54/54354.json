        "This film enables students to examine some simple evidence for the existence of molecules. Reference to the beliefs of Democritus and Plato are mentioned and also to the origin of the word \"atom\". It gives an opportunity to calculate the size of a molecule and some models of common molecules are shown. The film includes actual photographs of molecules produced by the modern electron microscope."
