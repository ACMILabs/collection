        "The title of this film refers to a wife and mother, Mabel Longhetti, who moves completely under the influence of her family and other people. She tries so hard to perform and conform, according to what she perceives they want, but she just comes across as \"crazy\" and the family are embarrassed. In the confusion, the film makes Mabel an expressive centre, focusing on the commotion she causes and the forms of agitation that extend across her face and body."
