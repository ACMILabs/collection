        "Young sales hopefuls Tony and Mary introduce us to self-proclaimed success story Danny, the manager of a door-to-door distribution company. His business philosophy inspires a cult like zeal in his sales team, who battle the hurdles of the working day. Danny is a model and mentor, but is his belief in greed enough? The Pursuit of happiness offers great comic relief in its view of a world where the only measure of success is winning the daily dash for cash."
