        "A Berlin puppet maker named Goethe takes his clockwork puppet knife-throwing act to New York. It is 1934 and a Nazi spy is watching him. A wickedly funny black comedy that quotes from Metropolis and Caligari, this short animation captures what was so good in German Expressionism- that eerie feeling of a world out of whack."
