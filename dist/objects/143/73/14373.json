        "A shy retiring little man and his glamourous neighbour share meaningful looks as they pass each other in the hallway. He is entranced by her ravishing outfits, she is a little lonely and thinks 'why not?'.  But there is a twist in the tale of this claymation. Music by Matt Archer. Graduate work from an AIM (Centre for Animation and Interactive Media) RMIT graduate, 2006."
