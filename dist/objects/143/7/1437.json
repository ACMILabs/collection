    "description": [
        "The unusual technique of sand animation is used to tell the story of a woman and her granddaughter.  It starts with them sitting at the kitchen table playing cards. As the cards are shuffled and cut, the film cuts between pre-war Poland, Europe in the Holocaust, the woman's childhood and the present. The old woman's homeland is evoked as a world the child strives to create from anecdotes. The woman's present is shown as one etched with darkness of her family's experience of the Holocaust."
