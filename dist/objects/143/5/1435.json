        "The subject of this amusing and touching story is a young cheeky Italian girl growing up in the Australian suburbs of the 70's, confused by the conflicting values of her classmates and those of her Italian family. She wonders about her relatives in Italy, acts as her parents' interpreter and battles with being called a wog at school. Feeling like an outsider, she seeks solace in her pet rabbit until the rabbit meets an untimely death."
