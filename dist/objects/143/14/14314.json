        "Insecurities is a snapshot of Sydney in 2004, focusing on the psychological  impact of the threat of terrorism on Sydneysiders and Sydney's public spaces. The film explores fear, safety, security, racism and patriotism through the eyes of its subjects, asking important questions along the way:    \"What effects does fear, on a large scale, have on people? Do we make judgements in a state of fear that we might otherwise not make?\""
