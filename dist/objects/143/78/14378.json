        "Myrtle Gordon is a successful actress who finds the part she has taken in a new play, about a \"defeated, older woman\", humiliating. When a young fan is killed outside the theatre one night, Myrtle uses the experience of the girl and the accident to revisit her youth. While she searches for a vantage-point to perform the part, the film shows how the play and the world behind the play interact and threaten to draw her into collapse. Also available on VHS [310942]."
