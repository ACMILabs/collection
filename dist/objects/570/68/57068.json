        "Gracefully captures the adept movements of wind surfers manoeuvreing their boards along Hawaii's magnificent coastline. Displays a variety of action camera techniques, including underwater shots and views from cameras mounted on the mast and on helmuts as well as aerial views. Exciting editing and complementary music combine in a visually stunning program without narration."
