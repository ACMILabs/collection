        "A juggler opens his magic box and takes out three balls. The audience marvels at his dexterity until one ball escapes. The mutinous ball assumes magical properties as it draws the juggler into a series of adventures with many levels of meaning: appearance, fantasy and love. The spectator's age and subjective impressions determine the interpretation of this non-narrated tale."
