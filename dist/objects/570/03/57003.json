        "Starring the Beatles, this comic fantasia with music uses a multitude of cinematic gags. An enormous commercial success, it led directly to all the kaleidescope swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the late sixties. In this film the Beatles, harrased by their manager and Paul's grandpa, embark from Liverpool by train for a London television show."
