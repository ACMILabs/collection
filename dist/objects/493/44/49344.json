        "This is the story of Shane Warne's mercurial career in his own words. Named one of the five greatest cricketers of the 20th century and Australia's greatest wicket taker in Test cricket, he commentates on footage of most of the highlights of his career so far, including his Test debut against India in 1991/92, the Test match hat-trick, and the 1999 World Cup victory. He also discusses many amusing behind the scenes tales as well as some of his greatest rivals."
