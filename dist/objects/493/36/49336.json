        "Shadow of the vampire is an adventurous and atmospheric docu-drama that offers a fascinating hypothesis as to how gifted German director F.W.Murnau may have managed to achieve his goal of making his 1922 film - \"Nosferatu\" - one of the most eerie and authentic vampire films ever. After being refused the right to film Stoker's \"Dracula\", Murnau (John Malkovich) begins filming interior shots for his unauthorized version in Berlin. Refusing to impart detailed information about the direction of the film, and the mysterious Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), who is to play \"Count Orlock\", he moves the cast and crew out to a remote location in Czechoslovakia for the shooting of pivotal scenes involving the vampire. Displaced by their surroundings, and frustrated by Murnau's ambiguity, everyone is taken aback when the elusive Shreck - who is only to be filmed at night, and only in full make-up - finally makes his first appearance. Shreck's bizarre behaviour and Murnau's unwavering determination to continue filming at all costs begin to take their strain on the production, and soon details of Murnau's alleged Faustian pact to secure the vampire's services emerge. As well as being director, E. Elias Merhige's homage to one of the great directors, this film also functions as a dark but witty exploration of the sacrifices one is willing to make, of oneself and others, in the pursuit of artistic perfection."
