        "A Vietnamese migrant family struggles to survive with their customary values in Australia. As the children reach adolescence, the conflict resulting from the difference between the two cultures intensifies. The children aim for independence. The father feels only shame heightened by the family living in high-rise commission flats and working as a factory worker, a fall of social standing. Cast includes Thanh-Vu Nguyen and Tamara Thao Nguyen."
