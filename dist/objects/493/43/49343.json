        "Narrated by David Attenborough, this documentary follows three newly discovered colonies of Lowland Gorillas in the northern Congo, exploring the true nature of the great Ape. This film is a masterpiece of expertise and innovation, award-winning cameraman Gavin Thurston and his crew use revolutionary techniques, backed by some of the latest scientific research to reveal aspects of the gorilla's lives that have never been seen before in their natural environment."
