        "Australia's tenth Test captain, Steve Waugh, carries some 14 years experience at cricket's highest level. Only Alan Border has scored more Test runs for Australia, and no-one has played more one-day internationals. A hero at home, a world beater away, the feats of Steve Waugh have become legend the world over. This is an exceptional insight into the story of a great sportsman in his own words."
