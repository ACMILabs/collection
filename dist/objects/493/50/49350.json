        "This classic Disney tale is a heartwarming story of two best friends who didn't know they were supposed to be enemies. Orphaned fox cub Tod is adopted by a lonely widow, and the fun and adventure begins when he meets Copper, an adorable hound puppy. Under the watchful eyes of Big Mama Owl, the innocent pair play and frolic in the forest, becoming inseparable friends - each unaware that the future will see them pitted against each other as each must fulfill his role in the scheme of things. Reflecting such timeless values as love, courage and the importance of friendship, and featuring the vocal talents of Mickey Rooney, Kurt Russell, Sandy Duncan, Pearl Bailey and Corey Feldman, this is a very endearing movie for the young and the young at heart."
