        "When a brawl breaks out between the Gauls and the Romans, the potion that gives Asterix and Obelix their powers tips over. Before more can be made, the Romans kidnap Getafix and hurl him into space, believing of course that the world is flat. When Asterix and Obelix go after him, they land in America, encountering strange animals and meeting a group of Indians. Based on the popular books by Goscinny and Underzo."
