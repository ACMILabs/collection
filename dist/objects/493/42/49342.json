        "A state-of-the-art remote-control camera disguised as a boulder is the innovative filming technique used to get filmmakers to the very heart of a pride of lions. For the first time a litter of cubs is filmed from the time they are introduced by the lionness to the rest of the pride at 6 weeks, covering almost 3,000 hours of growing time, until they are mature adults. Through this time David Attenborough discusses significant events in the development of the young lions that turn them from cubs into proficient hunters. This is a unique insight into the development of lions and the main discovery made is that every skill an adult lion has, every move it makes, is learned and practiced as a cub. Michael W. Richards and Geoffrey Bell are the main cinematographers who allow us to go where no camera has ever gone before."
