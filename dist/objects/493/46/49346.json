        "Colin Friels plays Rufus Dawes in Marcus Clarke's epic novel. Forced to leave his England home after being disinherited by the man he believed to be his natural father, Rufus is dealt another cruel blow when, on learning his father's real identity, is falsely arrested for his murder and sentenced to transportation to Van Dieman's Land for the term of his natural life. Once there, Rufus experiences many hardships and cruel acts, mainly at the hands of other hardened convicts but also from Lieutenant Frere, the feared and brutal ruler of the prison colonies. One thing that helps Rufus through this time is Sylvia, the daughter of Major Vickers with whom he holds a special but long forgotten bond. It is Rufus' courage and will to survive that maintains him through many escape attempts and the desire for freedom that make him an extrodinary person - barely living on the land that is pure hell."
