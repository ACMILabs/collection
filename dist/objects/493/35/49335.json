        "Another girl another planet has the distinction of being shot entirely in 'Pixelvision' (PXL), a now defunct Fisher Price kids video camera, initially made famous by Milwaukee teen artist Sadie Benning. The grainy, low light, high contrast, black and white images this inexpensive camera creates lends the film a casual home movie style, an appropriate mood for the film's languid musings about love and relationships. Although the images border on the abstract at times, \"Another girl another planet\" has a clearly defined narrative. The film traces the loves and angst of East Village neighbours, the morose and commitment phobic Bill (Barry Sherman) and the married highly strung Nic (Nic Ratner). Director Michael Almereyda resurrected the 'pixelvision' camera once again for his eerie 1994 revisionist vampire film Nadja. Cast includes Elina Lowensohn, Mary B. Ward, Isabel Gilles."
