        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Hornblower\". Hornblower's ship \"The Indefatigable\", together with three other ships carrying French emigre troops (the Frogs) and the British Infantrymen (the Lobsters), is sent to aid an attempted coup against the Republican Government by French Royalist counter-revolutionaries. In this episode Hornblower both finds and loses the one woman he truly loved. Starring Ioan Gruffudd and Robert Lindsay this is a dramatisation of C. S. Forester's classic maritime adventure."
