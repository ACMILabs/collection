        "Naked chef Jamie Oliver challenges the notion that fast food is easier and cheaper than any pucker tucker. Pitting his culinary skills against leading brands of instant meals, he creates his own variations on pasta, salmon, and an apple and blackberry crumble to prove that he comes in quicker and cheaper with home variations. Jamie also finds time to drop in on friends with a variety of backgrounds and budgets, in Coventry, Manchester and London and creates a range of dishes including: slow-roasted leg of pork with spicy scratching; sticky chocolate sauce pudding; celeriac and potato gratin; tray baked field mushrooms with garlic, butter and thyme; apricot and pistachio tarte tatin; sea bass with fennel and olives; white risotto with lemon thyme, sliced prosciutto, pecorino, parmesan and crumbled goats cheese. He also outlines the vital ingredients of a pantry."
