        "Adapted from one of Charles Dickens' best-selling novels by Martyn Hesford, this made for television two-part version of \"The Life and adventures of Nicholas Nickleby\" has proven very successful and features an excellent British cast including Charles Dance as Ralph Nickleby, the rather cruel and villainous uncle, James D'Arcy as our hero, Nicholas Nickleby intent on protecting his family at all costs and Sophie Myles as Nicholas's beautiful young sister Kate. The direction (by Stephen Whittaker) has allowed the story to flow and made the cast believable without seeming stagey or theatrical as they play out their character roles. This is a tale of Victorian London, of the aristocracy and the working class, vengeance and cruelty, true love and happiness, and of life's comic moments when you least expect it. Cast also includes Pam Ferris, Gregor Fisher, Lee Ingleby, Diana Kent, Liz Smith, Dominic West, George Innes, Tom Hollander."
