        "A photographers model (Vivienne Glance) ruminates on her modelling career to come to terms with her changing perception of herself as a female in this role. Her thoughts are punctuated by the images of famous early 20th Century paintings of women by Picasso, Bonnard, Degas and Lautrec along with the voice of a radio narrator (Richard Hawley) who talks of these famous artists and their depiction of women in terms of the male gaze. The female nude is discussed as possession, an object of desire and pawn in a power play and posited against the contemporary to illustrate that very little has changed. Cast includes Darren Williams and Martin Sharp."
