        "Episode of Series \"Australia Council archival film series: writers III\". One of Australia's most popular and acclaimed novelists, Elizabeth Jolley recalls her childhood and the influence of her Quaker upbringing in the industrial north of England. Jolley emigrated to Western Australia with her husband and three children and worked as a cleaner and travelling saleswoman to support her writing. Despite twenty years of rejection slips her first book of short fiction, \"Five Acre Virgin and Other Stories\" was eventually published in 1976. Another five books were released in the following six years and her radio plays were produced by both the ABC and the BBC World Service. Jolley asserts the importance of imagination over experience in her creative life and her belief in the value of regional fiction. Research and interview: James Murdoch."
