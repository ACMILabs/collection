        "Initially intending to write a story, Dorothy, a young journalist researching romantic love, travels to the United States following the footsteps of her mother who immigrated there many years before. In San Francisco she is introduced to the lesbian scene by a number of women including Susie Sexpert who initiates her into the practical arsenal of the American pragmatics of love, Dominique, a Hungarian bohemian from Uruguay and Ramona, a lesbian sex therapist with whom she falls in love. Treut employs experimental techniques to facilitate a first person insight into Dorothy's journey of sexual discovery. The direction and camera style also reflect the film's two locales; Germany, where Dorothy experiences paranoia, and California, the wonderland where she reacts with amazement at the subcultures she discovers. Cast includes Ina Blum, Shelly Mars, Peter Kern and Susie Bright."
