        "A real time recreation of the Wannsee Conference, which took place on Tuesday 20th January, 1942, at a house in the quiet Berlin suburb of Wannsee where leading SS and Nazi Party officals gathered to discuss the \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\". Led by SS-General Reinhard Heydrich, the Wannsee Conference was the starting point for the Jewish Holcaust which led to the mass murder of six million people. Actual notes from the meeting, letters written by Hermann Goering and Adolf Eichmann, and testimony by Eichmann at his 1961 trial in Israel were compiled to produce this fascinating historical docudrama. Cast includes Robert Artzhorn, Friedrich Beckhaus, Gerd Bockmann, Jochen Busse, Hans-Werner Bussinger, Dietrich Mattausch. Screenplay by Paul Mommertz. In German with English subtitles."
