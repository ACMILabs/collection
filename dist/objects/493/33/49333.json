        "In this grotesque black comedy, four rich, bored middle-aged men decide they have had enough of the tiresome life around them and decide to meet at a remote villa with the goal of ending their lives in one last decadent, drunken, depraved, orgiastic and impeccably well-catered marathon assault on their systems. The quartet comes from various walks of life-- a pilot (Marcello Mastroianni), a chef (Ugo Tognazzi), a television host (Michel Piccoli), and a judge (Philippe Noiret) but all are successful men with excessive appetites for life's pleasures (food is used as mere metaphor here, as graphic as that metaphor becomes). Ferreri's sexual and scatalogical catalogue of the men's indulgence of excesses, leaves no sensibility unassaulted. Cast also includes Andrea Ferreol. In French with English subtitles."
