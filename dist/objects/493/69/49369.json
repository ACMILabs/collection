        "Episode of Series \"Australia Council archival film series: writers III\". Dorothy Hewett reflects on her life as a playwright, poet, author and teacher. Hewett grew up in Western Australia and has been a writer all her life. A political, social and sexual rebel, she has created work which has often been controversial for its frankness and for the power of her female central characters. In this 1991 interview, Hewett discusses the professional and personal relationships that have enriched her life and inspired her writing. She also speaks about ageing and her struggle to overcome the loss of physical power. Research and interview: James Murdoch."
