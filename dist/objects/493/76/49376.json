        "Philip Baldwin (Monte Blue) is the son of a prosperous fruit-farmer. His marriage to Rosemary, daughter of his father's best friend has been planned since they were children, but when gold-digging city girl Marjorie (Marie Prevost) finds work during the summer vacation at the ranch, she seduces Philip into marriage. Domestic problems, city living and friction with his mother-in-law contribute to Marjorie divorcing Philip and abandoning their son. Philip then discovers true love with Mrs Grotenberg (Irene Rich) the widow who boards with the family and cares for the child. Cast also includes Harry Meyers, Frank Keenan and Harvey Clark. Based on the novel by Charles G. Norris."
