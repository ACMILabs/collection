        "This is a biographical film about one of Australia's great sporting heroes - in fact one of the world's highest point scorer in the game of men's basketball - Andrew Gaze. Born in Melbourne in 1965, Andrew spent his early years growing up in Albert Park, an area well-known for its sporting facilities from a basketball stadium to cricket, football, yachting and various other facilities. Andrew's father, Lindsay, who himself was a champion basketballer, had a profound influence on Andrew as his coach and mentor and to this day, there is still a very close bond between the two of them. Down to earth, highly respected by his peers, Andrew talks of his highs and lows, his motivation to keep going even when the odds seem to be against him and his career which spans across three decades and includes representing Australia in several Olympic Games, playing for Seton Hall in the NCAA competition, San Antonio Spurs and the Washington Bullets in the NBA and of course the Melbourne Tigers in the NBA. Put together in chronological order with footage from some of his major games, this is an entertaining and informative video which also includes some humorous moments from \"Gaze Cam\", Andrew's own home video shots."
