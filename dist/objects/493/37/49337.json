        "Laura Mars is a high profile fashion photographer who specialises in settings of urban murder and violence. When she becomes plagued by visions of \"real\" murders, Laura dismisses them as a by-product of her work. However, tension starts to mount when she begins to telepathically witness the bloody murders of her friends and colleagues, as seen through the eyes of the actual killer. Cast includes: Faye Dunaway, Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Dourif, Rene Auberjonois and Raul Julia."
