        "The Grizzly bear is the world's largest carnivore. Weighing up to 1,000 lbs, they can run as fast as a racehorse. They're smart, they're resourceful and they're very dangerous. Presented by David Attenborough, this video is the story of Jeff Turner, a nature cameraman who has spent the best part of the last 15 years filming Grizzly bears in their natural state in the coastal rainforests of western Canada. Because he understands the nature of the bears so well, he is able to get closer to them than ever before and it is this intimate footage which makes this documentary so special."
