        "Serafina had not seen her husband for 5 years. He'd emigrated to Australia to build a new life for himself and his young bride and prepares for Serafina's eventual arrival as a new Australian. Shortly after receiving her ticket to Australia, Serafina's husband unexpectedly dies. Alone and in an unfamiliar country, Serafina struggles with the culture, language, social isolation and her grief. An unexpected friendship with Angelo, a young Anglo-Italian, provides the start of happier introduction to a new life. Written by Monica Pellizzari."
