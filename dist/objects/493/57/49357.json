        "Humour based on 'ethnic' stereotypes is problematic. The situation is confounded/complicated when delivered from someone within that ethnic group. This documentary looks at Australia's most prominent (some say only), Vietnamese stand-up comic - Hung Le. Hung talks of his childhood in Vietnam, the move to Australia, the experiences of his family as migrants, his passion for the Carlton football club, and how he came into comedy. It explores the \"Wogs out of work\" phenomenon (of which Hung was involved), and includes interviews with other 'ethnic' comedians Vince Sorrenti, Anthony Mir and Peter Saleh, amongst others. Features excerpts of successful and not so successful stand-up routines."
