        "Sport has the power to unite and also to divide. It has the ability to build a person's confidence and at the same time destroy another's spirit. Australian Rules Football has for generations provided individuals and communities with a distraction from the normal focus of life. Created by our natural desire for competition, it has thrilled the masses, and for many, provided a way of life. It is the players that determine its power and this video is a celebration of those players. Players past and present, representing the 16 different clubs, discuss the game and their careers, providing insight into the journey of playing Australian Rules Football as a senior, the thrill of the first game and the heartache of being told your time is up."
