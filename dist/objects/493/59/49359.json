        "Walking with my sisters is an engaging documentary about the struggle of three Aboriginal sisters to have their native title rights acknowledged and their land returned to them. The three Aboriginal sisters - Lorna Kelly, Linda Vidler and Yvonne Graham - are the traditional custodians of the Byron Bay area, and a main criterion they must meet in the claims process is to prove that they are in fact descendents of this land and not migrants from elsewhere. \"Walking with my sisters\" gives a broad outline of the various steps involved in making native title claims, such as the endless negotiations and the many interested parties and competing interests. Behind this complex process, however, lies the fact that Indigenous peoples were the original inhabitants of the land and that part of the ongoing process of reconciliation and defining Australia's past and future involves grappling with this truth. Filmed over several years, \"Walking with my sisters\" shows a positive outcome to a long and deeply felt battle against what - at large - can be identified as cultural denial."
