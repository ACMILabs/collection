        "The first public film show in Great Britain was given at the Regent Street Polytechnic London, on February 20th, 1896, by the brothers August and Louis Lumiere. This film is a complete reprint of the programs shown on that occasion. It comprises the following subjects: Workers leaving the Lumiere factory; Baby at the lunch table; Demolition of a wall; Watering the gardener; Congress of Photographic Societies at Neuville-Sur-Saone, July 1895; Arrival of a train at Ciotat Station; A game of cards; A boat leaving harbour. None of these films is more than a single shot, without cutting or camera movement; their interest lay entirely in the novelty of the moving photograph."
