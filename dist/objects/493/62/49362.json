        "A woman living somewhere in the Australian high plains tends to her horses and gardens while something out of sight lurks. The woman has fantasies about a stranger who she desires to be with but also fears to be with and the line between fantasy and reality merge as she encounters the stranger in her house. This is a beautifully filmed short film that echoes the tale of \"Little Red Riding Hood\". (Awards: Winner, Silver Award for Cinematography in a Short Film, NSW Australian Cinematographers Society Awards, Sydney, 1998)"
