        "This comprehensive documentary looks at Australia's long running love affair with the ocean and in particular, with surfing. The evolution of the modern surfboard is traced, as well as the emergence of surfing films, music, magazines and surfwear fashion industries. We see the surfboard manufacturing industries that have emerged in coastal towns such as Torquay where surfer-craftsmen experiment in their eternal quest for the perfect board. The development of the Australian surfing subculture is shown, from the influential U.S. surfers who arrived at the 1956 Olympic Games with their Malibu boards, to the female surfers in the 60's who were largely disregarded unless they were tandem surfing with male partners. This culture is not only embraced by groups of mates who tour beaches in their panel vans but increasingly by the professional surfers who move around the world touring circuits from the Seychelles to Bali, and take out world titles in Hawaii. Historic clashes surfers have had with authorities are presented, as well as music clips of Australian surfing songs from Little Pattie, Col Joye, The Delltones, Normie Rowe and Johnny O'Keefe. The program is a blend of historical surfing footage, interview clips and cameo appearances from most of Australia's surfing greats from the 1950's through to the 1990's including Midge Farrelly, Nat Young, Layne Beachley, Kelly Slater and Mark Occhilupo."
