        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Hornblower\". Acting Lieutenant Hornblower, assisted by only five men captures the French sloop \"Le Reve\" off the Spanish coast - a major feat that does much to enhance his reputation. Hornblower is commissioned Lieutenant due to his 'exemplary gallantry'. Starring Ioan Gruffudd and Robert Lindsay this is a dramatisation of C. S. Forester's classic maritime adventure."
