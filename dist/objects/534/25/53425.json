        "Describes life at the Vaganova Choreographic Institute in Leningrad (also known as the Kirov School of Leningrad), formerly the Imperial Ballet School of Russia, which has spawned dancers like Nureyev, Pavlova, Nijinsky, Baryshnikov, and Balanchine. Here at the school, gifted students are trained in classical ballet, using methods that have much in common with the training of ballet students anywhere in the world. Narrated by Princess Grace of Monaco and features Galina Messenzeva and Konstantine Zaklinsky of the Kirov Ballet. Ballet performances filmed and recorded live at the Kirov, Bolshoi and Maly Theatres, USSR."
