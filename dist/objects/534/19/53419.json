        "The Bolshoi Theatre Ballet performs Raymonda at the Bolshoi Theatre, music by Aleksandr Glazunov, scenario by Lydia Pashkova and Marius Petipa with original choreography by Marius Petipa and Aleksandr Gorsky, revised by Yuri Grigorovich. Raymonda (Natalya Bessmertnova) is to marry Jean de Brienne (Yuri Vasyuchenko), but the Saraceb knight, Abderakhman (Gediminas Taranda), forces his attention on her while her betrothed is on a crusade. At the last moment Jean returns, fights his rival and wins the hand of Raymonda. With a spectacular stage setting and costume design, powerful performances by the principal dancers, and the magical sound of the music of the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra conducted by Algis Zhuraitis."
