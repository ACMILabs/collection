        "Episode of Series \"Films of the great victory 1941-1945\". Amid the chaos of WW2, a young Russian soldier earns a pass home, for an act of heroism. En route he is detained constantly, as he helps others on their way, managing only the briefest of encounters with his forlorn mother, before returning to active duty. This acclaimed drama speaks of the hardship of war as experienced by the Russian people and of the sadness of separation. It also depicts the sensuality of youth, a theme previously denied Russian filmmakers, but allowed during the \"thaw\" as it was known, a period in the 1950s of Soviet cinema."
