        "This Cold War thriller stars real-life dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov as a Russian defector who finds himself trapped in his homeland when his plane crashes in Siberia. Billeted with an American dancer (Gregory Hines), Kolya is desperate to escape and hatches a daring plan but must evade the keen attentions of the KGB. Whilst the plot is fair to middling, the dancing in this feature film is brilliant, making the most of the two lead's spectacular talents. Also stars Helen Mirren and Isabella Rossellini."
