        "La Fanciulla del west, opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini with libretto by Guelfo Givinini and Carlo Zangarini and based on the play by David Balesco was performed at The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and starred world acclaimed opera singer Placido Domingo (Dick Johnson aka Ramirez the bandit). Adapted for television this penultimate opera of Puccini's, set in California during the Gold rush, is quite spectacular both in set design and costuming. Placido Domingo is superbly supported by Carol Neblett (Minnie, \"the girl of the Golden West\") and Silvano Carroli (Jack Rance, the sherrif) along with Robert Lloyd and Gwynne Howell. Features The Royal Opera Chorus and The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House conducted by Nello Santi. Sung in Italian."
