        "Mikhail Baryshnikov, one of the world's greatest and most admired ballet dancers stars in this romantic drama about an American ballet company's arrival in Italy to perform the romantic ballet 'Giselle'. Baryshnikov plays Tony (Anton) Sergeyev, lead dancer and director of the production, ladies' man, experienced and charming who finds himself attracted to the newest member of his troupe, the young and naive American teenager Lisa (Julie Kent). Art begins to mirror life as the drama of love and betrayal of 'Giselle' is played out backstage between Tony and Lisa. Features the dancers of the American Ballet Theater, Allesandra Ferri (Francesca), Leslie Browne (Nadine) and Mariangela Melato (the Contessa). 'Giselle' is conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, original music by Pino Donaggio."
