        "Episode of Series \"Films of the great victory 1941-1945\". Melancholy and sympathetic view of the tragedies suffered by a family man and WW2 POW survivor. Haunted by his experiences in a concentration camp the man has survived this appalling event by clinging to the hope of reuniting with his wife and child. Directed by, and also starring Sergei Bondarchuk, this was a successful film that with its unstinting humanism, proved the ability of Russian filmmakers to combine cinematic beauty with compassionate sentiment."
