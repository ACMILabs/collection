        "Computer animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures, artfully combined live action backgrounds with CGI pre-historic beasts. This family oriented adventure movie is about an orphaned dinosaur raised by lemurs. Years later when the inhabitants flee the continent, Aladar, as he is known, encounters his own kind for the first time. The landmark animation of this feature was highly praised for its attention to detail and awe-inspiring aesthetics. Features the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, Max Casella, Hayden Panettiere, and Sam Wright."
