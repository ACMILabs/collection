        "Using archival footage, stills, film excerpts and trailers, and television program footage this video puts together an excellent documentary about the career of one of America's most loved comedic entertainers and actors, Lucille Ball. From radio to motion pictures to eventually television where Lucy, partnered by her husband Desi Arnaz, starred in what is considered America's all-time favourite television series, \"I Love Lucy\". She has also starred with such actors as Eddie Cantor, the Three Stooges, the Marx Brothers, Bob Hope and Henry Fonda. Narrated by Jeff Lupeton."
