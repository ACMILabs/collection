        "Peter Sellers plays six different characters in this raunchy World War 2 comedy set in a Parisian brothel. When the Germans march into Paris, the redoubtable Madame Grenier and her girls bid a sad farewell to her clients, and prepares to welcome the occupying Germans. It is not long before Madame and her girls are working for the resistance which earns them, at war's end, the gratitude of a very amorous French President who presents Madame Grenier with a plague for the wall of her 'distinguished house'. Screenplay by Wolf Mankowitz from the play by Jean Anouilh. Cast also includes Dany robin, John Fraser, Cyril Cusack, Margaret Leighton, John le Mesurier, Prunella Scales."
