        "A tender tale about two lonely wanderers, ex-vaudevillian dancer Steps (Ron Moody) and the drifting Pritt (David Soul) who goes wherever the odd job will take him. Steps is on the road looking for his missing beloved friend, Spot the dancing dog, when he first encounters Pritt. The two strike up a friendship and find themselves in a series of misadventures as they hit the road to find the missing Spot. A story for the family - one with a happy ending."
