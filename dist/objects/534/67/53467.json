        "Based on Alan Ayckbourn's West End trilogy \"The Norman conquests\" and adapted for television, part two of the trilogy, \"Living together\" sees the irrepressible Norman (Tom Conti) continuing his pursuit of the various women in his family including his sister-in-law, his brother-in-law's wife and his own wife. The trilogy takes place over a weekend in the family's country house and features the same six characters in each play. Each story is played out through different eyes but the three plays together form the whole picture. Complex plot but contains some wonderful moments of wit and humour. Stars Richard Briers, Penelope Keith, David Troughton, Fiona Walker, Penelope Wilton."
