Lord Byron lives here: The discovery of scribblings by the great poet Byron leads Hancock to open his house as a stately home, exploit the American tourists and make a fortune at the same time. The Lift: What a captive audience has top put up with when Hancock tips the balance of one too many in the lift and the lift won't budge."
