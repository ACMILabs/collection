        "Episode of Series \"Films of the great victory 1941-1945\". By interspersing historical footage with fictional narrative, this film attempts to present the precarious fighting conditions for WW2 Russian bomber pilots. The filmmaker ably captures the taxing environment in which battles were conducted and the constant danger to those serving in the armed forces. It also depicts the fraught personal lives of the pilots, under strain from wartime conditions. Based on the stories by Yuri German."
