        "Based on Alan Ayckbourn's West End trilogy \"The Norman conquests\" and adapted for television, part three of the trilogy, \"Round and round the garden\" sees most of the drama set in the garden with a furtive Norman (Tom Conti) doing his best to spirit Annie away, Reg and Tom speculating on Norman's secretive love-life and Ruth (Norman's wife) happily sunbathing. The trilogy takes place over a weekend in the family's country house and features the same six characters in each play. Each story is played out through different eyes but the three plays together form the whole picture. Complex plot but contains some wonderful moments of wit and humour. Stars Richard Briers, Penelope Keith, David Troughton, Fiona Walker, Penelope Wilton."
