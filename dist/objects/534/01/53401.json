        "Episode of Series \"Films of the great victory 1941-1945\". Based on the book by Emmanuil Kazakevich, this film focuses on a group of Russian scouts in WW2, aiming to penetrate Nazi communications and thwart a major attack. Echoing the themes of Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" (2000), director Nikolai Lebedev presents war as chaotic, taxing and disorienting. At times quite claustrophobic, the film works best when presenting the dangerously fraught reconnaissance missions undertaken by the unit."
