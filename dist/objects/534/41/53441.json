        "Cementing his status as action hero leading man, Harrison Ford plays the United States President who also happens to be a Vietnam War hero. Trapped aboard his private jet, President Marshall must display a steely reserve in the face of unhinged kidnappers. Peterson (In the Line of Fire, The Perfect Storm, Troy) ably directs this mainstream thriller that produces a tangle of twists but lacks the enormous tension generated by his classic wartime nail-biter \"Das Boot\". Cast also includes Gary Oldman, Wendy Crewson, Paul Guilfoyle, Glenn Close, Dean Stockwell, William H. Macy."
