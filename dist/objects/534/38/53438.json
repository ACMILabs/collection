        "An adventure story about a noble lady and her orphans fighting to remain in their mansion after being threatened with eviction if the estate taxes are not paid. Lady St Edmund (Helen Hayes), aware of the legend about one of her ancestors supposedly having hidden a treasure of gold coins somewhere in the mansion, unwittingly finds herself a victim of a set-up by two unscrupulous characters, Bundage (Leo McKern) and Grimsworthy (Vivian Pickles), who also want to find the hidden money. Plotting and scheming the pair persuade a young urchin Casey (Jodie Foster), to help them by posing as Lady St Edmund's long-lost granddaughter. Features David Niven as Priory, Lady St Edmund's butler, gardener, chauffeur and right-hand man."
