        "Two military men from different eras collide when their submarine is engaged in possible nuclear warfare. Gene Hackman plays an old-school captain, fearsome to his staff and a stickler for rules; Denzel Washington plays Lt. Commander Ron Hunter, a Harvard graduate who believes preventing conflict is also the role of the armed forces. As these two face off over the possibility of war, tensions, egos and threats soar. Cast also includes James Gandolfini and Matt Craven."
