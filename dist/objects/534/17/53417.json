        "The story of one of Hollywood's most memorable and often bitter rivalries between Hedda Hopper (Jane Alexander) and Louella Parsons (Elizabeth Taylor). This made for television docudrama, based on the book \"Hedda and Louella\" by George Eells, is full of drama and comedy as these two very powerful women vie with each other to get the latest gossip or scandal in the glitzy Hollywood world of stars and stardom. Cast also includes Richard Dysart, Joyce Van Patten, Jon Cypher."
