        "Beginning as a British Army training film called \"The New lot\", this film was then expanded into a feature length film written by Eric Ambler and Peter Ustinov, entitled \"The Way ahead\" for its British audience and re-edited into a slightly shorter film entitled \"The Immortal battalion\" for an American audience. Its basic concept is as a recruiting and training film for the British Army mixing training and combat footage with filmed sequences. The storyline is about a bunch of raw recruits from a variety of backgrounds who are finally welded into a unified and disciplined regimental unit ready for battle. Stars David Niven, Stanley Holloway, Peter Ustinov, Trevor Howard."
