        "Big budget sci-fiction thriller from director Michael Bay is nothing less than a glorious onslaught of thrills, explosions and entirely employable, if increasingly unlikely, scenarios. Negative reviews (deriding its extravagance and silliness) did nothing to dent its box office haul. Cast includes Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Peter Stormare."
