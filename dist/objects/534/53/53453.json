        "Adapted from the play by Neil Simon, this film version stars two great actors, Walter Matthau and George Burns, as the two cantankerous old-time vaudevillians who have been persuaded to reunite one more time for a television special, despite the fact that they hate each other. Also stars Richard Benjamin."
