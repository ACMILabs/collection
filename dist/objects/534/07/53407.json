        "Episode of Series \"Films of the great victory 1941-1945\". Highly acclaimed Russian feature about a young boy, living in occupied territory, who joins the partisans to fight against the Nazis. An expressionistic work of great beauty that depicts abject horror, the narrative, based on true events, is framed as a coming-of-age story. The protagonist, a survivor through chance, is forced to repeatedly witness the awfulness of genocide, rape, destruction and evil, robbing him of youth, innocence and trust. Unforgettably poetic scenes reflect the brutality of victory, magnified through the eyes of a child. Adapted from the book by Ales Adamovich."
