        "Stanley Dum and Oliver Dee are well-meaning but brainless toymakers in Toyland. They misinterpret an order from Santa Claus for 600 one foot high toy soldiers and make instead 100 six feet high soldiers. But their toy army comes in handy when the evil Barnaby and his furry Bogeymen invade Toyland. Starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy along with Virginia Karns, Charlotte Henry, Felix Knight, Florence Roberts, Henry Kleinbach. A musical operetta."
