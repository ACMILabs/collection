        "Episode of Series \"Films of the great victory 1941-1945\". Set in WW2, Karelia, northwest Russia, this elegiac war drama is about a small group of female soldiers in training, who are unexpectedly called upon to face a Nazi patrol of paratroopers. The narrative sensitively portrays the women's camaraderie, as well as their pre-war domestic life, and spousal relationships. A fine ensemble cast heads what is widely regarded as powerful statement about war and society, and the sacrifices of ordinary citizens made in extraordinary times. Based on a true story and adapted from the book by Boris Vasilyev. Also known as \"At Dawn its quiet here\" and \"That Dawn should be peaceful\"."
