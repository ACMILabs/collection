        "Six weeks after her mother dies, Nancy Perkin's father remarries, and she is reluctantly sent off to boarding school. There she falls under the evil spell of a teacher, who hypnotises her, converting Nancy to vampirism! In the third instalment of his horror trilogy (that includes \"I was a teenage werewolf\" and \"I was a teenage Frankenstein\" both 1957), producer Herman Cohen continues to trade on the themes of teen disenchantment and conflict between the rock and roll generation and their square parents. There is even a proto-feminist theme in this film, borne out by the ambitious teacher who seeks to prove herself in a man's world. Predictably she meets a sticky end, not only as the villain of the piece, but also perhaps as a warning to meddlesome females."
