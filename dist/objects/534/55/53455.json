        "This made for television theatre production stars two highly acclaimed actors, one British the other American, in what is a most thought provoking and intriguing piece of drama about two men and their shared love of one woman over a period of 40 years. Laurence Olivier is Joe Halpern, the husband, and Jackie Gleason plays Ernest Johnson, the man who is in love with Halpern's wife. Written by Lionel Goldstein."
