        "The role played by farmers' co-operatives in the farming community: illustrated in particular by the progress of one flourishing society established in 1911, and operating in the border country of England and Scotland. Bulk buying and processing, communal marketing, depots for engineers and other supplies, agricultural pharmacies, and such specialised services as aerial spraying are among its many activities."
