        "The animated story of a carved saint who is accidentally changed into a sailor and sold as a figurehead on a sailing ship. A beautiful mermaid falls in love with him, but even when the ship is destroyed and he joins her under the sea, he does not respond because he feels that, beneath his paint, he remains a saint. Based on the poem by Crosbie Garstin."
