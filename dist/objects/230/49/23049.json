        "A film about Paul, a normal five-year-old and his well-intentioned parents. In a series of episodes typical of those arising in families with small children, it shows how Paul's fears are related to his feelings about his parents. Fears not only prevent him from enjoying experiences other boys enjoy, but tend to widen the gap of mnisunderstanding between him and his parents. The film points out that Paul's feelings are common to children of his age and may be accentuated when parents become either unduly protective or over severe."
