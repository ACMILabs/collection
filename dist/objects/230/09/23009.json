        "An artistic treatment of what constitutes a change in the philosophy of family housing. Made from still photographs and nostalgic Victorian paintings, and based on an essay by the distinguished Canadian architect Humphrey Carver, the film contrasts the traditional romantic image of the home as domicile from cradle to grave with the needs of today's more transient urban population. The film is designed to stimulate thought and discussion about housing and town planning."
