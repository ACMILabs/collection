        "Episode of Series \"21st Century\". Neurotic behaviour is just a bad habit that can be unlearned. This is the basis of a contronversial psychotherapeutic technique developed by Drs Thomas Stampfi and Donald Lewis. In the film, a 23 year-old secretary is treated with a bombardment of the terrifying situation she fears most. According to Stampfi and Lewis, facing fear head-on breaks down the neurosis so she can relearn what may make her happiest."
