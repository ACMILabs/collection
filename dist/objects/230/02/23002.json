        "Family life as lived by a father, mother, two children and a grandmother is depicted. They are not in affluent circumstances and conflicts arise because the father wants to repair the house, mother wants a sewing machine, and the daughter a ball dress. They get together and talk out their problems; by so doing they strengthen the bonds of family life and create a sense of security among themselves."
