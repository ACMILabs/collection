        "An invitation to experience the thrill of spinning, jumping, skimming, and dancing on winged feet. The film shows how Canada's champions do it. Maria and Otto Jelinek, Don Jackson, Wendy Griner and Don McPherson appear briefly in dazzling exhibition, but the main object of the film is to show that figure skating is for everyone - children, young people, and adults."
