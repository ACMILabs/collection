    "description": [
        "Shot at a Mildura television station. Details how an episode of 'On the Land' is broadcast by inter-cutting between an installment of the programme and conventional 'behind the scenes' footage of a television studio. This includes shots of a camera operator, the television station's studio, vision-switching and so on.  Actual 'On the Land' programme featured, contains information on good seeds to sow and non-hormonal spraying techniques. Contains exterior shots of an orchid.  Film opens with exterior shots of Mildura that begin at river and then move into more general street scenes. This lasts for two minutes."
