        "Part of the French Language Series, this is the story of the film \"French children\" told in simple French by a teacher-narrator, born in France. Told in the present tense and avoiding all subjunctives, the narration is levelled at the needs of beginners and provides practice in the understanding of spoken French. The film portrays family life on a farm in Brittany. It illustrates the work of each member of the family and includes scenes of the village school and a neighbouring town."
