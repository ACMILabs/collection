        "Describes aspects of the life of an Indian family near Benares in the fertile Ganges Valley. The film shows methods of farming used in different seasons and emphasises the dependence of most Indians on the soil for their supply of food. Crop failure means starvation. A visit to the city of Benares is shown and the religious rituals observed at the sacred Ganges River are described. The film illustrates aspects of both country and city life in the Ganges Valley."
