        "The death of a child is dramatised to show the living conditions in an under-developed area in Latin America. People surrounded by potential wealth live in poverty, starvation and ignorance. Technical assistance by the United Nations will help to eliminate the conditions responsible for the death of this child, through the economic development of such areas."
