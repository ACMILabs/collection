        "An 18 year-old boy leaves home against his parents' wishes to work in a summer theatre. This aggravates the tense family atmosphere which results from an over-anxious and over-possessive mother and a father who is frustrated and withdrawn into himself. They both agree to seek help from a social case-worker who helps them to continue marriage as responsible adults. When the teenage daughter wishes to go out with someone of whom mother does not approve, father is able to persuade mother that the girl should be allowed to make her own mistakes."
