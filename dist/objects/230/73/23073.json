        "With animation by Norman McLaren, this experimental film is described as a film fantasy of dancing music and dancing colour. It is an abstract interpretation in colour of the music \"Listen to the Mocking Bird\" played by an old time fiddler and recorded on the soundtrack. Norman McLaren, painting on film, translates sound into sight, resulting in colours rippling, flowing, flickering and blending along with the music. (Awards: Brussels; Rome; Salerno)."
