        "Episode of Series \"This Modern Age\". A survey of the educational facilities available to the British citizen. The examination begins with the Universities: increased attendance, coupled with a shortage of accommodation, has created a situation in which professors and tutors have less time for research and personal tuition so vital to university life. The film also discusses the technical training colleges and the facilities provided by the local authorities for vocational training. The last secion deals with adult education and the organisations that are responsible for the provision of expert tuition in a wide variety of subjects."
