        "The Fauves were a group of artists centred around Henri Matisse, who worked together for a period of two years. The style was a mixture of technique with features derived from Sevrat, Van Gogh and later, Gauguin. The Fauves proclaimed the value of the formal elements in a painting. Their ideas greatly influenced the course of twentieth century art intended to be a stimulating resource material for senior art students. Music by Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin and Alan Hovhaness."
