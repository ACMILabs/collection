        "A dramatised story of what a low-rental housing project can mean to the people who once shared aged, sub-standard dwellings. A before-and-after picture about people in a large-scale public housing project in Toronto, who, because of the housing shortage, had been forced to live in squalid, dingy flats, all-purpose rooms, and ramshackle houses on a crowded street in Regent Park North. These people were freed through housing development to inhabit new, modern dwellings planned to give a measure of privacy, light and air."
