        "A film aimed at youngsters tempted by cigarettes but also for all those already addicted. Why a man suffering from emphysema has difficulty breathing is graphically illustrated. The entire respiratory system is shown in animated cross-sectional models, down to the smallest air cells, the alveoli. That is where the breakdown begins that eventually leads to impaired pulmonary function. This internal view of the damage done to the lungs is one that no viewer can ignore."
