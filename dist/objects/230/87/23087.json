        "How one American locality took up the fight for better schools. Statistics point to the general problems faced by America, which are exemplified by conditions in Arlington County, Virginia. Citizens there who became alive to the weaknesses of the local education system met only indifference until they showed the overcrowding and lack of facilities. Their action led to the election of new committees, new schools, new facilities and programs, and better pay for teachers."
