        "The Florentine painter Sandro Botticelli was one of the greatest products of the Renaissance. His sinuous and telling outlines are so exceptionally decorative and expressive that they place his work amongst the finest creations in the history of art. His admiration of classical art is most powerfully evident in his recreation of \"Calumny\", a lost masterpiece painted by a Greek artist Apelles in the third Century B.C. \"The Calumny\" is the centre point of the film around which the developing style of Botticelli is examined."
