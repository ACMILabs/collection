        "Shows common problems of adolescents and their parents. A moody 15 year-old girl clashes with her parents when they frustrate her efforts to \"run her own life\". Mistakes by the parents, such as scolding her in front of her young escort, widen the rift between parents and daughter. Conditions improve when the girl's teacher arranges a thorough discussion of adolescent problems, bringing more tolerance to both sides."
