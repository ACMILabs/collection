        "Kimberley country music has its own unique style and is promoted each year through the Derby Country Music Festival where musicians from as far as Halls Creek, Fitzroy Crossing, Port Hedland and the desert area of the Kimberleys gather together and compete in the Festival Talent Quest. The Country Music Festival, through organisers such as Pam Masters (Festival Committee Member) and Cyril Archer (Festival Talent Quest Co-ordinator), provides assistance and support to aspiring indigenous singers, songwriters and musicians. Geoffrey Fletcher, Kathleen Cox and Ashley Oobagooma talk about their background, their family and their passion for music as they each prepare for the journey to Derby and the Festival. The film concludes with performances by each of these three musicians at the Festival along with footage of the Benning Brothers, Fitzroy Express, Pigram Brothers, Gulingi Nunga, Kevin Gunn and Lucy Cox on stage. Beautifully photographed, particularly of the Australian landscape, and interesting and entertaining interviews along with some great country music."
