        "For the family on a camping vacation for the first time, or even for the experienced camper, this color film is a congenial and informative guide. It shows popular forms of camping: site camping; a hiking trip; canoe camping in the backwoods; cruise camping through more travelled waters; and trail riding in the Rockies. Each is seen to have its own attractions."
