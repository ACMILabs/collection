        "This film is more that a record of Goya's work; it is also an interpretation of the philosophy of the man himself. Two sharply differing aspects are depicted: in \"The Feast of St Isidore\" Goya sketched the festivities in Madrid, the excitement of the bullfight and the mixed adoration and fear in the faces of the people at the evening procession of the Virgin; in \"The Horrors of War\" Goya depicted all the cruelty, fear and violence of the Napoleonic invasion and the grief and pain which followe it. The film concludes with a vision of drawings showing the sadness and futility of human existence."
