        "When Dr. Cortum, a devout Catholic and a medical doctor, discovered that his 18 year old daughter Michelle was experimenting with drugs he asked her to leave home rather than give a bad example to their younger children. Eventually she joined the Society For Krishna Consciousness and her lifestyle is now considerably more disciplined than before. Explores through candid interviews the past and present relationship of Dr Cortum and his daughter. Also examines what it means to stand for one's beliefs or moral principles."
