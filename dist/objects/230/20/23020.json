        "Illustrates the geographical features of the Faroe Islands, showing how they affect the lives of the inhabitants, making farming difficult. Highland pastures afford grazing for large flocks of sheep and a few horses and cows. The wool is plucked by hand and carded, spun and woven in the farm houses. Extensive fishing operations are a mainstay of the economy of the islands."
