        "This episode of 'Transit' is the ninth in a series of ten-quarter hour episodes produced by Northern Access Television in 1998. 'Transit' was a series of Community TV programs produced about Melbourne's and Victoria's Public Transport System and Transport Museum Groups by Michael Costello, a former Melbourne Tram Conductor. Other episodes included episodes on the Bendigo and Ballarat Tramway Museums, the Melbourne Transit Band, the Tramcar Restaurant and many others. In the 1998 series, various members of Northern Access TV assisted in the production of the programs. The programs were all made using volunteers from Northern Access TV on Mini DV cameras. This episode looks at the SteamRail Workshops, located in the former Newport Railway Workshops. It consists of an interview where David McLauchlan interviews Keith Finlay, secretary of SteamRail Victoria Inc. This non-profit volunteer based association aims to preserve Victoria's steam powered rail heritage and keep examples of them running for public tours to many destinations on Victoria's Rail Network. In addition to preserving the days of steam-powered trains, the group also has sections that are dedicated to preserving Diesel and Electric rolling stock as well. During the interview, we see examples of the work undertaken on the carriages and associated equipment."
