        "The year 2000 saw water in the normally dry Lake Eyre. Life flourished there. But nearby, uranium mining was poisoning the land, and sucking millions of litres of artesian water each day. If Sydney was the headquarters for the Olympic Games, the shores of Lake Eyre was the base for a group of peace activists. In June of that year, two very different journeys commenced. One was the journey of the Olympic Torch and the other was a walk by group of people carrying a sacred fire with them, who wanted to spread the message of peace. This documentary explores the beginnings of both journeys. It presents the start of the Olympic Torch relay through another perspective and shows what wasn't seen by a global Olympic audience - a walk by a small group of people from the the shores of Lake Eyre to Sydney to raise awareness about nuclear issues and promote peace. The decision to do some filming was made in Coober Pedy two days before the Olympic Torch Relay commenced. In an old Subaru station wagon, Melbourne-based Sam de Silva, Michael Lumsdon and 'Fergus' travelled to Uluru, Alice Springs and Lake Eyre Peace Camp over a period of 3 days to document the story of the Olympic Flame and the Peace Fire. An Access News story. Voice over by Alex Kelly."
