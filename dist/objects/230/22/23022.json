        "An experimental feminist film which questions the goals of love and romance as a woman's ultimate fulfillment. Emma, vivacious but suicidal terrorist is reunited with Cecily, her old school chum. They meet a 'bionic bike dyke' called stretch and break open the jelly beans. Will they stretch a point over the pool table? Will tap-dancing and vaginal exercises be enough for Cecily? Will Emma metamorphose into Esther Williams? True romance. Cast includes Radda Jordan, Helen Pankhurst."
