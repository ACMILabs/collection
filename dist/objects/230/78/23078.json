        "Records the construction and the official opening of the Sydney Opera House. Joern Utzon, the Danish architect provides the commentary and says: \"One could not design a building for such an exposed position without paying attention to the roof, one must have a fifth facade\". Exterior sequences of the Opera House are blended with scenes of rehearsals."
