        "A dilemma of identity, Toilette is a black comedy account in clay animation of a woman uncertain of who she is. A facless female figure examines herself in a mirror. Unhappy with her appearance, she pats and pulls and reshapes her features. Throughout the film she experiments with various outfits, make-up and wigs. Nothing pleases her, and in the end she reverts to anonymity and returns to bed defeated."
