        "An extraordinary moving story about Michael, his hundred year old great-great Aunt Dew, and his mother, and the \"big ugly old box\". The box holds a small sack with a hundred pennies, each a memory of a year of Aunt Dew's life. Michael likes to count the pennies and listen to the stories that each year evokes. When his mother, burdened by the care of a failing old lady who disrupts the order of her house, wants to get rid of the big ugly old box, Michael is fiercely defiant. His small boy understanding of Aunt Dew is vastly greater than his mother's. Based on the book by Sharon Bell Mathis."
