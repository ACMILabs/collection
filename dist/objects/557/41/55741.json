        "This film combines animation and live-action to outline the variety and purpose of clothing. The development of fabrics from the early use of grasses, leaves, skins and furs is followed by scenes from early film clips showing industrialisation in textile-making and the manufacturing of synthetic fibres and cloth. Includes footage showing the mass production of jeans (Levi Strauss). Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
