        "Defines terms such as work, mechanical advantage, and simple machine. Also describes the six types of simple machines and their functions; the lever, the pulley, the inclines plane, the wedge and the wheel and axle. Explains how the use of a simple machine can help our lives, such as the crane by lifting objects from one place to another, the conveyer belt moving ore up- hill to a crusher or grain to a silo. We use simple machines in our everyday lives without being aware of it, unless we look."
