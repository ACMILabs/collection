        "Explores the ways in which the social and technological changes of the 19th century led writers to think of the future world as a very different world from the present. Shows the themes which pre-occupied Victorians were taken up by writers of predicive fiction and projected into the 20th century and beyond. Shows excerpts from \"Things to come\" and book illustrations from \"War of the worlds\" and \"Time machine\". Presented by Simon Eliot. Novel excerpts read by Patrick Troughton. Suitable for secondary level."
