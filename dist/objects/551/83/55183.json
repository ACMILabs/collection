        "The relationship of mass and distance to the force of gravity are explored by careful duplicating of Cavendish's and Boy's experiments. Understanding gravity helps us to explain the movements of the planets and the changes in weight of astronauts as they land on the moon. Suitable for upper secondary levels."
