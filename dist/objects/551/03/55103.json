        "An examination of the writing and philosophy of Albert Camus. This documentary traces the genesis of Camus' existentialism in his relationship to the geography and culture of Algeria. Born of French parents but growing up among Arabs, Camus' exploration of the agony of human separation reflects his own dichotomous identity. This film also includes a filmed conversation with the writer in which he talks about his love for theatre, football and the importance of achieving personal happiness in a world in which we are condemned to suffer the agonising silence of the unknown Universe. Excerpts from his novels and essays are read throughout the film."
