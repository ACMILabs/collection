        "Discusses the problems arising from living in high-rise developments. These include high noise-levels and lack of playing-space for children. An architect shows plans for high-density housing which should overcome these problems while still providing housing for many people in relatively small areas. Set in Melbourne, Victoria. Narrated by Wynn Roberts. Suitable for secondary years 7-12."
