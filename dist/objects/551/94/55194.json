        "A series of demonstrations reveal the properties that enabled man to harness light to his needs. The experiments illustrate the way light moves, is refracted and how a prism separates light into the spectrum of colours. Ends with a look at recent technological advances, in particular the laser. Suitable for upper primary science."
