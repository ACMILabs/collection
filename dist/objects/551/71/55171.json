        "From his epic \"Guernica\" to some of his last works. This film spans some thirty years of Picasso's art. It includes many unfamiliar works as well as some unique live sequences of the artist in his studio near Cannes. NOTE: Film content is worthy of viewing but print condition is poor with excessive colour fade (pinkish-red tones)."
