        "Many examples demonstrate how teachers can use mini-calculators to motivate and augment learning, check student work, explore number patterns and sequences, examine decimals, estimate solutions and stimulate mathematical curiosity and creativity. Students are shown in class and on field trips as they solve a variety of problems with the calculator. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
