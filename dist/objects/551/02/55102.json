        "This film shows the capacity of the camera to suspend or speed up the viewer's perception of motion. It is a film without words or people, where the screen is alive with light, movement and sound. Fleeting impressions are greatly accelerated as from the windows of a speeding train. The sun rockets through a vortex of clouds, light flickers -- all to the shythm of chattering wheels."
