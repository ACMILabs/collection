        "In a tale designed to probe the many facets of perception, a young man buys a box with a mirrored bottom and sees in it the face of his dead father. On opening the box his wife sees a young rival and a holy woman sees another holy woman. Are our own perceptions distorted by self-images? Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
