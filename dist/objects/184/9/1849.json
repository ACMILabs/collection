        "'Basilisk' is an interactive CD-Rom that operates as a conceptual journey into an ancient illustrated philosophical text and an imaginary bestiary. Through labryinthine visuals and language, 'Basilisk' charts a fiction of the genesis of the male as a queered perspective on subjectivity. As the artists state: \"It derives its intensities from an alchemistry of mediaeval marvels and a bricolage of contemporary nomadic thought... Basilisk diagrams the multiple relations that converge upon a making of the male that is monstrous and virtual. As a queered perspective on subjectivity, it derives itself from a hybrid relation between the alchemistry of wonder and a wander in the fourfold thought of the subject in Felix Guattari's philophical text 'Chaosmosis'.\""
