        "Manicured lawns...immaculate houses...clean streets...but beneath this highly desirable exterior lurks the desperation of the bored, the scared, the paranoid and the violent. And when the tranquil suburban life of the Goldings and the Bates deteriorates into chaos, they choose not to speak about it. Winner of Silver Hugo, Best short drama, Chicago International Film Festival, USA, 1991."
