        "'Recovering Hope' captures the personal stories of women who fled their homeland Vietnam for a new life in Australia. Sinking boats, pirates and transit camps were experiences for many as they made the dangerous journey. This Digital Storytelling project, in partnership with VicHealth and Belgium Street Neighbourhood House, marks the 30th anniversary of the first wave of migration."
