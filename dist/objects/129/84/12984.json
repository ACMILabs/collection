        "A lot of people made sacrifices in an attempt to free South Sudan from civil war. Nychuat and her family now live in Australia but they are deeply connected to Sudan and in honour and respect for those that have made sacrifices, they work tirelessly to support the freedom movement in Sudan. This story explores Nychaut's relationship with her two countries, Australia and Sudan."
