        "Mui Mui's family fled China to Saigon and with the fall of Saigon they experience persecution and are again forced to flee. The journey from Vietnam to Australia is rough and dangerous with time spent in appalling conditions in a camp in Malaysia. Mui Mui reflects on how she and her family worked hard to adapt to a new country and create a new life. Made at ACMI as part of the 'Recovering Hope' Digital Storytelling project, in partnership with VicHealth and Belgium Street Neighbourhood House."
