        "This single-channel tape is a remix of the video component of the installation NT YT FREE STYLES. X-PRZ constructs a powerful collage of rap music, authorial text, and iconic visuals to confront the politics of race in the context of the American media. Cokes writes,`Slick and easily legible Pop surface: deploying the Black male media projection as central model, heroic figure, and exploited buffoon of fear-mongers in the media. Moving images: clips from Gangsta rap videos, LA Rebellion 1992, the 'Jam' Michael Jackson/Michael Jordon video and other film sources.Sound: Adapted from the 'Murder was the Case' soundtrack with works by Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Doggy Dog.'"
