        "Christopher (Colin Friels) is sure he really likes psychology - but not the way it is taught at his university. Professor Wiseman, his tutor, is a disciple of the eminent European pyschologist, Professor Eisenbach - a cold rational behaviourist whose books are always cited as authorities. As a joke, Christopher and his girlfriend decide that he will impersonate Eisenbach and teach Professor Wiseman a lesson. Co-written by PJ Hogan (Muriel's Wedding). Also features Tracy Mann."
