        "Produced as an educational and informative video, \"World War I: cause and effect\" is made up of archival film footage, stills, drawings, maps and human stories and as such, presents an overall historical and comprehensive view in a direct and easy to follow format. The program is divided into sections beginning with \"The Road to war 1870-1914\", followed by segments (approx. 8 mins each) on each individual year of the War, upto 1918, and finally ending with \"New world order\". It is designed to create discussion about World War I, what led up to it, which nations were involved and why, the social and political implications, the change in the nature of combat due to new weapons, submarines and planes, and the effect of the Treaty of Versailles in relation to World War II. Also provides background details on some of the major leaders and perpetrators involved with the War, eg Kaiser Wilhelm II, Nicholas II, Douglas Haig, Von Hindenburg, T.E. Lawrence, Von Richthofen. Narrated by Daniel Dorse. (Includes Teacher support notes)"
