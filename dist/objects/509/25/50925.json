        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". 'Beneath the veil' charts British reporter Saira Shah's terrifying journey into Afghanistan at the height of Taliban rule. After two decades of war and four years of Taliban rule, Shah's documentary captures images of a country that has literally been blown to bits. Afghani citizens, especially women, live in a world of constant fear and terror. Legal public executions take place in front of thousands for crimes such as murder, adultery, prostitution and homosexuality. As a direct result of Taliban rule, woman and children without a 'breadwinner' in the family are forced to beg for food or starve. 'Beneath the veil' shows a country in moral meltdown, where the suffrage of humans is silenced by the paranoid demands of a fundamentalist religion in all its extremes. Contains graphic and disturbing images throughout with raw images of the daily life under the repressive regime, including public executions."
