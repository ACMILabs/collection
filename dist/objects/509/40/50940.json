        "A young Chinese man, disillusioned by life in London, shelters the daughter of a brutish prize fighter, whom he has adored at a distance. Her father, alerted by an informer, comes after them. This is a deceptively simple chamber piece (most of it takes place in two interior sets) in contrast to the epic scale of Intolerance and Birth of a Nation. Griffith's ties with Victorian theatre and literature were blended with the visual resources of the cinema in a new lyrically intense romanticism, the perfect context for Gish's unforgettable portrayal of quiet vulnerability complemented by Barthelmess's gentle emotionalism. Tinted version with musical soundtrack. Cast: Lillian Gish, Richard Barthelmess, Donald Crisp."
