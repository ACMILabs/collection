        "Presents an historical overview of the tragic circumstances which took place during the Gallipoli campaign in 1915 including a background profile of the lead-up to this most infamous battle. The Straits of the Dardanelles, a strategic key to the battle for Constantinople proved to be a watery graveyard for many Allied naval ships and cost the lives of over 500,000 soldiers from both the Allies and the Turks. A fatal mistake made by the Allies was to underestimate the determination and resourcefulness of the Turks who were prepared to defend their land at all costs. Covers in detail, the assault on the Gallipoli Peninsula by the ANZACs on 25 April 1915 through to the final decision by the British to withdraw on 7 December 1915. One poignant moment stands out in this horrific account of the Gallipoli campaign - on 24 May 1915, a ceasefire was called and both the ANZACs and the Turkish soldiers worked together to bury their dead (numbering in thousands). For just a moment the two sides came together in mutual respect and admiration for each other as soldiers, even parting on friendly terms before finally being ordered back into battle against each other once more. A thread running through the documentary is the battleships lost at sea. Underwater photography of the remains of many of these ships is included. Also includes stills, newsreel and archival film footage, and a detailed retelling through the words of historians, experts and the actual soldiers who fought in the Gallipoli campaign. Narrated by David Ritchie. Teacher notes included. Suitable for middle secondary level. Note: This is the English version produced by SBS Australia in 2001."
