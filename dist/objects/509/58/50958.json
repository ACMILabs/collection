        "A country girl is tricked into a fake marriage by a lecherous playboy. He deserts her when she becomes pregnant. After the death of the baby she seeks refuge in the house of a puritanical squire. The melodramatic cliche of the original play is transformed, suffused with the timelessness of myth by Griffith and the principal players. The extraordinary delicacy and intensity of Gish is well complemented by the playing of Barthelmess as the country boy. The final scenes of fragility against the elements in the blizzard and on the icefloe (filmed at some risk to Gish and Barthelmess) is a tour-de-force of staging, composition and editing. Based on the play by Lottie Blair Parker, William Brady and Joseph R. Grisner. Cast includes Lillian Gish, Richard Barthelmess and Lowell Sherman. With musical soundtrack recorded in 1928 by Louis Silvers. This version was fully restored by film historian David Shepard."
