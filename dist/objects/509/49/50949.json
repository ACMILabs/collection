        "Henry V, young king of medieval England, roused his troops to arms against a French army five times greater than themselves. His life and leadership was legendary. From the above story, William Shakespeare wrote one of his greatest plays. Kenneth Branagh, whose stage portrayal of Henry V has been world-acclaimed, made his film directorial debut with this film. Also starring Paul Scofield, Derek Jacobi, Judi Dench and Christian Bale, the film loses none of the power and beauty of Shakespeare's text."
