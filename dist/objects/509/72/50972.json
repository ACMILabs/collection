        "Formed in 1982, Roar Studios and the Roar group became synonymous with expressionism, abstract art and the emergence of a new group of talented young Australian artists that helped alter the future course of the teaching and exhibition of art in Australia. This was achieved through the breakdown of the stifling mores of the Australian art world of the time. Through interviews with artists from the original Roar group at a reunion exhibition at Roar 2 in the 1990s, critical discussion of the social circumstances and firm philosophies of the group as well as their key works, this program is an insightful study of one of the first artist run galleries and studios in Melbourne. It explores the experiences, international and local interests, and the diversity of artistic styles but shared influences of the artists who made it happen. It also discusses the significant impact of Roar on the facilitation of exhibitions for women and ethnic artists and on the emergence of an independent Australian art. The Roar artists profiled and interviewed include David Larwill, Pasquale Giardino, Stephen McCarthy, Jill Noble, Tony Mighell, Sarah Faulkner, Mark Howson, Peter Ferguson and Trevor Hoppen. The 26 minute documentary is followed by 20 minutes of extended viewing of stills of key artworks."
