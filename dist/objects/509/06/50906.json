        "A short 50s newsreel with a light-hearted commentary, filmed at Cyprus Gardens in Florida, featuring male and female bathing beauties demonstrating a selection of water skiing styles. Begins with groups of young boys and girls learning to ski, followed by examples of the different types of skis. The films proceeds to adult skiers such as champion Alfredo Medoza (also referred to as the Mexican Jumping Bean) demonstrating a variety of jumps. Also features champion and innovative skier Willa McGuire performing the technique she originated known as swivel skiing, combining ballet with water skiing."
