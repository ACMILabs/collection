        "Directed by Steve Jacobs and set in 1960, \"La Spagnola\" is one family's story of the migrant experience in Australia. Lola (Lola Marceli) is a beautiful, tempestuous Spanish woman living in a remote industrial town with her boorish husband, Ricardo (Simon Palomares), and their teenage daughter, Lucia (Alice Ansara). When Ricardo decides to leave her for his Australian mistress, Lola is left destitute and pregnant turns violent and vengeful. Her daughter, sensitive, lonely, mocked at school, and confused by her mother's anger toward her, seeks refuge in an aunt and tries to reconcile with her absent father. Lola is driven by a quest for revenge against the two who have robbed her of her only security in a strange land. Lola and Lucia, each striking out hatefully at the other, are on a collision course, plotting their separate plans for vengeance. Also starring Alex Dimitriades as a local playboy, romantically interested in both mother and daughter. Mostly in Spanish, with Italian and English, and with English subtitles."
