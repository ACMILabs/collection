        "With psychosis, paranoia and the blurring of the distinction between madness and sanity at its centre, Caligari can be seen thematically as a distant forerunner to the psycho-horror sub genre. A sinister hypnotist, Dr. Caligari, exhibits his creature, a somnambulist named Cesare, at the town fair. When a series of bizarre murders follow, Dr. Caligari is accused of using the somnambulist to commit the murders. A silent masterpiece, \"The Cabinet of Dr Caligari\" features macabre theatrical-style set designs influenced by German Expressionism. The intention of the filmmakers was to expand the notion of cinema beyond its quest for re-creation of reality. These elaborate and haunting sets serve as a touchstone for the characters' inner turmoil. This version features the original colourisation with green, brown and blue tints. Cast includes Werner Krauss, Conrad Veidt, Friedrich Feher, Lil Dagover, Rudolf Lettinger."
