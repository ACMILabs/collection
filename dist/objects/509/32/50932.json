        "This Anglo-American musical/comedy \"Happy go lovely\" is set in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the Edinburgh festival. A desperate theatre director is staving off creditors and his production hangs in the balance when his leading star quits. None of his crew have been paid properly and are demanding remuneration. Janet Jones (Vera Ellen) is a chorus girl mistaken for the fiancee of local multi-millionaire B.G. Bruno. As a result she is promoted to leading lady and showered in gifts from local dress stores. Rumours drift back to Bruno about Miss Jones and when he calls on her she mistakes him for a reporter, Charlie. As Charlie/Bruno woos Janet complications ensue in a classic case of mistaken identity. The film features numerous song and dance sequences, many of which are in the style of ballet."
