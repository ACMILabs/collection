        "Inside the Australian ballet examines the people behind the Australian Ballet Company. Consisting of 68 dancers, performing over 180 shows a year, the company is one of the hardest working in the world. With interviews throughout of some of the company's top dancers (past and present), this documentary illustrates the hardship and dedication demanded from all dancers involved. The documentary looks at some of the artistic achievements of the Company, the artistic process itself, psychological motivations, physical injury and psychological health and frames this in terms of career management and personal aspirations. Featured artists: Steven Heathcote, Miranda Coney, David McAllister, Justine Summers, Lisa Bolte, Matthew Trent, Nicole Rhodes, Geon Van Der Wyst, Lindy Wills, Daryl Brandwood, Shane Placentino, Sarah Peace, Jason Duff. With excerpts from the following productions: Bella Figura, Mirror Mirror, Coppelia, The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude. Narrated by Rod Young."
