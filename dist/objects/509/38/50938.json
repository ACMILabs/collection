        "Keaton's best, and arguably the greatest screen comedy ever made. Against a meticulously evoked Civil War background, Buster risks life, limb and love as he pursues his beloved railway engine, hijacked by Northern spies up to no good for the Southern cause. The result is everything one could wish for; witty, dramatic, visually stunning, full of subtle, delightful human insights, and constantly hilarious. Cast includes Buster Keaton and Marion Mack."
