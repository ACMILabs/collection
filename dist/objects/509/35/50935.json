        "A journey into Ludwig van Beethoven's incredible life of music starring Carl Boehm, an Austrian actor-classical pianist, as Beethoven. The story begins in 1792 in Vienna where Beethoven, aged 22, is studying music and composition under one of the music masters of the time, Joseph Haydn. It is Beethoven's early period when his enthusiasm is ahead of his ability, particularly in the high classical style, but it is also a time for him to establish himself as a pianist and a composer and earn an income. Beethoven struggled for many years to be accepted by the music discerning public and it was not until he composed his dramatic and tumultuous Symphony No. 5 that he eventually was widely acclaimed by his audience and became recognised on an international level. Now begins his middle period (around 1809 onwards), a time of prolific creativity and writing of symphonies, piano concertos and chamber music. However Beethoven also discovers that he has a hearing disorder that will eventually lead to profound deafness. So follows a period of torment, self-isolation and despair until an encounter and subsequent friendship with a young blind boy awakens Beethoven's creative spirit to lead him into the late period of his musical career, a calmer and more mature period. The film climaxes with the \"piece de resistance\", Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. Cast also includes Giulia Rubini and Ivan Desny."
