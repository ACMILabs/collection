        "This documentary focuses on Kade Farlow Collins a teenage FTM (female to male transgendered person) residing in Tucson, Arizona. At the age of fourteen Kade (then Kate), supported by her family, began the process of transitioning from female to male. Drawing on his personal narrative the film follows Kade's transition over a two year period. Friends and family candidly express their feelings about the transition, the changes in Kade and the impact on everyone involved. A moving story of some of the difficulties facing transgendered youth, as well as a portrayal of acceptance and understanding."
