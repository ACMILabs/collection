        "Stung by criticism of racism after \"The Birth of a nation\", director D.W. Griffith made amends with his next feature \"Intolerance\". Set over the ages, this is an epic silent film, a tale of misguided human nature expressed through the themes of intolerance, hypocrisy and treachery. The film consists of four tales: A modern story (a poor but loving family are persecuted by a group of judgemental women who seek to take the couple's small child, fearing its neglect); A Judean story (relates the last days of Jesus Christ); A French story (set in 15th century, detailing the persecution of the Huguenots by Catherine de Medici); A Babylonian story (traces the defeat of King Belshazzar by the hordes of Cyrus the Persian). The four stories are interwoven, which makes for challenging viewing, and on this DVD, the option exists to watch the four narratives separately. Griffith used a variety of tinted film stock for dramatic effect on a scale seldom equalled in silent cinema. One of the most influential films in the history of cinema, the four stories culminate in a climax of cross cutting. Each drama illustrates the operation and catastrophic consequences of intolerance."
