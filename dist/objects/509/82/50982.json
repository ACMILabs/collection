        "Part 1 of a 6 part series \"The History of football\" (or soccer as it is known in Australia) is an informative documentary that utilises extensive archival footage and a slew of revelatory interviews with key figures (including historians, players and coaches) in order to examine various aspects of the game. \"Origins\" This episode draws attention to the origins of the game of football - from ancient times to the playing fields of Victorian England, emerging as a sport with global popularity. Interviews include Hugo Sanchez and Alfredo di Stefano. \"Football cultures\" Each nation that has embraced football has done so in unique and idiosyncratic cultural ways. This program follows football's role within international cultures. Spotlights include: the 1998 World Cup match between US and Iran; acceptance of soccer in Iran; conflicts between Iran and Iraq, on the field and off; the history and meaning of football in Africa - where football remains a hugely popular sport, despite the frustrations of making an impact at the World Cup level. Also addresses the rise of soccer in the US where it has become one of the chosen sports among the upper classes, which has had a trickle down effect; also touches on the history of soccer in Spain. Interviews include: Luis Suarez, Carles Rexach, Jose Angel Iribar, Francisco Gento, Andoni Zubizarreta, Clive Toye, Phil Woosnam, Pele, Abedi Pele and Henry Kissinger."
