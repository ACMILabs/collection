        "Originally made to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the unsuccessful 1905 Russian Revolution, this film portrays the mutiny aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin and the role of the sailors and citizens of the Port of Odessa in the abortive revolution of 1905. It brought to the attention of the world the theories of Sergei Eisenstein, his emphasis on montage and his stress on the individual as protagonist."
