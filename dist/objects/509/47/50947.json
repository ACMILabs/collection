        "Western cinema and a heavy dose of Hong Kong cinema has cultivated an image of the Asian man as an asexual martial arts warrior, a worker, or a mean and domineering oppressor. Chinese-Canadian director Hunt Hoe questions the stereotype of the Asian male represented in Western culture. As a starting point, he begins with the question, \"Who is Albert Woo?\" a character he played in the film \"Foreign ghost\". Director and narrator Hoe draws on comments by Asian men from all sectors of life, including a performer, a musician, a businessman, a war veteran and, interestingly, a yo-yo champion. The men talk candidly of their experiences with racism, their role models, their sexuality, what they consider to be truisms of men in their race, how they feel about the issue of inter-racial marriages and the historical segregation of those who have made this choice. One woman, an ex love of Hoe's, is interviewed on her view on whether/why Asian women are more attracted to non-Asians than men of their own race. On his journey Hoe travels to Golden Studios to speak at length with Jackie Chan, as well as providing a brief overview of his genealogy."
