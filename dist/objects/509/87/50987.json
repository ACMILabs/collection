        "Episode 6 of The History of football - or soccer as it is known in Australia. \"Africa\" From colonial intervention, poverty and segregation, to independence and dictatorship, this program examines Africa's huge potential to become a successful football nation, against its continued failure to succeed at an international level. Including historical footage of key matches as well a slew of interviews with historians and sportsmen, this examination of the history of football in Africa makes for fascinating viewing. Interviews include: Roger Milla, Abedi Pele, Thomas N'kono, Neil Tovey, Pierre Kalala and Issa Hayatou. \"A game for all\" This episode focuses on the history of FIFA and the other powerbrokers that influence the spread of the game culturally as well as commercially, whilst documenting the start of football's partnership with large multi-national corporations. Touches on the history of women and football with wonderful excerpt footage. Interviews include Joao Havelange, Lennart Johansson, Pele, Jack Warner, Charles Dempsey and Dwight Yorkes. \"Futures\" As football is still dominated by Europe and South America this episode questions where future challenges will come from at a time when soccer has gained in popularity in China, Korea, Japan, India and the Middle East. Utilising interviews and archival footage, this episode examines the impact of soccer on these nations and the machinations of popularising the sport. Interviews include Zico, Kazu Miura, Baichung Bhutia, Kunishige, Kamamoto and Hong Deok-young."
