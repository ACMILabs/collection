        "Five young men from Alberta, Canada, talk openly about becoming teen fathers. They discuss the difficulties they face on a range of issues from increased responsibilities, change of life and community attitude to their role as young fathers. The young men discuss how their predicament forced them to address the question of what they want out of life. These young men, accepting their responsibilities, answer questions relating to morals, life choices, youth lifestyle, friendship, jobs, education and career."
