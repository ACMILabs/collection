        "Ivan the Terrible part I is Eisenstein's boldest and most successful experiment in stylisation drawing upon other arts - Wagnerian opera, Marinsky ballet and Japanese Kabuki theatre - which he had begun in \"Alexander Nevsky\". Ivan's personal life is interwoven with the themes of his drive for empire and his alliance with the merchant class against the aristocracy. It is the first part of a trilogy; part 2 is dominated by cloak-and-dagger intrigue; part 3 which was to be in colour, was designed but not filmed. Cast includes Nikolai Cherkasov and Ludmila Tselikovskaya."
