        "Tai-Pan is an epic adventure-romance set against the backdrop of the founding of Hong Kong as a British colony, circa 1842, in response to the opium wars between Britain and China. The plot revolves around an unscrupulous merchant trader Dirk Struan (Bryan Brown), and his long-standing feud with a rival merchant as each battles for supremacy as the ruling British merchant, or Tai-Pan, of Hong Kong. Over the years their bitter rivalry between the two men becomes murderous resulting eventually in a momentous showdown. Based on James Clavell's ambitious novel of the same name (the first of his Noble House series), the film simplifies the book's intricate sub-plots, only partially succeeding in capturing the spirit, depth and complexity of its source. Cast also includes Joan Chen, John Stanton and Bill Leadbitter."
