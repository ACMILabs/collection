        "1. 'Flying skis' looks at ice-skating, figure skating and ski joring. The Scandinavian sport of ski joring combines the skills of a cowboy with those of a skier whereby skiers are towed behind a horse. Alex Foster, ex-Olympian skier, captain of the Canadian ski team and inventor of the tow rope and ski-lift, demonstrates the fancy skiing style that he developed which combines down-hill skiing and figure skating techniques. 2. 'Fishing' captures the thrill and excitement that lures anglers to fresh and saltwater fishing. Introduces a range of innovative techniques including fishing with dogs and donkeys, casting a line with the aid of a parachute, Georgian swamp fishing without equipment and catching Arkansaw monster Garfish. Also shows more conventional fishing methods including Silvery Salmon; Marlin fishing off the Australian coast and Tuna fishing in Nova Scotia."
