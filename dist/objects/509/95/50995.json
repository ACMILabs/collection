        "In the late 1990s the dot com world of business boomed, due to an increase of use of the internet by companies and individuals, and a realisation by investors that vast amounts of money were to be made in untapped niche markets. Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and Tom Herman are two entrepreneurial types, men who grew up together, fuelling each other's dreams of an enterprise that would make them millionaires. Their idea is for an internet site which will allow people to pay parking fines, speeding fines, rates, get planning maps on line - it will serve as a link between people and government. \"Startup.com\" is a documentary that traces the progress of their company, govworks.com. Both men are shown to have differing but complimentary skills that enable them to raise close to twenty million dollars (US) from investors. Kaliel as CEO, is shown to be a master of public relations and a man not afraid to make difficult decisions. \"Startup.com\" is frank and revealing, laying bare the emotional upheaval and personal toll that the difficulties of getting their business up and running has on the two main players. \"Startup.com\" is a fascinating display of how friendship and commerce make for an interesting and challenging mix."
