        "Sophia Loren plays spoilt millionairess, Epifania Parerga, who having inherited her father's fortune, is unhappily married and suicidal. When she meets the mild mannered Indian doctor, Ahmed el Kabir, (Peter Sellers in typical disguise), she pursues him with fervour. But despite Epifania's schemes to attract Ahmed, he is impervious to her allure. Ahmed, who is devoted to running his clinic for the poor, challenges Epifania to live for three months without wealth in order to prove their suitability. He in turn accepts her challenge to turn 500 pounds into 15,000 in three months. Based on the play by Bernard Shaw, the screenplay was significantly updated to accommodate Loren's physical charms and Sellers' particular brand of comedy. The results are a mixed bag, with the chemistry between the two leads barely flaring, despite their mutual talents. Running gags revolve around every man falling for Loren, except the one she wants and Loren's elaborate seduction of the doctor."
