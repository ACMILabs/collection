        "Part 4 of \"The History of football\". \"For club and country\" This episode charts the trials and tribulations of French football, or soccer as it is known in Australia, how its developed over the years and how winning France '98 and Euro 2000 has helped the country to find its football identity. Also examined is the evolution of Juventus into one of the world's \"superclubs\"; Dwight Yorke talks about balancing the requirements of Manchester United with Trinidad, and Sir Alex Ferguson discusses the changes he's seen at MU - the first billion pound club. Interviews include the first ever World Cup scorer Lucien Laurent, as well as Michel Platini, Just Fontaine, Sir Bobby Charlton, Alan Shearer, Fernando Hierro, Zinedine Zidane, Aime Jacquet, Roberto Bettaga and Dino Zoff. This episode also examines the governing bodies behind football and the politics that govern the game. Addresses the club versus country debate - African players discuss conflicts of sport versus nationalism. \"The Dark side\". This episode draws together events and stories that have made headline news. Tragedies that have brought communities together; a war sparked by a match, and hooliganism that has threatened the very existence of the game. Includes an interview with Sauro Toma, whose life was saved through injury when he didn't travel to Lisbon with his Torino team-mates; and the infamous World War Two \"Death match\" in which players were asked to choose between victory and execution. Interviews include relatives of the Hillsborough victims, Munich air disaster survivor Bill Foulkes, and relatives of the Zambian air crash team. This well-documented and informative series contains frank interviews, extensive footage of key historical matches as well as providing an interesting insight into the history of football, and the social context of the evolution of the game."
