        "Australian short film set in the 1950s revolves around the shifting dynamics of a working class family. Pip is a young boy of about ten who puzzles over the goings on within his home, especially the relationship between his brawling parents. Revelling in the presence of his loving, nurturing mother, a dressmaker and homemaker, Pip regards in awe and fear, his cantankerous father, Jack. Jack grapples with his role within the small family, lashing out at his wife and son due to their strained financial situation. \"The Sewing room\" is a melancholic, nostalgic work that evokes fractured memories of an unpredictable childhood. Cast consists of Maude Davey, Nicolas Anderson and Robert Menzies."
