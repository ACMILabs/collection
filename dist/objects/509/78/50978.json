        "There was a program on British television in the sixties called Pogles' Wood, which appeared on the BBC program 'Watch with mother', about old friends Mr and Mrs Pogle. This collection of six short animated puppet tales, 'The Pogles' is from the series that precedes Pogles' Wood and tells the story of the magic plant and how the changling baby came to live with them in the woods. Originally screened only once on the BBC as it was deemed \"too scary for afternoon TV\" - (a funny thing to say about puppets really). This tape includes: 'The Magic bean', 'A Silver crown', 'Pogle go home', 'A Flower for wishes', 'The Singing bird', 'King of the Fairies'. An enchanting collection of animated tales."
