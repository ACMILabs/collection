        "A moving account of the Westray coal mine disaster, which killed 26 men in Nova Scotia on May 9, 1992. Personal stories are brought to the screen in an innovative and dramatic style, tracing the stories of six people - three miners and three widows - whose lives were forever changed that day by a company that violated the most basic rules of mining safety. The film recreates the events that drew the workers to the high-tech mine, detailing the horror of the explosion and its complex and tragic aftermath. 'Westray' is a compelling portrait of working men and their wives that extends far beyond this particular mining disaster to highlight how the lives of working class people are often entrusted to companies that violate the most fundamental rules of safety and decency in the name of profit."
