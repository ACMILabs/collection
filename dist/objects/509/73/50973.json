        "A detailed analysis of the work of Michelangelo from his early work to that of his later life with a biographical study of his childhood and working relationships. The program opens with a discussion of his Florentine family life in Cabreze near Sienna which reveals very few direct influences on the artist's later life. Studying art by the age of thirteen and an accomplished and famed fresco painter and sculptor early in life, both Michelangelo's completed and uncompleted works are closely examined here, providing a detailed insight into his artistic process and his most pivotal works. The program also discusses his move to architecture and the innovative urban planning ideas he worked on in the last twenty years of his life."
