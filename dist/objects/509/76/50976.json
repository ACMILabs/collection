        "The setting is pre-independence Bengal - Devdas and Paro are childhood neighbours who grow up together sharing an innocent and joyful friendship, despite their different social status. Whilst still a young man and quite a prankster, Devdas is sent to Calcutta to study and in order to help him mature. He returns home years later a handsome man and Paro has blossomed into a true beauty. Disregarding their mutual love for one another, Devdas' parents oppose the match, due to Paro's lowly status, and her parents arrange for her to marry another. Paro is willing to risk all, including her reputation for their love but Devdas, weak and unable to defy his family, cannot, and is driven to despair and alcoholism. Directed by Bimil Roy, this film is lyrical and understated in its evocation of the lovers' sorrow. Features numerous songs with original music composed by Sachin Dev Burman and lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi and incandescent black and white cinematography. Starring: Dilip Kumar, Vijantimala and Suchitra Sen. From the novel by Sarat Chandra Chatterjee."
