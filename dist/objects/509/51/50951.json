        "This animated feature is set in a mythical Ice Age, where, Juliana, a powerful Queen of the North, seeks to gain control the rest of the realm. In this realm also resides the good King, Jarol, who lives in his fortress of fire and his sworn enemy, evil ice Lord Nekron, who lives with his army of subhumans amongst the glaciers. Nekron uses his powers of sorcery to create havoc and orders the subhumans to kidnap Jarol's daughter. Thus a war is waged between fire and ice in a desperate battle for survival. Jarol, with help from the warrior hero Darkwolf must save mankind from the apocalyptic icy grave that awaits them if evil is to reign. Featuring the voices of Stephen Mendel, Maggie Roswell, Leo V. Gordon and Steve Sandor. Director Ralph Bakshi is best known for his animated adult feature \"Fritz the cat\"."
