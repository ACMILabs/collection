        "Presented by Valmik Thapar, this is a celebration of the incredible diversity of wildlife across the Indian subcontinent. It explores some of the most fascinating habitats in the natural world.. from the icy vastness of the Himalayas to the lush forest dominated by the world's largest tiger population; from vast plains and the beauty of the Rajasthan deserts to mighty rivers and the superabundant life of the oceans."
