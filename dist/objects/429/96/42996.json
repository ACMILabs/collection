        "Examples of restoration projects undertaken by Canada's National Historic Sites Service. Fort Louisbourg, painstakingly rebuilt to its former imposing dimensions on Nova Scotia's Cape Breton coast; near Winnipeg, a century-old Hudson's Bay Company trading post; in Kingston, the home of Sir John A. Macdonald; and famous Dawson City, are some of the many places and mementos of the past vividly brought to life in this film."
