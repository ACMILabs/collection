        "In this second installment of Alex Haley's classic novel, Kunta Kinte (John Amos), briefly escapes slavery but is captured again and crippled. His friendship with Fiddler terminates, but Kunte does fall in love and marries. His love for his wife and the need to care for their newborn daughter, Kizzy, prevents Kunte from escaping again. Jump forward 16 years and Kizzy (Leslie Uggams), is sold to a new master and bears him a son, Chicken George (Ben Vereen). Kizzy's master, Samuel Bennett (Richard Roundtree) is sympathetic to Kizzy's desire to see her parents, but they clash fiercly on his blase attitude towards slaves and his lack of interest in maintaining Kizzy's African heritage. Kizzy returns to her birthplace and discovers the fate of her parents. Written for television by James Lee, M. Charles Cohen and William Blinn. Cast includes John Amos, Lynda Day George, Lorne Greene, Chuck Connors, Sandy Duncan, George Hamilton, Carolyn Jones and Louis Gossett Jnr. Music by Gerald Fried."
