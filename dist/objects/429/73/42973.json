        "Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is a teenager struggling through life with a boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) not content with their present sex life, a father who is constantly absent on business trips, and the approaching one year anniversary of her mother's brutal murder. Just as things seem to be getting back to normal for Sidney and her friends, the small town of Woodsboro is once again plauged by a crazed killer who is turning the formula plot of horror movies into reality. Also starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard and Rose McGowan."
