        "Patrick McGoohan stars in this British television series that has attained cult status over the years. A former British secret agent (McGoohan has stated that the character was, in fact, the same character from his previous series, Secret Agent) resigns his post, only to find himself kidnapped and put in a beautiful but isolated community called The Village. Here men and women are stripped of their identities and reduced to mere numbers. The prisoner becomes No. 6. He begins to suspect that has not been captured by the enemy, but, in fact, it is his own government who believes he knows too much. \"The Prisoner\" is a unique piece of television. It addresses issues such as personal identity and freedom, democracy, education, scientific progress, art and technology, while still remaining an entertaining drama series. Guest appearance by Paul Eddington. Filmed in Portmeirion, Wales."
