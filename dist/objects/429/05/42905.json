        "Restoration is a lavish costume drama which follows the story of Robert Merivel (Robert Downey Jr.)a young doctor whose life is changed when he is favoured by King Charles II (Sam Neill). Amidst the decadent opulance of the Restoration court Merivel soon loses sight of his career as a doctor but when he is abandoned by Charles he must return to poverty and find a place in the real world again. Based on the novel by Rose Tremain, Michael Hoffman's film gives a great sense of life in England during the Restoration period. Sam Neill is excellent as the capricious King and Robert Downey Jr. likeable as the wayward Merivel. With appearances by Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant, Polly Walker, David Thewlis and Ian Mackellan and gorgeous music by Henry Purcell. Winner of 1996 Academy Awards for best Art Direction and Best Costume Design."
