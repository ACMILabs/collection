        "Based on the book by Alex Haley, \"Roots\" begins in Gambia, West Africa, 1750 with the birth of Kunta Kinte (Le Var Burton). Kunta's life begins well, as he rises in the ranks within his community by distinguishing himself in manhood training rituals. His good fortune does not last long with the arrival of slave traders who capture Kunta and many of his tribesmen. They are chained together and begin an arduous journey on the slave ship, Lord Ligonier, bound for the New World. Kunta finds a friend in Fiddler (Louis Gossett Jr), a slave in charge of Kunta's training. Kunta challenges the boundaries of their friendship when Fiddler discovers that Kunta is planning to escape with the female slave, Fanta (Ren Woods). This tape includes two episodes. Cast includes Edward Asner, O. J. Simpson, Ralph Waite, Maya Angelou and Ji-Tu Cumbuka. Music by Quincy Jones."
