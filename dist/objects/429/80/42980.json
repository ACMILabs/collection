You can visit areas such as; offshore production platforms, onshore gas and oil fields, witness the end use of gas and oil products, oil and gas reserves, processing products at the refinery, see how natural gas is created and trapped in the earth, and visit AMOSC (Australian Oil Spill Centre). There's an historical overview, safety outline, and a chance to do some testing."
