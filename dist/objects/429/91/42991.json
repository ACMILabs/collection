Best selling authors including Penelope Leach, Thomas Moore, Martin Seligman and Marina Warner discuss changing ideas about childhood and the raising of children Part 2: Damage; today we search childhood memories for the causes of our adult discontent. \"Damage done to us as children is blamed for everything from alcoholism to depression. But how important is childhood in the making of adult personality."
