        "Based on Jack London's classic novel about an Alaskan gold prospector and the dog he saves from a brutal life of slavery as a sled dog in Canada's vast frozen Yukon territory. This French/Canadian co-production has been hailed as one of the most accurate dramatic presentations of London's work. Cast includes Rutger Hauer, Burke Lawrence, Charles Powell, Bronwen Booth and Richard Dreyfuss"
