        "Presumed guilty compares elements of the French, American and British legal systems to construct an alternative that reaffirms the fundamental right that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Top defence barrister Michael Mansfield QC reveals his agenda for change in the British/Australian system of criminal justice, exposing the brutalities and iniquities of a system once thought to be the most just in the world."
