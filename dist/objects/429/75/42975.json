        "Imitation is the greatest compliment. But for Michel, having an impersonator is the biggest nightmare. Michel Blanc is an international film star who is about to have his life turned upside down. A look-alike is posing as him, making public appearances, hosting autograph signings and living his luxurious live. But his identical also happens to be sleazy, greedy and overly aggressive; and when he starts attacking women, dumping business associates and assaulting fans, the real Michel finds himself chased by the law, shunned by his friends and thrown behind bars! Now the world famous star with a reputation to uphold finds he's about to be ruined by a man who looks identical and acts even better than he. Michel sets off to locate and eliminate his double with the help of Carole Bouquet. The film is filled with cameo by real showbiz personalities sending themselves up and the excesses of their industry. A comedy with a double twist directed by Michel Blanc, from an idea by Bertrand Blier In French with sub-titles. Cast includes Roman Polanski"
