        "Cinemagazine items: The story of the building of a new bridge over the River Karun in South-West Persia. The film shows the difficult nature of the mountain country over which material for the bridge had to be transported. Finally the river is conquered and the strong, delicate steelwork of the bridge spans its summer sloth and its winter torrent, a safe, sure way for all who wish to cross."
