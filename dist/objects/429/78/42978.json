        "Life for 10 Anglo-Indian women from the industrial city of Birmingham is about to take a decidedly interesting turn. They've set off on a bus trip to the seaside resort of Blackpool for a \"female fun time\". With a mixed bag of ages, attitudes and social classes, it's going to be nothing short of outrageous when these ladies leave behind the demands of spoiled husbands, children and lovers to encounter a world full of strippers, seducers and several other british unmentionables!"
