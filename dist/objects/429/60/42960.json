        "An intriguing inside-out view of moving figures and images, made by using a colour negative print, but with more vivid colors and with accompanying sound effects that suggest the same kind of inversion of the sound track. Figures and faces appear in a shimmering haze; the one most frequently seen is a figure skater flashing, pirouetting, fading. These are shades of people and of movements, appearing, retreating, as in a mirage."
