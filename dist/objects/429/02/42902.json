        "After resigning from their jobs, 2 film company executives (David Argue and Bruce Spence) open a revival theatre. On their grand opening they plan to screen the Italian epic, \"Hercules\", the film that closed the theatre down. Their ex-boss exacts revenge by sending them the wrong print; an Italian one with no subtitles. With little or no means for rectifying the situation, they make do with what they have at hand and dub the voices themselves. What eventuates is a dramatic departure from the original version, which becomes set in Climidia, with Hercules a cabaret singer and a supporting cast that includes Labia, Testiculi and Machismo. Developed from the live show, \"Double take meets Hercules\", written and directed by Des Mangan. Cast includes David Argue, Bruce Spence, Mary Coustas and Michael Carman."
