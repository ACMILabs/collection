        "The Intellectual Disability Rights service have produced this video to help disabled people to deal with rights and responsibilities at work. It includes issues such as safety, sexual harrassment, the right to be treated fairly, the right to choose your own friends and to have relationships. The second section looks at why people may want a workers committee and how one group of workers set one up."
