        "A group of bounty hunters make camp in a bleak desert. Returning to camp Willett (Warren Oates) finds out his brother has gotten drunk in town and run down a little boy. Additionally his brother's partner has gotten shot in the back by an unknown gunman. Coley (Will Hutchins), fearful of what is going on gives Willett his guns. The next day, the two meet a mysterious woman (Millie Perkins) who offers Willett $1,000 to take her to the town of Kingsley. Although this film is relatively unknown, it is attracting a small but strong cult following, and is attracting more reviews each year."
