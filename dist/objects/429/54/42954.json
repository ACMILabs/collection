        "Documents the history of the Australian Trade Union Movement. The film is not endorsed by the ACTU and represents only the film maker's view. The 1850s saw the introduction of the eight hour labour movement and the subsequent development of the trade union movement. Unions were established to organise, assert and defend the worker's rights, industrial awards, occupational health and safety and minimum wages."
