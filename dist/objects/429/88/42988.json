        "Paddington is caught in a storm and shelters in the entrance of a cinema where he discovers that \"Singing in the Rain\" starring Gene Kelly is screening. Being an unaccompanied bear under 16, Paddington is not allowed in. However, he manages to peer through a keyhole and catches his first glimpse of the world of the silver screen. Unfortunately, in typical Paddington fashion, he also wreaks havoc in the theatre and the projection box. On his way home, in the excitement of the moment, Paddington tries to emulate the dancing of Gene Kelly. Narrated by Michael Hordern and based on the book by Michael Bond. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
