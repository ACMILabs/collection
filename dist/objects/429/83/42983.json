        "Angry customers may be found in any business. This instructive video portrays three business settings; telemarketing, the computer industry and an accounts department; all feature an angry customer over the phone. The scenarios depict a variety of conflicting reactions such as aggression and passivity. As a response to the scenarios the video provides key concepts such as; rational rather than emotional responses, positive rather than negative phrases, assertive as opposed to passive, active listening skills and the importance of a supportive work environment."
