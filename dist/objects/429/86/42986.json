        "In the final episodes of \"Roots\", Kunte Kinte's grandson, Chicken George, finds himself in England when his owner uses him as payment to settle a gambling debt. He returns to his family fourteen years later, the first free man in his family. The Civil War begins and Chicken George fights for the Union. Emancipation reaches the blacks with the end of the Civil War, but hooded night riders still pursue them. Chicken George leads his family to a new home in Tennessee, concluding the saga that began with his grandfather, Kunte Kinte. Alex Haley narrates the epilogue. Cast also includes Lloyd Bridges, Georg Stanford Brown, Macdonald Carey, Olivia Cole and Chuck Connors. Written for television by James Lee, William Blinn and M. Charles Cohen."
