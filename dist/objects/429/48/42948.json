        "Noise pollution is a scourge of our time no less than are the visible forms that contaminate our environment. From the jangle of the alarm clock to the din of downtown, noise assails us throughout the day. The way the film depicts this aural enemy provides overpowering, at times amusing, evidence that here, too, the time has come to call a halt. Cast includes Ghislaine Phaneuf, Don Scanlan, Griffith Brewer, Dave Broadfoot, Sonny Cullen, Don Arioli, Judith Gault."
