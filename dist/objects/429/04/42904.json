        "Armand (Robin Williams) and Albert (Nathan Lane) have created their own piece of serenity with their successful nightclub, \"The Birdcage\". Armand takes care of the management and Albert performs nightly as the wonderful female impersonator, Starina. Their world is thrown into disarray when Armand's son announces he is engaged to a conservative Senator's daughter who is eager to meet their future son in laws parents. It will take all of Albert's stage experience to convince the future in laws they are a 'normal' family. This reworking of the classic French farce 'La Cage aux Folles' will delight viewers with it sparkling humour and great performances by Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Hank Azaria, Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest, Dan Futterman and Calista Flockhart."
