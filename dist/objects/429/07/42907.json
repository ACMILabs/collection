The holiday starts off on shaky ground when she finds herself seated next to Mr Mooney on the plane, guest stars include Pat Priest and James Wellman. \"Lucy & the bean queen\"; Mr Mooney invests in a new product, 'Bailey's barbequed beans' for one of their major clients and Lucy turns out to be their biggest investor, for an unusual reason.
