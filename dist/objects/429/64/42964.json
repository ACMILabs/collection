        "Quebec produces about eighty percent of the worlds maple products. The film reports from the heart of the sugar country in Quebec's Eastern Townships. All stages of processing are shown, from collecting the sap from the trees, to boiling, bottling and marketing. Also includes the Canadian custom of 'sugaring off', a celebration of spring and the first maple syrup gathered. Fresh hot syrup is poured onto snow to create maple toffee which is then eaten by everyone."
