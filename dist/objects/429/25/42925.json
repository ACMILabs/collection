        "How do we punish criminals? Reveals the many dilemmas faced by our legal system in balancing society's expectation for protection (and the punishment and rehabilitation of offenders) against the rights of the criminal in order to ultimately reach a 'just' outcome. What is a 'just outcome' for both the individual and the community? These and other key questions are explored through interviews with prisoners, County Court Judges and other legal interest groups. Explains and discusses the main types of criminal sanctions issued by most Australian courts: Admonishment, Fines, Community based Corrections, Imprisonment, other innovations, such as Home Detention and private prisons."
