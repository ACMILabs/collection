        "This program clearly defines the procedures involved in selecting a jury to serve in a criminal trial. The Victorian example is used to explain the various steps of jury service including: jury selection, how jurors may be challenged, how jurors may be excused form serving and swearing in a jury. Interviews with jurors, a judge and other legal personnel further explain the reasons behind the procedures, providing an insight into the role of the jury. Suitable for middle Secondary - Tertiary level students."
