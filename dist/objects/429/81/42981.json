        "Using Canada as an example, this video presents an informative look at the interaction between males and females in the workplace. It uses a seminar on communication between the sexes held with the Bank of Commerce- CIBC. They uncover issues such as the clash between male and female culture, gender differences and expectations, gender gripe lists of the opposite sex, how men and women listen differently, male confusion over a changed workplace and the need to change the traditional male culture of the organisation. The seminar proves to be useful to the organisation and they feel better equipped to deal with gender differences in the workplace."
