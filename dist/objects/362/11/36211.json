        "This video is designed specifically for those women who have never played or are just beginning. Donna White, a veteran of 11 years on the LPGA tour circuit, will show you how simple learning golf can be. This video takes the mechanics out of learning the game and teaches you how to develop a natural flowing golf swing. Donna makes learning the basic techniques of golf fun and easy to understand through her creative and simple teaching style."
