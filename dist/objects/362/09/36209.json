        "This is an absorbing account of the men, money and boats involved in the glittering social and sporting event that is America's Cup yacht racing. It tells the fascinating story of the longest winning streak in sport's history from the first race in 1851 to the highly dramatic and much publicised series of 1983 races held off Newport, Rhode Island. America, defending the coveted trophy for the 25th time, was finally beaten, giving an historic victory to the challenging \"Australia II\"."
