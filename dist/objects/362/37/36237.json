        "Episode of Series \"Man on the rim series\". Part 3 in the series. \"The Powerhouse\" explores the powerhouse aspect of China's long history which displays her inventiveness beginning with the Han dynasty. \"Pure and simple\" shows how the Japanese, despite their close affinity with China, have fought with the utmost determination to remain distinctive. \"Road without wheels\" In South America, isolated from the rest of the world, the Indians produced their own remarkable range of food, invented the wheel but never used it for transport, and developed their own unique culture."
