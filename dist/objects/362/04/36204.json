        "Adventurer, Dick Smith, began the Bash in 1985 and since then it has grown to be one of the largest fund-raising events anywhere in the world. It is uniquely Australian. A drive in the Outback with a few mates, which at the same time helps raise money for less fortunate children. The 1989 Bash went from the South East of Australia across three States and the Northern Territory, to the North-West of the Continent, an epic 12 day, 1,600 kilometre drive. All vehicles taking part had to be built before 1966. 208 cars and nearly 1,000 people took part in the Bash and raised over two million dollars for the Variety Club of Australia, and all that money will go towards helping handicapped or underprivileged children throughout Australia."
