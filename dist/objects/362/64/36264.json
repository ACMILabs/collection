        "Episode of Series \"This Land Australia with Ted Egan\". Norfolk Island is an eight by six kilometre paradise set in the blue waters of the South West Pacific Ocean about 1,500 kilometres east of the Australian mainland. The island was secured by the British in 1788 just a few weeks after settlement at Sydney Cove. It was abandoned after a few years, until 1824 when it became one of the most terrible and feared penal settlements. The graveyards and chronicles testify to the brutality and terror of those awful years. The island was abandoned but eventually re-settled by descendants of the Bounty mutineers who moved there from the more isolated Pitcairn Island in 1856."
