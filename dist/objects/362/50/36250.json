        "Episode of Series \"This Land Australia with Ted Egan\". The first part of the Australian continent to be touched by the morning sun is the sentinel peak of Mt. Warning, the core of an ancient volcano. In the eroded valleys and rugged mountain ranges that surround the peak are some of the world's most beautiful rainforests, just a short journey from Surfers Paradise, Australia's tourist playground. Sandwiched between the ocean and the outer rim of the volcano exists an incredible pot pourri of people and lifestyles."
