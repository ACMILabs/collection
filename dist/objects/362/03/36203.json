        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Man on the rim series\". Part 4: \"The Feathered Serpent\" - The Olmec, Toltec, Maya and Aztec cultures represent the highest achievement of American Indian society. This episode shows how these complex communities and their skills in architecture, sculpture and the arts. \"The Last Horizon\" The final episode in the greatest migratory movement in the history of the human race belongs to the Polynesians. Their epic voyages from Fiji and Tonga carried them to Hawaii, Tahiti, New Zealand and Easter Island. New sails appeared on the horizon from Europe breaking the isolation of the Pacific. Now, there is a new dawning of the Pacific Century."
