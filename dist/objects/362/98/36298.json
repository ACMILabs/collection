        "Adapted from the popular story by Eleanor Parker. Pollyanna (Hayley Mills) glows as the little orphan girl who believes that \"things are always better than they seem\". She manages to change the heart of an entire town including her Aunt Polly (Jane Wyman). Judged by the public and critics alike as one of Walt Disney's finest achievements. Pollyanna is a celebration of life. Rated G."
