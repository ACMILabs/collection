        "Perfected centuries ago, Tai Chi remains one of the most efficient forms of exercise ever developed. Unlike most of today's exercises, it actually increases your mental and physical energy through systematic stress reduction. Guided by David Carradine (star of television's \"Kung Fu\") you will learn graceful flowing movements which tone muscles, firm the body and enhance flexibility."
