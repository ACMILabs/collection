        "The Robots are Coming- More and more jobs are being taken over each year by the robots of the world. Most of the jobs are tedious, but the robots don't seem to mind. \"Energy\"- The sun and the wind could supply us with most of our energy needs - pollution free. \"Research Into Space\"- The Americans and the Russians are showing the world that space has no boundaries but getting up there does present problems from time to time. \"Other Changes\"- Electronic bagpipes and a hotel room the size of a phone box - they are just two of the changes taking place right now."
