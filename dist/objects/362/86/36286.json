        "Brings into focus the question of the persistence of consciousness after biological death. Dr. Lawrence LeShan presents the scientific view. At a session at the Monroe Institute with Robert Monroe, author of \"Journeys Out of the Body\", participants learn that they are more than their physical body. Dr. Kenneth Ring interviews four who were clinically dead. Margaret Flavell, a British medium, communicates with the late A. D. Mattson, who describes the hereafter."
