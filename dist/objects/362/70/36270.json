        "Episode of Series \"Jack Absalom's outback Australia series\". Strezelecki was an early Polish explorer and surveyor. His name is given to one of the most desolate regions of the Outback. Jack Absalom traces the Strezelecki Track from the grand beauty of the Flinders Ranges, once the ancient coastline of the Australian continent, north to Cooper's Creek where in ancient times thousands of Aborigines lived in a paradise surrounded by desert. Many early English explorers of the continent perished here but true bushmen achieved remarkable feats. Rated: G"
