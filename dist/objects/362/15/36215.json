        "Humphrey Bogart is the gin soaked river tramp who reluctantly becomes a hero after rescuing a \"skinny-psalm-singing old maid\", (Katherine Hepburn) from the Germans during World War 1. Their hazardous mission of escape becomes pursuit as the odd pair survive malaria, insects, leeches and the persistent conflict of their personalities in order to destroy a German gunboat. Bogart won the Oscar for best actor for his role and Huston's script (co-written with James Agee) is remarkably efficient in disguising the narrative contrivances. Rated: G"
