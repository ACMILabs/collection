        "Traces the life of the Buddha from his birth as a prince through time spent as a wandering mendicant in search of a solution for life's sorrow to his later years when he trudged the dusty paths of India preaching his ego-shattering life-redeeming message. That message is threaded throughout the film as we visit monasteries and families in two different craft communities and see how Buddhism has influenced the lives of these gentle people in southeast Asia."
