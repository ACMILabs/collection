        "Episode of Series \"Jack Absalom's outback Australia series\". The original jewels in the Kimberley in Australia's far north west were the hardy pioneer cattlemen and women who crossed the Continent with their herds to establish themselves as Kings in Grass Castles. They were followed by gold prospectors and farmers who opened up the mighty Ord River Irrigation Scheme. The newest jewels are diamonds. They were discovered by the new prospectors who are now reaping rich rewards for the millions of dollars they spent prospecting for their jewels. Rated: G"
