        "Peter Weir's captivating American film debut is presented as a white knuckle mystery thriller, collision of cultures and a sensual romance. An Amish boy witnesses a drug-related murder and with his mother (Kelly McGillis) and a wounded cop (Harrison Ford), takes refuge in the sheltered Amish community. Violence comes to \"peacelands\" in a film of stark contrasts, delicate subtleties and surprising humour. Note how the widow blooms under the cop's attentions. Ford has never been better, portraying a hero real enough to show fear when faced with both barrels of a shotgun. Cast includes Josef Sommer, Lukas Haas, Jan Rubes, Alexander Godunov, Patti Lupone, Danny Glover and Brent Jennings."
