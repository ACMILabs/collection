        "Coriolanus is the name given to an honourable but arrogant patrician, Caius Martius, after capturing the town of Corioli where a plebeian uprising has occurred. He rises to distinction, but through his pride and insincerity does not govern well. He is sent into exile by the Senators after he criticises them harshly in the Forum. Scorned, he joins forces with the uprisers and plans to sack Rome. It is only through the intervention of his wife and his mother that he revokes this decision and enters into a peace treaty with the Senators."
