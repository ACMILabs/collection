        "What makes the weather so unpredictable and volatile? Why do epidemics come and go without any discernible pattern and why do social systems, like the Stock Exchange, suffer catastrophic collapses? Could these phenomena ever be predicted? The answer may lie in an exciting mathematical theory - the Chaos Theory - put forward by an intrepid group of mathematicians and physicist. Chaos provides clues to the way in which the universe can seem both ordered and disordered at the same time. This video describes the constituent segments of the Chaos Theory and its practical applications in the real world."
