        "A re-enactment of one of the biggest frauds of all time. In 1969, the Equity Funding Corporation of America lacked the facts to make an accurate profit forecast because of computer troubles. They made a guess - two million dollars too optimistic. So two young executives fed fictitious insurance polices in the computer - all prefixed \"99\" so that they could easily be cancelled when the temporary loan was paid off. But the temptation to escalate the fraud became irresistible. Cast includes James Woods, Bill Hootkins, Shane Rimmer, Sam Wanamaker, Christopher Guest and Lionel Murton. Script by Tom Clarke."
