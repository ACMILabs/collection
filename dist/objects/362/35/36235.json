        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Man on the rim series\". This video, the first of four, is about the Pacific Ocean, the people who live around it and across its vast expanse. \"First footsteps\" explores the theory that the earliest settlers of Australia were perhaps from China. \"Hunters and gatherers\" describes how the first Australians arrived, occupied and managed their environment. \"Into the deep freeze\" explains how the people who moved north through China to Siberia coped with the cold and utilised the inexhaustible natural resources. Over two years in the making, this video has breathtaking photography and fascinating narration which illustrate that what we are learning about the Pacific comes from the descendants of the original settlers of this vast area."
