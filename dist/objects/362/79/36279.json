        "Ravel pays homage to the great French composer Maurice Ravel. Many of Ravel's foremost interpreters - Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Alicia de Larrocha, Victoria de Los Angeles, Jean-Phillipe Collard, Augustin Dumay and others, capture the sensuality, the sweetness and the power of the entire spectrum of Ravel's work. In addition, a rare home movie footage, photographs, interviews and Ravel's unpublished letters give the film deep insight into the composer's elusive life."
