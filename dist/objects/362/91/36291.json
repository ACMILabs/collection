        "While travelling by train to Sydney, Nina, a teacher of Polish extraction meets a fellow Pole, Julian, whom she has not seen for many years. They recall their time at \"Silver City\" the camp for new Australians where they met in 1949. She was drawn to Julian from the start, it did not matter to her that he was married with a child, and they began an affair. Unable to become a teacher at this time due to her lack of qualifications, Nina takes on a job as a domestic in a country hospital. She is then transferred to a camp near Sydney where she again meets up with Julian. Together they are befriended by two Australians and begin to experience the positive side of their new lives in Australia. But when Julian returns to his wife, Nina is devastated. By 1962 she has fulfilled her desire to become a teacher, yet she remains alone."
