        "A vibrant kaleidoscope of Toronto's International Guitar Festival, \"Guitar\" meshes dance, mime, visual art and virtuoso performances to create a spectacular and yet intimate celebration of the instrument. For one exciting week the city of Toronto is transformed into the guitar centre of the world. The streets echo with the sounds of the instrument as the great masters from every tradition gather to play for each other - John Williams, Leo Brouwer, Steve Morse to name but a few."
