        "The Guelph Spring Festival provides the backdrop for this extraordinary meeting of two of the most impressive prodigies of the violin: 76 year old Yehudi Menuhin and 14 year old Corey Cerovsek. With the Camerata Lysy Gstaad, his own student orchestra from Switzerland, Menuhin - with characteristic warmth, humour and rigour - holds a master class for some of Canada's violin students. The culmination is a dramatic performance of Bach's \"Double Violin Concerto\" by Menuhin and Cerovsek. Rated: G"
