        "This film of timeless quality is more than just entertainment. Chip's life is one lived fully. Although many feel that he has been denied a lot in a lonely life, his recollections prove the contrary. Exquisitely woven into his memories are his unexpected romance with Elizabeth and what their love means to him. Considered either as an adaptation of James Hilton's short novel or as a film per se, \"Goodbye Mr Chips\" is a considerable achievement for 1939. Sam Wood (King's Row) directed the film for MGM and and Victor Saville produced it in England shortly before World War II. It stars Robert Donat and Greer Garson. Rated: G"
