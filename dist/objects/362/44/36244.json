        "Directed by legendary film maker George Cukor, the dazzling talents of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant light up the screen in this engaging lovingly filmed comedy adventure. When her father runs afoul of the law in re-war Paris, a plucky young girl (Katharine Hepburn) disguises herself as a boy to aid in their escape. But when they team up with a low-brow con-man (Cary Grant), Kate's scheming soon precipitates a disastrous series of uproarious romantic misunderstandings."
