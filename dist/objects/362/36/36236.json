        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Man on the rim series\". This video, part of a set of four, is about the Pacific Ocean and the people who live around it and across its vast expanse. \"Flaming arrows\" follows the Siberian hunters who crossed into Alaska and settled America more than 20,000 years ago developing a variety of cultures, arts and technologies. \"Changing the menu\" watches how the Northern Asians settled into Indonesia and New Guinea, in the process cultivating the new food plants, coconut and rice. \"The Cutting edge\" traces the technological revolution in Asia which occurred quite independently of those in the original \"cradle of civilisation\" of the Middle East."
