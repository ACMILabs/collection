        "In 1973 an exhibition of Chinese art was presented at the Royal Academy in London. Many of the prize pieces appear in this film, which evolves into an extensive journey through modern China to visit many of the sites from which the treasures came, putting them into the context of place and history. With William Watson and Magnus Magnusson. Museum sequences directed by Ray Sutcliffe, photographed by Phil Meheux."
