        "We all want to know what we can do about peace but few feel we can really make a difference. The Hundredth Monkey Phenomenon proves we can. The film reviews the research that shows how the thoughts of individuals affect the world. While feeding monkeys sweet potatoes on a Japanese island, a group of scientists discovered that when a critical number of monkeys learned a behaviour, all the monkeys in the tribe began exhibiting the same behaviour - without being taught. Ken Keyes brought attention to this research with his book \"The Hundredth monkey\", and he introduces the concept in this film. Both the book and the video support the notion that when awareness of an idea reaches a critical level, this awareness spreads exponentially and becomes universal."
