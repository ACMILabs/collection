        "There are many moments of stunning virtuosity in George Sidney's exuberant musical entertainment \"Anchors Aweigh\". One of the most wonderful of all MGM's musicals, it is set in Los Angeles and Hollywood. Isobel Lennart's witty screenplay is about two sailors on leave - Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra - and their involvement with a Hollywood extra - Kathryn Grayson - whom they want to help become a musical star. The songs include \"All of a Sudden my Heart Sings\", \"Jealousy\", \"All of a Sudden my Heart Sings\", \"I Fall in Love too Easily\" and \"What Makes the Sunset\". Rated: G"
