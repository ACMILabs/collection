        "Episode of Series \"This Land Australia with Ted Egan\". Ted Egan takes up the Snowy Mountains story 100 years after Australia's favourite poet, Banjo Paterson, immortalised a young mountain horseman in his epic poem, \"The Man From Snowy River\". Features the pioneering development and the lifestyle of the mountain's people, including the historic construction of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. Filmed over the four seasons, the story also includes an aerial kaleidoscope of the high country from spring to winter with spectacular displays of wild flowers and fragile alpine wilderness."
