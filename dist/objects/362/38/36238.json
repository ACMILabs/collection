        "Part One of a two part series. From the sub zero temperatures of the polar ice-caps to the baking heat of the deserts, from the ash-strewn sides of a volcano to the dense vegetation of a tropical forest, the environments on Earth are no less remarkable than the variety of life itself and almost nowhere on our planet is devoid of life. Narrated by David Attenborough."
