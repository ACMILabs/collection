        "Episode of Series \"Jack Absalom's outback Australia series\". At the western end of treacherous Bass Strait King Island is noted in the history books for the frequency of shipwrecks on its rocky shores. But in recent times it is getting a reputation for the quality of its tender beef and gourmet cheese...not to mention the \"characters\" that the so called \"forgotten\" island has attracted in recent years. Jack Absalom found it one of the most friendly places he'd visited and concluded that its name should be changed to \"the Magic Island\"."
