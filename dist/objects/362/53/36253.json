        "This program examines co-dependency. Reluctantly, Megan attends her uncle's funeral, and in the company of her two cousins, revisits her childhood home. Witnessing Megan's distress, her cousin encourages her to speak of the effects of her father's alcoholism on her childhood. This conversation leads Megan to seek a therapist's help, and during these sessions she realises the important role her past unhappy childhood has had in determining her life. She is eventually able to lay to rest all the anger, grief and guilt that she has been carrying for so long."
