        "Life at Harrington House is puzzling and frightening. A fourteen year old with a camera sets out to find some clues and meets the tenants who are caught up in the mystery - a flamboyant fortune teller, Marco the Musician, the sulking, suspicious maid and the incredible 95 year old Byrdie sisters. The haunting can only be solved within the sharp focus of her camera's lens. The answers revealed will make an evening at Harrington House one of hair raising suspense and adventure. Rated: G"
