        "Episode of Series \"Visionaries\". In Grave Danger of Falling Food - Bill Mollison believes that the most destructive force on the planet is modern agriculture. It destroys our soils, poisons our water and produces toxic food. Instead, he has designed Permaculture, a system that uses the engineering principles of nature itself. He combines hundreds of plants and animals into a fertile self-regulating ecosystem. \"Barefoot Economist\" - Manfred Max-Neef is a Chilean economist trying to address the problems of Latin America. He thinks the worst solutions are those imposed from the top by financial planners, and the best are those worked out on the ground by local communities."
