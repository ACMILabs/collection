        "Episode of Series \"Jack Absalom's outback Australia series\". The most infamous bush track runs for 540 kilometres through Australia's centre. Its history is one of personal hardships and tough pioneering people. Once goods were carried to remote cattle properties by camel and only in recent times was a road made across the sand dunes. Jack Absalom recalls the old times, meets newcomers to \"The Birdsville Track\" and has some sound travel advice. Rated: G"
