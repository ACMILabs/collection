        "High and Wild is the latest video from the Wilderness Society's ongoing education program. It traces the journey of eight students and their teacher from Melbourne's Kingswood College on what, for most, was their first wilderness experience. Shot on location in Victoria's Wonnangatta-Moroka National Park \"High and Wild\" captures the students' experience as they explore a variety of issues surrounding wilderness - such as alpine grazing logging, flora/fauna protection, outdoor recreation, Aboriginal and World Heritage values."
