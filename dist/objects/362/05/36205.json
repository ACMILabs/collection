        "A factual and exclusive account of the mainland activities of Exercise Kangaroo 89 which tested the ability of the Australian Defence Force to operate in and defend against terrorist style attack the vast, remote and sparsely populated region of Australia's Top End. The program graphically captures the reality of how the threats and attacks by effective Kumarian enemy raiding parties were dealt with. It won a gold camera award and a certificate of creative excellence at the USA Film and Video Festival in Chicago 1990."
