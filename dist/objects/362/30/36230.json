        "Joey Deacon, born in 1920 with brain damage, grew up severely spastic, unable to talk or walk. When, in 1928, his mother died, he was sent to an institution where he lived for years, quite unable to make himself understood. Then, in 1941, he met Ernie Roberts who had one remarkable skill - he could understand Joey. This led to a new and richer life, and this film tells Joey's remarkable story. Based on Joey Deacon's book \"Tongue tied\"."
