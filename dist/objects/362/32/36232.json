        "Episode of Series \"Visionaries\". \"The Man who named the World\" - Professor James Lovelock is responsible for one of the most revolutionary environmental ideas - the Gaia hypothesis. This says that the planet is more than a cosmic sphere brimming with life, it is a single organism that has been alive for three and a half billion years. \"Declaration of a Heretic\" - Jeremy Rivkin is a professional activist. For many years his Foundation on Economic Trends has challenged the bio sciences in the court rooms. He was responsible for preventing the release of genetically engineered bacteria onto Californian strawberry crops, he's putting the brakes on the Human Genome Project, and he's forced the genetic engineers to conduct their experiments in an atmosphere of public scrutiny.
