        "Episode of Series \"Jack Absalom's outback Australia series\". In recent years crocodiles have made quite an impact - 10 people have lost their lives. Living in the far north of Australia has been described as living inside a giant game park - no fences between man and beast, with the balance tipping more and more in the crocodile's favour. Jack Absalom talks with the people of the Northern Territory's Top End about their experiences with an increasing crocodile population. Rated: G"
