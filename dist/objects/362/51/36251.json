        "The story of the Penan tribe is one that is happening regularly all over the planet. It is one which we usually prefer not to know, as it deals with the potential extinction of yet another tribal culture this century. But the twist is that a Swiss man, Bruno Manser, is living and fighting with the Penan and bringing to world attention the fact that once again we of the West are allowing environmental and cultural destruction by our continuing use of rainforest timbers in our daily lives. The story of these people is moving and inspiring and one to stir your heart. Rated: G"
