        "Episode of Series \"Jack Absalom's outback Australia series\". From his home at Broken Hill, Jack Absalom retraces the journey of the English explorer Charles Sturt who was convinced the centre of Australia contained a vast inland sea. Sturt's journey was one of great hardship as his party was drought bound for over six months at one location, ravaged by scurvy and attacked by wild Aborigines on whose waters the party had camped. The story tells of the gold rush following Sturt's explorations, of the perils still to be encountered and some novel direction finding techniques."
