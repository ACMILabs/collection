        "All that Bach is a delightful celebration of the music of J S Bach as it is played, danced, sung, jazzed, computed, tapped, electrified and busked by a wide range of internationally renowned artists. Among the performers highlighted in this spectacular homage are jazz pianist Keith Jarratt, Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music, contralto Maureen Forrester, cellist Anner Bylsma, the Canadian Bass and the National Tap Dance Company. \"All that Bach\" is an entertaining feast that revels in the richness of Bach's musical legacy."
