        "Episode of Series \"This Land Australia with Ted Egan\". Torres Strait is a treacherous waterway between Cape York, the northern most tip of the Australian mainland and Papua New Guinea. The shallow strait is dotted with Islands and coral outcrops. From Possession Island at the southern extremity, Captain James Cook formally laid claim to the Australian colonies in the name of England. Later the Queensland Government moved to control the Islands of the Strait and their people. Once, the islanders currency of trade was human heads, and headhunting raids between the islands and mainland Papua New Guinea was part of life. On this journey through the islands, Ted Egan meets some old friends, sees dugout canoes being built and meets the keeper of the legendary Drums of Mer."
