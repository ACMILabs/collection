        "For over 450 years it has been a game of ultimate challenge and skill. Many have tried to master it, but only a few have truly conquered the sport. Some of the names include Sarazen, Jones, Hogan, Nelson, Demaret, Berg, Snead, Palmer, Nicklaus, Player, Casper and Trevino. With the power of their drives, accuracy of their irons and touch of their putters.. they have become legends. Who could ever forget the kind of year Byron Nelson had in 1945 when he won 13 of 19 tournaments. or how about Billy Caspers incredible comeback victory over Arnold Palmer at the 1966 U.S. Open."
