        "Adapted from the 1932 Cole Porter musical. The plot of \"The Gay Divorcee\", rooted in mistaken identity is delightful. The script is sophisticated and bright and the cast is impeccable for comedy of this nature. Comparable to the best of Busby Berkeley and the most ingenious ballets of Gene Kelly, The Continental\" dance routine is sufficient to turn \"The Gay Divorcee into one of your most thrilling musical experiences. Stars Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers."
