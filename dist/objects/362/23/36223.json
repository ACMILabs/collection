        "Part three of the series, \"The Family of Man\" which sets out to compare family life in five different locations around the world. A comparison of weddings, the differences and similarities these rituals have in different societies are studied. There is also an investigation into some of the mysteries surrounding weddings in England - what the ring, veil, bouquet and wedding cake signify. By looking at weddings in other countries it is possible to make some shrewd guesses."
