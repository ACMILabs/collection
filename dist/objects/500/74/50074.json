        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". About the life of Belgium artist Rene Magritte, one of the most famous of all surrealists. The documentary discusses his personal life and the motivations behind his art. Obsessed with the everyday, Magritte's practise was to reinvent the ordinary by changing the 'viewers' perception. \"It's not the painting that changes your perception, it's the thoughts triggered when looking at the work that does\". As a metaphysical painter like his mentor De Chirico, Magritte sought to make reality and meaning represented as visionary not literal - it's this legacy that is explored in this documentary."
