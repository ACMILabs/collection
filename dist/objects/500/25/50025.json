        "Episode of Series \"The Alternative\". This episode of the fifteen part television series on complementary health focuses on two separate segments: \"Depression\" (and stress) and \"Addiction\". In the first segment on depression, a brief definition and explanation of how and why this emotional illness can cause so much grief, physically and psychically. Explains 'Melancholic' and 'Atypical' depression and the fact that stress can also be attributed and/or linked to depression. Suggests that learning a better response to depression rather than just trying to cure it would be far more beneficial. By using case studies, the following areas of therapy are discussed and demonstrated: Hypnotherapy; Colour therapy; Reflexology and flower remedy therapy; the Journey therapy. The second segment deals with various forms of addiction with a brief explanation of why some people suffer from this disease (10% of the population have addictive or compulsive behavior problems) and why others don't. Through various case studies, it covers cannabis, food and alcohol addiction with discussion and demonstration of the following therapies: Homeopathic and Shamanic practice; Hypnotherapy and nutrition; Chinese medicine including acupuncture, Qi Gong and herbal therapy. Commentary by Dilly Barlow."
