        "Robbie the Reindeer has a big set of hoofprints to follow in - his father is Santa's beloved Rudolph (he of red-nosed fame). Robbie has come to the North Pole to take his place on Santa's team but he is a young reindeer who lacks direction and soon realises that he is not fit or disciplined enough to keep up with the others. He must firstly prove himself in the annual Reindeer races to win the respect of his teammates and the love of a girl. In the spirit of animator Nick Park's 'Wallace and Gromit' series and written by some of Britain's top comics, this is an animated adventure the whole family will enjoy. Voices include those of Robbie Williams, Jane Horrocks, Rhys Ifans, Ricky Tomlinson, Harry Enfield and Ardal O'Hanlon. Music by Mark Knopfler."
