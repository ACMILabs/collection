        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Great moments in science: presented by Dr Karl Kruszelnicki\". If there are two or more ways to do something and if one of those results in catastrophe, then someone will do it that way, Edward A. Murphy Jr. In 1949 the US Airforce had a project called MX984 which measured G forces and in which Edward A. Murphy was working. You can find out what went wrong and how inadvertently this famous law came about. With the use of several animation techniques, Karl Kruszelnicki explains this, as well as why a falling piece of toast will always land on the floor - buttered side down."
