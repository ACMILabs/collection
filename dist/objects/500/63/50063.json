        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". This documentary of Suerat not only addresses the man as artist and one of the most important of France in the late 19th Century but also of his person - a man of mystery, a revolutionary who was also both modest and self-effacing by nature. Combining both the impressionists love of light and colour with his own 'scientific' system for colour exploration Suerat welcomed the post-revolutionary era, and not unlike the Eiffel tower that became a symbol for modern France, Seurat was to symbolise the shift toward the modern in the art world. Written and narrated by David Thompson."
