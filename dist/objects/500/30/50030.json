        "Milo Tindle (Michael Caine), a former hairdresser, finds himself invited to cocktails by renowned mystery writer, Andrew Wkye (Laurence Olivier). Wyke's 16th century residence is a treasure trove of games paraphernalia - dart boards, chess sets, robots and mazes, and Tindle is about to join the accoutrements. When Wyke reveals that he knows about Milo's involvement with his estranged wife, Marguerite (Margo Channing), he devises a ploy to avoid paying alimony - a ploy that involves Tindle robbing his lover so that Wyke can claim on the insurance money. A power struggle ensues between the younger, middle class rival and the blue blood, upper-class ageing mystery writer. This taut, 3 character film was nominated for 3 Academy awards and was Mankiewicz's final film. Based on the stage play by Anthony Shaffer."
