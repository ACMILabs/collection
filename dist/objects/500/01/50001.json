        "Over the decades, images of mass destruction, whether natural or human, have been captured on film and television. This video presents a compilation of some of that footage beginning with natural disasters including the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, the 1913 floods in Ohio, the collapse of the Takoma Bridge in 1940 and some of the major hurricanes that have hit America over the years. It then follows on to human created disasters such as the many failed attempts at flying the skies via planes, rockets, helicopters and airships, with some amazing shots of the Hindenburg exploding. Also includes footage of the Titanic, the sinking of the Lusitania, and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There are some light-hearted moments but there are also some disturbing visions (and commentary) contained in this documentary compilation. Presented by George Takei. In English with Spanish subtitles."
