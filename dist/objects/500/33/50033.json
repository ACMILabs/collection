        "This video covers the history of the French Foreign Legion, an army of mercenaries whose sense of honour and loyalty transcends national boundaries and commands respect as one of the world's elite fighting forces. The Legionnaire's loyalty is to the corps and not to France. They are often loathed by the French as unwelcome foreigners but equally, Legionnaires are considered useful for fighting and dying on behalf of the French in their colonial wars in Africa, Vietnam and various other French colonies across the world. More than 35,000 Legionnaires have died in battle with 8,000 alone being killed at the siege of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam in 1954. The men who make up the French Foreign Legion are an enigma, often hated and despised for their mercenary attitude by some but highly respected for their fighting skills and effectiveness in battle, particularly guerilla warfare by others - all dependent upon your political and social point of view. Includes interviews, newsreels, stills, historic film footage of many of the battles fought in the 20th century around the world and rare behind-the-scenes footage of Legionnaires in training and in combat including frontline footage during Operation Desert Storm in the Gulf. Narrated by Jackson Bain. Contains some b&w footage."
