        "Rude awakening is just that, when hippies Hesus and Fred return to New York after spending twenty years at a hippie commune in Central America, they find that things have not stayed the same and are in for one awakening they did not expect. They return to New York armed with Government papers that fell into their hands informing them of a proposed war in Central America. Needing the help and support of their old friends, they soon find they have changed from the once youthful free spirited drug taking hippies, to the uptight hard nosed yuppies that they used to despise. \"Rude awakening\" looks at the environmental challenges our world faces and the reluctance by people to stand up and express their anger and objection to the destruction of a highly delicate world in which we live. Cast includes Eric Roberts, Cheech Marin, Robert Carradine and Julie Hagerty."
