        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". This documentary, presented and edited by Melvyn Bragg, presents the British artist Anthony Caro, famous for his 'revolutionary' approach to sculpture making in the 60's. Initially training at the Royal Academy in London as a sculptor and then under the tutelage of Henry Moore, a disillusioned Caro made a trip to New York where he befriended the famous New York art critic, Clement Greenberg. The trip was to symbolise a radical shift in Caro's approach to his art making, earning him his revolutionary status for criticisms that his work was, 'crude and over simplified'. The documentary discusses Caro's philosophy and methods over the decades and follows Caro in the process of constructing a number of steel sculptures. A prodigious artist with an output of over 2,000 sculptures whose search for, 'the fact of the work and not the form', makes this an exciting documentary about one of the modernist greats."
