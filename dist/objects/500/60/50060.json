        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". At a time when the world was turning toward Modernism. artist Marc Chagall had decided to finally leave his native Russia for Paris, the epi-centre of the art world at the turn of the 20th Century. Having suffered a poor and repressed childhood as a Russian Jew marginalised by poverty and cultural dissent Chagall's iconography differed from his contemporaries. Whilst employing essentially a cubist surface his subject matter was deeply personal drawing on his life experiences. This documentary explores Chagall's personal vision as artist and storyteller charting his career through his paintings, set and costume designs and stain glass work. Edited and presented by Melvyn Bragg."
