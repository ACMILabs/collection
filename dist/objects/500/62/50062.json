        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". Melvyn Bragg interviews David Hockney in this relaxed documentary. Hockney walks through a major retrospective exhibition held at the Tate Gallery London in 1988, starting with his first oil painting, a painting of his father, through his student and early work to his contemporary return to painting. He talks of his move from England to Southern California where he painted his well known pools and splashes. His double portraiture is discussed as is his spatial experiments with composite photography. Hockney talks of his theatre design and his return to painting with his contemporary works featuring curves, bright colours and strange subjective perspectives. The sometimes witty and casual down to earth Hockney ends with a recent portrait of his mother. Edited and presented by Melvyn Bragg."
