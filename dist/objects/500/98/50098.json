        "The son of a rich Texas oil family seems bent on self-destruction despite the apparent steadying influences of two outsiders who have been drawn into the family. It is, however, in the character of his sister, Marylee, that the conflict between society's repression and individual needs is focused. Sirk's mise en scene intensifies the genre's conventions in such a way as to make the inherent contradictions unusually explicit. The final scenes - the inquest and after - virtually form an epilogue which brings out ambiguities on how Marylee is to be seen in relation to the bourgeois couple (Hudson and Bacall). This displaces the conventions of the happy ending which often open a gap between the credible resolution of conflict and the apparently irreconcilable. Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Wilder. Cast includes Rock Hudson, Lauren Bacall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone."
