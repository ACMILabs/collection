        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". This seminal documentary, edited and narrated by Melvyn Bragg remains one of the 'stand out' documentaries that surveys the life, work and motivations of British painter, Francis Bacon, through a series of interviews. Bacon, an extraordinary man, laconically introduces the relationship between broad formalist concerns and attempts to connect with the subconscious. Bacon articulates his response to images of a distressed humanity, revealing his deep fascination with the human body and its connection with much of Bacon's life philosophies. Gritty in content, Bacon's paintings reveal much of the 'violence of life and death' but seek to describe the normality of this with controlled sense of chaos, 'capturing the moment'."
