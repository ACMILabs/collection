        "Filmed in Norway and on the Isle of Man, this documentary uses authentic recreations of Viking Journeys and activities to explain the reality behind the Viking Myths, who they were, where they came from, why they took long sea voyages and why their power terrified the world. It is the story of a local chieftain who is holding a feast to honour a guest to his house. Includes 3D graphics of Viking ship design and footage of the Viking fire festival held in York. Recreations by members of the Karmoy Viking Club."
