        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". Narrated by Polly Adams, this interesting documentary explores the paintings of Jasper Johns and follows his career from the 1950's through to 1988. As one of the major forces on the American art scene, Johns rejected abstraction in favour of realism and layed the ground work for Pop Art and Minimalism. Featuring excerpts from interviews with Richard Serra, Hilton Kramer, Merce Cunningham, Frank Stella, John Cage and many other friends including his agent Leo Castelli, this documentary provides a broad overview of his career. The soundtrack includes readings from composer John Cage."
