        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Great moments in science: presented by Dr Karl Kruszelnicki\". This entertaining animation presented by Karl Kruszelnicki explains the bow and arrow and its history and in so doing provides an explanation for the well known two finger salute. There is mention of the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and how the well trained British used the Welsh long bow to attack the French. All this adds up to the reason behind the two finger salute."
