        "In this charming animation based on the book by Raymond Briggs, Father Christmas decides to take a well-earned break after delivering all his presents on Christmas Eve. From France to Scotland to Las Vegas we follow the man in the red suit as he tries to relax and enjoy himself. However, this is not always easy or even possible for the busiest man in the world. A gentle parody of the English abroad, this film is a companion piece to 'The Snowman', another Christmas animation based on a Raymond Briggs story."
