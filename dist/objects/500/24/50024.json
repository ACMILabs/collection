        "Episode of Series \"The Alternative\". This episode of the fifteen part television series on complementary health focuses on two separate segments: \"Back pain\" and \"Migraine\". Dealing with back pain first, it is said that two-thirds of the population in the United Kingdom suffers from this physical ailment and that it is the second most common problem after heart disease. Back pain is usually caused through spinal disorders from accidents, sport injuries and work related physical stress. Treatment can be obtained from a range of practitioners including Osteopaths, Chiropractors, Physiotherapists and non-surgical medical practitioners. Using case studies, the following areas of therapy are discussed and demonstrated: Alexander technique/swimming; Osteopathy; Bowen technique; Electro-crystal therapy; Pilates. The second segment covers migraines which can be triggered off through various reasons including over exertion or stress causing tightness in the muscles. 60% of migraines are caused by displaced vertebrates in the cervical spine and can consist of many different symptoms, including headache, nausea, aversion to light and sound, vomiting, tiredness, It usually affects half the head and can sometimes create a sensititvity to alcohol, citrus, cheese, chocolate and other food types. The following areas of therapy are discussed and demonstrated: Magnet therapy; Osteopathy; 5-Element acupuncture; integrated treatment including therapeutic yoga, relaxation, breathing exercises, specific neck and spine exercises.
