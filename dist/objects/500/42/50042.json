        "This documentary video contains some rare archival footage of the German Luftwaffe carrying out some of their bombing operations during the years 1942-1945 of World War II including photo-intelligence surveillance, aerial bombings, strikes on allied convoys with anti-ship missiles and night bomber raids against the British. At one stage during 1942, the Luftwaffe were capable of launching up to 1000 sorties per day. However by 1944 due to the growing effectiveness of Allied air power, the Luftwaffe bombing force began to decline, until Germany's eventual surrender in May 1945. Aeroplane enthusiasts, and particularly those into war planes, will enjoy this documentary for its informative and historical visuals and its coverage of the various bombers used by the Luftwaffe, including the Junkers Ju-88 and Ju-188, the Dornier 217 series and the Heinkel He-111 and He-177, as well as flying boats and float planes operating from the Mediterranean through to the Arctic Ocean (in rare colour footage). Narrated by Brian Matthews."
