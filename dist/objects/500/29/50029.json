        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". The 18th in the Bond series finds Bond (Pierce Brosnan) battling crazed media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) who is intent on starting a war between England and China. His motivation - covering the event on his global satellite network and gaining kudos as the most powerful in current affairs and global business growth. Michelle Yeoh is the beautiful Wai Lin, a Chinese agent who teams up with Bond after crossing paths with him in her pursuit to find out what Carver really is up to. \"Tomorrow never dies\" is a fast paced action film full of over the top stunts and the usual comedy and sexual innuendo which will delight fans of 007. Cast also includes Dame Judi Dench, Teri Hatcher and Geoffrey Palmer."
