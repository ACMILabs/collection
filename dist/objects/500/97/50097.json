        "Liv Ullman, best known for her acting in iconic films by Ingmar Bergman, directs \"Faithless\", from a script by Bergman. \"Faithless\" is the story of a bourgeois Swedish family whose lives are put asunder by an extra-marital affair. Marianne (Lena Andre) is happily married to composer Markus (Thomas Hanzon), living with their young daughter, Isabelle. David (Krister Henriksson), a friend to both Marianne and Markus, is a hapless writer and theatre director, onto his troubled second marriage, and a frequent visitor to the family home. David is depicted as a charming rogue with a self-destructive streak, filled with self-loathing. One night, when Markus is away on tour, David proposes to Marianne that they sleep together. Marianne refuses but her interest is piqued and the sanctity of her family unit is doomed. Told in extended flashback sequences, Marianne relays her story to the narrator, Bergman (Erland Josephson), who listens patiently, coercing Marianne to confess her indiscretions. This set-up, at a beautiful, remote beachside retreat, is reminiscent of many Ingmar Bergman films, in particular \"Persona\". \"Faithless\" employs a leisurely pace to unfurl this tale of morality, betrayal, love and revenge, between three consenting adults and an innocent child. In Swedish with English subtitles."
