        "Formulated on the occasion of a major retrospective on the work of renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz at the International Center of Photography, New York, which toured internationally, this documentary explores Leibovitz's career from the 1960s to the 1990s and discusses a wide range of her most celebrated work during this time. The program features in-depth interviews with Leibovitz herself about her life, career and particular works and features commentary from her colleagues, art critics and her subjects, including commentary from Mick Jagger, Demi Moore, Hunter S. Thompson and the editors of Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair magazines. Liebovitz is filmed at work on various photo shoots with a focus on sequences surrounding her most compelling images such as the 1977 concert tour with the Rolling Stones, her cover photo of Yoko Ono and John Lennon taken shortly before his death in 1980, and the controversial 1993 cover shot of a naked and pregnant Demi Moore. Through such wide ranging material the program traces the progression and turning points of her life and work and the stylistic visions which signify particular points in her career. It provides a thorough survey on and insight into this major photographer, her documentation of American youth culture, politics, celebrity culture and her own professional and personal aims and achievements."
