        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". In the first episode of this three part series, Karl Lagerfeld discusses the history of fashion from its rise in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the present day. Lagerfeld's commentary, layered over a backdrop of fashion illustrations and archival footage, provides a broad survey of the evolution of this fascinating industry. The film begins by introducing the work of Charles Worth, inventor of haute couture and explores the changes of fashion over time to the work of some of the leading designers of today: Donna Karan; Fendi; Versace; Ralph Lauren; Valentino. Other areas that are discussed through interviews with leading industry players include dressmaking, fur, embroidery, hats, hairstyles, magazines and advertising techniques. Commentary written by Meredith Etherington-Smith and spoken by Diana Quick."
