        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". Donatello is said in this documentary to be the most versatile and imaginative of all artists of his century and he is credited with bringing the Renaissance to Italy. The intense and personal work of Donatello is examined here in terms of his vision, emotion and techniques. Most notable is his inventive techniques in his work such as was used in his relief making sculpture. Writer and art historian Charles Avery locates an obscure terra-cotta relief of Donatello's in Florence and throughout the documentary the authentication of the work is shown. Avery discusses the work of Donatello along with sculptors Henry Moore, Elisabeth Frink, and Peter Rockwell. This documentary was made shortly after the restoration of a number of significant works by Donatello and is the first time that these works can be seen in their former glory revealing a brilliance in colour and detail not seen in recent history."
