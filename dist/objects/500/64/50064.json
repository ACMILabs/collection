        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". This is the story of the modern English artist Ben Nicholson as remembered by some of his closest friends and colleagues: Patrick Heron, Andras Kalman, Sir Leslie Martin, Angela Verren and Dr Felicitas Vogler. At the height of his career, Nicholson was one of the few artists to obtain international recognition with his contributions to modern art. His 'white wall reliefs' of the 30's were his most notable work. This documentary traces his life and movements across Europe from Cumberland, St Ives to Switzerland - landscapes that were to influence his work greatly and remain a source of inspiration during his lifetime. Written and narrated by John Read."
