        "Louie, a Trumpeter swan born without a voice, falls in love but has no way of communicating his emotions. Feeling despondent and at odds with his siblings with wonderful calls, he leaves home on a journey where he meets a young boy called Sam and his teacher, Mrs Hammerbotham, who teaches Louie how to speak. Learning English is not the solution to Louie's problem however as none of the other swans can understand him. A solution is reached when Louie's father gives his son a trumpet which he begins to play proficiently. Unbeknownst to Louie though, his father has stolen the trumpet in a moment of desperation to help his son. A stint in a jazz band and a race to reclaim his now engaged childhood love, Serena, ensues in this animated adaption of E.B. White's classic children's tale. Features the voices of Dee Baker, Jason Alexander, Reese Witherspoon, Seth Green, Carol Burnett, Mary Steenburgen and Joe Mantegna."
