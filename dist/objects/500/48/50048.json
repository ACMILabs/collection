        "Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is 32, single, smokes too much, drinks too much, and says what is on her mind. After another disastrous New Years Eve, Bridget makes a resolution to keep a diary, lose weight, cut down on her smoking and drinking, and above all, find herself the perfect man. Her mother tries to assist her in her search for a man, setting her up with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth, in a role comparable to his performance as Mr. Darcy in 'Pride and Prejudice'), the son of an old family friend. Unfortunately, the first man to notice the new Bridget is her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), a chauvinistic womaniser with whom she starts a love affair, despite her attraction to Mark. Bridget's confusion over her attraction to Mark, her relationship with Daniel, is complicated by her meddling and slightly eccentric friends, and the breakdown of her parent's relationship. Based on the novel by Helen Fielding. Cast also includes Gemma Jones, Celia Imrie, Hugh Grant and Jim Broadbent."
