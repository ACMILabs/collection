        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". Pierre Bonnard was amongst one of the Nabi artists known to kick start French painting into modernism. Nick-named \"The Japanese Nabi\" for his predilection to things Japanese - exploring his love for line, colour and division of space, remained an inspiration throughout Bonnard's life. Mostly working from his home overlooking Cannes, Bonnard spent his life in search of 'pure colour' wanting \"to show what you see when you suddenly burst into a room\". This documentary describes Bonnard's relationship with contemporary artists such as Gauguin, Matisse, Cezanne, Seurat and Renoir, his personal relationship with his models and his personal vision expressed through his paintings and sketchbooks. A life dedicated to 'colour, form and reason' over content and feeling."
