        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". Cezanne is widely understood as \"the father of modernism\". It was Cezanne's studies of structure in the landscape that acted as a precursor to cubism and abstraction in the 20th Century. In his lifetime however he was much maligned by the critics and public alike and would often retreat into a rural solitary existence. His difficult relationship with his father and strained family life resulted in a lifelong struggle for happiness and determined much of his personal difficulties. This documentary details his 'constant' emotional struggles alongside his working career and draws on the observations of a number of contemporary artists and historians to help us understand how complex Cezanne's life was to his art. Commentaries by: Bridget Riley, Howard Hodgkin, R.B. Kitaj, Joseph Rishal, critic John Golding and granddaughter, Aline Cezanne."
