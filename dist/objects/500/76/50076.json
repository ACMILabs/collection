        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". This is a fine introduction to the work of renowned Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida (born 1914), who works mainly with iron, clay, and stone to create both monumental and smaller works of art. Chillida's art is primarily conceptual and not functional. We learn through his articulate commentary that Chillida is interested in space, time and the unknown. He begins the creative process without imposing preconceived thoughts, aims or ideas. Rather, Chillida seeks to break away from tradition, habit, expectation and repetition to discover and enter the unknown, the unseen. His approach is philosophical, and the result is impressive. The documentary also provides an overview of Chillida's childhood, family background, his affinity with his hometown San Sebastian, and his working methods. The local history and traditions of his hometown are an important influence on his work as is its natural wonders. The abstract minimalism of Chillida's art is spiritual, and a wondrous attempt to grapple with the mysteries and beauty of the world of nature."
