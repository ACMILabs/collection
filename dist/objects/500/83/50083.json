        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". Renowned war photographer W. Eugene Smith (1918-78) photographed the victims of war throughout his distinguished career. This is an insightful portrait of a powerful and sensitive artist who used his photographs to transmit a message against the greed, the stupidity and the intolerance that causes wars that bring cruelty and suffering to humanity."
