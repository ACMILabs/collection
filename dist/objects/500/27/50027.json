        "Directed and written by Diane Kurys, \"Apres l'amour\" is the tale of Lola (Isabelle Huppert), a passionate woman caught between the two men in her life. Lola is a professional writer of independent means, living in Paris. Her long-term lover with whom she lives is David (Bernard Giraudeau), an architect. Marianne (Lio), his wife and mother of his two children, longs for him to return to the family home. David is still sexually active with Marianne and involved in their children's lives. Lola meanwhile, is having an affair with a musician, Tom (Hippolyte Giradot), who is also married. Tom's wife, Elisabeth, is aware of his extra-marital activities but is confident, as the mother of his children, of her power over him. Lola writes about her affairs with both men, pondering the meaning of her connection to them. Elisabeth and Marianne (the respective wives) are driven to despair by their husbands' indiscretions. The film tracks a year in the life of the characters as they struggle to gain a sense of power over their relationships. \"Apres l'amour\" is a film about love, sex, marriage, commitment, parenthood and fidelity. Also starring Yvan Attal as David's brother, Romain. In French with English subtitles."
