        "Loosely based on director Dein Perry's early life as a dancer, \"Bootmen\" is the story of two brothers - Sean (Adam Garcia) and Mitchell (Sam Worthington) - working in a steel mill in the industrial city of Newcastle. Both dream of one day escaping from the mill, Sean as a tap dancer in Sydney and Mitchell purchasing a tow truck to get out of the only life their stern father has ever known. Tension arrises between the brothers when Sean quits the mill to go to Sydney to study with a well known dance troupe and Mitchell moves in on Sean's woman, Linda (Sophie Lee), both brothers finding themselves in love with her. \"Bootmen\" is a feel-good movie that is similar in genre to \"Strictly Ballroom\" and \"The Full Monty\", a touching and sweet film with wonderful tap dancing sequences. Cast also includes William Zappa, Richard Carter and Susie Porter."
