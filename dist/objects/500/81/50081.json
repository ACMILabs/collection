        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". The second of a two volume series, 'Raphael: the prince of painters' provides great background to Raphael's life, influences, education and professional friendships as an artist beyond his apprentice years. The documentary starts with Raphael's arrival to Rome aged twenty-five. Already famous for his work in Florence this volume focuses on Raphael's art as a matured vision and reflects on his relationship with the Vatican and Pope Julius the second and his entry into aristocratic high culture at a time of unrivalled confidence and riches in the Catholic Church. Raphael's tapestry work at the Sistine Chapel and the 'Transfiguration' altarpiece are focussed on in this documentary, his philosophy being reflected by his close friendships in humanist thinkers Baldassare Castiglione and Pietro Bembo and architect Donato Bramante. Written and narrated by David Thompson."
