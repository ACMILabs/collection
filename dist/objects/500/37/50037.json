        "Episode four in the \"Mummies and the wonders of Ancient Egypt\" series examines the tomb of King Tutankhamum, the first royal tomb ever discovered intact within the Valley of the Kings. Narrated by Frank Langella, this documentary includes footage of the tomb when it was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter and discusses the tomb's discovery and excavation, as well as the curse that some believe claimed the lives of many involved in the initial exploration. The contents of the tomb are shown, as is the face of the king himself, before moving on to the site of KV5 where the largest tomb ever has been discovered."
