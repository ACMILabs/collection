        "Episode of Series \"Royal Horticultural Society practical guides\". The definition of soft fruits are those grown on canes and bushes as opposed to trees, eg strawberries, raspberries etc. This video gives a practical guide for beginners and established enthusiasts on how to grow and produce soft fruits in a small to medium garden. It provides a most comprehensive step-by-step guide with a brief history of each plant and great close-up photography. Each fruit is covered separately and includes strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, currants and gooseberries with advice and demonstrations given on propagation, cultivation, pests and diseases treatment and prevention, and pruning. A brief summary is given at the end of each segment with a final overall summary of the key points for success at the end of the program. Written and narrated by John Walmsley and presented by Haden Williams."
