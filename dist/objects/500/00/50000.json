        "In Whoville, the Whos are overexcited, preparing for both Christmas, and the town's 'Whobelation', a celebration of everything 'Who'. The Grinch (Jim Carrey), living on Mount Crumpet overlooking the town of Whoville, despises everything about the holiday season and the town (due to a bad childhood Christmas experience) and decides to stop the festive season all together. Meanwhile, down in Whoville little Cindy Lou Who is trying to discover the true meaning behind Christmas and believes the Grinch might have the answers. A live-action adaptation of Dr. Seuss's Christmas classic 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas', narrated by Anthony Hopkins. Cast also includes Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Jeffrey Tambor."
