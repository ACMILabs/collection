        "Episode of Series \"Royal Horticultural Society practical guides\". Presented by Jekka McVicar, this detailed Royal Horticultural Society documentary offers a practical approach to the cultivation and use of herbs for both culinary and medicinal purposes. Beginning with a brief definition and history of herbs, the program goes on to provide detailed information on the creation of a herb garden, focusing on garden design, successful propagation using a variety of techniques, pruning, protecting, harvesting and drying. McVicar's enthusiasm for her subject is apparent as she leads the viewer on a visual odyssey through the world of herbs, sharing tips and anecdotes along the way. Examples of exceptional herb gardens, such as Rosemary Verey's Barnsley House and Raymond Blanc's garden at Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons are also shown, as are herb borders and other types of container, formal, and knot gardens."
