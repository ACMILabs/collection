        "Presented here are two adaptations of stories for children by the much loved Dr. Seuss: \"How the Grinch stole Christmas\" and \"If I ran the zoo\". Narrated by Walter Matthau, \"How the Grinch stole Christmas\" is the story of the people from Who-ville...\"Every Who in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot...But the Grinch, who lived just north of Who-ville, did not!\". \"If I ran the zoo\" tells a tale of young McGrew and his fantastical animals like the scraggle-foot Mulligatawny and the elephant cat,\"Young McGrew's made his mark. He's built a zoo better than Noah's whole ark\". Narrated by Brett Ambler."
