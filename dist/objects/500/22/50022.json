        "When the 'House of Mouse' is snowed in during a cabaret performance, Mickey Mouse pulls all stops to keep the Disney characters entertained and the Christmas spirit flowing. With the help from a host of regular Disney characters, Mickey reintroduces some of the classic Disney Christmas stories. But will Donald Duck shrug his scrooge-like ways and join the party? Animated excerpts include: 'House of mouse', 'Donald on Ice', 'The Nutcracker', 'Mickey's Christmas carol', and 'Oh what a merry Christmas day'."
