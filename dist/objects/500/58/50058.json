        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) was one of the world's leading sculptors of the 20th century. By rights American, residing in both Long Island and the Japanese island Shikoku, Noguchi throughout the documentary makes reference to his 'nomadic' life influenced by his family upbringing and this relationship to his work. Throughout the documentary, Noguchi explores his relationship with place, sculpture and stone (his chosen material) discussing freely his ideas and motivations. Some of his large scale commissions from the 60's to the late 70's are featured in locations as varied as Paris, Detroit, Japan and Mexico City along with the sets he designed for Martha Graham's dance \"Cortege of Eagles\" (see 16mm film title #015721 of the same title). Written, directed and narrated by Bruce W. Bassett, this documentary features some iconic photography by Bruce G. Sparks that captures the spirit of the time reflecting the value of Noguchi's legacy."
