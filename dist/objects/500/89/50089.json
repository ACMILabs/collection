        "David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott and Julianne Moore star in this Sci-Fi comedy about a team of unlikely heroes trying to save the world from an alien invasion. Wayne Green, a wannabe fireman is practising for his fireman's test when a meteor crashes into his car. He calls in the police who, in turn, call in college professor Ira Kane and his friend, geologist Harry Block. Together, they discover the meteor was carrying single-celled organisms which were evolving at a fast rate. When strange creatures appear in the area surrounding the meteor and start attacking the government is called in to investigate. When the trio discovers the government's plan to destroy the aliens will actually cause them to reproduce faster, Ira, Harry and Wayne - with the assistance of Government scientist Allison Reed, attempt to save the day. Directed by Ivan Reitman, \"Evolution\" borrows jokes from his film \"Ghostbusters\" as well as from the hit film \"Men in Black\". Cast also includes Dan Aykroyd in a cameo role as the Governor of Arizona."
