        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". A comprehensive documentary on one of the most important contemporary artists of 20th Century France, Christian Boltanski. Interviewed by Melvyn Bragg, Boltanski's childhood influences, mostly the affects of the Holocaust on society in post-war France are explored in direct reference to a series of Boltanski's work spanning over a period of 30 years. Boltanski's passion for ethnology, collections and death, as themes central to his art, are discussed in relationship to his work. The subtlety of broad themes are constantly explored in his work: the nature of the killer, heroes and villains, quantifying loss. Boltanski uses mostly photographs in his installation pieces. Works featured in the documentary: 'Shadows' (1985); 'Sans Souci' (1991); 'The Reserves' (1993); 'The Dead Swiss'; 'The Art of the Venice Biennale 1938' (1993); 'Comical Skits'(1974)."
