        "Hans the shoemaker shuts himself off from the Christmas preparations going on around him in his German village, as he has no family and few friends. One night he is visited by an angel who promises him a special gift at Christmas. He crafts a special pair of red boots to give in return. As the story unfolds, Hans learns the pleasure of caring and giving to others, and finally realises that this is his gift from God. Based on \"Die Roten stiefel\" by Dr. Paul Christoph and produced by the Lutheran Church."
