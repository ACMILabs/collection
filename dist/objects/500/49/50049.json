        "Joe Dirt (David Spade) is a janitor, has a 'mullet' hairstyle and is the butt of many jokes in the building where he works. Abandoned as a child at the Grand Canyon by his birth parents, Joe is raised by foster parents, until he makes the decision to find his family and ask them why they left him behind. When he is discovered by a radio DJ (Dennis Miller) in Los Angeles, Joe goes live on air and shares the adventures he had while searching for his parents with the listeners, captivating the entire city. Cast also includes Christopher Walken, Brittany Daniel, Kid Rock and Jaime Pressley."
