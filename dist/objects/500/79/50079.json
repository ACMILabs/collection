        "Episode of Series \"Phaidon art collection\". In the third of this three part series, Karl Lagerfeld as presenter discusses the history of fashion in the 20th Century focussing on 'The age of dissent', the 60's and beyond. Lagerfeld enlightens with commentary the archival footage of fashions from the last forty years with interviews of respected seniors of the industry such as; Ralph Lauren, Issy Miyaki, Mary Quant, Ballenciaga, John Crancher, Georgio Armani, Ralph Lauren and more. In emphasis is the shift from a controlled environment to one that defines the day of 'anything goes'. Explored is the change in attitude toward the making, showing and promotion of fashion since the sixties, a change that has developed from social conditions and lifestyle. From the ultimate dissent of 'Punk' to the sleek and subtle work of Jean Muir, this program celebrates design in a time where the lines between art and fashion have blurred and an increase of cultural exchange has fashioned a diffusion of styles."
