        "This big screen adaptation of the popular 70s TV series sees the return of the beautiful, brilliant and sassy angels who work for billionaire recluse, Charles Townsend. Together with their fellow colleague, Bosley, they are sent to work when an electronic genius, Eric Knox, is kidnapped. They soon discover even even bigger problems are at bay when they realise Knox's latest technology is a system which can monitor voice communication from anywhere in the world. This is an exuberant action comedy which never takes itself seriously, combining modern day themes with elements of 70s cheese. Cast includes: Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Luck Liu, Bill Murray, Sam Rockwell, Tim Curry, Kelly Lynch, Crispin Glover and the voice of John Forsythe as Charlie."
