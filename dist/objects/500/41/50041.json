        "The Bach Flower Remedies represent a system of healing for the personality and temperament. Their purpose is to help to re-establish emotional equilibrium and thus act as an aid to one's own natural healing. This interesting and informative video gives a general guide to Dr Edward Bach's flower remedies. Bach believed that the real cause of an illness was the mental state or temperament of the patient and not the condition of their body. Using flowers from plants and trees, Bach had, by the time of his death, discovered 38 remedies which he divided into seven groups: fear; uncertainty; insufficient interest in present circumstances; loneliness; over-sensitivity to influence and ideas; despondency or despair; over care for the welfare of others. Filmed at Mount Vernon, the cottage in Oxfordshire where Dr Edward Bach spent the last years of his life, Brenda Longman (presenter and narrator) discusses various aspects of the remedies with John Ramsell and Judy Howard (trustees and curators of Mount Vernon) including a demonstration in making up the remedies, the process of determining the right remedy for a particular type of person, self-help advice and examples of remedies for depression and anger. A recommended reading list is provided at the end of the program."
