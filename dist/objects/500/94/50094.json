        "Oliver Stone's unflinching macabre black comedy is possibly one of the most despairing films, a destructive romp through American popular culture witnessed through the eyes of Mickey and Mallory (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis), two young serial killers. From the sit-com parody of Mallory's sexual abuse by her father (Rodney Dangerfield) - it comes complete with laughtrack - to the apocalyptic jail riot that cements the killers' reputations as cultural heroes, \"Natural Born Killers\" presents a vehement hate-letter to television and media technologies. The cast is outstanding, including Robert Downey Jr who is very funny as a sicko Australian compere of a television show that celebrates mass murder and Tommy Lee Jones as the psycho-warden of a top-security prison. \"Natural Born Killers\" is violent, obscene and extravagant, a rollercoaster through the media sewers of the United States. It is also a brilliant collision of filmmaking styles; with everything from music video to the avant-garde, from porn to propaganda. Features a suitably fiery soundtrack of industrial metal, punk, Arabic chants and hardcore techno. Cast also includes Robert Downey Jr., Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore."
