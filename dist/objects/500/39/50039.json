    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"Royal Horticultural Society practical guides\". Propagation is a way of allowing you to introduce a wide variety of plants into your garden whilst at the same time providing a cost-benefit and sense of achievement with the results. This excellent two-part program filmed at the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley and presented by an expert team of RHS gardeners demonstrates the various techniques involved in propagating, beginning with seed sowing, and followed by division, layering, cuttings, budding and grafting, and chipping and scaling. Close-up photography and detailed step-by-step instructions covering a large cross-section of plants, choice of equipment, plus lots of useful tips and ideas make this video an ideal choice for gardeners at all levels. Presented by Anne Swithinbank."
