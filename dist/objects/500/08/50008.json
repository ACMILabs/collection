        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Great moments in science: presented by Dr Karl Kruszelnicki\". It is safer for a cat to fall from a thirty-two story building than a seven story building and testing these things are easy in the ready made environment of New York and its high rise. It is said that one hundred and thirty two cats in five months fall from high rise buildings. Lots of information has been gathered, and it had been found that ninety percent of cats survive. In fact, the higher the building, the higher the chance of survival, the shorter the distance, the greater the chance of broken bones. Find out more in this animation, it is very interesting."
