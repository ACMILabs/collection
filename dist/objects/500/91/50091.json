        "Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell) and his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) lost their father to a tragic rock climbing accident, an accident that left Peter having to cut his father free from a rope they were all clinging to in order to save his and Annie's lives. Years later, Annie has become a world class mountain climber who is hired by Elliot Vaughn to help him climb K2, the second highest peak in the world. Peter has given up climbing to become a nature photographer. In the middle of the climb bad weather strikes and Elliot, Annie and their crew find themselves trapped by an avalanche. Peter, working on an assignment near K2 organizes a rescue mission to help Annie and the other climbers before they run out of air."
