        "Narrated by Frank Langella, the second documentary in the \"Mummies and the wonders of Ancient Egypt\" series examines the history of the sphinx, the half man half cat statue, from its origins to the latest attempts at its restoration. As guardian to the Giza plateau, local legend has it that this mystical statue is also guarding the Great Pyramid of Kahfre. Used as target practice by Napoleon's troops, the Sphinx has undergone many restorations. With the aid of computer technology this documentary is able to re-create what the Sphinx looked like in its original state, and discusses the secrets and legends behind one of Egypt's most recognised landmarks."
