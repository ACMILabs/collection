    "description": [
        "The Isle of Man is located in the centre of the British Isles. With their strong Celtic influences, the Isle has a strong tradition of storytelling, some similar to other stories from Celtic lands, some unique to the Isle itself. Narrated by Manx students Ben and Sarah, and told by Manx residents, these ten tales capture the essence of Celtic history. Each story is introduced, their origins explained, and then told accompanied by illustrations provided by Manx students."
