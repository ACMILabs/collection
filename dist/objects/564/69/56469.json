        "Presents dramatized re-enactments of three case studies of teenage pregnancies: a girl who gives up her baby for adoption when she realizes she cannot cope; a girl who lives with her parents after the birth; and a couple who marries after the girl becomes pregnant. De-romanticises the notion of \"Having a baby\" by pointing out some commo problems of teenage pregnancies."
