        "A documentary exploring the life and music of the legendary Count Basie. Using rare footage from the 30s and 40s and interviews with his favourite musicians and admirers, this tribute recalls the Count's famous numbers (\"One o'clock jump, Jumping at the Woodside, Every tub, The Kid from Red Bank, Doggin' around, Little darlin', April in Paris) and reveals the personality behind them. Count Basie himself tells of the early influence of Fats Waller and Pete Johnson and his first barnstorming days in Kansas City. Suitable for middle and upper secondary, and tertiary levels."
