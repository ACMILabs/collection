        "Presents a group of cross-country skiers talking about the sport, telling how it is a way of life for them rather than a pastime. Shows them skiing in various settings. Also depicts the correct way to build and occupy a snow cave, and contrasts equipment - skis circa 1900 versus today's efficient, low-cost skinny skis. Suitable for middle and upper secondary and teacher/tertiary levels."
