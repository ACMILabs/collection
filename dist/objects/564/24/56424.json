        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Geography today: a search for order\". Examines the relationship between waves and beaches on Spurn head on the north shore of the Humber Estuary. Simulated demonstrations, using time-lapse photography, show the effects of waves and sand in a wave tank. Discusses sediment movement and the effect of different amounts of wave energy on beaches. Simple field experiments examine the factors effecting the size and shape of a beach. Suitable for senior students due to technical language and complex concepts."
