        "Provides an account of the evolution of blues music from its origins in the rural south of America to the contemporary electric sound shaped in the ghettos of Chicago. The harsh experiences of blacks in America and the liberation they found through music are delineated through archival footage, interviews and performances by musicians at home or in Southside clubs. Features amongst others, Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Floyd Jones, J.B.Hutto and Dick Gregory. This film is suitable for tertiary levels."
