        "Reveals many of the impressive monuments built by the ancient Egyptians such as the pyramids at Giza and the temples at Karnak, Luxor and Abu Simbal: it also looks at the enormous task faced by archaeologists and Egyptologists in their struggle to preserve the artifacts of Egypt's past, which are deteriorating at an alarming rate due to population increase, tourism and the Nile's rising waters. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels. Includes teacher's guide."
