        "A look at the making of \"Winstanley\", a low budget feature film by independent filmmakers Kevin Brownlow and Arthur Mollo. Shows the search for actors, locations and money for this adaptation of a period from 17th century British history, concerned with the setting up of a commune by Winstanley, a man with a socialist vision. As well, Brownlow and Mollo talk of their beginnings in the film industry and their other film ventures. Suitable for middle and upper secondary and tertiary levels."
