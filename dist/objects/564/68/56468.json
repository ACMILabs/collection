        "Documents the problem of worldwide hunger, its causes and solutions. Looks at how Third World governments trade the lives and health of their people for personal gain, how Western foreign policy supports corrupt Third World governments and how multinational corporations use business practices which often rob the poor of their land and food. Also shows how improved farming methods not dependent upon extensive energy and technology or foreign investment could help reduce hunger. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
