        "Part of a series in which distinguished anthropologist Richard Leakey traces the origin of our species. Includes the discovery of the footprints of upright humans who existed in Tanzania over 4 million years ago, the famous skeleton \"Lucy\" from Ethiopea and demonstrates a post-mortem done in the USA on a man who died one and a half million years ago. Other examples of finds showing the evolution of upright humans are shown. Leakey also explains one of the dilemmas of science - trying to find evidence to fit a theory. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
