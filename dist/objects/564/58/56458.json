        "Episode of Series \"The Biological sciences\". Commencing with 3.5 billion year old fossil evidence, this program traces cellular development from prokaryotes, the cellular pioneers of our oxygen based ecology system, through to the eukaryotic cells, which compose all advanced forms of life. Introduces recent theory to explain the quantam leap forward in complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotic cells. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
