        "A contemporary drama featuring Lorna Lesley, Sam Neill and Martin Vaughan. Portrays a young woman's conflicts with her parents, her love affair while still at school, her marriage to her former teacher, their subsequent separation and the near disastrous effects it has upon her life. In tracing an archetypal journey from adolescence to adulthood, the film probes both the 'silences of family life' and the tenuousness of relationships. Suitable for senior students. Teacher preview recommended."
