        "Told in their own words, this film provides a commentary on the American Indians' way of life prior to the erosion of their cultural values by European civilization. Highlights their respect for the natural world and their appreciation of its importance to the physical, spiritual and psychological well-being of human beings. Photographs taken by Edward S. Curtis between 1896 and 1930 illustrate the traditional life of the Northwest plains and mountain Indians in its complete, authentic form. The commentary is selected from the words of: Black Elk, Brave Buffalo, Chief Flying Hawk, Chief Luther-Standing Bear, Chief Red Jacket, Chief Seattle. Music from \"Songs and Dances of the Flathead Indians\" and John Arlee."
