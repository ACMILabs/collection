        "An examination of rainforests and remaining wilderness areas focusing on the untouched forests (the Antarctic beech forests of the Upper Hastings River Valley of New South Wales) to show the importance of the conservation movement in preserving our wilderness areas. Studies the attitudes to land use from Aboriginal occupancy through the struggle of white settlers and the golden age of timber to the present day when conservation has become a powerful voice world-wide. Outlines the benefits of a rainforest ecology to man and the effects of the depletion of rainforests on the rest of the ecosystem. Examines the relationship of mill workers to their jobs. Uses archival footage and the words of Henry Thoreau from his book \"Walden\". Narrated by John Downes."
