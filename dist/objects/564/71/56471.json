        "Designed to alert younger children to the techniques and motivations behind television commercials. Shows how close-up shots, camera angles, lighting and special effects can make products seem bigger and more exciting than they really are, and points out how the narration in commercials can be misleading. Also notes how important product information and disclaimers are often included very briefly and subtly at the end of a commercial. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
