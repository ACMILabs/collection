        "Uses simple experiments to demonstrate the scientific properties of water. Shows that water can change forms from liquid to vapor through evaporation and condensation. It also depicts, through use of a model farm, how it can power a water wheel, irrigate paddocks and cause erosion. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
