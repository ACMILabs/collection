        "This film by Ken Loach, the Director of \"Cathy come home\", \"Family life and \"Kes\", takes a bleak but compassionate look at working-class life in contemporary Britain. It is set in Industrialized Sheffield and while not an attack on the system, the film implicity condemns the system's failure to cope with economic fluctuations. Script by Barry Hines."
