        "Indicates the enormous amount of skill and teamwork required to put together the puppet film 'The dark crystal' which was five years in the making. Shows the building of the sets from artists' impressions, the creation of the individual puppet characters and the training of the puppet operators who used video monitors to observe the puppets' movements as they worked. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
