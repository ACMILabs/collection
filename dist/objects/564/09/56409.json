        "An animated treatment of time dilation that utilises a flash counting sequence to show the unambiguous aging of twins in different frames of reference. Using only Einstein's postulates, but without using a single mathematical equation, the results are the same as those using the equations for the relativistic Doppler shift and the Einstein-Lorentz time dilation. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
