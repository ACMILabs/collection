        "Attempts to break down people's prejudices to people of other cultures by putting forward the view that prejudice is the result of fear based on lack of understanding. Interviews several people of ethnic origins living in Canada who still follow the customs and beliefs of their own cultures, including the wearing of particular clothing and hairstyles. Narrated by Professor Jamshed Mavalwala. Suitable for upper primary, lower and middle secondary levels."
