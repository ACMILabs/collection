        "Looks at the issue of abortion in America and the cases for and against abortion in relation to such areas as rape, incest, child abuse, mother's health and genetic abnormalities. Note that the film is sponsored by the Naitonal Abortion Rights League Foundation Education Project in America and is pro-abortion in its approach. It is therefore strongly recommended that teachers preview the film before screening it to students. Narrated by Ed Asner and Tammy Grimes. Suitable for upper secondary level."
