        "Episode of Series \"World cultures and youth\". The story of Lena, a 17-year-old girl who decides to become a glassblower against the wishes of her parents, who want her to take up tertiary education. As well as dealing positively with this conflict, the film shows many aspects of the craft of glassblowing - in particular, that carried out at the Orrefors establishment in Sweden. Suitable for upper primary, lower and middle secondary levels."
