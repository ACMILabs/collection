        "Uses the phase contrast optical system to show that living cells are very active structures. Shows how movement can be detected in the cytoplasm of the cells, ranging from a streaming movement of the early cytoplasm to movements by a whole variety of cellular organelles. The cell surface also exhibits movement, and even in the case of multicellularorganisms, movement of the whole cell can be observed. Suitable for upper secondary level."
