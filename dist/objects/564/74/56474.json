        "Dr. Carl Sagan discusses the fossil record, the respective evolutionary theories of Darwin and Wallace and the alternative explanation of a \"great designer\". Shows that life forms developed comparatively late in terms of the development of the cosmos as a whole and a computer-animated sequence recapitulates the path of evolution from the single-celled organism to the first human."
