        "Humorously explains the pitfalls of renting and looking after oneself. Two 18 year-old boys rent a flat and fall into strife over bills, shopping, cooking and sharing of tasks; their ever-present landlady/caretaker is always ready to provide sound advice. Raises for consideration the following points: lease v monthly tenancy, rent and bond, secondhand v new furniture, phone installation costs, laundering of clothing, economical places to shop, budgeting, hygiene in the kitchen, basic cooking procedures and rostering of household tasks. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
