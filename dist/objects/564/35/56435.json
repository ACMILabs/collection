        "Episode of Series \"World cultures and youth\". Focuses on sixteen-year-old boy Igor Lang who for two years has been a stableboy on the famed Lipica horse farm in Yugoslavia, training his mount, Maestozo, in the graceful steps of dressage. When Maestozo suffers a leg injury due to Igor's handling, the boy loses hope of participating in an upcoming celebration. But good care heals the wound and Igor and Maestozo play their part in the program that marks the farm's 400th anniversary. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
