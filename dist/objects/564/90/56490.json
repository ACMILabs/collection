        "A tale from China centred around the theme of the wolf in sheep's clothing. A caterpillar admits herself to the animal hospital after becoming ill from eating leaves of protected plants. Unfortunately for her, this is discovered by the medical staff who decide not to let her out. However, the caterpillar metamorphoses into a butterfly and seeks to deceive the hospital staff by playing on the fact that nothing as beautiful as she could do anything destructive. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
