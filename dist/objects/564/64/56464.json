        "A humorous and informative film which clearly outlines in a narrative context the factors necessary for good speech. Andrew, who suffers from a nasal problem which affects the clarity of his speech, is instructed by his teacher to speak at a parent teacher night on the importance of good speech patterns. During the days preceding the speech night, Andrew's friends, noting his lack of confidence, coach and encourage him in the points that make up good speech making - organisation and clarity. With practice, Andrew overcomes his barriers and impresses with his newly-developed abilities. Suitable for upper primary level."
