        "Episode of Series \"The Biological sciences\". Shows that an ecosystem is a system of interactions between the physical environment and the varied species populations which inhabit it. Describes how the ecological relationships in any given environment follow basic principles. Indicates that our own human species must make informed decisions based on an awareness of these principles and highlights the consequences of ignoring them. Stresses that human activities must be adapted to maintain the delicate balance of a complex worldwide ecosystem."
