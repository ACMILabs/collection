        "Made with the help of Myra Hilsendorf and Victoria's Art Project, this film utilizes the art of mentally retarded people to provide an indication of their potential capabilities. Introduces the view to Tommy's world through his drawings and also shows the paintings of other handicapped people. The vitality, immediacy and emotional impact of their work challenges the viewer to examine conventional attitudes towards handicapped people. No dialogue, musical background only."
