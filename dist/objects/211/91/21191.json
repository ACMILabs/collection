        "An experiment in animation technique produced by a group of amateur film makers, about a newly wed couple who cannot get rid of a door-to-door salesman. Pixillated technique is used in which the principles of animation are applied to real people rather than inanimate materials such as drawings and three-dimensional puppets."
