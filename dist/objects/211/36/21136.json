        "During the last three thousand years the commune of Borgo a Mozzano in Tuscany has often been touched by history but somehow, now, it has stopped growing. As an experiment in raising the standard of living an agronomist was called in. But peasants are conservative and it takes time to win them over, but at last this was done and a new way of life began to unfold."
