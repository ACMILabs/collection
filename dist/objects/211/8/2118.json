        "\"Men like me\" is a collaboration between the filmmaker and Dale Michaels and was made in 1994 when female to male transgender was relatively unfamiliar to the broader community and rarely discussed. Informative and sensitively presented the film uses interviews, vox pops, archival footage and stills, combined with computer animated images and narration by Susan Long and Dale Michaels."
