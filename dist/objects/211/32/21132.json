        "An amusing diagnosis of big city growing pains. This film is an ironic view of town planning or rather, the lack of it and what has happened to our cities as a result. Done in cartoon animation, the film traces the growth of the typical city, from a tiny settlement in the vast North American wilderness to the car-clogged metropolis that so many cities are today. Awards: New York; Oberhousen; Les Menuires."
