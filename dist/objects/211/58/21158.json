        "Dramatised documentary of a young African boy, Kumasenu, making his way unaided from the tribal world into the twentieth century. He has known no life other than that of a quiet fishing village. Wrongly accused of bringing bad luck to his people he becomes an outcast and an easy prey to the temptations of the city life of which his flash friend Agboh thinks so highly. Until helped by new friends, life for him is bewildering and dangerous."
