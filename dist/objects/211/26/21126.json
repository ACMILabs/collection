        "States that education is a continuing process which does not end when school studies are completed. The ways in which the modern public library serves this purpose and meets practical needs in the community are illustrated. The film describes how the Alabama library extension agency operates and how it helps local communities in establishing and strengthening county libraries. Various forms of library services designed to meet special needs in the community are described. These include the use of bookmobiles to bring books, recorded music, and films to outlying rural communities."
