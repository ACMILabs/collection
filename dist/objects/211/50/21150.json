        "This film traces the introduction and spread of the disease throughout Australia; why it persists in the north and how in spite of all precautions it occasionally infiltrates to the south. The main section of the film depicts in detail the characteristic symptoms and post-mortem findings, the effectiveness of vaccination, and the nature of present and past research work of the Division of Animal Health and Production."
