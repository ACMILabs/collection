        "To improve the supply and quality of milk in Bombay, the Government began construction in 1948 of a dairy farm and passed a law requiring that all cattle herds be moved outside the city limits. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations sent an expert in animal husbandry and a dairy technologist to work with local officials and experts."
