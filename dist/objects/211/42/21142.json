        "Unambiguously, the film explains cerebral palsy and shows various activities of handicapped people in England, including sheltered workshops and social clubs, like Joe's Club, which caters not only for the handicapped, but their siblings as well. Both the handicapped and the people involved with them discuss some of the problems faced by the handicapped in England."
