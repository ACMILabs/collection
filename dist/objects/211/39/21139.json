        "One quarter of the world's population is Chinese, yet their habits and customs are little known. This is a story of a Chinese family and the life that surrounds them. They left China soon after the Revolution and now live in one of the huge government housing blocks in the thriving British colony of Hong Kong, where since the mass exodus from China it is possible to mingle with greater freedom than ever before with people born and brought up in China. Tells of their domestic, social, business, and cultural life. Narrated by Anthony Lawrence."
