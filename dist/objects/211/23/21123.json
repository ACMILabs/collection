        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Printing as a Career\". Demonstrates book-binding. Pages are machine folded into sections - two types of folding machines are seen in operation; sections are then pressed and the end papers glued. The different sections comprising a book are sewn together; pressing machines round and shoulder the spines which are then glued to receive the cheesecloth; the building in process, in which the shoulders and backs of the books are shaped, is followed by the making and affixing of the cases. After lettering, dust covers are added by hand."
