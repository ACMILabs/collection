        "Education of deaf children in Victoria. At the Princess Elizabeth Kindergarten for the Deaf, very young children start the training which will fit them into a world of sound. Specially trained staff teach small groups by means of lip-reading, drawings and play-acting. Older children attend the St Kilda Road School, where, beside the ordinary curriculum, they learn domestic science, typing or a trade. Commentary by George Fairfax."
