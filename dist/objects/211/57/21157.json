        "The enchantment to be found in a bush-like garden by a young boy who reflects the spirit shown in the statue of Pan playing his pipes. Scampering, dabbling his toes, floating flower petals and pressing his face close to the flowers, he shows us his fascination in the wonder of nature. A film without commentary and with flute accompaniment. Music: Nancy Tow."
