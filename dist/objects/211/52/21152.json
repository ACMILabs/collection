        "An analysis of the slow-medium bowling action of Ray Smith of Essex. The movements of Smith's body in a run-up and delivery are shown and analysed, using normal speed, slow motion, and suspended shots. At four key positions of the action, H.P. Crabtree illustrates a method by which boys can obtain concentrated practice in pitching the ball for both length and direction. Commentary by John Arlott and filmed on location at Lord's (MCC), the home of cricket."
