        "A story of conflict and rebellion in a teenage girl that, to a large degree, typifies the problems of emotional adjustment experienced by many adolescents in their striving towards maturity. We meet Nora Fenton, a disturbed 15-year-old girl who, because of her persistent defiance of parental authority and self-injurious behavior, is sent to a remedial home for problem adolescents. As the film reviews Nora's problems, we see how understanding, affection and firm parental guidance are th factors most needed in helping teenagers weather their most turbulent years."
