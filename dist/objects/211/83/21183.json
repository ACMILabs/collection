        "How successful delegation sets free the energy and talents which are the real strength of any undertaking and the importance of overcoming the basic psychological obstacle: fear. At an organisational conference, three men competent and experienced in their own fields, but new to the responsibilities of supervision, are put in charge of newly expanded departments and are faced with a deadline resulting from a rush contract. As the months pass, each experiences and overcomes three of the most prevalent fears of delegation; fear of loss of job satisfaction, of mistakes and their repercussions and fear of loss of authority and prestige."
