        "An exciting study of Ravel's composition \"Bolero\" with the subtle meanings and accents polished to a brilliant interpretation by members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra with Zubin Mehta. The film involves the viewer in each musician's approach to his part in individual performance. It also gives some insight into Mehta's perspective on musical values in the composition. Suitable for upper primary and secondary levels."
