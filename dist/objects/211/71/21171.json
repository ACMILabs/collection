        "Dramatised incidents from the boyhood of Edison - his sitting on eggs to hatch them, his early experiments with chemicals and electricity, the newspaper he published on a train, provide an insight into his character traits. His curiosity, persistence, ingenuity, and his ability to learn through observation, qualities which later helped him change the world."
