        "It took a boy with his eyes on the stars to show that even the best town is a poor town when it has no place for books. Beaver River, a farming community in north central Saskatchewan, has paved roads, a new school, a curling rink, and many television sets, but no place where a boy could find a book about the stars. In this film Beaver River gets its own library and, in the process, illustrates Saskatchewan's regional library system which provides book loans at minimum costs to municipality and province. This film is historically good for the pictorial/architecture/general life style of such a country town of it's time."
