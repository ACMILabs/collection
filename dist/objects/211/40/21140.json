        "A documentary about the mentally handicapped children cared for at the Melbourne Kew Cottages. Founded in 1887 mainly owing to the campaigning of Dr J.V. McCleery, the Superintendant of the Kew Mental Hospital, the cottages are now one of the largest government institutions for the care and training of mentally handicapped children. Gives an unusual insight into this little-understood problem in talks with nurses who tell of the activities at the centre. Parents of handicapped children explain what these children have meant in their lives, and of the decision to send the youngsters to the cottages. Narrated by Gerald Lyons."
