        "A story of two children for whom a difference in language made no difference once the first moves were made. When French-speaking Jacques moves next door to English-speaking Jimmy, each is amazed to find that the other doesn't speak his language. But when it comes to exploring, playing together, language just doesn't seem to matter."
