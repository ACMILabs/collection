        "Children learn to enjoy the art of making dolls from bottles, with plasticine. Imaginative use is made of a variety of materials at Brisbane's Creative Leisure Centre. Costumes may be sewn, pinned or glued on to the figure and arms joined on with strips of plasticine. Finished figures are lined up and music-makers accompany the procession of completed dolls."
