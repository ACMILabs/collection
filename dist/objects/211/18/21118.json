        "Episode of Series \"Brickwork\". This film describes why different types of bonds are used and proceeds to demonstrate various bonds. It explains that \"bonding\" means to arrange bricks to a definite pattern according to function. A wall in \"Flemish\" bond is shown and its construction demonstrated in a one brick and a one and a half brick wall. \"English\" bond is then dealt with followed by \"Dutch\" bond. English and Flemish garden wall bonds bring the film to a close."
