        "England, Denmark, New Zealand and America are the major dairying countries of the world which use artificial insemination. In order to improve the dairy herds in Western Australia the government has set up a research station which supplies commercial herds with semen from top-quality bulls. Records show that artificial insemination has proved its worth to the dairy farmer in increased production, better quality milk and healthier herds."
