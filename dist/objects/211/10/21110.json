        "This film is an exposition of the human body's three lines of defence against disease: the skin, the phagocytic cells and lymphatics, and the blood. Types of antibodies and their effect, the action of the liver and the spleen, and the application of a defence mechanism in specific cases are studied in detail. Immunology is also studies, and microphotography shows us phagocytosis."
