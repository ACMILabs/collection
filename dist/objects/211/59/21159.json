The West Vancouver Boys' Band (there are girls in it too), prizewinners at band festivals in Canada and Europe, set feet tapping in this film as they rehearse for a local gala event. Follows a new recruit, to show the full scope of musical opportunity given to youngsters in Vancouver through joint community effort."
