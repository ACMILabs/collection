        "This is a study of Scotland's woollen industry, and, in particular, the weaving of the famous rainbow-hued Border cloth. From all over the world comes wool for Border looms to manufacture into the finest woollen cloth in the world. This film shows the processes in detail, from the preliminary grading and scouring of the wool, the careful blending of the brilliant colors for dyeing and the spinning of the yarn."
