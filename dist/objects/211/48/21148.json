        "This film is a plea for human understanding of our fellows. Its message is that we must learn, as people, to live together in harmony and tolerance, making every effort to overcome the invisible lines which divide us against each other - lines which spring from fear, greed, hate, and prejudice, the boundary lines of environment, wealth, skin colour, religion, language and racial origin. The technique of this film is of particular interest; conventional animation is used sparingly; for its impact Boundary Lines relies mostly on drawings moved in relation to the camera."
