        "In October 2002, just before opening at Federation Square, ACMI and the City of Melbourne asked the Kids Own Publishing Partnership from Ireland to run a workshop for over 300 primary school students from 8 schools in the city. Each group of kids had a different job to do - some made and filmed shadow puppets, some acted, some digitally animated, and some created an original soundtrack with artists from the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The result was the very first Made @ACMI student movie 'Screens and Screams'"
