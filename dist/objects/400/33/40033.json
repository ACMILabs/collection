        "Madeline (the mischievous little heroine with a heart twice her size) and eleven of her friends experience a snowstorm and are confined indoors. But it's Christmas so Madeline cares and cleans for her sneezing friends with many songs and cheer, reminding us all of the true spirit of Christmas - love and friendship. Based on the popular novels by Ludwig Bemelmans and narrated by Christopher Plummer."
