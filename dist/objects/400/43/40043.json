        "John Galsworthy's remarkable story continues... the 1920's heralds a new age in politics and culture, but the Forsytes are haunted by familiar tensions. Fleur and Jon's relationship is destroyed by the bitter family feud that still lingers on, driving Fleur into marriage with the socially conscious Michael Mont, and Jon to America after his father's death. The emergence of Mont's best friend, Wilfred Desert, as a threat to their happiness bring the echo of past passions to the story once more; whilst Soames, ever anxious for a grandchild and male heir, has his troubles compounded by the teetering foreign investments of the insurance company on whose board he sits."
