        "Narrated by Christopher Plummer, this is another Madeline adventure based on the popular books by Ludwig Bemelmans. Pepito and Madeline have been left on top of the ferris wheel and the weather has turned from bad to rotten. Luckily the strong man, the Clown and the elephant rescue them and the adventurous pair join the gypsy circus. They love to swim in a pool while the other children have to go to school, and they love never to be told to brush their teeth or go to sleep. However along the way, they develop a lion-sized case of homesickness. They miss their families, their friends, their clean clothes and their beds. Still, Miss Clavel hasn't forgotten them. She visits the circus with their friends - and happy is how this story ends!"
