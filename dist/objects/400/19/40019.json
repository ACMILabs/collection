        "Soar away on a magic carpet ride of non-stop enchantment in the most spectacular animated adventure of all time. Outrageously funny, furiously fast-paced and packed with dazzling surprises this film won two Academy Awards for Best Song ('A Whole new world') and for Best Score. Follow the fantastic story of Aladdin, a street-smart peasant boy who, with one rub of a magic lamp, meets up with the most hip, hilarious, totally unpredictable Genie the screen has ever seen. But the evil sorcerer, Jafar, also craves the lamp's power. If Aladdin is to defeat him and win the love of the free spirited Jasmine, he must learn to be himself - and that's one wish the Genie can't grant! Now enjoy the breathtaking Disney artistry and phenomenal fun. Robin Williams is hilarious as the voice of the Genie. Voices also include Scott Weinger, Linda Larkin, Jonathan Freeman, Frank Welker."
