        "Episode of Series \"Classic Looney Tunes Cartoons\". This special collection of Porky Pig cartoons highlights all the loveable characteristics of this rotund Looney Tunes favourite. Timid and shy, Porky's wide-eyed innocence and boyish eagerness often play him straight into the hands of the more assertive characters such as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck (see \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" for a perfect example) who easily bamboozle him. The first of the Warner Brothers cartoon stars, Porky has undergone many changes since his debut in 1935, but he is still as cute as ever and he continues to delight young and old alike with his blushing naivete, famous stutter and appealing sweetness."
