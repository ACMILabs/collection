        "Reading out loud from letters sent by her mother in Beirut, Hatoum constructs a visual montage that evokes feelings of separation and isolation from her Palestinian family. The personal and political are inextricably bound in a narrative that explores personal and family identity against a backdrop of traumatic social rupture, exile and displacement."
