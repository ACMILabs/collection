        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". Having arrived at the end of his life, Ingres assembled twenty five nude women in a lovingly prepared canvas. Even today, the painting inspires as much repulsion as it does fascination. Amongst the most memorable criticisms Paul Claudel's opinion of it as \"a cake of maggots\" is probably the most damning. The program describes the painting in detail, and the sources in Ingres earlier work, and the work of others, for the figures in the painting, as well as its transformation from a rectangle to a circular tondo. Haunted, all of his life by the nude, this painting is his most comprehensive tribute to female beauty."
