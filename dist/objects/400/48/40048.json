        "How big is too big? This problem explores the question of scale by looking at the impossibility of Hollywood monsters, who, in reality, would have collapsed under their own weight. In relation to this the program looks at proportion, similarity and tensile strength and then moves on to a discussion of patterns, tiling and regular polygons and concludes with a look at four-fold and five-fold symmetry."
