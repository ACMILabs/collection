        "Written and presented by famed Australian journalist, John Pilger, this confronting documentary looks at the history of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. Since the 1975 invasion of this tiny island, the Indonesian military government has enacted a policy of genocide which has resulted in over 200,000 deaths and the attempted dismantling of the Timorese language, culture and identity. Much of this documentary was filmed undercover since, as the film makes vividly clear, one of the means by which the Indonenesian government has used to legitimise the occupation is through a blanket censoring of media images about and from East Timor. One of the most chilling aspects of this documentary is the evidence presented of the tacit assistance the governments of Australia, Great Britain and the United States have given to the invasion and occupation, an occupation which has seen some of the most barbaric human rights abuses of the twentieth century. The video includes interviews with former Western ambassadors to Indonesia; survivors of torture; and with FRETELIN guerrilla fighters who are still resisting the Indonesians without the assistance of any outside aid."
