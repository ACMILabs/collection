        "The Pacific Northwest Ballet features in this motion picture version of the story by E.T.A. Hoffmann with music by Peter Illich Tchaikovsky. It is New Year's Eve. Clara's parents have arranged a party for their daughter. The dollmaker has prepared a suprise for the children - a puppet show - but best of all is a doll, the nutcracker. Clara sleeps, after a day of celebrations, and dreams of a collage of impressions from the day. The fantasy includes the transformation of her nutcracker into a handsome prince, his battle and victory with the Wicked Mouse king, beautiful puppets, dancing snowflakes and a giant Christmas tree. The London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sir Charles MacKerras, lends magic to the star performers which include: Hugh Bigney (Herr Drosselmeir), Vanessa Sharp (Young Clara), Patricia Barker (Dream Clara) and Wade Walthall (Nutcracker). Costumes designed by Maurice Sendak."
