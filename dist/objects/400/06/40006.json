        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Animals of Farthing Wood\". No-one said this journey to White Deer Park would be easy, but we've come through it so far and we'll come through this - but even as he speaks, Fox knows that the huge motorway which stretches before them poses the animals' biggest challenge yet. Whistler, the stork, may be able to carry the smaller animals over but that doesn't help the rabbits or weasel. And what of the poor hedgehogs who are too prickly to be carried by Whistler, and can't change their natural instinct to stop where they are and curl up into a little ball when they are frightened? Even if they do all manage to survive the motorway, will the animals make it safely to White Deer Park before the cold winter - and forced hibernation - sets in? Time is running out for the animals of Farthing Wood."
