        "Episode of Series \"Faerie tale theatre\". Paul Rubens (aka Pee Wee Herman) stars as the puppet who wanted to be a boy in this theatrical production of Pinocchio. Carl Reiner stars as Geppetto, the kindly puppet maker who wanted a real son to love. Lainie Kazan is the Fairy who promises to turn Pinocchio into a real boy if he can prove he is kind, honest and loving. James Coburn is a wayward huckster who tries to lead the innocent puppet astray. Featuring intricate production design reminiscent of 19th Century Italian folk art, this is a lovely and loving production of Pinocchio."
