        "John Galsworthy's epic saga continues... Despite Jo's misgivings, his relationship with Irene blossoms, but their joy is marred by Jolly's death out in South Africa. Soames has his evidence for a divorce, and a series of marriages, births and deaths continues to shape the destiny of the Forsyte family. The Great War shakes out the last vestiges of Victorian England, and among the younger Forsytes a new love burns, rekindling bitter old feuds. Oblivious to the enduring resentment harboured by their parents, Jon and Fleur meet by chance and fall in love. But the reluctance of Jo, Irene and Soames to reveal the truth of the past to their children makes tham all the more determined to discover it."
