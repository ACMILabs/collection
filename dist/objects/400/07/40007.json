        "It is January 6, 1904, on a snowy night in Dublin; a festive night at the Morkan house, as Miss Kate, Miss Julia and their niece Mary Jane prepare for their annual party. In this his last film, John Huston, captures the wonderful mix of comedy and quiet tragedy portrayed in James Joyce's short stroy from \"The Dubliners\". As the evening progresses, the characters subtly betray their secret lives, culminating in the moment when Gabriel, the calm observer, learns a secret that will change his life forever. A beautiful, eloquent film."
