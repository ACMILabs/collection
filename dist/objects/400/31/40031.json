        "For Madeline and her friends, it is a very sad day when their dear friend Pepito has to move away. But the girls quickly forget their sorrow when they are invited to visit Pepito in London. There they decide to buy Pepito the birthday present he's always wanted - a horse. The horse takes Madeline and Pepito on a wild ride round London (and leaves Miss Clavel searching high and low) when a trumpet blast causes him to bolt. What will the Queen think when she sees Madeline and Pepito leading the Royal Parade? And what will Pepito's mother say when the horse eats all the flowers, apples and carrots in her garden? Join the fun as Madeline finds the answers in this beautifully animated, song-filled adventure. Based on the book by Ludwig Bemelmans and narrated by Christopher Plummer."
