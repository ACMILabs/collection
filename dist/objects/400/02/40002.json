        "Schumann's cycle of 28 short pieces for the piano written in 1837, has been choreographed by George Balanchine in 1980. The pieces concerns the composers own life, his love for his wife, his war on the critics of the day, and the conflict of the personalities within his own mind. This brilliant production of this moving piece is performed by the principal members of the New York City Ballet."
