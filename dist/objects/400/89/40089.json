        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Global Economy\". This episode of \"The Global Economy\" examines the contemporary workings of multinational companies. Using Hungary as a test-case, we examine how a developing nation's economy is affected once it is reliant upon international capital. The question of whether multinational corporations can be said to have a national \"home\" or whether they now are part of an international economy with no strict state borders is also addressed. A panel of economists from Europe, the United States and Australia discuss some of the issues affecting the politics of transglobal industries in the post-Cold War global culture."
