        "This celebrated adaptation of John Galsworthy's remarkable story begins in 1879. The talk in the Forsyte's opulent drawing room revolves around Winifred's marriage to \"man of the world\" Monty Dartie, and the scandal of Jo's relationship with Helene, his daughter's Austrian governess. Jo's coldly calculating cousin Soames persuades the beautiful Irene Heron to marry him, but their marriage proves devoid of passion or communication. Meanwhile, the sudden death of Jo's wife leaves him free to marry his mistress, though he is promptly cut off from the family's wealth; and Jo's estranged daughter June becomes engaged to a bohemian young architect who threatens to bring a new strain of unpredictability to the family."
