        "This magnificent adaption of James Joyce's autobiographical novel is a faithful portrait of the young author and his coming-of-age. It portrays Stephen Dedalus and his Irish Catholic upbringing, his confrontation with the tyranny of the Church and his sexual guilt and frustration which start him on the path of rebellion. The young artist chooses lonely exile in his search for freedom and truth. Starring Bosco Hogan, T.P. McKenna and John Gielgud."
