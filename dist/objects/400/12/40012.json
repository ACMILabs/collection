        "More than just the man who delivers the mail, Postman Pat is a friend to all the people of Greendale. He always has a kind word and a joke for everyone, and he's ready to help out when needed. His trusty companion Jess, the black and white cat, goes everywhere with him. This compilation of three stories consists of \"Postman Pat's finding day\" showing Pat searching for Katy Pottage's missing doll, \"Postman Pat and the Magpie Hen\" featuring a naughty hen who decides to 'borrow' the keys to Pat's van and \"Postman Pat's Secret\" though everyone knows that it's Pat's birthday."
