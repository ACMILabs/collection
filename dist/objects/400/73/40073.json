        "Episode of Series \"Faerie tale theatre\". Tatum O'Neal stars as the mischievious but lovable heroine in the classic fairy tale of a child who invades the home of three bears. This version features a production design based on the all-American style of illustrator Norman Rockwell and more acrobatics than any previous version. Goldilocks teaches children a valuable lesson about respect for the property of others. Co-starring Alex Karras, Carole King, John Lithgow and Hoyt Axton."
