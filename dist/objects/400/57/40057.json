        "Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright head the cast of The National Theatre Company's presentation of Jonathan Miller's brilliant stage production of the Merchant of Venice. This particular Shakespeare production is set in Venice in the 1880's and includes a musical score by Carl Davies. The focus is on the central character of Shylock, the Jew, played powerfully and unusually sympathetically by Laurence Olivier. The story involves a young Venetian Antonio (Anthony Nichols) who borrows money from Shylock on the security of a pound of flesh. On default of his bond a trial takes place and the heroine Portia (Joan Plowright) pleads in Antonio's defence. Whilst the romantic comedy aspects of the play are retained, there is a heightened sense of drama throughout this production with the trial scene making a forceful climax. The cast also includes Jeremy Brett as Bassanio and Michael Jayston as Gratiano."
