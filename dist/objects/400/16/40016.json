        "An itinerant Lanternist is witness to the rural unrest prevalent in Southern England in the early 1830's. He arrives in the village of Tolpuddle where the farm labourers form a union and strike when their wages are reduced. Arrested and transported to Australia for seven years, the film follows the fortunes of the five men until their pardon and return to England. Bill Douglas' only other major film after his autobiographical trilogy, is a similar homage to the oppressed poor. However, in spite of its subject matter, this is less grim. An important work from a great filmmaker. Cameo appearances from Vanessa Redgrave, James Fox, Michael Hordern, John Hargreaves and Robert Stephens."
