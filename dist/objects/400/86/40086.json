        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Global Economy\". This episode of the Open Learning economics course examines the growing unilateral and bilateral regional trading markets dominating contemporary global economic relations. Overviews the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade (GATT) and looks at the reasons why Canada, the United States and Mexico decided to form the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in response to the perceived inaction and bureaucracy of the GATT talks. Analyses the European Community given that it is the most successful of regional trading blocs and therefore is of central importance in understanding financial forecasts for the 21st century."
