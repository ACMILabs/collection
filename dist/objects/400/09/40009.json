        "Postman Pat and Jess have to go out in all kinds of weather to deliver the mail - not even heat and wind and fog will stop them! \"Pat's Thirsty Day\" shows the old village water pump being used again during a water shortage in Greendale. \"Pat's Windy Day\" shows strong winds creating havoc for the villagers as trees, telegraph poles and even Pat's letters get blown around. \"Pat's Foggy Day\" finds Pat and Jess losing their way in heavy fog, and they must follow the sound of the church bells to find their way home again."
