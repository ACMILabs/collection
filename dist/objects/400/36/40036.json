        "May Gibbs' famous children's classic is now a popular children's ballet performed by the Dancers Company of the Australian Ballet School with guest artists from the Australian Ballet. This video includes a brief background on May Gibbs before entering into the world of her characters, Snugglepot, Cuddlepie, Snake, Kookaburra and Ragged Blossom in the ballet. This ballet brings the enchanting world of May Gibbs and her charming bush creatures to children of all ages. It also introduces them to the integrated themes of the arts, conservation and literature. Music is performed by the Elizabethan Sinfonietta, composed by Richard Mills and the ballet is choreographed by Petal Miller-Ashmole."
