        "During the recording of their new album, EB84 in 1984, The Everly Brothers were filmed in their Nashville studios, and in London. This video features in-depth interviews with Don and Phil and their record producer Dave Edmunds. Included are videos for their new songs \"You make it seem so easy\", \"The story of me\", \"Following the sun\", and \"On the wings of a nightingale\", penned by such music industry luminaries as Paul McCartney and Jeff Lynne. The result is a fascinating glimpse into the recording life of the Everlys."
