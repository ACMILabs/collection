        "Portrays a stream-of-consciousness in a day in the life of Leopold Bloom, Molly Bloom and Stephen Dedalus (the hero of Joyce's earlier biographical novel, \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\"). Bloom is an ordinary man; a Jew whose odyssey through the streets of turn-of-the-century Dublin leads him through trails that parallel his classic prototype, Ulysses on his epic journey home. Molly is his voluptuous, delightfully earthy wife whose infidelity is a major burden to Bloom. The intimacy of Joyce's language was without precedent in literature, and its flashbacks, dream episodes, sounds and visual montages translate freely into the language of cinema. Starring Milo O'Shea and Barbara Jefford."
