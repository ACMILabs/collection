        "This is Bunuel's very personal version of La Ronde, and in eight sketches - each representing a different aspect of hypocrisy - he creates a succession of dazzling moments. The sketches use every type of comedy: there is a interval of French farce with slamming bedroom doors, two trenchantly black jokes about cancer and mass murder and a piece of pure lunesco. Each sketch has its point to make and its own authority figures to be lampooned. This is a delightful and hilarious Bunuelian masterpiece. French dialogue with English subtitles."
