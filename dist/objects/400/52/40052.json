        "This delicate, handsome, quasi-fictional biography of one of the great saints of the Catholic Church, Francis of Assisi, focuses on the early years of his life. Saint Francis, who sought communion with the natural world by renouncing his family;s riches to seek his own destiny unencumbered by material possessions. Francis was, in a sense, history's first \"drop-out\" ; he left a life of comfort to seek a spiritual union with the world. Starring Graham Faulkner as Francis and Judi Bowker as the young girl who eventually sheds her materialistic existence for religious poverty, this visually stunning film was nominate for a Best Art Direction Academy Award in 1973."
