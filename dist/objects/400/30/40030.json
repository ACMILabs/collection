        "In an old house in Paris covered with vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines. Until the day Pepito moves in next door - and wreaks havoc on his neighbours' orderly life. Pepito traps ants, bats, dogs and frogs - and drags them into his horrible games. He boasts, flaunts, teases and haunts the girls. His antics escalate until he ends up in a brawl. Madeline seizes the ocassion to help a battered and bandaged Pepito to change his ways. And change, he does! But Pepito can do nothing halfway, and his attempts to make amends prove to be almost too much! Based on the book by Ludwig Bemelmans and narrated by Christopher Plummer."
