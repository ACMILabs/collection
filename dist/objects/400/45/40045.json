        "The final chapter in John Galswothy's epic saga... while Michael busies himself with promoting a slum-clearance scheme, Fleur's restlessness is further stirred by repeated meetings with Jon - not all of them by chance. Even Soames is persuaded to join Michael's scheme, and Fleur seeks to quell her growing discontent by opening a rest home for factory girls. But, like Fleur, the past will not rest. The 'formidable unit' of the Forsytes is wracked once again by internal feuding, passion and jealousy; and the family's characteristic doggedness and possessiveness carry us relentlessly towards the series' moving and unforgettable climax."
