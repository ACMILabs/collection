        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Global Economy\". This episode of the Open Learning economics course examines Government influence on markets through national trade policies. Two examples are investigated: the European Community's support of the Airbus aeronautics industry, and the Chilean government's involvement with wine-producing companies. A panel of economists discuss the reasons for government intervention in market economies and examine the problems that can arise for productivity and market competition from this kind of overt government intervention."
