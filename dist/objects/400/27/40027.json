Mr. Fruit poses as a waiter at the restaurant where she works and waits to see if she has found a gentleman friend... \"Total loss\": A widow is left with a clothing business, but her head for business is no match for her sense of style. She is in debt and beginning to get desperate when she is tempted by an insurance scam..."
