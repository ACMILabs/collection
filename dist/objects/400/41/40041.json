        "John Galsworthy's remarkable chronicles continue... as the twentieth century looms, the lives of the more senior Forsytes draw to a close. Jo's wife, Helene, dies from a fall before madness can claim her, and Jo becomes closer to Irene. Soames, meanwhile, desperate for an heir, wants a divorce from Irene and his sister Winifred seeks the same from her husband, who has eloped with a Spanish dancer. The Boer War draws the younger Forsytes into its web as Jo's son Jolly challenges the despised Val Dartie to join him in enlisting for the Imperial Yeomanry. June and Holly also volunteer as nurses, though each for different reasons. Finally, as the vengeful Soames sites his cousin Jo in the divorce proceedings against his wife, Jo and Irene come to realize the depth of their feeling for each other."
