        "Narrated by Chris Haywood, this final volume of the series \"Blood sweat and tears: Australians and sport\" includes the episodes: \"Bought sport\" investigates the issues surrounding commercial sponsorship of sport, both amatuer and professional and asks the question - if sport was supposed to be the great equaliser, spreading ideals about manliness, team spirit and fair play, and with so much money riding on a win, have the ideals of sport been corrupted? \"Political football\" looks at the issues of how politics influence sport - athletes have long complained about victimisation by sporting bureaucrats. Sport and politics don't mix and can sport, realistically, be amoral? \"Wearing the green and gold\" focuses on why Australian athletes feel they must achieve recognition in the world sporting arena in order to feel they have succeeded in their chosen field. Why isn't reaching the pinnacle of your chosen sport in Australia enough?"
