        "Asterix, the adventurous hero is the cunning little warrior to whom all perilous missions are immediately entrusted. Thanks to the magic potion of the Druid, he is famed for his superhuman strength. As if that were not enough, his mighty friend, Obelix is always ready to drop everything to go off on a new adventure with Asterix, although he is never allowed to have a portion of the magic potion because he fell into it when he was a baby. Wherever excitement and danger reigns, you can be sure that our intrepid pair will be in the thick of it. So Romans beware, here comes Asterix the Gaul. Based on the popular books by Goscinny and Underzo."
