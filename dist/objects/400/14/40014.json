        "Mystery Train is a trilogy of films all centering on a group of strangers who arrive in Memphis, Tennessee, a city dominated by the historical prescence of rock 'n' roll and in particular the memory of Elvis Presley. As in all of Jarmush's films the pleasure is in his ability to create an identification with characters who are far from the glamorous stereotypes of traditional Hollywood cinema. But as becomes clear in the cross-cutting between the various threads of the film, each individual displays both eccentricities and talents which enable them to transcend the limitations of social roles. Youki Kudoh and Mastoshi Nagase are excellent as a hip Japanese couple making a pilgrimage to Presley's grave and the rest of the cast are also outstanding. Excellent cameos from Clash singer Joe Strummer and a very funny wild performance by blues veteran Screamin Jay Hawkins. Narrated by Tom Waits and featuring the music of John Lurie, Roy Orbinson, the Bar Kays and Rufus Thomas."
