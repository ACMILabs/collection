        "Opera is arguably the best medium for dramatising history and this is particularly true for Verdi's \"Don Carlo\" in Luchino Visconti's magnificent and definitive 1958 production. Set in France and Spain in the second half of the 16th century, the five act opera tells of the political and amorous rivalry between Philip II of Spain and his son, Don Carlo. Bernard Haitink conducts The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House and a superb cast is led by Ileana Cotrubas as a tender and touching Elisabetta accompanied by the fine lyric tenor Luis Lima in the title role. Sung in Italian and English."
