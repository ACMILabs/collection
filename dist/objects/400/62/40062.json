        "This thought-provoking film about a small community of working class people who live in the old wharfside Sydney suburb of Pyrmont, brings into question the notion of coummunity participation in major urban development schemes. The development, in this case, involves nothing less than the total destruction of a community and of valuable heritage sites, for the construction of a casino and a whole range of high rise commercial development. The community is \"consulted\" and \"involved\", yet their own suggestions as to how best develop the area are largely ignored."
