        "Her heart was big, her size was small and Madeline was loved by all. The delightful narration of Christopher Plummer brings life to the endearing character of Madeline, lovingly created by Ludwig Bemelmans. In a Parisian girls' school, our perky, popular heroine charms even her classmates with funny pranks and youthful wit. However, when she needs her appendix removed, it is she who needs charm and humour for a speedy recovery. With cheerful music and charming characters, this beautifully animated classic will touch your heart."
