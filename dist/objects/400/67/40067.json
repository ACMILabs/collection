        "Episode of Series \"Children's circle\". A collection of animated short stories for children. \"Doctor De Soto\" by William Steig. The kind-hearted mouse Doctor De Soto is a dentist. He and his wife find a very clever way to treat a crafty fox, who comes to them with a sore tooth and secret thoughts of eating them after the job is done. This outstanding cartoon was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. \"Patrick\" by Quentin Blake. When Patrick plays his fiddle, the countryside comes alive with vibrant colour and motion. \"The Hat\" by Tomi Ungerer. Penniless Benito finds good fortune when he comes upon a magic black hat with which he can perform fantastic feats. \"Smile for Auntie\" by Diane Paterson. Silly Auntie sings, dances, makes funny faces, stands on her head - anything to get the baby to smile! \"The Foolish Frog\" by Pete And Charles Seeger. Folk singer Pete Seeger plays and sings this catchy song about the frog who fell in the mud, to the delightful drawings of Mioslav Jagr. \"Leopold the See-through Crumb-picker\" by James Flora. Leopold is invisible and devours every crumb he finds, creating havoc in the process. See what happens when a little girl befriends him."
