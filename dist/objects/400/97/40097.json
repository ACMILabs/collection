        "Episode number 21 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". This program looks at t formulae and t distributions, which use exactly the same calculations as in formulae except that the formulae are applied to samples rather than populations. They are therefore good for studying uncommon disorders such as autism. The program also looks at paired comparisons and uses the example of testing the changes in sweetness in coca cola over a time period. Introduced by Teresa M. Amabile."
