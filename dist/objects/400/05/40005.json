        "George Eliot's veritable feast of literary delight, with a star studded cast and stunning locations. Early nineteenth century England is restless. Soon the Industrial Revolution will split its population apart - into two opposing factions: the conservatives and the liberals. The young ambitious Doctor Tertius Lydgate arrives in the town of Middlemarch to take up his new position as the local doctor and medical supervisor at the new hospital, his intention is \"to do good small work for Middlemarch and great work for the world.\" However he meets with resistance from many of the town's dignitaries. Meanwhile Dorothea Brooke, ashamed of her privileged existence of comfort in her Uncle Arthur's house, seeks a purpose to her young life and finds herself drawn to the scholarly Edward Casaubon. But on their honeymoon in Rome, it seems her blind faith may have been misplaced... And what of Casubon's errant artist/writer nephew, the Byronic Will Ladislaw, who is unable to banish Dorothea from his thoughts? He waits in the wings for passion to take its course ."
