        "John Galsworthy's story continues... Jo is slowly welcomed back into the Forsyte fold as his father Jolyon's stubborn resolve weakens. Soames has commisioned June's fiance, Philip Bossiney, to build a house at Robin Hill, though it becomes increasingly clear that Soames wife, Irene and the young architect are passionately in love. Soames' discovery of the affair leads to a brutal, frenzied climax. Soames, in spiteful revenge, sues Bossiney over his work at Robin Hill, but Bossiney does not live to defend himself. Jolyon moves into the country house to live out his days with his family. While Jo, Helene and June are in Spain, Jolyon is visited by Irene, who becomes a regular guest and companion through that last, peaceful summer."
