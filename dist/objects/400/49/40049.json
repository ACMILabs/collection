        "Akira is set in Neo-Tokyo, 2019. The city is rebuilding after World War III. Kaneda and Tetsuo, two high-school dropouts, are members of a joy-riding motorcycle gang. They stumble upon a secret government project to develop telekinetic humans, apparently for use as weapons. The most powerful of these subjects is Akira, a being shrouded in mystery. The film is based on the popular graphic novel of the same name, which has achieved cult status in Japan. Animation and visual effects are outstanding in this spectacular and often disturbing vision of urban apocalypse. NB: THIS IS NOT A CHILDRENS' FEATURE AND IS RECOMMENDED FOR MATURE AUDIENCES."
