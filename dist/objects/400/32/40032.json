        "Based upon the ever popular books by Ludwig Bemelmans and narrated by Christopher Plummer. Madeline, merrily balancing along a bridge rail, takes a plunge into the river! But before the current can carry her away, a plucky dog paddles to her rescue. Miss Clavel and the girls adopt the dog, and soon find she is no ordinary mongrel. She helps with lessons, sings and spells, and even picks her own lovely name - Genevieve! The fun lasts until the Chairman of the trustees of Miss Clavel's school arrives to enforce the rule: No dogs allowed! He vows the girls will never set eyes on Genevieve again. The girls, drowned in grief, search for their pet in vain. Then one day Genevieve returns. So does the Chairman of the Trustees - just in time for Genevieve to share her wonderful surprise! A song-filled story destined to enchant children of all ages."
