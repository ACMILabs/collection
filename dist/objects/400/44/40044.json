        "John Galsworthy's saga sees the fast-changing twenties gallop on, and the economy worsens as society trips carelessly through its soirees and fashions. Fleur's flirtation with the despairing Wilfred ends and she finds herself expecting Michael's child, much to the satisfaction of her father. Michael, meanwhile, pricked by his burgeoning social conscience, attempts to help a struggling ex-employee. But his plan backfires, resulting in anger and shame for the man he tries to benefit. A scandal at the insurance company causes Soames to resign indignantly from the board, and although the birth of Kit brings celebration and reconciliation to the family, scandal of another kind is brewing. In America, romance stirs again for John, and it would seem the wounds of past love are still open."
