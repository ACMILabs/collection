        "Episode of Series \"Children's circle\". Where the wild things are is Maurice Sendak's classic tale of Mischievous Max, who sails to where the wild things are and becomes their king. \"The Nutshell Kids\" features four delightful teaching poems set to music. \"In the Night Kitchen\" Little Mickey dreams of the kitchen at night where bakers bake cakes, dough aeroplanes fly and everyone dances to the deliciously syncopated music."
