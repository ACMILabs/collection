        "The Ferals are the original urban wild bunch. Rattus is tough, streetwise and constantly arguing with Modigliana, the cat with a definite sense of style, if not taste. With Mixy the rabbit and Derryn, the not too bright dog, they hang out in the shed at the bottom of Joe's garden. \"An explosion of talent\": The Feral's performance at a talent quest is helped enormously by Leonard's new invention - the Digital Volume Enhancer, until Modi pulls the wrong switch. \"Double trouble\": As if one Rattus wasn't trouble enough! Rattus and Joe's 'get-rich'quick' scheme goes awfully wrong so it's just as well that the Digital Duplicator has a reverse mode."
