        "PJ, Goose and Judy are three teenagers saving to buy BMX bikes. In their efforts, they stumble across a case of smuggled walkie-talkies needed by a bunch of crooks for their next job. Accidentally, while testing them, the teenagers alert the police on the same airwave band. The rest of the film becomes a BMX packed chase as the crooks and the police seek the trio. Action filled fun entertainment, \"BMX bandits\" stars a very young Nicole Kidman, David Argue and John Ley."
