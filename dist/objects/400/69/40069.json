        "Set in the sleazy horse-tracks and gambling dens of contemporary L.A., \"The Grifters\" is a modern crime film that compares favourably to classic Hollywood film-noir films. Based on Jim Thompson's pulp classic of the same name, this film shimmers with a consistent erotic tension. John Cusack is Roy, a young con-man who makes easy money off the gullible hordes that crowd Los Angeles. He finds himself caught in the middle of a dangerous tug-of-war between his prostitute girlfriend (Annette Bening) who wants him to committ a major scam, and his elegant but desperate mother, Lily (Angelica Huston), who has been hustling for years and wants to find a way out. Both are powerful women not adverse to using the people they love to get what they want, and their desperate machinations to achieve financial independance puts Roy's very life at risk. This brilliantly directed film is a powerful study on the corrosive effects of power and money on human relationships. All the cast is outstanding but special mention must be made of the majestic Angelica Huston: her blazing and frightening performance as Lily is unforgettable."
