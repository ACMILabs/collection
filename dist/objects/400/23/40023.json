        "Episode of Series \"Classic Looney Tunes Cartoons\". Commissioned to commemorate his 50th birthday, this compilation tape features the best of Bugs Bunny. The classic selection includes the hilarious \"Barber of Seville\" where Bugs gives Elmer Fudd a shave he will never forget. \"Duck Rabbit Duck\" where Daffy tries to convince hunters it is really rabbit season not duck season, and the Oscar-winning \"What's Opera Doc?\" where Bugs makes a beautiful Brunhilda. As this compilation of nine shorts prove, Bugs Bunny is not only a comic character who has delighted children for decades, but his cartoons also have a sly and anarchic edge that makes them equally appealing for adults."
