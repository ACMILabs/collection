The episodes look at asking for advice, talking about your health, making arrangements, making polite requests, talking about interests and holidays, visiting Rome, as well as providing insight into the local customs and culture of different areas of Italy. Audio cassettes and a manual complement the videos and can be borowed as separate loan items."
