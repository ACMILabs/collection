        "Episode of Series \"Classic Looney Tunes Cartoons\". Drawn together to celebrate his Looney Tunes stablemate Bugs Bunny's 50th birthday, this collection concentrates on the irrepressible Daffy Duck. Outspoken and quickwitted, Daffy is also conniving, greedy and vain, and with his frenzied energy and sharp tongue, he can really look after himself. With his over-inflated ego and visions of himself in various ill-suited heroic roles, he is often in trouble, but with his crazed courage he'll stop at nothing to get what he wants, no matter what the odds are. Underneath all his antics, he's really looking for love, approval and acceptance which is what makes this loveable little black duck so appealing to audiences of all ages."
