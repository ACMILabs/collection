        "An Australian photographer takes a historic journey retracing the historic trail of the Long March, by which Mao Tse Tung led 100,000 Communist cadres, on foot, across China. Traversing rivers, forests, mountain ranges and wild steppes, the Long March was central to consolidating the Communist Party's support from the Chinese peasantry. This video offers an excellent historic account of the history of the Long March, as well as offering a breathtaking visual exploration of China and its people."
