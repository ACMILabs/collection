        "Compelling Academy Award-nominated documentary providing an oral history account of the American Communist Party from the Great Depression, through McCarthyist demonisation of the 50s, to the early 80s. Employing a wealth of archival material culled from over 400 interview sessions with former and current party members, the film provides a vernacular account of the American Left. Includes footage of speeches made by Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey and Joseph McCarthy set the context for the film. The film provides a fascinating vernacular account of the American Left."
