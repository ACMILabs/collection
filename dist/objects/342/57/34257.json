        "Episode of Series \"Fauna\". This program shows that the Silver Gulls have a fascinating behaviour and ecology. As well as their interaction with humans, we see their beautiful off-shore island nesting grounds where thousands of birds compete for territory. Sharing this idyllic habitat with the gulls are Sea-Lions, with quaint antics on shore and graceful gymnastics in the water."
