        "This program looks at media representation of ethnic and minority groups. The video uses a zany quiz show format to raise questions about ethnic stereotyping using examples from advertising. Both the video and its accompanying study guide provide a launching point for classroom discussion, activity and further study, suitable for a wide range of age groups."
