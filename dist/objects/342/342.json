        "Late at night the tired staff of a French restaurant prepare to go home only to find some lovestruck diners on the verge of a marriage proposal still lingering behind the potted palms. What promises to be the perfect end to a romantic night goes horribly wrong when the prospective bride accidently swallows the ring. The lurid, expressionist painted animation effect emphasises the absurdity and grotesqueness of the couples' behaviour."
