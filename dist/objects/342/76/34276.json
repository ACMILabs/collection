        "A film about women who follow their obsessions, taking dreams and illnesses as signs that they must find places in nature - rocks, trees, groves - that have special connection with their ancestors. They challenge the established order of things on the small depopulated island of Hatoma (Japan) and exert their spiritual power and leadership through subversive means. Focuses on three women, all of whom left the island long ago, but still retain a strong attachment to it, and who return to it regularly to perform their rituals."
