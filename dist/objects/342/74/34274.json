        "Before 1965, not a single woman had received a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Western Ontario. Two decades later, the class of '84 was almost 25% female. Class of Promise tracks the progress of selected students and the careers of several female graduates. Their impact on management in the male-dominated business world is considerable, but ultimately they still find themselves wrestling with issues career-oriented men seldom have to face, particularly the conflict between family and work."
