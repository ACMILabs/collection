        "Episode of Series \"Fauna\". Until 1930 the Rabbit-Eared Bandicoot, or Bilby, was relatively common in various parts of Australia but suddenly it disappeared from many of them. Today it is the subject of an intensive search and study sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund. The program investigates the history and mystery of this beautiful marsupial. Narrated by David Moore."
