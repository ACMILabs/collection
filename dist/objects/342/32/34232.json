        "An experimental look at the migrant experience through the alienation of a Greek photographer. The photographer, Peter Lyssiotis, with memories of his homeland Cyprus, his relationship with his father and fantasies based in the photographer's everyday life is well known for his work in photography, photomontage and photo books. He recently collaborated with Ettore Siracusa and Michael Karaglanidis on this film which explores some of the themes and practices of his photographic work."
