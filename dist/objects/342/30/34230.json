        "The Lindsay Kemp Company in a production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" by William Shakespeare. Hermia, daughter of Egeus is in love with Lysander, but has been ordered by Theseus, who is to marry the defeated queen of the Amazons, Hippolyta, to wed Demetrius, who is loved by Helena. The four young people flee to the forest where they are found by Oberon, king of the fairies, Titania, his wife with whom he is in ill humour, and the merry Puck. Using a love potion somewhat indiscriminately, Puck manages to effect a remarkable chain of romantic entanglements which are eventually resolved to everyone's satisfaction. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A MUSICAL PRODUCTION BASED ON SHAKESPEARE'S TEXT AND NOT A PERFORMANCE OF THE PLAY ITSELF."
