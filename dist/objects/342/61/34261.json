        "Episode of Series \"Fauna\". In this huge country most of the carnivorous mammals are tiny, and many are marsupials. Typically they are small but fierce predators of insects, spiders and grubs, but some - notably the native cats and Tasmanian Devil - are larger and more formidable. The program explores the behaviour of these animals."
