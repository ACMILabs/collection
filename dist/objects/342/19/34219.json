        "The first Australian film to document the organisation of a strike and its unfolding over time from an \"insider\" perspective. In September 1982, at the height of the economic recession, Australian Iron and Steel, a subsidiary of BHP, announced its intention to retrench 400 miners from the six coal pits which supplied the company's Wollongong steelworks. Kemira was the worst affected pit where 206 workers (two-thirds of the workforce) were to lose their jobs. A confronting account of an important historical and political event."
