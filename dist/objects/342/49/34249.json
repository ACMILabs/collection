        "Episode of Series \"Space Science\". How is a satellite placed in a desired orbit? The program explores this problem by illustrating how a satellite's shape, path and period may be modified. Practical application of this procedure - the establishing of weather and communications satellites - is demonstrated as students are given a satellite's eye view of the various paths over the earth's surface."
