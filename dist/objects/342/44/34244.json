        "A technical and visual masterpiece created by Ishu Patel. His creation of a fantastic kingdom where a Divine Bird performs a magic dance for an adoring emperor has won international acclaim. Innovative mixed-media techniques and dramatic lighting create a fabulous crystal chamber which is both palace and prison. A palace for the jealous blackbird who covets such an artificial paradise, and a prison for the Divine Bird, who has never enjoyed the freedom of the forest. Photographed by Pierre Landry. Animated by Ishu Patel and George Ungar. Music by Gheorghe Zamfir. (Awards: Berlin; Annecy; Gijon; Spain; Melbourne; Antibes-Juan-les-Pins; Los Angeles; Adelaide; Hamilton; Oakland; New York; Oscar nomination, Hollywood.)"
