        "Episode of Series \"Fauna\". Koalas manage to survive exclusively on a diet of eucalyptus leaves, and in this program we go twenty metres up into the trees to observe the endearing behaviour of mother koalas and their young. The program also observes the habitat and wildlife surrounding the koala, as well as threats to its survival such as bushfires and tree felling."
