        "The film explores montage techniques with playful and complex effects. Through the film's five separate segments, themes, images and sounds recur and clash in unexpected ways. The myths from Australian cultural history - of pioneers, mateship and rugged (male) individualism - are dismantled as created truths and manufactured history. Features Stephen Leeder, Marilyn Allen, Robert Alexander, Nicholas Enright."
