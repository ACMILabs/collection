        "A frank look at the relations between Australia and the United States since 1945 and the cost of that friendship. It is the story, told by men with first-hand involvement, of the cold war in Australia and the setting up of ASIO; it is the story of Sir Robert Menzies' ambitions to follow the U.S. into Vietnam in order to demonstrate loyalty to the alliance."
