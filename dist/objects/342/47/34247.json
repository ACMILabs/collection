        "A look at how film has been used to portray agriculture in Australia and particularly in Victoria between 1913 and 1985, and how film makers strengthened certain myths about city and country life. This compilation of old film footage was put together for the 150th anniversary of Victoria. Narrated by Sir Eric Pearce."
