        "A fascinating ethnographic documentary about cultural creativity among the people of the Trobriand Islands. The film shows how the islanders have adapted the game of cricket - first introduced by Methodist missionaries - into an outlet for mock warfare and inter-village competition, chanting and an expression of the islanders' experience of colonialism."
