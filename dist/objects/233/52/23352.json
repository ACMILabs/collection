        "The Bulolo Valley in New Guinea was once a mere hunting ground; now it is the home of the Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers, a company cutting 10 million square feet of Klinki pine a year. Compares pre-war mining operations by dredge and the forestry industry of today; the milling operations, growing seedling trees, felling mature ones; transport; transformation into the finished product; importance to the people of the area of the industry."
