        "Draws a contrast between people who have plenty to eat and those who have next to nothing. Followers of Thomas Malthus are convinced that a world of plenty will never be possible; others believe the world's population should be limited; and another group advocates the increase of food production and distribution. The latter concept also stresses conservation of resources and improved agricultural methods. Emphasises that with free world trade, peoples of all nations will benefit. Suggests that a world of plenty provides greater chances for individual security and world peace."
