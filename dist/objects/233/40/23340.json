        "Professor C.H. Munro introduces Australia's water problem - the periodic cycles of flood and drought and the first major step in its solution, the Snowy Mountains scheme. The first part shows floods in town and country areas and rescue teams at work; the second, drought and a family forced to abandon their property; finally, the aims of the Snowy Mountains Scheme and some of the work in progress. Little commentary is used. Ballads and natural sound accompany evocative visuals."
