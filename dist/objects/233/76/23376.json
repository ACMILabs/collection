        "A film made for the Festival of Britain surveying the nation's achievements during the past 100 years, a note on contemporary conditions, and some indication of possible advances within the next 100 years. Old prints and engravings of life in Victorian ships, financial exchanges and Parliament, customs of the different classes, slums and other manifestations of poverty, all seen against a commentary explaining features of the period's social, industrial, scientific and political history. Changes since that time illustrated by views of the 1951 Festival and of accomplishments in various technological fields, with emphasis on the increasing concern for human welfare. A number of scientists suggest possible sources of energy and power in 2051."
