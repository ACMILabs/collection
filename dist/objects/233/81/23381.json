        "Mogul architecture reflects Hindu, Sarasenic, and Arabic influences. Fatehbur Sikri, a deserted city near Agra, was built by Akbar the Mogul Emperor in 1569. His architectural achievements reflect his philosophy, combining Hindu design and Sarasenic carving in the mosque, pillar and gateway to this city which was later abandoned."
