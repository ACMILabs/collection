        "The Forest watchers tells us some remarkable things about one of our great natural resources. For example, nearly one half of Canada is forest, by the end of the century the supply might fall short of the demand. This film looks at the Canadian forests and the elements threatening them. These include the spruce budworm, air pollution and indiscriminate logging operations. Man is in the process of developing a new vision of the forest through the advent of remote sensing techniques. Written by Peter Raymont; photographed by Andreas Poulsson, Raymond Dumas; music by Larry Crosley."
