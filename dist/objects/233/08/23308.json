        "Demonstrates a series of chemical reactions designed to show that the course of the reaction can be followed by measuring various parameters. One reaction shown is that between tertiary butyl bromide and water, and rates are observed by measuring the volume of a gas evolved, the ph change, change of boiling point, and changes in light absorption during reactions."
