        "Football (soccer) is a major sport and social phenomenon in Britain, where the game was born. Amateur players are the backbone of the sport, about half a million of them in England alone, mostly young and many belonging to England's 30,000 amateur clubs. The film explains the history, the competition leading up to the Cup Final and how football is now a world sport including the Chinese, Nigerians and Argentinians who come and play well-known teams in Britain."
