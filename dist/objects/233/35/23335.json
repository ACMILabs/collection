        "Made to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of World War 1, this film traces events leading to the declaration of war, and eventually to Canada's involvement, when, on August 3, 1914, Great Britain and the Empire declared their support of their allies. This film uses both archival and new footage which reveals the contributions and sacrifices of those Canadians who served in World War 1."
