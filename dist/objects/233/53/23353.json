        "The history of the timber industry in Eastern Canada. England deprived of its timber supplies after Napoleon's conquest of Europe turned to Canada. The move west in America increased the demand for timber, and the advent of newspapers created a need for wood pulp. Today the highly mechanised timber industry makes Canada the largest exporter in the world."
