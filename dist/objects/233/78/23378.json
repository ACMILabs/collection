        "Depicts the life of Palesinian Arab refugees at Jabalia Camp, in the Gaza Strip. The film shows the work of the vocational training schools which are producing skilled craftsmen whose services are in keen demand. It also illistrates how the United Nations is setting up families in their own farms so that they can become self supporting."
