        "Begins with landscape shots outside of Bright, before focusing on the centenary celebrations, including crowds and reinactments of life in Bright 100 years ago. Film then follows a parade, highlighting the numerous floats involved.  Good footage of 20m high tress being cut down as part of a carnival.  Deputy Premier A.G Rylah unviels the Bright centenary Cairn, gives speech about the importnace of young people in a community.  Film nicely shot, with vibrant colours."
