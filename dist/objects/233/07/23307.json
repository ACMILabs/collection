        "Episode of Series \"Office Supervisor's Problem\". An office force is distressed because some important reports have failed to get through. It is found that the fault lay in the operation of a new office machine which was not adequately explained to the person responsible for using it, causing considerable delay on the job. Discussion hinges on how this could have been avoided."
