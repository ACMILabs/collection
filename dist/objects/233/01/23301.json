        "A 4 1/2 month pregnant monkey (the equivalent to 7 months in human terms), has its foetus operated on to create a condition that occurs in human babies - the short bowel syndrome, for later study under laboratory conditions. When the baby monkey was born there was virtually no scar tissue, and the foetus had replaced enough of the removed bowel to survive."
