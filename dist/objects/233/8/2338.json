    "description": [
        "Opens with the showgrounds devoid of people, livestock and produce, before contrasting this with the show in full swing.  Includes footage of people wandering around, livestock, produce, rides, food and 'fun' being had.  No narration, only location sound and upbeat music. This makes for a sophisticated and enoyable film, where the experiences of the people it captures are the focus.  Nice 'night' sequence with fireworks.  Great hand-painted credits that mimic various signs allready up at the showgrounds.  Great film!"
