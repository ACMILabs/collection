        "Artists at work in the Gustavberg pottery factory at Gustavberg, Sweden. We see how they design their work, how they find aesthetic and practical solutions to functional problems, and the fact that the way in which the finished article is used determines the design and form of the product. Many fine examples of Swedish pottery are included."
