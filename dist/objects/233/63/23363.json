        "With an introduction by Duke Edinburgh, this film considers the plight of thousands of refugees who are still in camps in Europe, especially Greece. Many of them are without a country or relatives and pass their time in loneliness and misery in the squalor of the refugee camps. The United Nations Refugee Emergency Fund was set up for the purpose of helping these people. In Greece in the 1950's, the Fund was able to assist the Greek Government in building homes and as a result many could hope for a better future."
