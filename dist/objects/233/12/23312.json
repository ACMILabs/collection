        "Episode of Series \"Earth and it's peoples\". This film shows the sources of food from the sea and earth which supply the Paris markets, and stresses the human co-operation and continuity of effort necessary to maintain them. From the coastal towns along the rocky shores of Brittany came a variety of sea foods. from a day's catch, some of the fish is sold to markets and some to local canneries. From Normandy, come vegetables, grains and fruits. Wines are another of France's famed products especially champagne from the region around Rheims. Method of producing and distributing the wine is also featured."
