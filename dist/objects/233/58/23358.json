        "A survey of the remains of the ancient Viyayanagar Empire in Andhra State: the grand palaces, the magnificent gateways, beautiful frescoes and temples in the historical city of Viyayangar. This once mighty Hindu empire was founded in 1336 A.D. by two brothers-Hakka and Bukka-to serve as the strongest bastion of the south against recurrent invasions. The fateful battle of Talikota in 1565 brought ruin to the kingdom. Commentary written by Berkeley Hill and narrated by Romesh Thapar."
