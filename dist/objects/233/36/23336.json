        "This film presents a demonstration of labor-saving machines and methods for harvesting forage crops. Greater accent on mixed farming in Canada has increased the need for winter silage and, in the busy harvest season, for more efficient ways of cutting, handling and storing forage crops. We are shown the use of such equipment as the forage harvester and the automatic unloader, which greatly reduces the amount of work and time involved."
