        "Episode of Series \"This Week\". Prompted by the statement by the then Victorian Premier, Sir Henry Bolte, to the effect that there would be no State Parliamentary House of Review within a generation, this television current affairs report dedicates itself to the history and protocol of the Victorian Legislative Council as well as the architectural features of its chambers. A fairly dry \"talking heads\" program."
