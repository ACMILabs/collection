        "Portrays the Swedish lumber industry, which in the 1950's played a vital part in Sweden's economy. Near the end of winter, power saws fell thousands of trees. The logs are hauled by tractor to the nearest river bank. In spring the logs are bulldozed into the melting rivers, and commence their journey in the fast flowing waters to the timbermills which cluster around the river mouths. Here they are sorted and graded by skilled lumberjacks, hauled into mills, and cut into timber for an endless variety of uses. In Sweden trees are a crop, and care is taken to prevent bushfires and indiscriminate felling. The forests of Sweden are a heritage from the past-they must be replanted and guarded from danger so that they may continue to be a source of wealth to future generations. Story by Albert Viksen; photographed by Sven Olsson; narrated by Burnett Anderson."
