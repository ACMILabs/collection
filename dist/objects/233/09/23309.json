        "A tour of contemporary Canadian agriculture led by a modern troubador whose work on the land moves him to song. What is seen is farming as big business coast-to-coast, mechanised, automated, where the farmer is businessman, scientist, world citizen, but still a man with a desire for independence and his own place on the land."
