        "English production, NOT made by the Department of Agriculture.  Details hot to and how not to project a 16mm film using a social church gathering as the backdrop. Stars a bumbling projectionist and a priest who first do everything the wrong way and then do everything the correct way.  Comical (in a daggy way) throughout with good use of slapstick humour. Also contains an amusing, very dry voiceover."
