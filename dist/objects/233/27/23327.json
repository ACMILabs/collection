        "As a preliminary to the crossing of the Antarctic continent by Sir Vivian Fuchs and his party, an advance group set out from London in the m.v. \"Theron\", a Canadian sealing vessel, to establish a base camp. Her month long struggle with the pack ice of the Weddell Sea captured the attention of the world. This film, a record of that journey, received Honourable Mention at the International Festival of Documentary and Expeprimental Cinema, Montevideo, 1958."
