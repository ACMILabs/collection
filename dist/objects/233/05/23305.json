        "Illustrates the important part folk dancing can play in primary education. Shows the teaching of folk dancing in simple movements to young children, and a series of more complicated Latvian and French dances suitable for older children. Demonstrates how actual dancing can lead to activities such as class projects on national folk dances, costumes and music, and how this interest can lead to international understanding and correct social behaviour at an early stage. The film concludes with a school folk dancing festival complete with national costumes made by the children. Music by Barbara Mettam."
