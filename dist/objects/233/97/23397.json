        "This film is made to acquaint young children with the habits of animals and also to motivate a desire to read. A wise old owl narrates the story of how the fox tried to catch the rooster and failed. This well known episode appears in Aesop's Fables and is dramatised by actual farm and forest animals. A skunk and a frog warn the rooster of the fox's evil plan and the rooster climbs out of reach. An opossum tries to help the fox by knocking the rooster off his perch but both are scared away when they are told a dog is coming."
