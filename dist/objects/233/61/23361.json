        "A young Chinese student living in Chinatown, Melbourne wanders aimlessly through the city streets observing the people, traffic and shops. Seeing a group of young companions having fun together, he appears out of place and alone. His loneliness is banished, however when he meets a fellow Asian friend. This film shot during the Christmas season (the Myer decorated windows are shown) is a cinema verite styled film starring Ken Lui and Howard Wong. Music by Hans Poulsen, Ron Snellgrove, Steve Dunstan and Barry Duggan; sound by Bill Armstrong and Brian Kavanagh; photographed by Chris Lofven. (Award: Tenth Muse Prize in the International contest for young filmmakers - Milan, Italy, 1965)."
