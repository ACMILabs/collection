        "One-half of the human population is either underfed or malnourished; every year 50 million mouths are added to the world's population, yet only one-tenth of the earth's surface is farmed. Food production must be increased by using improved strains of crops, chemicals, land reclamation and better methods of fishing, plus research into hydroponics - growing crops in water with the necessary chemicals added which are present naturally in the soil."
