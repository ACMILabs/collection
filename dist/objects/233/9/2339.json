        "Film begins with instructions on how to garner and prepare tomato seeds for planting, before focusing on the seed germination process and how to cultivate a good crop of seedlings.  The seedlings are then uprooted and planted in larger fields. Manual and semi-automatic seedling planting techniques are shown using different types of machinery.  When fully grown the tomatoes are picked and packed into wooden crates. Film details the correct picking and packing process.  Finally, the tomatoes are taken to a factory, where they are pulped and made into tomato sauce.  Good colour/shoits throughout."
