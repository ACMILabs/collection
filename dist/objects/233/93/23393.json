        "The four seasons in one of Canada's many wildlife sanctuaries - Gatineau Park. In a variety of scenes picturing the colorful pageantry of the months, the lives of its wild birds and beasts, the seasonal economy of farms and forests, the film builds up a cumulative impression of this region in the Laurentian mountains of Canada. Photography by Radford Crawley, Grant Crabtree and Judith Crawley, with music by Maurice Blackburn."
