        "A country-wide survey of the changing technology of lumbering and the system of long-range reforestation. Shown is a machine that strips a tree of branches, then neatly bites through the base and lowers it onto a timber carrier; and a machine that reduces logs to wood chips right in the forest, for easier transport to the mill. Animated maps show the locations of the various forest regions of Canada. (Award: Santarem)."
