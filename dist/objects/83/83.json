        "New York City -- a huge, slow pulse of light steaming through daytime and night time. A study of the soul of the city, its radiance, its isolates and its irates -- the special souls who are lost to the vision of the workaday world but scorched into the vision of Cohen's video world. A world of blindness, grace and vision. A world made more sacred by noise -- the special noise composed in response to the city's scorching radiance, another kind of soul music."
