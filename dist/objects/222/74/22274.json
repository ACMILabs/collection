        "A reconstruction of 399BC in Athens where Socrates, judged guilty of the corruption of youth and of refusal to recognize accepted gods of state faces execution according to Athenian law by drinking poison. Those who had been his main accusers said they did not desire his death but Anytus the politician who caused the trial refuses to reverse his judgement. In prison where a small group of friends have gathered Socrates speaks of the values he has cherished. Without being able to discourse daily about virtue and the greatest good of man he has no reason to live. He drinks poison and as friends weep, dies. Narrated by Walter Cronkite. Cast includes John Cassavetes as Plato, Robert Culp as Xenophon, E.G. Marshall as Aristophanes, Shepperd Strudwic as Crito, Milton Selzer as Melitus and Richard Kiley, Michael Higgins, Barry Jones, Philip Bourneuf, Grant Gordon and Victor Thorley."
