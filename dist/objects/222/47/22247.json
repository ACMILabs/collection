        "A sensitive and frightening portrait of Donny B, a young drug addict, who lives and will probably die in Harlem. To the accompaniament of the song in folk idiom: A Day in the Death of Donny B, we follow him through a day in which he steals enough money for his next \"fix\". Shows the utter degradation of a young human being, the hopeless slum environment in which he lives and his situation which can lead to nothing but death."
