        "An explanation of the occurrence of day and night by means of experiments with a rotating model globe. The film deals with the rotation of the earth on its tilted axis; the sun as a source of light to the earth; the cause of day and night; the movement of the earth, with its tilted axis, round the sun, and the effect of this tilting on the length of day and night in the four seasons of the year."
