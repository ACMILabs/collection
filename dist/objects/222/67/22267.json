        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Wild Life\". Illustrates and describes several species of spiders, some of which, although appearing most frightening, are quite harmless. The film warns against the poisonous varieties, such as the red-back and the deadly funnel web spiders. The spinneret fangs, poison sacs, and eyes of the funnel web are shown in detail. First aid treatment of a bite by a spider is demonstrated. The film also makes suggestions on how to preserve those species of spiders which are beneficial to man."
