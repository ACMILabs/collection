        "The film animator gives vivid expression to his own memories of a child's first encounter with elementary school - at the tender age when grown-ups appear ten feet tall, a monster lurks in every corridor and the very walls have eyes. Feeling, but not understanding the regimentation imposed on him, the child seeks, in spite of it all, to be himself. Awards: Toronto; Oberhausen."
