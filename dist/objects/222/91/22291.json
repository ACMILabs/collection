        "The production of anti-polio vaccine is explained, showing how the three types of virus are grown on Rhesus monkey kidney tissue. All remaining cell tissue is then removed, the virus inactivated, and the three strains mixed to ensure full protection. The vaccine is then safe to produce the protective anti-bodies in the person vaccinated."
