A father who accompanies his son on a short drive observes that his son is a safe driver who anticipates dangerous situations and drives defensively in order to avoid accidents. Father and son discuss driving hazards which require alertness and courtesy, as well as skill, on the part of drivers: overcrowded areas, complicated traffic lights, pedestrians, emergency vehicles, road signs, grade crossings, and student drivers."
