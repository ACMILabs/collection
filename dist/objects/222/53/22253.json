        "On 26 January 1976 Concorde carried its first paying passengers on a British Airways proving flight from Heathrow to Gander, Newfoundland. (An Air France Concorde took off at the same time, on a similar flight to Brazil.) This film captures this historic event, as the complement of VIP's embark in the early morning and return in time for lunch."
