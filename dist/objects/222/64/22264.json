        "A short story by Margaret Wise Brown which encourages young readers to expect a rewarding experience from reading and to write a story themselves from casual incidents in their own lives. The theme of the film, the dead bird, also lends itself to discussion about the naturalness of death, leading to an appraisal of the essential values in living"
