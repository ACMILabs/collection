        "Contrary to common opinion the desert supports a profusion of wildlife. Desert flora and fauna all exhibit adaptations to retain, prevent loss of, or derive small amounts of water. In this film specialised survival techniques which permit the withstanding of long periods of drought and extreme temperature changes are studied in the horned toad, badger, peccary, gila woodpecker, various species of desert birds, spiders, snakes and a variety of plants and other animals."
