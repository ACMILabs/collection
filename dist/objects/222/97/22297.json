        "Episode of Series \"Searching for values: a film anthology\". Adapted from the film \"The Tiger makes out\" with Eli Wallach, the theme here is the modern individual in conflict with complex bureaucratic systems. Waking up one morning to the callous impersonality of big city life, Hymie Schultz, mailman, decides to fight back. Bureaucracy, however, proves more stubborn than he, and at the end of the day defeated and helpless, he retreats, one individual lost among many."
