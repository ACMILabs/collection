        "Examines and chronicles the January, 1973 eruption of the volcano Eldfell on the Icelandic island of Aeimaey. Shows how scientists studied the eruption and documents the civil defence personnel and towns people as they attempted to save buildings from approaching lava flow. Depicts the evacuation of the 5,000 inhabitants, both by air and sea. Graphically captures scenes of bellowing craters, flowing lava and burning and collapsing buildings."
