        "A look at life in a small paper-milling town in Quebec where most of the 6,500 inhabitants derive their livelihood from the one industry. Day after day the same work, the same hours, the same machines, the same product, until the entire routine of living becomes but a reflection of the dominant routines of the mill. The commentary is made up largely of fragments of thoughts which might be running through the minds of the mill workers - this is the film's theme as it probes to the very core of company-town life. (Awards: Toronto, San Francisco, Montreal, Chicago, New York)"
