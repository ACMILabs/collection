        "A study of what may happen when a husband insulates his job from his family. David believes that what happens at work is his sole concern. Hazel has grown to accept her husband's estimation of himself as a breadwinner and of herself as homemaker, and does not expect his confidences when things go wrong. A neighbour voices quite different views about the sharing of family problems. When David's job is threatened, it is from this neighbour that Hazel hears of it. Her worries, added to David's, trigger a chain of reaction of bruised feelings. Presented as a case study for discussion on family relations."
