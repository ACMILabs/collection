        "A court room parody pointing out the fallacies upon which prejudice thrives and the inadequacy of the laws to eliminate discrimination. Jonathon Mole is a bigoted law clerk who considers himself a victimised average citizen. One night, Jonathan dreams of a 'perfect' nation where he is elevated to the status of judge and is presented with a case testing a law which reserves the most desired vocations to person's of 'pure' racial origin. Witnesses for the Prosecution present easily recognizable stereotypes of prejudice and witnesses for the Defence counter with undeniable facts. Although this film was made in 1959 to combat employment discrimination in Canada, the attitudes exposed have repeatedly surfaced throughout the world, since this film's production."
