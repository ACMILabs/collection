        "Produced with the assistance of the Los Angeles Police Department. Designed to impress children with the need to be on guard against molesters. Dramatizes places and circumstances under which the child may encounter dangerous strangers under unsupervised conditions and indicates how to avoid potential molesters. Human interest, common sense and humour are used, but fear is scrupulously avoided. Written and photographed by Orville H. Hampton. All the perverts in this film wear sport jackets."
