        "Shows how some farmers and graziers managed their properties to cope with drought conditions in various parts of Queensland and New South Wales between 1964 and 1967. Shows how the problem can be met successfully in several ways to minimise its effects including hand feeding, reducing stock, and use of underground water. Emphasises the importance of adopting a definite plan to provide for the bad years and changing circumstances."
