        "A gentle satire on television commercials showing the production and use of effective advertising. Features Dizzy Gillespie and Quintet improvising a musical soundtrack for drawings made by John Hubley and his staff as they create animated-cartoon television commercials for a new product with unsuccessful results until the director screens three previous advertisements as examples of the desired effect. Concludes with a wild jam session led by Dizzy Gillespie. Several of the Hubley animation techniques are illustrated making this film useful for discussion on film technique."
