        "Descent is a film about David Murray, a member of Canada's National Ski Team. It shows the less glamorous aspects of training for the World Cup Downhill race, the tension prior to the event, and Murray's mixed feelings when it is all over. The camera records a spectacular slow-motion fall, and speeds that would not appeal to your average highway patrol. Murray comes across as a skillful, courageous and dedicated athlete, and a very likeable guy at that. Sound film without commentary. Film without words."
