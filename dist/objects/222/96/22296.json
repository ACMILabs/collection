        "Degas was unique in his ability to synthesize the skill of the classic draftsman with the innovative techniques of the impressionist. His chief interest was the female figure and he never tired of painting the curve of an arm or the extension of a leg. What mattered to him was the light and shade on the human figure. Art students can learn much from his drawings, space arrangements and brilliant coloring."
