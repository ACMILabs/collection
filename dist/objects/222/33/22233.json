        "Outlines the early days of David Livingston(e) in Africa and the series of journeys throughout the continent extending over a period of 30 years. The film illustrates particularly the importance of Livington's exploration and actual scenes show the nature of the country through which he made his journeys. Tribute is paid to his work in combating the slave trade. The film ends with a reconstruction of this meeting with Stanley and an artist's impression of his death and the final journey of his body to the coast and to Westminster Abbey."
