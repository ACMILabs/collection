        "Young Charles Darwin's voyage on HMS Beagle resulted in discoveries that have had a profound effect on nearly every field of human knowledge. Through Darwin's observations off the coasts and islands of South America and experiments made in England, we see how this scientist developed his Theory of Natural Selection. Many rare views of animal and plant life were photographed on the Galapagos Islands."
