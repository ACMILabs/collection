        "Many people visit Dearborn to see cars of the present turned out at the Ford Motor Company Works. Cars of the future are on view at the Ford Rotunda. Other tourist attractions are the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, centres for a historic collection, including both the early years of the Ford motor car and such diverse objects as Thomas Edison's laboratory and the Cape Cod windmill built by the Pilgrims."
