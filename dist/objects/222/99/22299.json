        "A study of the dynamics of youth culture as expressed in dominant youth reactions to the world; rebellion, escape and uncritical acceptance. Each reaction is examined dramatically and the significance pointed out critically, yet sympathetically, by the narrator Dr. William Kirkland, late professor of Christian Ethics, McCormick Theological Seminary. Written by Elliot Baker. Starring Warren Berlinger as the square, William Hickey as the delinquent, Pat DeSimone as the girl, Mal Throne as the poet and the Max Roach Quinter."
