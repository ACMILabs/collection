        "Life in Darwin, first port of call for air travellers en route from Europe to Sydney. Typical life in the city is shown, commerce, public administration, problems arising from its isolation, plans to improve the city with town planning and housing schemes to replace the shanty towns of the pre-war era. The film concludes with a corroboree danced by aboriginal tribes at an annual gathering in the Darwin Botanical Gardens."
