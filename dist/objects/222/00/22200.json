        "To persuade a man that he may be incurably damaging his ears, this film adopts the philosophy that he learns best what he also understands. The physics of sound - sound waves and frequency, pitch and loudness are introduced. The film demonstrates how the ear receives the sounds and compares actual test results showing damage done to the ears by dangerous noises."
