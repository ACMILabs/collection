        "Episode of Series \"Basic Television\". An explanation of vertical and horizontal output circuits for magnetic deflection, staring with the vertical output stages as a typical deflections amplifier. The first part pf the film shows how the sawtooth scanning current in the deflection coils corresponds to linear scanning of the electron beam; it explains oscillations and damping in the output circuit. The remainder of the film builds up the complete horizontal out-put circuit, step by step."
