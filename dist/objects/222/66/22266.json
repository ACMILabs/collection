        "A spider spins a silken web with which to ensnare its food; a moth is caught. Next the trapdoor spider uses its silk glands to construct its home and conceal the entrance with a perfectly hinged door. Two male scorpions fight for the favour of a female of the species, and the victorious male is later devoured by the female in a nuptial feast."
