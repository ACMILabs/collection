        "Combining a sense of adventure and a touch of wit this film is a record of the successful British Trans-Americas Expedition, led by Major Blashford-Snell, through the Darien Gap. It shows the terrible conditions that the men had to go through to achieve this success and also displays the versatility of the two Range-Rover vehicles used."
