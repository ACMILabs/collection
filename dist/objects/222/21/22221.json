        "A tribute to the older worker's high standard of dependability and productivity, and a plea to employers to remove age barriers in hiring new staff. The bitter disappointment felt by an able man denied work because he is over forty-five is expressed in a brief dramatic sequence, and then the film presents the actual record of employees in this age group, reminding us that there is less absenteeism, a lower turnover rate and an equal standard of production among older workers. The importance to the whole country of giving a fair chance to workers over forty-five years of age is explained, and ways in which their problem is being tackled are described."
