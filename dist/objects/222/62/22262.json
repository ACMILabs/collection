        "An animated film to promote discussion. The ceremony of commissioning a new building is about to begin, but first it must be painted white to match its twin, which is located nearby. The people gather, the officials appear, the drummer beats his drum in noisy salute to the magnificent new building... and the building collapses. Who is to blame? The architect? The bricklayer? The carpenter? The painter? Finally a decision is reached. It was the drummer's fault. The angry officials descend on the hapless drummer, take his drum and stomp on it. A loud triumphant cheer rings out from the crowd... and the second building falls down!"
