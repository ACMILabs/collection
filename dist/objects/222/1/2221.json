        "It uses as its basis recordings of the electrical activity occuring within my brain during unconsciousness, to create a unique sound composition, a kind of audio representation of my dreams during sleep. This we realised through the use of software to systematically create audio transcriptions of both my EEG (electroencephalography) wave-traces and MRI images into sound, subsequently giving my unconscious mind a voice. The visual element of the piece consists of the entire sequence of MRI scans which were used in creating the soundtrack. These I animated in order that the viewer be taken on a highly unorthodox journey through the human head, as part of the experience"
