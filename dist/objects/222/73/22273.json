        "The Wolf is an endangered species in Canada, threatened by man and his technology, largely because of unfounded myths that have grown up around it. This study attempts to disprove the fallacies, showing the wolf's life cycle, the social organisation of the pack and the wolf's role in maintaining the balance of nature.
