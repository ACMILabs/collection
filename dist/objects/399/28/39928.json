        "Noel, divorced, middle-aged, takes a break from his high pressure job in a big corporation to visit his brother, who, with his wife, is struggling to hang onto a barely viable small business - a service station in Adelaide. Gary, the 19 year old apprentice is struggling to come to terms with the complexities of life as an emerging adult and befriends Noel. Before long, Noel rediscovers the pleasures of family and is revitalised. After his return to Melbourne, his brother Gary and wife Judy, reassess their own lives and begin to see their own potential. Noel eventually returns to Adelaide for good; his journey for happiness, security and a future filled with promise is finally over. Ray Argall's direction gives form and substance to everyday lives. A sense of naturalism is apparent. Stars Dennis Coard, Frankie J. Holden, Ben Mendelsohn and Micki Camilleri. Cinematography by Mandy Walker. Also available on DVD [319217]"
