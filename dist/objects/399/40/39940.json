        "The year is 1943 and Eugene Morris Jerome, (Matthew Broderick), finds himself far from the comforts of his Brooklyn home when he is drafted and sent to basic training in Mississippi. Expecting to find donuts and USO dances, he instead encounters a weird and sadistic drill sergeant, (Christopher Walken), and a platoon of often hostile recruits. Armed only with his sense of humour and a quick wit, Eugene is determined to survive the rigours of army life and leave the camp with everything he came with... except his virginity. Directed by Mike Nichols, Neil Simon's hilarious adaptation of his long-running Broadway comedy is the story of Eugene's comical travels from adolescence to adulthood."
