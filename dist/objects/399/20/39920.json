        "Noah Render (Elias Koteas), is an insurance adjuster who plays saviour to vulnerable clients whose lives have been uprooted by tragedy. His wife Hera (Arsinee Khanjian), works as a film censor for the Canadian government and secretly videotapes extracts for her sister. Into their lives come Bubba and Mimi, a wealthy couple who spend money staging erotic fantasies to sustain their relationship. Posing as filmmakers, they use Noah and Hera's home in the middle of a desolate housing estate as the setting for their latest and most dangerous immersion in playacting."
