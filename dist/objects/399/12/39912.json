    "description": [
        "The Father lies stiff and near-naked on the kitchen table. His family prepare his body for an outing to the cinema and then carry him through a bleak landscape of concrete roads and decaying factories. This short film combines highly expressionist black and white cinematography with an ominous atmospheric soundtrack. The result is a bizarre and perverse film that has the texture of a dream. Winner of multiple awards for Best Short Film, including prizes at the Melbourne, Edinburgh and London Film Festivals. Cast includes Helen Rollinson, Ian Nash, Imogen Gough, Paul Bajada, Ryan Giddins and features William McInnes as an extra."
