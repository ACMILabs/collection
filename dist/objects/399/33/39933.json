        "Many small, self-contained businesses form the building industry. As a whole, the industry acts as a barometer of the Australian economy; when the economy is failing, the building industry is one of the first to suffer. Many small firms may survive bad times with improved understanding of management techniques. In good times, these management skills form a basis for business growth. This program aims to compare the work method of three self-employed Australian builders, and to start discussion on why builders should adopt a professional approach to work organization, through forward planning, adjusting plans to cope with contingencies, adequate business records, organising the builders own time, relations with employees, subcontractors and partners, relations with clients. Accompanied by comprehensive teaching notes designed to encourage discussion of the issues raised."
