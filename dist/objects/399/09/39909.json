        "Tom Kalin's first feature is a stylish and challenging interpretation of the 1924 kidnapping and murder of a young boy by Chicago's famous lovers Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb. Although based on court transcripts and archival research, the fractured narrative and experimental format are utilized to question the mythology of the 'pathological' homosexual and to reorder history as it was reported."
