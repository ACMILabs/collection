        "Narrated by Chris Haywood, the third volume of \"Blood sweat and tears: Australians and sport\" includes the following episodes: \"Punters and wowsers\" examines why we are so good at sport and why we are so passionate about it. Our sporting prominence owes a lot to gambling, and to those wowsers who tried to tame the wild punters and stamp out the gambling. The war still rages today! \"Image makers\" delves into the dazzling world of televising sport, which has become an incredibly complex art form, and begs the question: will sport become something we enjoy mainly from our armchair? \"You've got to have heart\" investigates the reasons why some people push themselves to the limits of their endurance as it almost seems as if they feel unfulfilled unless they make their dreams of achievement a reality."
