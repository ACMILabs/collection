        "On turning forty years old, Stan (Paul Chubb) decides to leave his job in his father's barber shop and start a new life. He finds work in the Public Service, working in the Department of Meteorology. There he meets George (Julie Forsyte), a young country girl who is hoping to find happiness in the big city. They fall in love but Stan's obsession with the weather, an obsession inherited from his father, threatens their secure future. Stan's expertise with predicting the weather is too threatening for a Government Department run on a tradition of failure. Funny, compassionate and beautifully shot by cinematographer Ray Argill, \"Stan and George's New Life\" continues McKenzie's exploration of an intimate Australian cinema that faithfully captures the textures of Melbourne's working-class life. Some of the funniest moments come from observing the daily run-ins and relationships of office life - even the tea-break requires a certain etiquette!"
