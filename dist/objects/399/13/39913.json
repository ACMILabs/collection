        "The premise of this wonderfully engaging documentary is simple: sit a number of the world's best cinematographers in front of a camera for a change, have them talk about their work on some of the enduring classics of world cinema, excerpt clips to illustrate what they are talking about, and ask them to cite some of their influences. What results is completely hypnotic, especially for anyone who knows anything about the movies and wants a glimpse of what goes into getting them made. This documentary will leave you wishing that it was at least twice as long!"
