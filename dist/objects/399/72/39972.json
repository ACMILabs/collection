        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Long Search\". Ronald Eyre investigates Protestantism in three of its guises in America today. The two main groups of mainstream and fundamentalist are explored. The Fundamentalist groups are experiencing a startling growth, and the mainstream protestant churches are in decline. The Fundamentalists rely heavily on a literal interpretation of the Bible and on saving souls, whilst the traditional churches see religion as an outward directing force to improve the lot of humankind. Ronald Eyre concludes with a visit to a Black Baptist Church in a poor area where the needs of the poor are addressed, and the idea that Protestantism is the impulse to keep things moving."
