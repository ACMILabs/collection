        "Episode number 13 of Series \"The Long Search\". In this concluding episode Ronald Eyre attempts to answer questions such as \"Is religion about theology?\", \"Is God dead?\", \"Do all religions say the same thing?\" In a program filled with such questions and many more personal ones besides, he revisits some of the crucial moments in his search including his visits to Romania, the Buddhist monks and the taoist funeral, concluding that in order to find true religion, one first has to find oneself."
