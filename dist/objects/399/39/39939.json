        "Hailed by critics as a masterpice, this film is based on the true story of a squad of U.S. soldiers caught in the moral dilemma of wartime Vietnam. Witness to a vile crime, Private Ericksson (Michael J. Fox) is forced to stand alone against his fellow soldiers and commanding officer Sergeant Meserve (Sean Penn), a powerful and charismatic man pushed over the edge of barbarism by the terror and brutality of combat. With sweeping scope, action and raw power, master filmmaker, Brian De Palma creates a devastating and unforgettable tale of one man's quest for sanity and justice amidst the chaos of war. Based upon the book by Daniel Lang."
