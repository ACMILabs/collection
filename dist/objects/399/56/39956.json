        "Takes the student and the teacher behind the scenes to offer fascinating insights into the complex task of bringing a great 19th Century novel to the television screen. It uses authentic materials from different aspects of the TV and radio production process. It gives opportunities to compare George Eliot's original text with the radio adaptation, the TV production and the screenwriter's version, by using excerpts from the actual dramatisation. Allows both teachers and students the opportunity to re-edit some of the shots taken by the production team, and to compare their versions with the broadcast version. It examines the roles of sound effects and music in relation to narrative and realism. This programme will not only teach the process of turning a book into a television serial, but by examining such concepts as narrative, realism, character, gender, class and the use of the authorial voice, will also help students with the study of the novel generally. The kit contains one 90 minute videocassette, one 60 minute audiocassette and one comprehensive activity book."
