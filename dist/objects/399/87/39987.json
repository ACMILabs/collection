        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Everybody's business: management in action (NP)\". This episode emphasises the importance for managers to develop an interest in understanding some of the characteristics of their most important resource - the organisation's members. Understanding the needs, values, attitudes and perceptions of individuals helps managers make better decisions about selection, placement and training. The Sheraton Towers Hotel and Metropolitan Fire Brigade are two organisations profiled here and a test case of the attitude survey conducted at Dulux is also featured."
