        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Long Search\". In this episode Ronald Eyre visits a buddhist monastery in Sri Lanka to discover the meaning of buddhism. He finds that buddhism has no god; buddhists regard gods as useful but not crucial. The three basic principles of buddhism are to shun all evils, to do good, and to achieve purification of the mind. The individual can expect no external help, but must follow the noble eight-fold path to nirvana, using meditation to penetrate appearances and show the world as it is. The program includes the initiation of a young boy as a monk."
