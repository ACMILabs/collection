        "Mathsphere aims to bring the real world into the classroom. By placing mathematics in a real context, for example, the examination of environmental issues, the objective is to see mathematics as a human activity. Each episode is in two parts with a corresponding mathematical process or activity. Exercises and data are provided in the accompanying booklet. Topics include manipulating data, percentages and ratios, spreadsheets, geometry, algebra, trigonometry, statistical methodologies and fractions. The programs are pitched so that they can be applied to different levels of study."
