        "At the centre of this film is an unlikely friendship between two twelve year old boys - Andri is from a wealthy family and Gempol is from a poor family. Both are deprived in different ways, Andri of the love and attention from his father, Gempol the chance of education and opportunities in life. A bond develops between them and they set out to find Gempol's displaced family. The central theme focusing on the vitality and resourcefulness of the poor embellished with oblique political jokes did not find favour with it's Indonesian distributors who withdrew it from cinemas on the grounds that it was uncommercial! The ensuing press controversy in Indonesia brought it to world wide attention. Indonesian dialogue with English subtitles. For use with secondary school students and adults, this film comes with a bibliography and study notes."
