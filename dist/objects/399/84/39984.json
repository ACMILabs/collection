        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Everybody's business: management in action (NP)\". In many organisations, preparation for people to assume management positions is often poor and unstructured. While people should undertake career planning, organisations should also encourage career development skills. This episode focuses on two case studies of cadet mangement programs operating at the ANZ Bank and Coles Myer."
