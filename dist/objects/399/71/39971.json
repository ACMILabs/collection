        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Long Search\". Ronald Eyre begins his search for the answers to the great philosophical questions of experience in India, home of 330 million gods. He discovers that Hinduism is really a philosophy of life rather than a religion. He visits Benares and a small village to discover what religion means to the ordinary people of India as they perform their daily rituals and celebrate festivals associated with their local deity. Much of the discussion hinges on the meaning of symbols, ritual and what is a God."
