        "From acid rain to the greenhouse effect, from rainforests to desertification... this highly acclaimed series brings together the major world environmental issues and presents them in a form that is both accessible and easy to use. The ten, 20 minute programmes examine themes such as - the limited nature of our global resources, the interdependence of human life and the physical environment, the necessity of a sustainable basis for development. Underlying this is a central message - that an understanding of these themes is crucial if our planet is to survive. The video comes with notes for teachers offering an outline of each programme and useful resources for follow-up work. The ten parts are: 1 - 'In the shadow of the city': urbanisation. 2 - 'Breaking Ground': Soil erosion and desertification. 3 - 'What's on tap': water pollution. 4 - 'Timber!': forest management. 5 - 'The Greenhouse Effect': global warming and possible effects. 6 - 'Power for the people': energy conservation. 7 - 'A Breath of fresh air': air pollution and acid rain. 8 - 'Down in the dumps': waste and waste recycling. 9 - 'The Troubled sea': overfishing and ocean pollution. 10 - 'Our future world': round-up of the series. Suitable for years 7-10."
