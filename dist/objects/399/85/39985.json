        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Everybody's business: management in action (NP)\". This episode asks the complex question: what is management? Since there are many diverse management systems, this episode follows a day in the life of two very different managers - Tricia Caswell, Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation and Michael Bowman from Ford Australia. The Chief Executive Officer of the City of Melbourne, Elizabeth Proust, joins Kerry O'Brien in the studio."
