        "Narrated by Chris Haywood, this second volume of the four volume series \"Blood sweat and tears: Australians and sport\", includes the episodes: \"Silvertails & yobbos\" which investigates the gulf that exists between the public access areas at sporting venues and the areas reserved for members only - is it really only money that separates the \"classes\" today? \"Beauty and the beast\" focuses on the struggle for women against rigid atittudes to be equal in the sporting arena - to have their achievements recognised on the same level as male sporting achievements. \"Blood and guts\" looks at how a mere game can turn murderous - the increase in violence in sports, such as Australian Rules football, and the extraordinary jump in the number of serious injuries in recent years."
