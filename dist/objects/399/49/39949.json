Overnight, their relationship dramatically changes from friends to lovers. A once beautiful relationship is threatened, and the complication of an unexpected pregnancy throws them both into a spin! A light romantic comedy with a strong supporting cast including Ruth Cracknell, Henri Szeps and Mark Lee."
