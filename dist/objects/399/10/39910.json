        "In New England, the Civil War rages and the women left at home must struggle, many deprived of their menfolk, sticking together to survive and enjoy life regardless of the hardships. So it befell the March family, those \"little women\" of Louisa May Alcott's novel which has delighted children and adults for generations. There is headstrong Jo, fiercely intent on a writing career, Meg with her love of life's finer things, Amy's wilful tantrums as she struggles through adolescence and the quiet Beth, calm in her world of music. Sibling rivalry, happy adventures and pure joy in living, despite the difficult times, are evident in this charming adaptation of the classic novel."
