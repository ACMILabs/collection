        "Anne Baxter, in one of her greatest performances, plays the elegant Lilianna, an actress and drama coach, struggling to produce a newly discovered Jane Austen play. However, the manuscript is in the hands of Pierre (Robert Powell), an ex-student of Lilianna's, who has broken away from traditional theatre values into bizzare experimental techniques and a raging tug-of-war ensues between the traditional and experimental. Co-starring Michael Wager, Tim Choate, Sean Young, John Guerrasio, Katrina Hodiak, Kurt Johnson, Philip Lenkowsky, Nancy New and Charles McCaughan. Written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and based upon Sir Charles Grandison or \"The Happy Man\"."
