        "Episode number 8 of Series \"The Long Search\". In this program the producers have chosen the Turaja people of Sulawesi in Indonesia to represent cultures which still practice a 'primal' religion. Their particular form of religion emphasises the role of the ancestors which leads to extremely elaborate and lengthy funeral ceremonies with an emphasis on animal sacrifice. Ronald Eyre ponders on how these religions are coping with the modern world, in the form of christianity and 'cultural tourism', as well as trying to understand the religion itself. The film does contain scenes of animal sacrifice, although the viewer is warned of their approach."
