        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Long Search\". In this program Ronald Eyre looks at three aspects of Catholicism; the triumphal pageant of Rome and the Pope, the beliefs of a British convert to Catholicism and her family in Leeds, and finally at the Little Brothers of Jesus who live in small groups in the community, except for the year they spend alone in the desert, and the time they spend training in Spain."
