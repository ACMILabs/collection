        "This world is indeed a living being endowed with soul and intelligence. This quote from Plato's \"Timeus\" guides the spirit of this ravishing short film. An original music score by Philip Glass, based on indigenous music from around the globe, is the soundtrack to a compilation of some of the world's finest film footage of the animal kingdom. From mammals to reptiles, then to the mysterious worlds beneath the ocean, the film is a poetic celebration of the diversity and beauty of animal life. The music, integral to this film without dialogue, combines orchestral instruments with rhythms and sounds from across the globe. From the majesty of a lion's face, to the intimate wonder of a cell multiplying, this is an excellent teacher of the rich legacy nature has left our planet. A co-production between Italy and the United States, \"Anima Mundi\" was partly funded by the World Wildlife Fund to celebrate their Biological Diversity Campaign."
