        "Episode number 7 of Series \"The Long Search\". In this video Ronald Eyre explores the concept of \"the chosen people\" and the significance of the holocaust with Eli Wiesel, the leader of the Amadeus Quartet, a Jerusalem rabbi and a New York lawyer. He also discovers the Jewish love of words and argument, which stems from their need to constantly reinterpret the word of God, and their propensity to illustrate their arguments with humorous stories and jokes."
