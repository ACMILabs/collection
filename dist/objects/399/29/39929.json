        "A strong pacifist theme underlines this moving story of Bashu, a terrified ten year old who escapes the bombing that kills his family and destroys his village. Stowing away on a truck travelling from the South to the North, Bashu meets Nai, a woman who shelters him. Gradually Nai accepts him as a son and tries to initiate him into the ways of life in the region. They discover new grounds for a closer spiritual relationship when Nai keeps the boy despite objections from relatives and neighbours. Nai's husband returns home, approves of his wife's decision and adopts Bashu. This subtly crafted film was banned in Iran for six years and was only released after the Iran/Iraq war. Starring S. Taslimi, P. Poor Hosseini and A. Afravian. Persian language with English subtitles."
