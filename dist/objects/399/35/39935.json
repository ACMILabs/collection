        "Australian funnyman Paul Hogan stars as a thief who's convinced he's an angel. Hogan is career criminal Terry Dean, who's hit by a car while saving the life of a little girl. When Terry regains consciousness, he awakens in a place strangely like heaven, with a God who looks strangely like Charlton Heston! Terry emerges from this vision believing he's an angel - a belief that propels him and those he encounters into some howlingly funny and heartfelt predicaments."
