        "John Jarratt plays a young man who enlists to serve in Vietnam. The film follows him as he serves active duty in one of the toughest of army units - the Australian Special Air Service. In between the savagery of combat the men of the unit gamble, play tricks on each other and drink a numbing amount of alcohol. This hard-edged comedy is a celebration of the Australian male ethos of larrikinism. Amid both the horror and tedium of war, it is only the mens' sense of humour that saves them from descending into madness. One of the few Australian features to deal directly with Australian combat in Vietnam, \"The Odd Angry Shot\" features an excellent cast including John Hargreaves, Bryan Brown, Graeme Blundell and Graham Kennedy. Based on the novel by William Nagle."
