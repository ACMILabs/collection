        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Everybody's business: management in action (NP)\". Management must strive to achieve many outcomes. They are responsible to the organisation, the staff, the customer and society. Productivity improvement is their primary responsibility. However, this must be considered relative to the needs and wants of all the stakeholders. Meeting the needs and desires of all these people is often a very complex balancing act. How well it is carried out is a measure of the managers. This episode is likely to be a full scale debate among Australian managers, unionists, commentators, and employees about the role of management in the 1990's."
