        "A short Melbourne comedy which explores the complications that arise when a gothic punk woman and her racist skinhead boyfriend move next door to a Vietnamese-Australian couple in Melbourne's western suburbs. Funny and astute, \"Black Dogs\" pokes gentle fun at some of the eccentricities of youth subcultures without being patronising or offensive. Sharply written and directed, this gem of a movie manages to entertain as it examines some of the tensions of modern \"multicultural\" Australia. The acting by the young cast is faultless."
