        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Long Search\". Even under the communist regime of 1977 it was estimated that 80% of the Romanian population were members of the Orthodox church. The Orthodox church lays claim to an uninterrupted 2000 years of unfragmented Christianity, a Christianity which gives great importance to the symbolic, particularly in the form of icons, which are windows into heaven. This is because the Orthodox believe that words do not suffice to convey the real meaning of what we feel. The program includes church ceremonies, and particularly the celebration of Easter."
