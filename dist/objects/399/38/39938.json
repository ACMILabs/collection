        "The quietly haunting tale of an aloof Jewish intellectual (Ron Silver) who managed to escape the Nazis and now in 1949 is living a double life in New York, married to a simple peasant girl who protected him during the war, and fooling around with a sexy Jewish woman who is desperate to marry him. Into all this walks his first wife Tamara (Anjelica Huston) whom reappears after being presumed killed during the war. Will Herman be able to please his three wives? This touching and humorous story is based on the novel by Isaac Bashevis Singer and lovingly brought to the screen by Paul Mazursky with all of Singer's wit, irony and heartbreak."
