        "A contemporary tale of 'amour fou' based on the novel by Phillipe Djian, \"Betty blue\" is the story of Zorg (Jean-Hugues Anglade) who at 31 has accepted a certain measure of resignation, and the beautiful, passionate nineteen year old Betty (Beatrice Dalle), who dramatically enters his life and proceeds to dismantle his complacency with her volatile, urgent nature. Betty and Zorg's life together is dominated by Betty's fearless embracing of whatever emotion or new circumstance presents itself. This propels them both into a series of events and encounters by turns comic and poignant. Betty's restlessness and her ever-worsening mental illness finds a focus in Zorg. She decides he is a brilliant writer and she sets about despatching his diaries to potential publishers. In the face of disappointment, however, Betty's increasingly extreme reactions begin to reveal an instinct for self-destruction that Zorg is helpless to subdue. French language with English subtitles."
