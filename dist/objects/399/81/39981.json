        "Episode number 11 of Series \"The Long Search\". In this visit to Taiwan Ronald Eyre looks at Chinese religion and finds that the Chinese are Confucians, Taoists, Buddhists or can be all three at once. He explores the concept of yin and yan and the harmony which comes when good and evil are combined in balance. He takes his journey from a look at the local gods to the philosophy of the three accepted religions. The three main aims of the Chinese seem to be to live a long time, to have enough money and to have children, and it is from this that the importance of ancestors derive. He attends a village opera performance, a taoist funeral and explores a new temple which seems to include all three religions."
