        "Episode number 9 of Series \"The Long Search\". In this program Ronald Eyre looks at Japanese Buddhism, which is rather different to the Buddhism of Sri Lanka, which was explored in an earlier program. He visits a Zen Buddhist monastery and observes their austere and meditative rituals, which include martial arts and tea ceremonies. He then looks at Soka-ga-kai which is a new form of Buddhism catering to the masses, whose focus is the temple. He concludes by exploring the idea of the boddhisvata poised on the edge of eternity reaching back so that he can take others with him, rather than the Buddha himself who has passed beyond the reach of time."
