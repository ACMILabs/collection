        "Based on Mark Medoff's Tony Award-winning (1980) play. It is a touching and poignant love story between a deaf woman and a hearing man. William Hurt gives a sensitive performance as James a likeable schoolmaster, whose job is to teach hearing impaired people to speak. Sarah (Marlee Matlin - who is hearing impaired in real life) is a young beautiful girl who leaves school with a chip on her shoulder and with the knowledge that sex needs no conversation. The touching portrayal of their attraction makes it impossible not to share the experience. Matlin won the 1987 Academy Award for Best Actress with nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay."
