        "An intelligent, witty animation based on John Gardener's popular novel which retells the Beowulf epic. Originally written in 600AD, the story pits Beowulf, a southern Swedish hero against a terrible monster, Grendel. In this adaptation, as with the novel, the legend is retold from Grendel's viewpoint, making him a sympathetic, philosophic monster plagued by greedy, warring stupid creatures called men who invade his territory and his serenity. The characters are engaging and individual, coloured in pastels with a refreshing ambience. They are given voice by an eclectic range of performers including Keith Mitchell, Barry Hill and Bobby Bright. This is a highly engrossing story and is recommended for its humanist sympathies."
