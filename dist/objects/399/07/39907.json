        "The year is 1958. The men of the first Japanese Antarctic expedition are expecting to be relieved by another party on board the ice breaker 'Soya'. A fierce blizzard erupts and the 'Soya' is unable to reach base camp. A small plane is used to ferry the men of the first expedition back to the ice breaker. The men, believing the second party to be on its way, left behind fifteen sled dogs which were chained to posts embedded in ice. This is the incredible true story of these sled dogs and their struggle to survive an Antarctic winter. Narrated by Robert Wagner and music by Vangelis."
