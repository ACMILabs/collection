        "These two classic children's tales are brought to life in these enchanting puppet plays. \"The Reluctant dragon\" tells the story of a simple shepherd's son and his discovery of a dragon in a cave. He is not dismayed or surprised that the dragon is friendly but they have some trouble convincing the villagers and St. George the dragon slayer. This version of \"The Pied piper of Hamelin\" is the winner of the BAFTA Best Children's Programme Award and the Prix Jeunesse. Narrated by Robert Hardy."
