        "This unusual video explores the day-to-day life of Australian soldiers who served during the Vietnamese War. By using super-8 film footage that the soldiers took of themselves, we are taken from training in Australia to the camps in Vietnam where the young men were to confront the terrors of fighting a bitter guerrila war. The super-8 images are ultimately touching because they reveal young boys at the point of losing their innocence. The haunting musical score is by David Bridie and John Phillips of Not Drowning, Waving."
