        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". Dr.No was the first extraordinary adventure of the world's most famous spy: James Bond. Sean Connery is 007: suave, charming and fearless; an expert on weapons, women, martinis and just about everything. Dr. No, a fanatical scientist plots to overtake the world but is ultimately defeated. Ursula Andress made her first screen appearance in the film. While there is no famous title song, the well-known James Bond theme and elaborate opening title sequences by Maurice Binder have become part of the James Bond legend."
