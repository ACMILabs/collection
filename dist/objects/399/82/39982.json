        "Episode number 12 of Series \"The Long Search\". In this penultimate program Ronald Eyre visits the alternative communities of San Francisco, where westerners are searching for something to replace traditional religion, or the religion of science and progress, which seems to have replaced religion in the accepted sense in much of western society. The fundamental question he asks in this program is \"Is God dead and did science kill him, and is science an adequate explanation of reality?\" He talks to Theodore Roszak about the quest for meaning, and to noted physicists and philosophers, about the growing indadequacy of science to explain. Touching briefly on various manifestations of this search - biofeedback, sikhism, SAGE and the new physics, he concludes that the search itself is positive, even if the finding is sometimes shallow and negative."
