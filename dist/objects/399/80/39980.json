        "Episode number 10 of Series \"The Long Search\". In this visit to South Africa Ronald Eyre looks at the ways Christianity has evolved into an almost completely different religion, with an emphasis on dreams, purification, healing and the power of the holy spirit. Black Africans separated from the land search to replace these roots in God and the three different Christian sects which are explored here - the Zionists, the Lutherans and the Nazarites, all in their different ways have combined traditional African religion with Christianity. A fascinating look at how two different religions can merge and evolve into something quite unique and alive."
