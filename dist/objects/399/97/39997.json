        "Narrated by Chris Haywood, this first volume of the \"Blood sweat and tears\" series contains the following episodes: \"Obsession\" looks at the seemingly obsessive attention given to sport by both the Australian media and the general public: investigates the questions why are there are sometimes when you can't get anything on television except sport? and why do most people believe Donald Bradman is the most famous Australian of all time? \"Winners and losers\" shows the fine line that exists between success and failure in the ruthless world of international sport. \"Black diamonds\" looks at the issues surrounding Aboriginal achievements in sport. \"Kill the bastards\" looks at why people immerse themselves in a wider Self - a crowd of supporters, joined at the heart, not the head, bound by the team colours - to whom the one thing that gives life meaning is belonging, even if it means defeat."
