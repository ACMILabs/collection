        "At seventeen, Samantha Hughes of Hopewell, Kentucky is pretty, energetic, headstrong and curious; curious about the father she never knew, and curious about the war that took him away - the war nobody wants to remember. Bruce Willis plays a reclusive vet in this story of a family's struggle to heal the wounds of Vietnam. This film captures both the horror of battle and the disillusionment of a young soldier who thought war meant glory. Norman Jewison directs this heartfelt and powerful movie highlighted by one of the most poignant final scenes ever filmed - the family's emotionally stirring, almost wordless visit to the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial in Washington D.C. \"In country\" is the term American GI's used for their time in Vietnam. Based on the novel by Bobbie Ann Mason."
