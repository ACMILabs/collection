        "Noah Taylor is Jack, a young man who is obsessed by the lives of the great Russian writers. He wanders through a dreamscape in which reality entwines with characters from Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Gogol. Penniless in a cold and bleak West Berlin, he falls in love with Elena, (Solveig Dommartin), who in his fevered imagination comes to represent Dostoevsky's pure and ill-treated Sasha. Over the course of a magical night in Berlin, Jack, Elena and her friend Johanna search the alleys and autobahns of Berlin seeking love, solace and the promise of redemption. This idosyncratic and romantic Australian film is a lyrical celebration of human contact and communion."
