        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". Claude Lorrain's painting \"Seaport at sunset\" is one of a pair of paintings. The colours, the spacing of the figures, the lighting close to the ground and the perspective of the buildings converge to produce an illusion of depth. This program examines the painting in detail, at Claude Lorrain's life and the historical setting in which he lived, the symbolism of the painting and his technique, which ultimately led to Turner and impressionism."
