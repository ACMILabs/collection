        "Stuart Gunn (John Waters) is a perfectionist. Barbara (Jacki Weaver) is his long suffering wife. Stuart and Barbara reach a crossroads in their relationship when she wishes to return to the workforce whilst he wants her to stay at home. Finally, Barbara wins out and a babysitter is hired, though not the usual stereotype. He is a tall, blond and handsome Scandinavian called Erik. Without warning the roles of Stuart and Barbara have been reversed - but who is the better off? Starring Jacki Weaver, John Waters, Noel Ferrier and Steven Vidler. Screenplay by David Williamson from his stageplay."
