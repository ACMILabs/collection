        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Long Search\". It is estimated that one seventh of the world's population is Moslem. In this program Ronald Eyre attempts to discover the essential core of Islam and of the Sufi sect in particular. This proves to be a difficult task, but in his search in Egypt he discovers that Islam means \"making submission to Allah\" and that therefore a Moslem is one who submits. The central message seems to be \"there is no god but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger\", grounded on the rock of the Koran which sets out the five pillars of Islam. A fascinating but tantalising look at one of the world's great religions."
