        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Everybody's business: management in action (NP)\". Even though our education pushes us towards individual achievement, groups and teams are often essential for an organisation to reach its goals. This episode looks at the value of effective teamwork, different approaches to increasing the effectiveness of teams and the task of managers to understand and utilise groups. We look at an ABC news crew team and follow a training day in the bush with National Mutual."
