        "In Australia's early days the ship of the desert, the camel, was imported to help explore the harsh interior of this vast continent. Through the wonder of animation and live action 'The Camel Boy' takes you back to the beginning of this century for an exciting adventure story based on the actual journeys of explorers in Australia's outback wilderness. The burning sands of the inland desert and the hurricane lashed waters of the ocean are the setting for this story of friendship between a boy and a camel."
