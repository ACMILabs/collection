        "A helicopter, hovering, swoops, wheels and searches like some malignant mechanical bat. Below two men, their hands tied behind their backs, flee for their lives. MacConnachie, played by Robert Shaw, is forty and Ansell, played by Malcolm McDowell, is in his early twenties. Ahead lies 400 miles of hostile terrain they must cross to escape. Between each other lies a deep mutual mistrust, but they are bound by a common need to escape and survive. MacConnachie moves by instinct and Ansell by reason. On and on the two men are hunted by the unrelenting helicopter, and unlike ordinary men who would keep running, they hunt back."
