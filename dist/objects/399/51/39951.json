        "Smash Palace is a remarkable drama about a marital breakup which erupts into an impulsive kidnapping of a child by the father, and a totally credible escalation to the brink of tragedy. Bruno Lawrence and Anna Jemison play the estranged couple in strong performances. Filmed amongst a vast junk-yard of cars, Donaldson's direction is economical and enthralling, capturing the tension that goes beneath the surface of this all too real drama."
