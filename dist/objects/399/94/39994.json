        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Everybody's business: management in action (NP)\". To carry out a plan or implement a decision a degree of organisation needs to occur. What individuals do (job design), how people relate formally to one another (organisational structure) and how this gets co-ordinated are the essential organising activities. At the same time, mechanisms to establish if the planning, organising, motivating, etc. is achieving what intended to occur. Self correcting control or control followed by corrective action needs to be built into all management processes."
