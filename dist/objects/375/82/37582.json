        "In Beaumont-sur-mer on the French Riviera, Lawrence Jamison (Michael Caine), a suave stylish con man who is an expert at extracting jewels from rich, married women must find a way to deal with crass new competition in the person of Freddy Benson (Steve Martin), a small time scam artist who tells tragic tales about his grandma to secure a few francs from almost anyone! Eventually they decide to compete and make a wager that whoever cannot swindle a certain naive soap heiress (Glenne Headly) for $50,000 must leave the French Riviera hunting ground. A remake of the 1964 \"Bedtime stories\"."
