        "The first episode of this video demonstrates the need for safety precautions at work and at home, and in particular stresses the wearing of protective clothing. In \"Building a home\" a young couple is offered concise advice on what to do and what not to do when building your own house. The final episode, \"Improving health and safety\" stresses the necessity of clear, understandable information at the work place on health and safety - including the need for employers, unions and workers to ensure that health and safety information is accessible to all regardless of cultural or linguistic backgrounds."
