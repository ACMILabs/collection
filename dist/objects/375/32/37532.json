        "Buying a car, new or used, can often be a stressful time because of the money involved. The first episode of this video details the importance of organising appropriate finance, being sure of exactly what kind of vehicle you need, and knowing what questions to ask dealers (be they a business or an individual) before buying your car. In \"Deciding where to live\" information is given on the various types of housing that exist in Australia - private, public, rental, home ownership and emergency housing. Episode 30, \"Getting your skills recognised\" explains the various services available for migrants to Australia to receive assistance in getting overseas qualifications recognised, and also explains how to arrange upgrading skills for the Australian workplace."
