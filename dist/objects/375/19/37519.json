        "Enid Blyton's famous adventure story about five children, a sinister castle and a network of spies is brought vividly to life. A young widowed mother, takes her two children and friends to stay at a country cottage during the school holidays. They befriend a young gypsy girl who lives in the nearby woods. Across the valley, stand the dark, brooding remains of a mysterious ruined castle. The five children launch an expedition to discover the castle's secrets."
