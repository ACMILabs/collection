        "The Sunburnt country tells the story of Australia's arid interior, formed when climatic change overtook and dried out Central Australia. \"Land of flood and fire\" portrays a year in the life of the spectacular far north coast of Australia, where the first Aboriginal people arrived and settled. The region swings savagely between the floods of the annual wet and the parched heat of the dry season. \"The End of isolation\" examines the impact of the European invasion which sent change sweeping across the continent with unprecedented speed."
