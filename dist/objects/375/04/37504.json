        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Warriors\". A drama-documentary based on the memoirs of Lewis Lind. Lew Lind was a member of the Australian 2/11 Battalion, 3 Company, who defended Rethymnon in Crete against the German invasion in 1941. Following the German occupation of Crete, Lind was imprisoned in a POW camp from which he escaped with three other soldiers. This film uses interviews with Lind during his return to Crete in the 80s and re-enactments of the wartime experiences of Lind and fellow soldier, Dick Plant, who were sheltered by the Cretans from the Nazis. A notable feature of the program is the archival German newsreel footage on the invasion of Crete."
