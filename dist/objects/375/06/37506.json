        "In March 1947 the SS Johan de Witt docked in Sydney with seven hundred Jewish refugees on board. It was the last such mass intake of refugees of the Holocaust and stirred up a degree of anti-Semitism which contributed to the revival of the White Australia policy shortly afterwards. This program combines interviews with three of those on board and archival footage to present an authentic and personal account of the times."
