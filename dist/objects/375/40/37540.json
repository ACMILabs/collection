        "Glory tells the epic true story of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and his 54th Massachusetts Regiment - the American Civil War's first black fighting unit. By risking their own lives in battle these men were to lay claim to freedom and citizenship for themselves and their children. Stars Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, in an Academy Award winning role, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. Graphically depicts the supreme sacrifice made by these brave men in order to prove themselves the equals of the white Americans."
