        "An inescapably moving animal adventure film starring Eric Porter as a huntsman who unwittingly pits the forces of nature against each other. Tag, an orphaned fox cub, is reared with a litter of hound puppies and through this kindly act comes tragedy for both humans and animals. Also stars Rachel Roberts, Dennis Waterman, Jeremy Kemp and Bill Travers."
