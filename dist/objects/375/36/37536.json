        "The final three episodes of the \"English at work\" series. In \"Helping with problems\" we are shown the various ways people can assist others by being good listeners and being prepared to stand up for the rights of others. In \"Saving energy\" we are shown ways to be more energy efficient at both work and home. \"Preventing sexual harassment\". The prevention of sexual harassment and intimidation is shown to be the responsibility of management, workers, and unions: in fact every woman and man needs to object to the practice of harassment in their workplace whenever it occurs."
