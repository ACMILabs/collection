        "Radio Redfern is an inner-city Sydney public radio station which is run by Aboriginal people and their communities. In January 1988 while \"gubbas\" (white Australians) were celebrating the 200th anniversary of the invasion of Aboriginal Australia, Radio Redfern ran a twenty-four hour service which aimed to bring Aboriginal communities throughout Australia together to protest both the destructive effects of 200 years of European colonialism, and to celebrate the strength, dignity and resistance of Aboriginal culture. Using a rich soundtrack of Koori contemporary music this documentary is a testament to the diversity of contemporary black culture, and to Aboriginal unity around such issues as land rights and black deaths in custody."
