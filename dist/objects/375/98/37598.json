        "An interview with Australian writer, Mary Durack, and her sister, Elizabeth, recorded in December 1982 in Perth. Mary Durack had never, when growing up, entertained the idea of being a writer and began writing as \"a bit of a game\". Her first efforts were published when she was ten. The Duracks lived on cattle stations in the Kimberleys in NW Western Australia. In the interview, Mary Durack recalls the life on the Argyle and Ivanhoe stations and her close relationship with the Aborigines living there as well as the influence her father has had on her books \"Kings in Grass Castles\" and its sequel. Produced in association with the Archival Film Program of the Australia Council."
