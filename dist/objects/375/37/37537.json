        "The land before time is an animated tale of dinosaurs who long ago roamed the land that was threatened by earthquakes and volcanoes. A young brontosaurus named Littlefoot sets off in search of the legendary Great Valley where dinosaurs can thrive and live in peace. Along the way he makes friends with four other dinosaurs. During their journey they encounter incredible adventures and obstacles and learn unforgettable lessons about life and what it means to stick together."
