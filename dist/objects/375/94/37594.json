        "An adaptation of Anthony Trollope's two 19th Century classics, \"The Warden\", and \"Barchester Towers\", starring Donald Pleasence, Nigel Hawthorne, Geraldine McEwan and Susan Hampshire. Reverend Septimus Harding is one of the most respected men in Barchester. He lives an honest and undisturbed life until the advent of a passionate reformer, John Bold, who accuses the Reverend of corruption which turns his cosy world of Barchester upside down."
