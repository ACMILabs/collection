        "This famous story of the mischievous marionette and his long-suffering 'father' Gepetto, is full of fantastic adventure brought about by Pinocchio's genius for landing himself in trouble and his naive trust in Mr. Cat and Mr. Fox. This production is rich in special effects and incorporates original music and songs. Pinocchio appears for the first time as a real live puppet moving without strings. Based on the novel by Carlo Collodi."
