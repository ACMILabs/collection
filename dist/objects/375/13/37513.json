        "This screen adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel retains the essential ingredients of this well-known Christmas story of a mean lonely old man called Ebenezer Scrooge who refuses to join in the Christmas festivities. Scrooge is forced to face the truth about himself when confronted by the ghosts of his late business partner, Marley, and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. Dramatised by Elaine Morgan, stars Michael Hordern as Scrooge and John Le Mesurier as Marley."
