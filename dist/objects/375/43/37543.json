        "Episode number 7 of Series \"A Day in the Life of a Woman\". Wong King Chan is a Chinese immigrant living and working in extremely hard conditions in Macau. Her factory work takes her away from her husband and two children for at least ten hours a day, then she returns to the tiny one room flat in a tenement building they share with three others. As we follow her daily routine we learn of her hopes to save enough money to buy a flat which will generate enough income to provide for her children's education."
