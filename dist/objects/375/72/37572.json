        "With little understanding of the meanings or the origins of Australian Aboriginal art, the international art market has eagerly, almost obscenely, embraced this most ancient cultural tradition. This significant, ironic documentary does not presume to make judgements on the artists and the analysts, the prophets and the profiteers, the critics and collectors. The images and stories speak for themselves. Features artists, Ronnie Tjampitjinpa, Michael Jagamara Nelson, Darby Jampijinpa, Dolly Nampijinpo Granites, Uta Uta Tjangala and Turkey Tolson Tjupurrlo. Gold Medal Winner, International Film & Television Festival, New York, 1991."
