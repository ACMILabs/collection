        "The first three episodes of the acclaimed nature series \" A separate creation\" tells the story of how the Australian marsupials rose from being primitive insect hunters in the primeval forests of the now vanished super continent of Gondwana, to become the dominant mammal group in Australia. \"Seas under Capricorn\" recounts how, following the breakaway from Gondwana 45 million years ago, the island continent came to span both tropical and temperate seas, resulting in the most diverse marine life on Earth. \"The making of the bush\" tells the story of how Australia's wooded margins came to be dominated by one unique type of tree growing in a great variety of forms - the eucalypt."
