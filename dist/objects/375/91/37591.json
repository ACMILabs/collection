        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Writers of today\". British poet, W. H. Auden, and New York Herald Tribune drama critic Walter Kerr, smoke their way through this entertaining discussion on the role of the poet and poetry in the modern world. The program is a reissue of an interview originally recorded in the '50s for the Educational Television & Radio Center. In it, Auden holds forth on the essentials for a good poet, poetry as magic or play, and the estrangement of the poet in a technological society. A highlight is Auden's moving recitation of his own poem on poetry - \"The truest poetry is the most feigning\"."
