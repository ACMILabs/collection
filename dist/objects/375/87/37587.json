        "It is 1916. A shell-shocked soldier (Alan Bates) is sent home to the tranquillity of his English estate, his beautiful but spoilt wife Kitty (Julie Christie) and adoring cousin (Ann-Margret). But he barely remembers Kitty and can only find happiness with his first love (Glenda Jackson), who is from a lower class and now married to a schoolteacher. Kitty, however, wants him back whatever the cost. Adapted by Hugh Whitemore from the novel by Rebecca West, with music by Richard Rodney Bennett. Also stars Frank Finlay and Ian Holm."
