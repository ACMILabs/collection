        "The ability to involve an audience, to change people's thinking and elicit a desired response, is a skill which can be learned and in this video Peter Thompson analyses the techniques which have been used by some admired and effective communicators. Included are examples from Winston Churchill, Laurence Olivier, Bob Ansett, John Kennedy and in conclusion a lengthy extract from Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech is shown."
