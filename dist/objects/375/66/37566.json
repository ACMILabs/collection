        "Kathleen Turner leads a double life in this film by Ken Russell. By day she is Joanna, a sportswear designer, but by night she transforms herself to China-Blue, a hooker servicing a variety of sexual fantasies. Among her regular clients is a sinister preacher (Anthony Perkins) who carries his obsession with China-Blue to a chilling extreme."
