        "My Sweet Little Village examines with simple affection the affairs - comic, sad, quirky and downright ordinary - of a village collective farm in Czechoslovakia. The story begins and ends with a marvellous comic pair - truckie's offsider, Otek, and his long suffering workmate. There is not a solitary political utterance to be heard, but the film still manages to subtly convey the graft and corruption permeating every level of Czech society."
