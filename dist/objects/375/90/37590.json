        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Writers of today\". Re-release of an interview recorded in America in the 50's with Frank (Flannery) O'Connor who is interviewed by Walter Kerr, drama critic with the New York Herald Tribune. O'Connor discusses the difference between the short story and the novel and declares his dislike for the \"mood\" short story. He sees a need for a strong narrative impulse in the short story and ends the interview by reciting an extract from his own highly amusing short story, \"First Confession\"."
