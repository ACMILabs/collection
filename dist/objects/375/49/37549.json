        "If there were such a thing, Les Murray would be the Poet Laureate of Australia. In this amusing, lyrical documentary, Don Featherstone has succeeded in capturing the essence of one of our finest poets, a man totally at home in the country round Bunyah N.S.W., farming for a living and writing poems. Interviews with the endearing Les Murray are interspersed with readings of his poems set to suitably beautiful images of the area and people which inspired them. Winner of the Gold Plaque, Chicago International Film Festival 1991."
