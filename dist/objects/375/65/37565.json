        "The Marx Brothers are penniless Broadway producers, living in a hotel, who are planning a new stage show and are waiting for the finance to come through. As their hotel room becomes packed by members of the cast and the hotel bill escalates, the Marx Brothers devise a number of schemes to avoid eviction by the hotel's management. Also stars Lucille Ball."
