        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Writers of today\". A reissue of a program made in the 50's for the Educational Television & Radio Center in the United States. Playwright, Arthur Miller, (\"The Crucible\", \"Death of a salesman\", \"From the bridge\") is interviewed by Walter Kerr, drama critic with the New York Herald Tribune. Miller explains his views on live theatre, the need he sees for drama which transcends classes and communicates with all levels of society, and his abhorrence for obscure \"literary\" drama."
