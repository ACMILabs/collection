        "Contemporary South London, with its mixture of races, classes and subcultures is the setting for this engaging film written by Hanif Kureishi. Omar is a young Anglo-Asian man on the make who is taken under the wing of his materialistic, and benevolently corrupt, Uncle Nasser. Omar is given a rundown laundromat to manage and he enlists an old school friend, Johnny, who has joined the National Front out of boredom, to help him run the business. Omar and Johnny begin a sexual relationship while around them friends and family try to get by as best they can in the divided society of Thatcherite Britain. One of the most joyous and insightful English films of the eighties. With Daniel Day Lewis, Saeed Jaffrey and Roshan Seth."
