        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Warriors\". This program examines the impact of the Vietnam War on three Australian ex-servicemen, a Vietnamese student and a Cambodian refugee. Brian Day, a member of the Australian Regular Army for 21 years, believed the Army was an honourable profession, but his experiences in Vietnam and afterwards in Australia, have disillusioned him. He now works for the Australia-Vietnam Society and is suffering from the effects of chemical defoliants. Greg Lockhart served in the Australian Embassy in Saigon and has since devoted himself to Vietnamese history. He is married to Monique Hoa Phan, a Vietnamese student stranded in Australia after the fall of Saigon. The program also includes extensive interviews with an Aboriginal serviceman now working for the rights of his own people in Alice Springs and Cambodian, An Veng, who now lives in Australia but who served as driver and sound recordist for Australian war journalist, Neil Davis, during the Vietnam War."
