        "Episode of Series \"Warriors\". The story of Sparrow Force, the Australian 2/2 Independent Company, a specially trained troop of Australian soldiers sent to join Dutch forces in Timor in 1941, to defend Northern Australia against the Japanese advance. The program uses interviews with surviving Company members, as well as their Japanese opponents, mixed with re-enactments of their experiences. The interviews reveal that without the selfless assistance of the Timorese, the Australian troops would not have survived. The program also features footage shot by Academy Award winning Australian news cameraman, Damien Parer, who was killed in action in New Guinea."
