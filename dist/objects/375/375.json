        "A quietly humurous 3D computer animation set in the quiet after hours of a flightless bird museum. The stationary bird exhibits slowly come to life. One skeleton in waking, a pre-historic flightless bird, dreams of flying and is by ironic twist of fate, flung across the room to land on an aeroplane model. His flight, ironically, is short lived when both the flightless bird and the airplane crash together to the ground."
