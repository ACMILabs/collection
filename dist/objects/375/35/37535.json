        "In \"Training for work\" advice is given to sole parents who are thinking of rejoining the workforce. Particular attention is paid to the need for adequate childcare and retraining opportunities. The second episode \"Driving safely\" warns against irresponsible driving behaviour, especially drink- driving and speeding. In \"Making job decisions\" we follow young people making choices about the work they would like to do, as well as established workers attempting to retrain for different careers."
