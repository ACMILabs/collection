        "The very first Act passed by Australia's first parliament was a law to exclude non-white races from Australia. \"Admission impossible\" is the true story of the behind-the-scenes political forces and propaganda that created the infamous White Australia Policy which was enforced until 1972. Eyewitness accounts and recently discovered confidential documents reveal how immigration officers carried out racial selectivity to discriminate against Asians, Jews and non-European applicants. The last part of the program discusses the impact the Vietnam War had on the reversal of this policy."
