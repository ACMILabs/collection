        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Race to save the planet\". A series of case studies which show how fossil fuels can either be used more efficiently or replaced altogether by alternative energy sources. The program stresses, however, that unless the alternatives are shown to be economically advantageous, no matter how environmentally desirable renewable energy sources are, they will not replace fossil fuels in the near future. Teacher's notes accompany the video."
