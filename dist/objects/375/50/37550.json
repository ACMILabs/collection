        "Koalas today are a species in trouble, threatened with extinction as the Australian suburbs spread. They are extremely vulnerable because they are dependent on eucalyptus forest and must feed on gum leaves for an average of five hours per day in order to survive. This film takes a dramatic and often amusing look at the plight facing this extraordinary animal and the lengths to which some people will go in order to help. If you think koalas are cute and cuddly animals who just sit round eating gum leaves all day, this film will surprise you."
