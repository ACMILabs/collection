        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Top end\". In the late nineteenth century there were six times as many Chinese as Europeans in the Northern Territory and even now Australians of Chinese descent make up a large portion of the population. These third generation Australians are now making efforts to teach Chinese culture and language before it is lost completely. Integration of the Chinese in the Territory has been relatively painless and several Chinese Australians, including Darwin's first Chinese Lord Mayor, talk about this and their mixed national identity."
