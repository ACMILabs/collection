        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". This program looks at artists and political protest, using as a focus the exhibition \"Towers of torture\" held at Sydney University's Tin Shed Gallery in 1988. Artists, including Bernard Smith, Ruth Waller, Clem Milward, Bruce Petty and George Gittoes had been asked to contribute works which protested Alan Bond's involvement with the Pinochet regime. As well as discussing the specific issue of Chile, Professor Bernard Smith and art critic Charles Merewether discuss the role of the artist in social and political protest, with particular reference to Australian art."
