        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Inspired by an exhibition of the same name held at Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney 1988 and organised by the Bicentennial Committee, NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, this video portrays the history of the Jews in Australia from those who arrived on the First Fleet to the Jewish immigrants from Russia of the present day. Interviews with representatives of the Jewish community highlight the differences which still exist within the community which yet retains a distinctively Jewish character."
