        "Episode of Series \"My Sesame Street Home Video\". Children need to know that everything about them is special and unique - their bodies and how they look, what they think and what they feel. Big Bird, Bert, Ernie and their Sesame Street friends encourage children to identify parts of their own bodies, and to develop a sense of pride and self-esteem."
