        "Since the death of their parents, Mary Blair and her little sister Elizabeth have been inmates of a private orphanage. Mary promised her dying mother that she and Elizabeth, nicknamed \"Curly Top\" would never be separated. With a natural talent for singing and dancing Curly Top is a mischievous yet appealing child. Elizabeth gets into trouble during a visit of the trustees, one of them, a playboy bachelor is taken with her and decides to adopt her. The bachelor soon discovers Mary is part of the 'deal' and this leads to some embarrassing and often funny predicaments. Stars Shirley Temple, John Boles, Rochelle Hudson and Jane Darwell."
