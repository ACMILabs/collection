        "A magical blend of live-acting and animation that comes off brilliantly due to the super effort by Bob Hoskins in playing to imaginary \"co-stars\" who were drawn in later. Hoskins plays Eddie Valiant, a has-been gumshoe in the '40's film noir mould who comes out of a self enforced \"retirement.\" Someone is out to steal Toon Town from the cartoon characters who inhabit the magical land. To get their hands on the valuable property they frame its biggest star, Roger Rabbit for murder. Detective Valiant must solve the case and save the toons. Co-starring Christopher Lloyd, Joanna Cassidy, Stubby Kaye and Charles Fleisher."
