        "Bette Davis plays Charlotte Hollis, a reclusive spinster still mourning the savage murder of the man she loved 37 years ago. When the state wants Charlotte's grand property to construct a new highway, she turns to her cousin Miriam (Olivia de Havilland) and an old friend, Drew (Joseph Cotton) to help her resist. What follows is a series of chilling scares and shocks. Also stars Agnes Moorehead."
