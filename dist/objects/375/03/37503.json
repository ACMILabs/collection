        "At the end of World War II, 14,000 Australians were released from Japanese POW camps in Asia. 8,000 of their comrades had died in the same camps and many of the survivors released were virtual walking skeletons. In this program, survivors of the camps (including Nurse Vivian Bullwinkel) describe their experiences during the war and the effect it has had on their lives and their families. Even now, decades later, they still fight the memories of the brutality, starvation, disease and trauma to which they were subjected."
