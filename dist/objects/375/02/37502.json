        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Top end\". Steve is a Hungarian chef who gave up being a chef to become a cook in a mining camp in the Northern Territory, and liked the life so much that he became a prospector for gold. Now retired, he lives with his wife Essie on the Pine Creek goldfield, two hours south of Darwin. The program explores the history of the goldfield and the town of Spring Hill which, with the advent of new technology, is now undergoing a revival."
