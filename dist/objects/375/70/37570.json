        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Race to save the planet\". This program examines the possibility that this generation may preside over a biological mass extinction of half the species on earth today. It addresses the delicate balance of protecting life's diversity whilst managing the needs of growing human populations. Examples are taken from Kenya, United States, Thailand, Oman and Costa Rica. Narrated by Karina Kelly. Teacher's notes accompany the video."
