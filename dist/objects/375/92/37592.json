        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Visual instincts : Australian contemporary photographers\". Two thirty minute programs: 1. \"Grant Mudford\" Born in Australia in 1944, photographer, Grant Mudford, now lives and works in California. He prefers anonymous architectural subject matter photographed in a manner that transforms it. 2. \"Max Pam\" Born in Melbourne, Max Pam left at age 19 for Katmandu. He returned to Australia in 1984 having established an international reputation as a photographer of Asia. Photography, for Pam, has the capacity to capture certain moments which elude the writer, the filmmaker or the painter."
