        "Everyone is preparing for Christmas on Sesame Street when Oscar the Grouch asks his friend Big Bird to explain how Santa Claus \"who is built like a dump truck\" gets down all those skinny little chimneys. Big Bird, with the help of all his Sesame Street friends, tries to solve the Santa Claus riddle and finds that the true miracle of Christmas is in the loving and sharing between friends. Features Jim Henson's Sesame Street Muppets and the Sesame Street live cast."
