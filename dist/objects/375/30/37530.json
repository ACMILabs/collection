        "Going through a job interview is a nerve-racking experience for most of us. This video teaches you the skills needed to present yourself well and win a tough job interview. Over a dozen common interview situations are re-enacted in a dramatic and often humorous way to show you how not to proceed as well as how to impress your interviewer, from the moment you arrive to the moment the interview is closed."
