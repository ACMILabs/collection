        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Talking about Aboriginal art\". The images by the four Aboriginal women artists in this video program challenge old steroetypes that have seen the artistic activities of Aboriginal women as limited to crafts and body decoration. They use media techniques with which Western artists are familiar but the imagery is distinctively their own revealing the artist's Aboriginality, whether she lives in a tradition-oriented community or an urban environment. Banduk Marika produces linocuts and fabric designs often involving stories from her clan group. Fiona Foley works in a variety of contemporary media to produce work about her history and against popular stereotypes of Aboriginal people. Bronwyn Bancroft is known for her fabrics, fashion designs and paintings utilizing images of her family and Koori heritage. Euphemia Bostock has helped bring international attention to Koorie fashion design and art through her teaching and practice."
