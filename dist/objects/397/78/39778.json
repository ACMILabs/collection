        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Gardens of the world\". The vast, colourful bulb fields of our host audrey Hepburn's native Holland are only a small part of a complex cultural phenomenon. Here bulbs are intertwined with the history and art of an entire country. The transformation from sleeping bulb to elegant bloom is miraculous. Narcissus, hyacinth, muscari and bluebells share the stage with the favourite, the tulip, for a grand tour of the spectacular Kreukenhof in Holland and Chenics Manor, in England and more. Hosted by Audrey Hepburn and narrated by Michael York."
