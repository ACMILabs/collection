        "Set in Nevada 1959, Helen Shaver is Vivian Bell, a repressed college professor from New York who arrives at a ranch in Reno for a temporary stay to obtain a divorce. Anticipating a quiet stay reading and preparing for the academic year she finds herself distracted and drawn to the ranch owner's fiery step-daughter Cay Rivvers (Patricia Charbonneau). As their friendship develops and Vivian's restrained and latent passion is unleashed, their lesbian relationship becomes an act of defiance against the accepted rules of society. The memorable soundtrack includes songs by Patsy Cline and other performers of the late 50's. Based on the novel \"Desert of the Heart\" by Jane Rule."
