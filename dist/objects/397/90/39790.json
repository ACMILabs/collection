        "The archetypal \"Baby Boomers\" movie of the 80's which focuses on a group of college friends from the 60's who have exchanged their radical ideals for Mercedes' and \"Yuppiedom\". In coming together at the funeral of one of their group, they strive to regain touch, not only with one another but with themselves. What follows is a weekend of drugs, sex, a re-examination of their anti-establishment days and a reconcilation of their past with their present. \"In a cool world you need your friends to keep you warm.\" This film will remain a nostalgic favourite. It features a great soundtrack and an early screen appearance by Kevin Costner as the corpse. Stars Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, Meg Tilly and Jobeth Williams."
