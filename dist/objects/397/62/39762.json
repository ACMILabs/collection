        "Episode of Series \"Cooking at the Academy\". Fill your kitchen with the tantalizing aromas of \"Chicken Portugese\", Phillipine-style \"Pork Adobo\" or a hearty \"Sauerbraten\". The time-honoured methods of braising and stewing turn inexpensive cuts into exotic main dishes. Among other savoury tips is included how to truss a rump roast, master a flavourful marinade and make a traditional German sauce spiced with gingersnaps."
