        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Talking about Aboriginal art\". While the three artists in this video cannot speak for all city-based Aboriginal artists, they raise issues central to the art-making of urban Aboriginals and the problems and controversies surrounding such art. They discuss issues of identity, their views on differences between black and white Australians and social issues of concern to their communities. Michael Riley has a growing reputation as a photographer and film maker, portraying the myths and misconceptions of Aboriginality. Trevor Nickolls has developed a strong iconography in his paintings which attempt to reconcile his black and white heritage. Jeffrey Samuels portrays his cultural heritage through his paintings using contemporary techniques, reflecting on stereotypes, tradition and nature."
