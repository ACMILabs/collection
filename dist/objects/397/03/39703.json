        "In another of Kipling's fanciful \"Just so stories\", a Parsee man, through his special magic, seeks revenge on a nasty, piggish rhino and we discover how the rhinoceros got his skin. The next tale involves an \"excruciatin'- idle\" camel who refuses to work. A desert spirit teaches him a lesson about laziness and gives the camel his well deserved \"humph\". Narrated by Jack Nicholson."
