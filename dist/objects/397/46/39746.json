        "There's the war-toughened sergeant who passionately longs to train soldiers for fighting in Vietnam, but is assigned to the elite Old Guard. His beautiful girlfriend, a Washington Post reporter who is fervently against the war. The zealous soldier that the sergeant takes under his wing, and the young woman who learns the pain of being an army wife. Their stories are poignantly told in Francis Coppola's perceptive and moving film that stars James Caan, Angelica Huston, James Earl Jones and Mary Stuart Masterson. This film takes a different look at the Vietnam war era in the United States. It is a drama that captures the anguishing effect of the war on the relationships of the men and women at home. Based on the novel by Nicholas Proffitt. Original music by Carmine Coppola."
