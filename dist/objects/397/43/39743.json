        "A movie about the craziest, most lovable teenagers to come out of Liverpool since the Beatles. It's a fairytale full of edgy cynical realism. It's a love story and an adventure with a rock 'n' roll soundtrack. It's a movie about inner-city decay, the frustration of unemployment and people desperate for change - any change. This film has gathered an impressive array of awards and critical praise but its most impressive achievement is evident by its popularity amongst audiences. Starring Peter Firth and features music from Bronski Beat."
