        "Tornatore's loving homage to the world of movies. A celebration of cinema - its mystery, its fascination and its capacity to make us laugh, cry and dream. Through the eyes of the adult Toto, we relive his childhood and adolescence in the small Sicilian village of Giancaldo, and especially his relationship with Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) the Cinema Paradiso's gentle and wise old projectionist. Hidden together high up in the projection box, they grow to share a special love of movies that outlives Toto's rocky path to manhood. Hailed worldwide by critics and the public alike, this film is a glowingly warm tribute to the innocence of childhood, the anguish of first love and the emotional power of the cinema. English subtitles."
