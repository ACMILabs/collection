        "This program examines some of the most important issues facing people living with HIV and contains interviews with people who are HIV positive. It focuses on the availability of drugs for HIV patients, and the lack of action and apathy shown by Australian governments. It also explores the outlook on life of the interviewees, how the stigma of AIDS, the death of friends and loved ones has affected them and finally examines their attitudes to death and dying."
