        "The \"hullaballo\" in question is a leisurely, but fiercely determined race for possession of a priceless collection of rare Indian pictures. It's enlivened by a romp through royal India...a world of princes, palaces, tourists, precious art objects and their wheelers and dealers... but more than this, the film gives us rare insight into the lasting values of life. The films boasts a wonderful screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabuala. Stars Peggy Ashcroft."
