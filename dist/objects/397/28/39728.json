        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Talking about Aboriginal art\". In recent decades Aboriginal art has increasingly been destined for art museums and major private collections. It has not been totally subsumed into the Western art dealer and museum system, but has made curators and art historians ask some profound questions about their practices and policies of collecting and exhibiting art. One concern is the involvement of non- Aboriginal curators and art advisers, with many believing they occupy positions which would be more appropriately held by Aboriginal people. Curators Djon Mundine, Wally Caruana and Peter Sutton discuss gallery collecting policies, major exhibitions and key issues in the criticism of contemporary Aboriginal art."
