        "The witch and the rainbow cat is the story of Rose, a young girl on an outing to the country with her parents. Rose enters a mysterious wood in which she discovers a strange little house full of bric-a-brac and curiosities. A stuffed cat watches her as she sees her reflection in a mirror which shows her what she will look like in the future. When the owner of the house arrives - a wizened old witch - she is told that she will have to be the witch's servant for the rest of her life. The stuffed cat comes to life and offers to help Rose if she can solve a riddle. She manages to escape and rejoins her parents who laugh at her story. \"The sea tiger\" is the story of a tiger who tells the most outrageous lies and how his animal friends in the jungle try to put a stop to it. This video also includes the song \"Think before you speak\", written by Neil Innes."
