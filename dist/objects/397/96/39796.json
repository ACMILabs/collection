        "In response to poor sales figures, a consulting salesman offers an incentive to a group of Chicago real-estate salesmen. The agent with the most sales at the end of the month wins a Cadillac, second prize is a set of steak knives, third prize is the sack!! Now more than ever the pressure is on to perform and the salesmen are desperate to do anything to hold on to their jobs... even robbery, extortion and embezzlement. David Mamet's moving screenplay (based on his play) focuses on the dilemmas of the various salesmen desperate to keep their jobs who sustain themselves by reliving past glories. Stars an ensemble of fine actors including Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris and Alan Arkin."
