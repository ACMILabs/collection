        "Edward James Olmos gives a widely-acclaimed performance as Jaime Escalante, a dedicated Maths teacher at a Los Angeles high school where most of the inner-city students are underachievers and come from poor Latin American families. Escalante refuses to see them as losers and cajoles, pushes and inspires his class to become Maths wizards and to pass a national exam which no student of the school has ever passed before. With Lou Diamond Phillips and Andy Garcia."
