        "Narrated by Jessica Tandy, this visually stunning documentary shows phenomenal encounters never before captured on film. Whales are enormous, powerful creatures with extraordinary grace and intelligence. They are masters of a watery realm where they have existed for more than 30 million years. Filmed in 15 locations off the coasts of five continents, this affords a comprehensive look at whales (Blue, Sperm, Right, Beluga, Bottle-nosed whale and their small relatives the dolphin) and their environment. Guided by one of the world's leading Cetacean experts, Dr. Roger Payne, a team of underwater cameramen reveal the mysteries of whale song, their sophisticated navigation techniques, their remarkable intelligence and affectionate social behaviour emphasising that they really are the gentle giants of the deep."
