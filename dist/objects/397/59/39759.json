        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". Hywel Bennett narrates this documentary about the wolves who inhabit remote regions of Spain and their fight for survival in the face of hostility from Spanish villagers, whose sheep they kill for food. Once the most widely distributed mammal in Europe, man's hatred of these animals has led to their destruction in nearly all countries, and unless the regional governments of Spain provide a solution the wolf may once again be subject to indiscriminate hunting and poisoning."
