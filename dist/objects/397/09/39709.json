        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". For thousands of years the European Crane has travelled an incredible 2500 miles from its winter home in Spain to its breeding grounds in Northern Scandinavia. Radical changes however have come in recent times to the land across which it flies. The European wetlands, where the birds rest and refuel, are disappearing fast as they are drained for agriculture. Forests are being felled. The pressure of hunting continues. In Sweden alone, where the birds perform their spectacular courtship dance, are adequate conservation efforts being made to preserve the areas they need to survive. Since classical times the echoing call of the crane has been a sign of the changing seasons. Today it may be a message of warning alerting us to the dangers of these changes to the environment."
