        "Episode of Series \"The Storybook classics\". Two of the most loved children's stories are brought to life with wonderful drawings, excellent narration by Danny Glover, and music by Taj Mahal and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Brer Rabbit tries to outsmart wily Brer Fox who has captured him by the use of a tar baby. Brer Rabbit proves brains are better than muscle in this tale by Uncle Remus. Rudyard Kipling's story tells how the leopard, who was once spotless, was forced to follow his prey down into the striped, splotchy spotted forest. In order to live, he had to transform his own bright brown and yellow skin."
