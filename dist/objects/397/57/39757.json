        "Alan Parker's tale of an Irish working class band's odyssey is a strident belt-you-in-the-mouth delight. On a mission to bring soul to Dublin plus fame and fortune for himself, Jimmy Rabbitte transforms a motley bunch of misfits and raw talent into 'the hardest working band in the world', THE COMMITMENTS, billing them as the 'saviours of Soul'. Based on the cult novel by Roddy Doyle and set to a scorching soul soundtrack. This film pulsates with raw energy, colourful dialogue, working class struggles and big time dreams - it's a knockout."
