        "An explosive contemporary thriller starring Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. Fonda is cast as a news reporter who covers a story on nuclear energy and films a startling and controversial 'incident'. Lemmon is a veteran engineer whose integrity makes him a target for murder. Douglas is a newsreel cameraman determined to discover what his film footage, which the station refuses to air, really means. The China Syndrome is acknowledged as one of the best made films dealing with such highly controversial subject matter."
