        "Matteo Scuri (Marcello Mastroianni) is a gentle warm-hearted widower and the proudest father of all in Italy. With his five children all successes in their own right, Matteo can't help but boast about them to everyone he meets - including strangers! For years his children, scattered throughout Italy, have paid an annual visit on his birthday. But this year, they are unable to make it. Disappointed and feeling a little lost, Matteo decides to pay his children a surprise visit, and reunite them all for another family celebration. As he crosses a noisy and crazy country, the trip becomes a revelation as he discovers the real lives of the children he thought he knew. A chronicle of one man's haunting journey of discovery, this film touches all emotions - a truly captivating cinematic experience from director Giuseppe Tornatore. English subtitles."
