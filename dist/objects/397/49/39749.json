        "Death is yellow and smells of vanilla pronounces Antoine, the protagonist of this sunny and optimistic film in which even something sombre is imagined as radiant and sweet. Photographed in glowing primary colours, with some scenes shot in slight slow-motion, this study of male erotic obsession is a lazy, dreamy film about nothing more than a state of being - happiness. Cocooned in their little one-roomed store, Antoine and Mathilde, his luminous wife are sufficient to themselves. Two wonderful performances from Jean Rochefort and Anna Galiena are complemented by the Arab music Antoine loves and original music by Michael Nyman."
