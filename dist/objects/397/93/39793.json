        "It is the early fifties and with a suitcase full of songs and hearts full of passion, two brothers leave Cuba and come to America in search of their Dream. They start a band and play the Mambo, Samba and Cha-cha in a nightclub every night. This is the story of their quest for show business fame based on the Pulitzer Prize winning \"The Mambo Kings play Songs of Love\" by Oscar Hjuelos. This film abounds with exciting Latin American music and fascinating footage of the \"I Love Lucy\" show is matched with footage of the brothers when their big break arrives. Stars Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas."
