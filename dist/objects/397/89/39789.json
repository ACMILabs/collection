        "Two children, Rosetta and Giusseppe are victims of a child prostitution ring. After their mother is arrested, they are taken by Antonio the Carabiniere from the North to the South of Italy, looking for an orphanage that will take the children. The children have learned to trust no-one, not even each other, yet this journey with Antonio begins to break down the barriers that the children have always had to maintain. This very special, rewarding film was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival and has been universally hailed as one of the finest Italian films released in many years. Stars Enrico Lo Verso, Valentina Scalici and Giuseppe Ieracitano."
