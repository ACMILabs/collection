        "Tony and Brenda Last (James Wilby and Kristin Scott Thomas) appear to be the perfect married ccouple - with money, position, a great country house and an adored son, John Andrew. When Tony inadvertently invites John Beaver (Rupert Graves), an idle and penniless young socialite, to stay for the weekend, he sets in motion a series of events which drastically disrupts the course of all their lives. Brenda drifts into an affair with the worthless Mr. Beaver, with disastrous consequences, particularly for Tony, who remains unaware of Brenda's betrayal until the tragic death of their young son. As Brenda leaves home to take up a precarious life with her lover in London. Tony sets sail with an eccentric explorer on an expedition to the South American rain forests. Lost in the jungle and stricken by fever, Tony is rescued from death by the eccentric half-caste Mr. Todd (Alec Guinness) with unexpected and sinister results."
