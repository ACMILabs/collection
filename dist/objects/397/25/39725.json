        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Talking about Aboriginal art\". In the past two decades Aboriginal art has flourished and diversified to a phenomenal extent. A many-faceted art movement has developed, with artists from communities all around Australia contributing fresh visions. Critics and the general public are excited by its inventiveness and aesthetic appeal. Its difference from traditional Aboriginal art has caused much controversy. Hetti Perkins introduces contemporary Aboriginal art, its themes and the issues. Geoff Bardon gives a personal account of the beginnings of the Papunya painting movement when he encouraged senior men to paint their Dreaming Stories in acrylics. Michael Nelson Jakamarra, recognized internationally as one of the outstanding artists from the Papuya central desert community, talks about his country and his art."
