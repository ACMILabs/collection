        "Episode of Series \"Cooking at the Academy\". Discover the pleasure of home-made soups with Chef Ian Algeroen. Nutritious, satisfying and easy to make in advance, soups are infinitely versatile - ranging from delicate first courses to hearty main-dish chowders. Start with creamy, aromatic Four Onion Soup. Then try contemporary Grilled Corn Chowder and refreshing Grilled Vegetable Gazpacho, the chilled \"garden soup\" of Spain. Each is a lesson in combining techniques and ingredients to produce rich flavours, pleasing textures and tempting presentations."
