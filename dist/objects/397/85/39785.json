        "Simple recipes garnished with humour and a smattering of hints and tips are demonstrated by Peter Doyle of the Sydney restaurant family. He shows you everything you need to know about how to make delicious seafood meals, including how to cook a fish in your dishwasher. The video is accompanied by a recipe booklet which also includes charts which show you which fish to substitute for another, and when particular fish are in season. The video is also time coded so that you can find the recipe you want, quickly and easily."
