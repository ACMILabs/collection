        "Based on the novel by Kurt Vonnegut, an American P.O.W. is slipping into mental illness. Now a suburban optometrist, he has space/time fantasies, shifting between his experiences as a POW, including the bombing of Dresden, his life on another planet and his actual life. Michael Sacks plays Billy Pilgrim in a film shot in Czechoslovakia and Minnesota, which captures the complexity of Vonnegut's work, and the despair of mental illness"
