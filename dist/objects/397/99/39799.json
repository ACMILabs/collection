        "A follow uo to his comedy film \"A Taxing woman\", Itami satirises the collapse of traditional values in Japan since World War II. Ryoko Hakura, the resourceful tax inspector inspired by the american \"Colombo\", takes on the financial labyrinthe constructed by a jaded leader of a fraudulent religious cult collaborating with politicians, banks, big business; all held together by organised crime. This is a world peopled with \"off-centre\" characters who possess a gammut of short comings, cleverly satirised. The pace of the film is frantic; the plot, an intricate blend of comedy and action."
