        "Episode of Series \"Videos on Australian Writers: archival writers series II\". Elizabeth Riddell came to Australia from New Zealand when she was eighteen. She recalls the community of artists and writers in Sydney in the 1930's and her early experiences as a journalist. During the Second World War Riddell reported from North America and travelled through Europe. On her return to Australia, her long autobiographical poem was published. Riddell discusses the conflict between the demands of her career and her desire to write poetry. She speaks about the discipline of writing and the state of contemporary Australian literature."
