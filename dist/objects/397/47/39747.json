        "Jack Nicholson stars as Charley Partanna an aging hit-man for a powerful Mafia family, the Prizzis. He meets and falls in love with Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) the widow of his latest victim, masquerading as a tax consultant. When he discovers that Irene is a hired killer and has cheated his own Mafia family, his loyalties are painfully divided. To complicate matters, Maerose Prizzi, (Anjelica Huston in an Academy Award winning performance for Best Supporting Actress), the black sheep of the powerful clan, harbors a lost love for Charley and manoeuvers the plot of this tragic-comedy in insidious ways. Based on the novel by Richard Condon."
