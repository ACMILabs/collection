        "A Monty Python splinter faction is responsible for this medieval farce of hysterical proportions. Based on the Lewis Carroll play of the same name, the monster of the title doesn't appear until the final minutes but it is worth the wait as it is a work of inspired dark imagination. Set in the Middle Ages in England, Michael Palin plays a bumpkin son of a country cooper who goes to the city to seek his fortune after the death of his father. The land in which he lives is terrorised by the monster who attacks travellers who pass through it's forest. Palin becomes the inadvertent hero, chosen to slay the monster and win the hand of the fair princess. Full of dark humour and even darker ambience, this is not a film for the squeamish!"
