        "Set in Las Vegas at the time of the first atom bomb tests in 1951, this powerful drama examines the life of a struggling middle-class Nevada family, seen through the eyes of 13 year old Rose Chismore (Annabeth Gish). Finding life difficult with her war-scarred father (Jon Voight), Rose forms a close bond with her flamboyant Aunt Starr (Ellen Barkin) whose friendship comes at a critical time."
