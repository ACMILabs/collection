        "Rare film footage of Walt Disney introduces the long and charming life of the greatest cartoon character of them all - Mickey Mouse. Mickey started life as Mortimer, but the name just didn't seem to fit! Instead, he became Mickey Mouse for his show business premiere on November 18, 1928. Mickey's screen debut was in the first animated cartoon to feature synchronised sound: \"Steamboat Willie\". In addition to Mickey's first film role, this collection also includes some of his greatest adventures highlighted in a career that has spanned over 55 years. Titles include \"Steamboat Willie\", \"Mickey's grand opera\" and \"Symphony hour\", all classics in their own right."
