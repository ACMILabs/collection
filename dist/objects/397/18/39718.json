        "Filmed in the remote Pilbara region in far north Western Australia this is a moving revelation of the struggle of women who are trying to create a life for themselves in the hostile environment of outback iron ore mining towns. \"Time goes very slowly\" deals with the problems of isolation and unemployment for women in Newman. \"It's not a community anymore\" tells of the ongoing effects of the bitter 1986 Robe River industrial dispute upon families in the town of Wickham. \"It's supposed to be a town\" explores racism through the eyes of both the black and white women of Newman."
