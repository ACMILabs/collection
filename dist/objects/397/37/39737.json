        "Set in an Army barracks in 1965, a group of young soldiers wait assignment to Vietnam. The draftees come from diverse backgrounds: two are afro-americans, one a country boy and the other a Yale-educated homosexual. They are confronted by two brutal ex-Korean war veteran sergeants. Sexual and racial tensions build as the men wait in their claustrophobic barracks but eventually shocking violence erupts. The barracks is a microcosm of the explosive emotions and issues which surfaced in America at that time, however the theatrical nature of the original material, (based on a play by David Rabe) is reflected in a static production which is more stagebound than fluid. The performances, especially by Matthew Modine, Michael Wright and George Dzundza are superb."
