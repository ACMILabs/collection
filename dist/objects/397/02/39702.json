        "Set in France in 1958, a boy is reluctantly sent to the country to stay with relatives. The boy's guardians are the rough, alcoholic and violent carpenter called Pelo, and his gallant, fatalistic, protective wife Marcelle. Their broken marriage means that each reacts to the child differently; to Pelo, he is a surrogate son and to Marcelle, he is an outlet for her maternal instincts."
