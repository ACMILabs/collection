        "Brilliant, enigmatic, beloved, Charlie Chaplin made more people laugh than anyone else in history. His story and the story of filmmaking - inextricably linked together - are brought to the screen in Richard Attenborough's modern masterpiece. This truly magnificent film starring one of the finest casts from the world of film including: Dan Aykroyd, Geraldine Chaplin, Anthony Hopkins, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Kline and James Woods. This is the story of how this master entertainer survived a deprived and tragic childhood and then transformed such poverty into humour which everyone, everywhere cherished."
