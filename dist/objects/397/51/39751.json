        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". Filming wildlife in exotic locations may sound like a glamourous occupation but, in fact, it is frequently fraught with danger and demands nerve and ice-cool courage. This film reveals the reality, following the trials, hardship, enjoyment and successes of award-winning cameraman Dieter Plage. In the course of his many assignments, Dieter has been run over by an elephant, charged at by a huge male gorilla and had a face-to-face encounter with a tiger. Whether home for several months is a tent in a jungle, a swamp on a mountainside or a remote tropical island, Deiter is always accompanied by his wife Mary who takes care of everything else, leaving her husband free to film his magnificent shots! Some of the unique sequences shown include Rangers rounding up elephants, relocating endangered antelopes and warthogs chasing cheetas!"
