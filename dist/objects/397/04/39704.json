        "Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni appear in three separate stories. In the first, Adelina (Loren) is a blackmarket slum marketeer who remains permanently pregnant in order to escape a jail sentence, much to the consternation of her exhausted husband (Mastroianni). In the second, Anna, the elegant wife of a rich Milan industrialist, meets her lover for a secret rendezvous. In the third, Mara is a call girl having an affair with a Bologna playboy. Saucy entertainment from two of the best actors to come out of Italy, this film confirmed Loren's and Mastroianni's success as international sex symbols. Dubbed in English."
