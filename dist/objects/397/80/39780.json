        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Gardens of the world\". Perhaps no garden in the world exhibits a more exhilirating use of flowers than Claude Monet's garden at Giverny. Monet's exuberant palette of colours strikingly contrasts with the grace and elegance of the classic perennial borders found at Tintinhull House in Somerset, England. The native flora of America's southeast further illustrate the range of aesthetics and pleasure found in the world's most beautiful flower gardens. Hosted by Audrey Hepburn and narrated by Michael York."
