        "Angelo, who is from a rich family in Bologna, is engaged to the very beautiful Silvia who is the daughter of peasants in the Italian countryside. To celebrate the engagement, Angelo and Silvia's families are to come together for a grand lunch at the home of her parents. As the wine flows and the sumptious meal is consumed, family secrets and resentments come to the surface and threaten the young couple's happiness. Set in the thirties, the rigid codes which govern peasant life are already beginning to become undone: Mussolini is beginning his ascendancy; the dictates of family honour and fidelity are being defied; the centuries old division between poor and the rich is being questioned. But for Angelo and Silvia, caught up in the passion of their love, everything else is secondary. Charming, comic and beautifully filmed \"A Story of Boys and Girls\" is a rewarding film about the ties of love, family and honour; a film about the last moment in a young nation's life where it knew peace before the advent of a World War which would tear it apart."
