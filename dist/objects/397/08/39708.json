        "This is a fascinating, largely successful adaptation of John Irving's 1981 novel of the same name. The tale concerns an eccentric New England family that, spurred on by an ever-searching father, establishes a new hotel in locale after locale which mutates in the process. It is a bizarre and whimsical tale starring Rob Lowe and Jodie Foster in the role of brother and sister and Natassja Kinski as a girl so insecure that she hides most of the time inside an enormous bear suit."
