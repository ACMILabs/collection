        "On a continent distinguished for its unique mixture of climates and for its exotic wildlife, there is no state that provides more variety and contrast than Victoria. Occupying the south-east corner of Australia, and only slightly larger than the size of Great Britain, Victoria has something for everybody. This video takes you on a remarkable tour of the state of Victoria which includes the wilderness areas of its world famous national parks, some of the best surf beaches in the world, Australia's largest inland lagoon system, a rugged shipwrecked coast, winter resorts and high country, wetlands and even deserts. Also the vibrant and sophisticated city of Melbourne, renowned for its beautiful parks and gardens, exciting restaurants and nightlife, its devotion to the arts and, of course, a fanatical love of sports of all kinds. This superb video is a comprehensive celebration of this wonderful state, in all its beauty, seasons and moods."
