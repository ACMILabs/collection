        "A sadistic headmaster at a private boy's school is murdered by his long suffering wife and his brutalised mistress (Simone Signoret). But when the two women return to the school and pretend no knowledge of the headmaster's disappearance they are unsettled by the schoolboys' sightings of his \"ghost\". Clouzot's famous horror film is imbued with a dark, malevolent atmosphere and perversity seems to lurk behind every corner. On its release the film was justly celebrated as an innovative contribution to horror filmmaking, and though much of Clouzot's staging has been copied by subsequent generations of horror filmmakers, few have managed to equal the chilling power of the original. Based on the book \"Celle qui N'Etait Plus\" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac (who also wrote \"Vertigo\")."
