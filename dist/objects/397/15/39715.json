        "Tommy and Ruth are two young friends living in a declining fishing community. Whilst Ruth loves the sea, Tommy would rather be pursuing his passions of painting, drawing and studying the lives of the great painters. His father, alarmed at the direction of his obsessions, exerts pressures on Tommy to join the family fishing business. During the holidays an old painter arrives to stay for the summer. His presence exerts a powerful influence on Tommy and changes the course of his life but not without a price."
