        "Crossing the Simpson Desert is one of the world's greatest motoring adventures. The Desert National Parks of South Australia also include Innamincka Reserve and Lake Eyre. You can get there via the Birdsville, Oodnadatta and Strezlecki Tracks. But it's rugged and isolated terrain. What if you break down? Where can you get fuel? Is it safe for the family? How much water to take? Where are the tracks? What spare parts to take? Where to get Park permits? This programme answers all these questions and more. Trip preparation, how to travel in safety, basic four-wheel drive techniques are all covered as the spectacular scenic highlights are shown and as you hear some colourful history and speak to the people that live and work there."
