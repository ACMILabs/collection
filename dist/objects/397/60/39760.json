        "Directed by internationally acclaimed Peter Weir, this charming comedy is based on a very real issue facing many foreigners in the United States today - the possibility of marrying an American citizen in order to obtain a \"greencard\" which allows them to live and work in America. Starring the big, lovable Depardieu, in his english-speaking film debut, as a French alien who wants to remain in the US, and MacDowell as a New York horticulturalist who desperately wants to rent an apartment with a greenhouse (the owners of which only want to rent to married couples). Through a mutual friend they meet and strike a deal - they'll get married so that each can have what they desire. They marry in a quick legal ceremony and then part company, only to find they must get to know one another and act as husband and wife when immigration officials begins snooping around."
