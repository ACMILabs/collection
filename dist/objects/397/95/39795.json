        "Father Brian (Tom Courtenay), a young Anglican priest, is unaware that he is dying of leukemia when he begins a mission into the majestic solitude of British Columbia. Sharing the joys and sorrows of a once proud Indian tribe, Father Brian learns enough of life to be ready to die, peacefully and with dignity. So when, on a cold and wintry evening he hears the owl call his name, he is prepared. In what is, without doubt, a simple yet powerful tale, Tom Courtenay's stunning performance as a man doomed to die, is both touching and dramatic. The film rates as one of those rare presentations that packs a dramatic wallop that is not easily forgotten. Based on Margaret Craven's novel of the same title."
