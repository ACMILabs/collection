        "Sovexportfilm Australia presents this historic feature length production made in 1953 and beautifully preserved. It is a compilation of three ballets, featuring both world famous Kirov and Bolshoi Ballets. The first of the three ballets is Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" with Galina Ulanova as the beautiful White Swan - Odette, and the outstanding Natalya Dudinskaya as the rivalling Black Swan - Odile. The second ballet is \"The Fountains of Bakchisarai\" based on the poem by Alexander Pushkin and starring the internationally acclaimed Maya Plisetskaya as the seductive Zarema and Galina Ulanova as the tragic Maria. The final ballet is \"The Flames of Paris\" the breathtaking tale of the French Revolution, with magnificent sets and costumes and one of the largest casts ever assembled for a ballet."
