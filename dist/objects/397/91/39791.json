        "A film of staggering scale and grandeur in which cattleman Bick Benedict (Rock Hudson), his society-gilded wife Leslie (Elizabeth Taylor) and three generations of land-rich Texas sons and daughters love, swagger, connive, and clash in a monumental drama of family strife, racial bigotry and conflict between cattle barons and newly-rich oil tycoons. George Stevens received his second Academy Award for Best Director and the film also received nine other Oscar nominations. James Dean's portrayal of the sulking, cackling wrangler Jett Rink is perhaps the most significant of the stellar performances because it was his very last. Also stars Mercedes McCambridge, Dennis Hopper and Sal Mineo. A truly unforgettable experience, \"Giant\" not only lives up to its name, but surpasses it by far. Based on the novel by Edna Ferber."
