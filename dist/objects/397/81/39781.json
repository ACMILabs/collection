        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Gardens of the world\". The pleasure of a country garden - heavy with smell, taste and touch - has captured the imagination of artists and poets for centuries. Audrey Hepburn explores several of the world's most beautiful country gardens, among them, the romantic Giardino del Ninfa, south of Rome; charming cottage gardens in England; the farmhouse gardens surrounding Chilcombe House in Dorset. Narrated by Michael York."
