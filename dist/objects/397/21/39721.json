        "A two part program about the life and works of Australian fiction writer, Gerald Murnane. Pt. 1. The imaginary and real world of Gerald Murnane (41 min.) The first part explores his imaginary world and presents images both of Murnane's childhood in Victoria during the 1940's and of his interests, particularly his obsession with horseracing. Pt. 2. The real and imaginary world of Gerald Murnane (45 min.) In the second part Murnane discusses his writing style and reads extracts from Tamarisk Row to show how he weaves his interests and obsessions into his work."
