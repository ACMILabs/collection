        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Gardens of the world\". Audrey Hepburn travels through the rich evolution of formal garden design in some of the world's most spectacular settings - from the Renaissance gardens of Italy, (Villa Gamberaia, Villa Lante, Villa La Pietra), the grand 17th century gardens of France, (Chateau de Courances, Versailles), to the lushly planted gardens of England, (Hidcote Manor, Tintinhull House). Narrated by Michael York."
