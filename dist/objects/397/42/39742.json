        "At last we get to see a teenager who doesn't \"have it all together\".. one whose attempts to be super cool give way to eagerness, hysterical shyness, clumsiness and woeful incompetence. Gregory (John Gordon Sinclair) suddenly discovers that \"playing the field\" doesn't necessarily mean keeping a wide cover on the football ground! His latest obsession is with the new girl on his soccer team, Dorothy (Dee Hepburn), but his schoolmates delightfully manoeuver him into giving the out-going Susan (Clare Grogan) a tumble."
