        "Mermaids are supposed to stay under the sea, but there was never a mermaid quite like Ariel. The headstrong teenager longs to be part of the magical world on land, much to the dismay of her father, King Triton. When she falls in love with a human Prince, Ariel looks to Ursula, a sea witch. With the help of her friends, Ariel must win her prince's love in a thrilling race against time. This production of \"The Little Mermaid\" based on the fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen is full of dazzling animation."
