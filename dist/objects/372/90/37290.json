        "This Australian documentary/drama tells how the defection of Soviet spy Vladmir Petrov in Canberra 1954 led to a political crisis in Australia and the eventual 'smoking out' of the century's master spy, Harold Russell (Kim) Philby - a senior KGB agent for more than fifty years. Included is much of the most recent footage of Philby himself."
