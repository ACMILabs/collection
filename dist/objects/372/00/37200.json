        "Monster of the imagination and monarch of the wild, the great grizzly bear has long played a part in myth and legend. Despite man's combined fear of and fascination with the grizzly, the bear survives today only by consent of his one real contender - man. Travel from Alaska's Brooks Range to Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park for an illuminating portrait of this powerful, intelligent and extremely aggressive creature."
