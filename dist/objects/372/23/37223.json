        "A look at the decadent lifestyle of Roman high society, seen through the eyes of a gossip columnist who aspires to straight journalism, but is unable to break away from his debauched life. \"La Dolce Vita\" still remains one of the most popular of all Fellini's films. Cast includes Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg. In Italian with English subtitles."
