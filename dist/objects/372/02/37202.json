        "Lavish film version of Marcel Pagnol's tale of a simple man who leaves the city to live on an inherited piece of land but is ruined when he fails to find water to irrigate his property because the location of an underground spring is kept secret from him by two scheming villagers who wish to take over the farm. The conclusion to this story comes in the sequel, \"Manon des Sources\". \"Jean de Florette\" stars Yves Montand and Gerard Depardieu."
