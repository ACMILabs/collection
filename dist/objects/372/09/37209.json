        "A mysterious man with a twitch in his eye; a young woman's body washed ashore along with the raincoat belt used to strangle her; the supposedly innocent owner of the raincoat, fleeing from the police and frantically seeking the real murderer - all these elements combine to produce a full-speed, nail-biting mystery melodrama from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Based on the novel A shilling for candles by Josephine Tey."
