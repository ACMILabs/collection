        "John Boorman recreates the London and England of his childhood, when he was a young boy living through the excitement of the Blitz, whilst the adults around him were dealing with the horror of war as best they could. In contrast to the adult's fears, for the children the war also brings adventure and excitement, and much of the film's comedy comes from the differing perspective's between the \"grown-ups\" and the \"kiddies\". The recreation of war-time London is visually spot-on. Boorman wrote the screenplay. The film stars Sarah Miles."
