        "The four baby turtles who strayed into radioactive waste and mutated to become human sized talking reptilians with a hearty appetite for pizzas and rock music were raised by the Japanese ninja master water rat Splinter in the sewers of New York City. Now the dreaded Shredder is recruiting teenagers to commit a wave of robberies which has the city in panic. So it's up to the four fearless turtles to save the day with a little help from feisty TV reporter April. Cowabunga! Based on the comic-book creation of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird."
