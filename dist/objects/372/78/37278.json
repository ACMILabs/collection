        "Robert Montgomery and John Wayne are naval lieutenants stationed in the Philippines who are keen to test their squadrons and equipment in battle. They get the chance to do so when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour and the US enters World War II. Donna Reed also features as a nurse falling in love with Wayne, but the relationship takes second place to the brilliant staging and editing of the navy and air battles. In the bloody and intense war scenes Ford shows his brilliance as a film director. Based on the novel of the same name by William L. White."
