        "Episode of Series 'More Winners'. In the Enchanted Realm the fairies are in trouble. According to the Charter of the Grand Master, they must give away seven wishes to the humans every 100 years or lose their magic powers. But the only human who will believe in them is Christopher Walter Pratt (C.W.). C.W. has one day to enjoy his seven wishes - what he doesn't know is that the last wish lasts forever."
