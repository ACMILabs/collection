        "Six half-hour episodes of David Attenborough's series on animal behaviour, examining why creatures behave as they do and showing that their lives are a series of problems to be faced and overcome. The episodes are - 1. Arriving (on reproduction and birth) 2. Growing up (on parental protection) 3. Finding food (the interdependence of plants and animals) 4. Hunting & escaping (Attack and defence behaviour) 5. Living together (Companion species) 6. Home making (Burrows, nests etc. for safety)."
