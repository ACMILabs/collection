        "A tense, realistic Australian drama which examines the barbarity and cruelty that exists within an Australian jail for male prisoners. Bryan Brown stars as a young but experienced convict determined to protest against the mindless, and often dehumanising, rules and limitations placed on prisoners. The script-writer, Bob Jewson, was a prisoner at Bathurst Goal in 1974 and he has based his script for \"Stir\" on the events and personalities which led to the infamous rioting at that institution. \"Stir\" culminates in a similar explosive finish. Cast also includes Max Phipps, Dennis Miller, Gary Waddell, Phil Motherwell, Edward Robshaw, Michael Gow and Robert 'Tex' Morton. Written by Bob Jewson. Photography by Geoff Burton."
