        "Set in pre-revolutionary China, Paul Muni plays Wang Lung, a simple peasant farmer who rises to become a prosperous lord. Tragedy pursues him as he betrays his family and neglects the earth he has worshipped. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for her portrayal of O-Lan, Wang's devoted wife, a battered slave who grows into a proud, loyal woman. Based on Pearl S. Buck's Pulitzer Prize winning novel."
