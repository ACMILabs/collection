        "Chandleresque private eye J.J. Gittes takes on the seemingly routine investigation of an errant husband but is soon caught up in a network of private and public evil. Drought-stricken Los Angeles in 1937 is a disorienting and alien place. In this multi-layered narrative, marked by dark humour, the mysterious Chinatown, where social and moral norms don't operate, acts as a metaphor for a pervasive corruption implicating the past, the present and the future. Stars John Huston, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Also available on DVD [316887]."
