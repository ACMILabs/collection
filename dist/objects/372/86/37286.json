        "The producing and directing team of Powell and Pressburger resulted in some of British cinema's finest films. \"Colonel Blimp\" is a deeply romantic film, but its emotionalism is kept in check by the cast's English reserve. During the Boer War a young English soldier meets a German soldier and they are to continue a friendship that will take them through three wars on opposite sides of battle. Deborah Kerr features as the woman they both love. Also stars Roger Livesey and Roland Culver."
