        "A best-selling romance writer, played by Kathleen Turner, gets more than bargained for when she goes to Colombia to find her kidnapped sister. There's a mysterious man hanging around, the jungle is full of hungry crocodiles and the kidnappers are out to get her. Luckily a hero right out of her imagination (Michael Douglas) is there to rescue her...but for a price. This is a film that recalls the spirit of the old movie matinee serials."
