        "If it were not for some extraordinary photographic techniques, sophisticated cameras and imaging devices, many events that the human eye cannot perceive - because these occurrences are too small, too large, too fast or beyond the spectrum of visible light - would go unnoticed. This film captures such events that would otherwise escape our inspection."
