        "Two jazz musicians (played brilliantly by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and elude their gangster pursuers by disguising themselves as women and joining an all-girl band headed for Miami. Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond had no doubts that they were making the funniest film of their careers when they created this superb comedy. Marilyn Monroe plays a singer in one of her best performances ever."
