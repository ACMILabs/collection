        "Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is travelling aimlessly through Texas, having left behind his son in LA with his successful brother Walt (Dean Stockwell). But Travis decides to go back for his son and take him along on a journey to find the boy's mother (Nastassja Kinski). Their search ends in a cheap strip- joint and Travis and his ex-wife confront each other about lost dreams and past betrayals. Visually striking, and intellectually stimulating, \"Paris, Texas\" is scripted by Sam Shepard and based on his own volume of short stories, \"Motel chronicles\". The haunting musical score is by Ry Cooder."
