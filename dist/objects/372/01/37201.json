        "Witness the realities of birth, death and survival in a vivid encounter with the animal world. Filmed in Namibia's Etosha National Park over the course of two years, the film captures extraordinary close-ups of animal behaviour, a wildebeest giving birth, a zebra mother successfully defending her foal from the swift attack of a cheetah, and a young springbok alerting his herd to the presence of a predator with stiff-legged leaps."
