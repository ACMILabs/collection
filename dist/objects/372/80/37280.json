        "Based on the autobiography of the same name by country and western legend Loretta Lynn, the film traces her beginnings in the Appalachia backwoods, her marriage when still a child, and her eventual arrival in Nashville. From there she launches her career and becomes one of America's most successful recording artists. The film is notable for its evocative depiction of poverty in the Deep South, and the winning portrayal of Lynn by Sissy Spacek (who won an Academy Award for her role). Cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Levon Helm and Beverly D'Angelo in a cameo as Patsy Cline. The soundtrack features a selection of country and western classics."
