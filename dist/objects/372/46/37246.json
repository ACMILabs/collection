        "Perhaps the best loved of all family pictures, \"Oliver\" is a joyous and entertaining version of Dickens' \"Oliver Twist\". Mark Lester plays Oliver, the foundling who escapes the indignities of the workhouse to find success and happiness in the London underworld. Oliver's new friends include the Artful Dodger and Fagin who teach him to \"pick a pocket\". Star roles are played by Harry Secombe, Oliver Reed and Shani Wallis."
