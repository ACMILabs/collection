        "Guy Bennett is nearing the end of his last year at a leading English boarding school. His best friend, Tommy Judd, is a Marxist, committed to Lenin's brave new world. In a school permeated by homosexuality, affairs between the boys are accepted, provided discretion is practised. Bennett breaks this unwritten rule and the humiliating consequences establish within him a rejection of the system that excludes him. Scripted by Julian Mitchell from his own play."
