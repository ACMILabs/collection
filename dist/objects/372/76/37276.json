        "In 1908 three year old Pu Yi becomes Emperor of Imperial China. In the course of his life-time he will be treated as a God, become a playboy and traitor, and finally end up jailed by the communists. The end of his life is spent happily as a humble gardener. Bertolucci's film is an astonishing visual treat, encompassing both the history of China in the twentieth century, and elegantly detailing the story of the country's last imperial ruler. Stars John Lone, Peter O'Toole and Joan Chen. Winner of nine Academy Awards (including Best Picture). The music is by David Byrne and Ryuichi Sakamoto."
