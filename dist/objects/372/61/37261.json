        "Based on Raymond Chandler's novel of the same name, \"The Big Sleep\" stars Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe, the private eye who \"dares to walk the mean streets alone\". Investigating a series of gambling debts he comes across plenty of murder, blackmail, kidnapping and violence. Lauren Bacall plays opposite Bogart and the screen magic between them in this film is legendary. The witty dialogue is scripted by William Faulkner. A consummate Hollywood film noir."
