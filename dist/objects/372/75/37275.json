        "Gene Hackman plays private detective Harry Moseby who is hired by an ex- actress to find her teenage runaway daughter. Moseby's hunt for the missing teenager takes him deep into mystery, double-cross, violence and smuggling. A homage to film-noir, \"Night Moves\" is also a bleak, stylish examination of alienation and greed in contemporary America."
