        "It is October 1944, and the Pacific War has brought American forces to Sydney, turning it into a gaudy garrison town. The gamblers and good time charlies converge on the South Pacific Hotel, Sydney's finest. Amidst the social upheavals of war, a society is in flux, marriages are strained, values are tested. The heart of the South Pacific Hotel is the beauty salon run by three remarkable women. This is the story of one week in their lives. Based on the novel by Dymphna Cusack and Florence James."
