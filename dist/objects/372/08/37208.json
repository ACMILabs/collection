        "A tale of three women with the same name, whose solidarity with one another brings about three copy-cat murders. They drown their husbands - one in a tin bath, one in the sea and one in a swimming pool. An ironic, black comedy that celebrates the English obsession with gameplaying, sex and death. Stars Joan Plowright, Juliet Stevenson, Joely Richardson and Bernard Hill."
