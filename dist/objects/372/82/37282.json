        "A freelance travelling news photographer with a broken leg is confined in his Greenwich Village apartment during a New York heatwave. A voyeuristic impulse leads him from curiosity to suspicion of murder as he observes his neighbours in the apartments opposite. His morbid curiosity is marked by a switch from binoculars to a telephoto lens as he watches a 'silent' film of other people's lives. To Hitchcock it was the visual construction of a mental process, 'the epitome of the subjective treatment'. Cast includes James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, Thelma Ritter. Screenplay by John Michael Hayes based on a the short story by Cornell Woolrich. Photography by Robert Burks. Music by Franz Waxman."
