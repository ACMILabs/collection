        "Space: the final frontier details the history of the space race, using footage from both the USA and the USSR. The ancient Chinese and Greek science of astronomy eventually led to Neil Armstrong's walking on the moon. While concentrating on the vision and success of the space programs, the video also examines tragedies such as the Challenger explosion. The video ends with a look to the future, particularly the new knowledge that the Discovery sky-ship has given us about our universe."
