        "The compelling study of the intense relationship between the exhausted and aging leader of a wartime Shakespearian company, \"Sir\" (Albert Finney), and his homosexual dresser, Norman (Tom Courtenay). Adapted by Ronald Harwood from his own play, \"The Dresser\" is based on the touring career of Donald Wolfit whose dresser the author was. A film rich in comedy, compassion and love for the theatre."
