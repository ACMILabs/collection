        "This visually sumptuous film is the story of three young slum dwellers who are forced to leave Chicago and search for work in the wheat fields of Texas. It is the turn-of-the-century and the depression has created enormous poverty. Bill (Richard Gere) forms a plan to inherit the fortune of his employer, and secure a future for his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) and sister (Linda Manz). This sets in train a chain of deceit and betrayal which leads to tragedy. The cinematography of the stark Texas landscape is by Academy Award winning Nestor Alemandros. The film also stars writer Sam Shepard. Critically \"Days of Heaven\" has been acclaimed as a leading film of the 1970's Hollywood \"new wave\"."
