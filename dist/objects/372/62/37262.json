        "Eating your heart out is about food, dieting and obsessional eating, especially as they effect women and girls in western societies. The program looks at four eating disorders: anorexia nervosa; bulimia; obesity; and a condition known as the fat/thin woman. It also examines the wider societal pressures on women that lead to these eating obsessions."
