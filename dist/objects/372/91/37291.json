        "Set in Victorian England, Katharine Hepburn plays the not-so-young Phoebe Throssel, fearing imminent spinsterhood as she watches her favourite suitor head off to the Napoleonic Wars, without leaving a wedding proposal behind. When he returns years later, Phoebe must masquerade as her own high-spirited niece to regain his attention. Also starring Joan Fontaine and Franchot Tone. Based on the play by Sir James M. Barrie."
