        "A documentary style feature film set in a brothel in Manhattan. Centring on a prostitute named Molly, the film takes us from her private life to the everyday routines of the brothel and exposes the working conditions and conflicts that confront the prostitutes. An open and unglamorous account of the women who work in the brothel."
