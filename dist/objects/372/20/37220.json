        "Two stories: \"Babar's triumph\" and \"Babar's choice\". \"Babar's triumph\": Babar faces his greatest challenge when the Hunter returns to threaten his kingdom. He must unite Lord Rataxes and everyone in the jungle to fight the Hunter and repel him once and for all. \"Babar's choice\": Babar's advisers, Cornelius and Pompadour, jeopardise his relationship with Celeste by insisting that he take the Gorilla King's daughter to an important palace ball instead of Celeste. Based on the picture books by Jean and Laurent de Brunhoff."
