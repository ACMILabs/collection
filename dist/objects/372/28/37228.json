        "Episode of Series 'More Winners'. At school Mark meets Annie who believes she is the re-incarnation of Phar Lap. Soon Mark becomes fascinated by reincarnation and discovers he was Henry Ford in a past life. His friends also get into the act, and soon they are all revelling in their new \"old\" identities. But when they work out that in their past lives they were responsible for some of the world's current problems, they set out on a mission to make up for what they've done."
