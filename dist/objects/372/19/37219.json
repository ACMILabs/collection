        "La Sylphide, in diaphanous white costume and with shining wings, dances for the Scottish farmer James, in the first scene of this most famous and enduring ballet by August Bournonville. This production by the Royal Dutch Ballet was partly recorded in the atmosphere of live performance but essentially in the confines of an empty Royal Theatre. The orchestra is conducted by Paul Jorgensen."
