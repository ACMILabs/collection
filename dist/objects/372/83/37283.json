        "A naive, young cowboy coming to Phoenix for the big rodeo, falls in love with the first woman he sees. She happens to be Marilyn Monroe, playing a \"chantoosie\" in a cheap bar, and he has to almost kidnap her, get beaten up for her, and perform majestically in the rodeo before she reciprocates his love. Don Murray gives a boisterous performance as the cowboy in the big city, but Monroe steals the film in what is considered one of her best performances. Based on the play \"Bus Stop\" by William Inge."
