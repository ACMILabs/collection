        "This mature exploration of difficult relationships utilises understated camerawork to convey an assured and gripping narrative. Strong visual composition and the use of motif combine with an effective soundtrack to create a piece that does not underestimate the role of the audience. Music composed and performed by Madeleine Jay. 'Moonlight Sonata' by Beethoven."
