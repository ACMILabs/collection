        "\"Remembrance: Reverberation\" was an exhibition held at ACMI Screen Gallery, 27 June 2003 - 31 August 2003. See Exhibition activity file record \"Remembrance: Reverberation\" (ID 12) for more information. Are memories like movies? Can they be recorded? Can you capture their yearning, their dread, their jubilation? Featuring spellbinding artworks by leading artists from around the world in ACMI's acclaimed screen gallery, Remembrance reveals how deeply our memories can move us.  An unforgettable experience that draws on the visitors' own memories, Remembrance will affect everyone in unique and unexpected ways. Evoking and challenging the intimate memories that sustain and shape our past, present and future, Remembrance immerses the visitor in explorations from the romantic to the confessional, from the spiritual to the taboo."
