        "Subtlety is the key to this brilliantly conceived hand drawn animation that employs the simple technology of a whiteboard and markers to create an engaging evocation of Paris. The use of minimalist materials is supported by thorough planning skills, the controlled use of camera and a storyline that is achievable within the limitations of the medium. Music by The Cafe Accordian Orchestra."
