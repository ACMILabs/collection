        "This black-and-white computer animation is based around the image of a sparsely furnished apartment at nighttime, using light and shade effects - of a subtlety and delicacy that recalls the brushstrokes in a Chinese ink drawing - to pick out the objects from the dark background. The austere beauty of the forms and movements is accentuated by the strains of a Bach cello suite."
