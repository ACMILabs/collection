        "Includes the following five titles which typify Lye's technique of directly scratching on the leader and other various techniques directly onto the film.  Tusalava (1929). Lye's first film was originally accompanied by live music by Jack Ellit. No score was ever found, so the film presented here is silent, a vision of the beginnings of life on earth - mixing Maori, silent and modernist influences.  Rhythm (1957). Live images of a car assembly line lead into Lye's traditional white scratches, synchronised to African drum music.  Free radicals (1979). Set against African drum music, images are provided by scratches on black leader, created using a variety of tools. Supported by a grant from the New Zealand Film Commission.  Particles in space (1979). New kinds of scratch imagery reflect the disparate element of the title as dots and dashes squiggle about the screen. Supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. A Federal agency, Washington, D.C  Tal farlow (1980). Jazz guitarist Tal Farlow provides the background music to Lye's final film, which, although begun in the 50's, was not recommenced until the 1980's, only he died before completing it. It contains geometrical scratches and was completed by Lye's assistant Steve Jones, under the supervision of Ann Lye. Supported in part by a grant from the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council of New Zealand."
