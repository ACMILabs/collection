        "The last collaboration between actor Toshiro Mifune and Kurosawa, is a moral tale about a young and arrogant medical graduate - charged by his modern training and ambition - who is devastated to be assigned to an impoverished local clinic. The young doctor's mentor, Red Beard, aims to show the young gun that there is more to life than prestige and power and more to healing than medicine. Set in 1820, this is a poignant and compassionate work; a humanistic narrative that follows the character's arc from supercilious to empathetic whilst presenting a myriad of stories about the villagers and their struggles."
