        "Episode of Series \"The Blues Collection = Martin Scorsese presents The Blues a musical journey [DVD]\". Part of Martin Scorsese's \"The Blues Collection\". When immigrants from Poland and African Americans migrating north from the oppression of the south came together, some magic was made through music - in particular, the formation of Chess Records in 1950 - initially created by two Jewish brothers who were inspired listening to gospel music at a local church. Marc Levin looks at the history of blues by talking to the son of the founder of Chess, Marshall Chess and his take on music and inter-racial relations at the time. Marshall's psychodelic inspired project Electric Mud featuring Muddy Waters is a pivotal album in the influential sphere of Chuck D from hip-hop's Public Enemy. Exploring his roots, Chuck D, and Marshall, take a tour of Chicago and re-form the Electric Mud Group to pay homage to the 'roots' of blues and add their own contemporary interpretation. Marshall's life in music went beyond the recording industry and he worked in the 1960s for seven years as Company Manager for the Rolling Stones. The take up of the blues by young white musicians in the UK and the US in the 1960s is shown - the cycle of Godfathers influencing the Sons. Features archival performance footage and includes live concert footage of the Chicago Blues Festival and the legendary Koko Taylor at her club. Howlin' Wolf, Bob Dylan, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Pinetop Perkins, and Ike Turner are some of the artists featured."
