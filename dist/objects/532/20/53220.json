        "Episodes 10-13 of \"Berserk\", Japanese anime series set in the Middle Ages. Gatsu, a dark knight and skilled swordsman, bears a mark of mysterious origins and is on a quest to find the being who branded him. Adapted from the comic book by Kentaro Miura, \"Young animal\", this decidedly sinister series is filled with kinetic displays of magic, depicting violent and gory encounters whilst conjuring a mood evocative of gothic horror. Ep. 10 After completing a brutal assignment, Gatsu is wounded, and haunted by his actions. Ep. 11 When Griffith heads off to war, his Hawks are involved in a bloody skirmish on the front line. Ep. 12 Stranded in a cave with Gatsu, Caska relives her brutal past. Ep. 13 Wounded and trapped in enemy territory, Caska and Gatsu struggle to rejoin their battalion."
