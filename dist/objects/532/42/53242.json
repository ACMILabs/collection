        "Bruce Willis plays Russ Duritz, an emotionally detached image consultant who is a winner in business, but a loser in all other areas of his life, especially in regards to his interpersonal skills. Upon meeting Rusty (a ten year old version of himself) Russ starts to reshape himself into a more humane being, partly by revisiting, understanding, and even altering, his past. Cast also includes Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin, Chi McBride, Jean Smart."
