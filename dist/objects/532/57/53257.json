Three part documentary series about the history of the Austalian Motion Picture industry. \"The Pictures That Moved\" describes the intense activity in the Australian film industry from the first screening at the Melbourne Opera House in 1896 to the decline of the industry in the early 1920's. Extracts from productions of particular interest are shown, including \"Soldiers of the cross\", \"Living Hawthorn\", \"The Story of the Kelly gang\", \"A Girl of the bush\", \"On our selection\" and \"The Sentimental bloke\", with stills, contemporary press reports and interviews. Shows the technical advances gained, and the exhibition of the national character in a wide range of films.

Includes material from fifty newsreels, sixteen feature films and still photographs drawn from many collections. \"Now you're talking\" - The 30s saw the introduction of the \"talkies\" and a new era of filmmaking began.
