        "In Vienna a young woman (Theresa Russell), begins an affair with an American psychoanalyst (Art Garfunkel). The couple become sexually obsessed with one another, but his lack of trust, and his constant suspicions, lead her to alcohol, drugs and excess until one night she decides to take her own life. Or does he make the decision for her? A combination of thriller, detective story, and a study of alienation, \"Bad Timing\" both fascinates and disturbs. Technically the editing and production values of the film are superb. Also stars Denholm Elliott and Harvey Keitel."
