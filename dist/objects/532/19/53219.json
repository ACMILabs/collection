        "Episodes 22-25 (final) of \"Berserk\", Japanese anime series set in the Middle Ages. Gatsu, a dark knight and skilled swordsman, bears a mark of mysterious origins and is on a quest to find the being who branded him. Adapted from the comic book by Kentaro Miura, \"Young animal\", this decidedly sinister series is filled with kinetic displays of magic, depicting violent and gory encounters whilst conjuring a mood evocative of gothic horror. Ep. 22 Griffith is being tortured but his Hawks have not given up on him. Ep. 23 The army pursues the fleeing Hawks; Griffith is very frail; Gatsu realises the depths of his feelings for Caska. Ep. 24 As Griffith hovers between life and death, the terrible truth behind his destiny is revealed. Ep. 25 Will Gatsu and Caska become sacrificial beings, as predicted? In an attempt to save her, Gatsu faces an array of marauding beasts. Final episode of \"Berserk\"."
