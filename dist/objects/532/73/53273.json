        "Based on Mark Twain's 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' this Disney film version provides a new twist to the story by setting it in today's space age. NASA scientist Tom Trimble (Dennis Dugan) and his robot clone accidentally find themselves travelling back in time to the land of merry England and the court of King Arthur (Kenneth More). Here Trimble encounters the lovely Alisande (Sheila White), King Arthur's enemy the evil knight Sir Mordred (Jim Dale), and Merlin (Ron Moody) the Court's magician. Will Trimble be drawn into Sir Mordred's evil plot to oust King Arthur or will he save the day and in doing so stop history from being changed forever? Cast includes John Le Mesurier as Sir Gawain."
