        "Celebratory, but also poignant, documentary about the history of South African apartheid, as seen through the eyes of numerous black South African musicians and artists. Interviews are interwoven with footage from the 1940s and beyond -- footage that portrays the awful discrimination and brutality of apartheid. Activists used music to express their rage and frustration at the ruling government, often incurring the wrath of the oppressive regime with their protest songs. The dissenters used these songs to mobilise the masses while venting their sorrow at the injustices being suffered. These artists argue convincingly that the songs were integral to the struggle, providing an inestimable tole in the victory over apartheid. Performers and interviewees include: Thandi Modise, Vusi Mahlasela, Sibongile Khumalo, Duma KaNdlovu, Sibusiso Nxumalo, Lindiwe Zulu, Miriam Makeba, Abdullah Ibrahim, Sifiso Ntuli, Dolly Rathebe, and Hugh Masekela."
