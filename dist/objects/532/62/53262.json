        "William Hurt stars as a doctor who faces his mortality and his own, previously callous, handling of patients, when he himself becomes seriously ill. As well as being a personal drama about one man's journey into self discovery and self awareness, the narrative also, in part, addressees the inequities of the American medical system whereby the medical care of the poor is seriously compromised. Also stars Alan Arkin and Elizabeth Perkins."
