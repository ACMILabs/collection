        "Family comedy film around the theme of fantasy and magic. The discovery of a magic ring changed young Wilby Daniels' (Tommy Kirk) life forever. Suddenly he could transform himself into a large sheepdog - but the problem was he had no control as to when this was going to happen. Wilby did not need this in his life right now, just when he had his eye on the rather pretty Allison (Annette Funicello). He had to break the spell and the only way to do that was by performing some virtuous deed. Cast also includes Fred MacMurray, Jean Hagen, Tim Considine."
