        "Moving documentary about 1960s rock musician Syd Barrett, composer and vocalist in the original line up of the band Pink Floyd. Featuring contemporary interviews with band members and some original footage from the swinging 1960s, this documentary portrays the downfall of a life full of potential - ruined by psychodelic drugs and mental health problems. Syd's departure from the band in 1968 and his personal problems are not the only things that still resonate with band members and friends - his musical contribution and influence also live on. Contains interviews with friends and fans and features some classic early Pink Floyd songs. Narrated by Kirsty Wark. Other band members featured are David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Rick Wright."
