        "Episode of Series \"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection\". Set in 2015, in a post-holocaust world, with half the population annihilated, this made for television animated series mixes science fiction, action, mystery and adventure with humour. Evangelion is the name of the most powerful combat weapon ever made by man, but one that requires a young human pilot to manipulate it. In this instalment betrayals and revelations erupt across NERV as Kaji's allegiance to an outside authority becomes apparent. Shinji's faltering abilities become deadly when a new Angel attacks Unit 0:1. Meanwhile the search for the Fourth child begins. This disc, Collection 0:5, contains episodes 15-17."
