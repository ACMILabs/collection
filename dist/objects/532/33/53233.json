        "Creepy thriller from horror maestro Dario Argento features a strong performance from a very young Jennifer Connelly as an imperilled schoolgirl (also named Jennifer) who undergoes a series of frightening encounters whilst boarding at a Swiss finishing school. After experiencing nightmares that provide insight into a serial killer's movements, Jennifer's talent for communicating with insects links her to bug specialist Dr McGregor, with whom she aims to unmask the murderer. Engaging in the tropes of the genre - and using his trademark gore and gross-out aesthetics - Argento provides an array of thrills, scares and narrative twists all backed by a rock soundtrack. Uncut, uncensored widescreen edition. Also known as \"Creepers\" (US title)."
