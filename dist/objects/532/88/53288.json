        "Episode of Series \"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection\". Set in 2015, in a post-holocaust world, with half the population annihilated, this made for television animated series mixes science fiction, action, mystery and adventure with humour. Evangelion is the name of the most powerful combat weapon ever made by man, but one that requires a young human pilot to manipulate it. A triple-cross leaves the fate of mankind hanging in the balance as the Evangelions must once again defend the earth against Angels. With the world in extreme danger, Rei must make a terrible sacrifice in order to save NERV once more. This disc, Collection 0:7, contains episodes 21-23."
