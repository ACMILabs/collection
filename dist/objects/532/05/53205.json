        "In the pipe-smoking daydreamer Mr. Hulot, Jaques Tati created one of the most adored and one of the funniest of screen clowns. In a sleepy seaside resort town, Hulot is the centre of increasing chaos: deckchairs behave anarchically, a summer Ball turns into a disaster. Amidst it all Mr. Hulot wanders around oblivious to the madness. \"Mr. Hulot's Holiday\" is a beautifully orchestrated piece of comic cinema and widely considered Tati's funniest film. Also available on VHS [303607]."
