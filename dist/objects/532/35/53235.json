        "In this sequel to \"The Grudge\", a Tokyo house has been the site of many strange disappearances. A television crew go to investigate the site, setting off a spate of killings by the evil spirit that dwells there. Although not as well received as \"The Grudge\" this horror film contains a convoluted narrative, but contains exemplary scares and thrills, fitting for the genre, with a chilling finale. Cast includes: Noriko Sakai, Chiharu Niiyama and Kei Horie."
