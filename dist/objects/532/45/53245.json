        "Episode of Series \"The Blues Collection = Martin Scorsese presents The Blues a musical journey [DVD]\". Part of Martin Scorsese's \"The Blues Collection\". Kidnapped by Uncle Buddy, on his way to be saved from the devil by being baptised, a young 11 year-old boy gets a life education on exactly what it is he is going to be 'saved' from. Through a re-telling of this young boy's journey travelling the Deep South, his education becomes the viewers' with a narration (by Carl Lumbly) of the boy as an adult recalling this past he will never forget. The history of the African American musician is his lesson, starting out in New Orleans and the blues music that stemmed from early 1900 to the 1940s turns into, as the director says, a 'story that gives you the impression of the blues'. Inserted in the 'educational' narrative is a combination of archival footage of the period, original performances and stills. The influence of the church and gospel music is covered and the work also includes details of female performers whose powerful music and voices transcend time and place, such as Bessie Smith, Victoria Spivey, Ma Rainey, Dinah Washington and Sister Rosetta Thorpe. Others featured include Willie Dixon, Sonny Boy Williamson, Son House, John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters amongst many others. Cast includes Tommy Redmond Hicks and Nathaniel Lee Jr. with an original score by Stephen James Taylor."
