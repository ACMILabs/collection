        "Episodes 14-17 of \"Berserk\", Japanese anime series set in the Middle Ages. Gatsu, a dark knight and skilled swordsman, bears a mark of mysterious origins and is on a quest to find the being who branded him. Adapted from the comic book by Kentaro Miura, \"Young animal\", this decidedly sinister series is filled with kinetic displays of magic, depicting violent and gory encounters whilst conjuring a mood evocative of gothic horror. Ep. 14 Koska is trapped and Gatsu must face a brutal encounter with 100 soldiers. Ep. 15 Koksa has conflicted emotions about Gatsu and her devotion to Griffith. Ep. 16 With the aim of capturing Doldery, the knights face the strongest of Chuder's army. Ep. 17 In the final battle between Midland and Chuder, the outcome means more than simply victory or defeat."
