        "Loosely based on a real-life story, this 1930s depression-era gangster flick stars Charles Bronson in the titular role, as a sadistic killer. A bank robber leading a motley band, Kelly is goaded into more elaborate crime by his ambitious wife who craves media attention and basks in her husband's notoriety. Alas, Kelly decides to hold the daughter of a wealthy industrialist for ransom. Things go badly when a fractious gang member seeks revenge on his leader. Despite its B-movie credentials, \"Machine Gun Kelly\" impresses as a claustrophobic crime drama, marking Corman's move into big-league movie making."
