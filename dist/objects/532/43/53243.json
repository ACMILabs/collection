        "Resoundingly derided drama about the invasion on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, this film, directed by Michael Bay, nonetheless contains some impressive sequences, mostly the expertly executed and detailed battle scenes. Less engaging is the love triangle between two pilots, and the girl they both fall for. Cast includes Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jnr, Jon Voight."
