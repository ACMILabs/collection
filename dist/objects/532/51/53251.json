        "Nicolas Roeg's lyrical tale about a sister (Jenny Agutter) and her young brother (Lucien John) left stranded in the Australian outback having survived their father's attempt to destroy the family. They are rescued by a young aborigine (David Gulpilil) who has journeyed into the vast desert on his walkabout - a tribal initiation into manhood. During their journey Gulpilil courts the young woman, though in her incomprehension she rejects his advances. The vision of paradise lost presented with an often surreal intensity is that of a European outsider, who sees white history as invasive and deeply destructive. Also stars John Meillon, Robert McDara, Pete Carver, John Illingsworth, Hilary Bamberger, Barry Donnelly, Noelene Brown and Carlo Machini. Cinematography by Nicolas Roeg. Screenplay by Edward Bond, based on the novel by James Vance Marshall. Edited by Antony Gibbs and Alan Pattillo. Music composed and conducted by John Barry. Also available on VHS [309075]."
