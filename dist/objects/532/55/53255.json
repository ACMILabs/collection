        "Episode of Series \"American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection\". Donald McCann plays a young man Gar, bored with the monotony of his life in rural Ireland, who seeks adventure in the wider world by deciding to live with his aunt in Philadelphia. On the eve of his departure Gar reflects upon his past, on what might have been and upon his relationship with his emotionally distant father. His inner turmoil and rage are relayed via his alter ego (played by Des Cave) who gives a caustic running commentary about Gar's shortcomings and those of his friends and family. A funny and bittersweet adaptation of the Brian Friel play of the same name, the narrative is a rumination upon identity, nationality, maturity and regret. Cast also includes: Siobhan McKenna and Eamon A. Kelly."
