        "Mon Oncle is a poetic satire depicting man against machine, rather in the manner of Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" and Rene Clair's \"A Nous la Liberte\". Hulot is little Gerard Arpel's uncle, a fond relative whose whimsical ways fail to impress the boy's ultra-modern parents. What transpires is a masterpiece of design which develops Tati's unique comic vision without ever losing sight of the essential simplicity he holds so dear. Deft, elusive, full of heart, \"Mon Oncle\" is a film to see again and again. Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Also available on VHS [301867]."
