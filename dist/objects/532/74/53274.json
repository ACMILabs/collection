        "This low brow comedy from Saturday Night Live alumni Rob Schneider is about a luckless fish tank cleaner who gets mistaken for a male gigolo, and must grapple with the complications that mistaken identity brings. Jokes are mainly in the order of the scatological and deliberately offensive - following in the footsteps of Adam Sandler (who is executive producer) and the Farrelly brothers, although with decidedly less polish."
