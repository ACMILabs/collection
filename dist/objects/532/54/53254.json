        "Episode of Series \"American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection\". Atmospheric adaptation of David Storey's emotionally charged play, about three sons who return to their Yorkshire mining town for their parent's wedding anniversary - an event that stirs up suppressed resentment, childhood memories and bitterness, despite the men's successful lives. Impressive performances from Alan Bates, James Bolam and Brian Cox who reprise their stage roles as the three middle class sons. Part of the American Film Theatre Collection."
