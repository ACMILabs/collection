        "Featuring a very young Kurt Russell as Dexter, student leader at Medfield College who is transformed into a human being with a hard drive memory when the computer he is repairing is unexpectedly struck by a bolt of lightning. This act of nature presents all manner of problems for Dexter as his brain begins to discover certain information about the somewhat suspect activities of the College's rich benefactor A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) who donated the computer in the first place. The story bounces along from adventure to adventure, revealing secrets and plans, a kidnapping and a rescue. Cast includes Joe Flynn, William Schallert, Alan Hewitt."
