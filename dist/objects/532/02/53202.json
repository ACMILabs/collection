        "Intriguing documentary about a midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour by the Japanese during World War II. On the evening of 1st June 1942, a surprise offensive left twenty-one allied and six Japanese dead. Survivors, witnesses and relatives, from both Australia and Japan, recount their memories of the event and how it still affects their lives today. A moving portrait of a singular incident that brought the realisation that the war was not an event happening overseas - how prepared was Australia for invasion? Using a mixture of archival, contemporary footage and interviews (and with a moving musical score composed by Sam Petty) this poignant documentary recalls in a personal way the lives and losses of those caught up in the perils of war. Written, directed and co-produced by Claude Gonzalez."
