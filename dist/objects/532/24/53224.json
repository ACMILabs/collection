        "A comedy that involves sex, surgery and golf - and a lighthearted look at the gruesome business of human organ trafficking. Two young medical students, Brad and Gregor (Matt Day, Jason Barry), find themselves in desperate times as they have no money to pay their fees, the rent or buy food. Mannah from heaven comes in the form of a man jumping to his death in front of them, providing the boys the means to steal his kidney and assist with their financial obligation to local gangster Roy Rogers (Chris Haywood). Roy also has a financial hold on fellow student Sophie (Petra Yared) who works as a prostitute to cover her student costs. In a bid to clear their own debt, and Sophie's, Brad and Gregor get creative and steal more organs, upsetting the local corrupt ambulance officers who, up to that point, were the main suppliers. Cast includes Nicola Charles, Caroline Gillmer, Simon Bossell, Frank Gallacher."
