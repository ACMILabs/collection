        "Episodes 18-21 of \"Berserk\", Japanese anime series set in the Middle Ages. Gatsu, a dark knight and skilled swordsman, bears a mark of mysterious origins and is on a quest to find the being who branded him. Adapted from the comic book by Kentaro Miura, \"Young animal\", this decidedly sinister series is filled with kinetic displays of magic, depicting violent and gory encounters whilst conjuring a mood evocative of gothic horror. Ep. 18 Skullduggery at court threatens Griffith's life. Ep. 19 Gatsu needs to find his own path which puts him in conflict with Griffith. Ep. 20 Away from battle, Gatsu questions the routes his life has taken. Ep. 21 With Griffith imprisoned for treason, Koska now leads the dispirited Hawks."
