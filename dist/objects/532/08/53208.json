        "Fun, fun, fun. That is the verdict on the latest ingenious animated feature from Pixar. Based around a family of 'supers' (aka superheroes) \"The Incredibles\" introduces Robert \"Mr Incredible\", consigned to a life of mind-numbing boredom in suburbia who longs for his glory days as a world saving super hero. Spiritually crushed by a pen-pushing insurance claim job, Robert toils under the daily grind in the suburbs with loyal wife Helen (\"Elastigirl\") and their three children. Bob's zest for life is revived when he is called upon by the mysterious Mirage to perform some planet-saving assignments, but he is unwittingly drawn into confrontation with an old foe who seeks to bring all the Supers down. Bob must rely on his family to help when the situation becomes desperate and the audience gets to discover how super, these Supers really are. Features the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson."
