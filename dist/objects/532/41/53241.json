        "A moving documentary about one woman's anti-nuclear crusade that has her challenging the very fabric of American society - but she's an Australian. A qualified medical doctor, Helen Caldicott has been a peace activist for the last twenty years. Her cynical filmmaking niece, Anna Broinowski, goes on the road with her aunt for a year to document and sometimes challenge Dr Caldicott. Helen's predictions of the use of missiles on the people of Iraq become true and she is more determined to fight the good fight, particularly post 9/11. Her public speaking is something to behold and the reactions she receives, either enraging people or moving them to empathetic tears is powerful stuff. An Australian/Canadian co-production."
