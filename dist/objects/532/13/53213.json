        "Philip Seymour Hoffman hosts an exploration of the state of politics in the United States, leading up to the 2000 election. Hoffman collects a variety of perspectives by attending a Farm Aid concert, various rallies, political conventions, a primary school, a NRA gun show, a Christian coalition, and prison towns. By interviewing the young and old, the famous and the obscure, the filmmakers strive to present a multifarious picture of America. Whilst the results are not polished, the work does capture the scandals of the election, including the faulty ballot cards, re-counts and the decision of the Supreme Court to appoint Bush. Interviews include Willie Nelson, Susan Sarandon, Noam Chomsky, and Michael Moore."
