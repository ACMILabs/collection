        "A romantic comedy fairytale about a most unlikely liaison between a beautiful mermaid (Daryl Hannah) and a New York businessman, Allen Bauer (Tom Hanks). The two first meet when Allen (as a young boy) is rescued from drowning by the lovely mermaid, but it is many years later before the two are reunited on land in New York and our mermaid has transformed into Madison with legs in place of her fishy tail. Madison not only tries to hide her identity from Allen but she also has to keep her legs away from water - or her telltale fin will return. Added to this, Madison has also captured the interest of an obsessed scientist (Eugene Levy). Light-hearted entertainment with great support from John Candy as Allen's brother Freddie Bauer."
