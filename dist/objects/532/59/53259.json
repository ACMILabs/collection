    "description": [
        "Are the patients incurably insane or just part of the occult? A young psychiatric doctor (Robert Powell) visits an asylum where he is to have a short residency. Upon arriving he finds out the director/leading doctor has now become a patient and is upstairs with the other sick people. There are four patients and the young doctor is to guess which of the patients is the now mad Dr B. Starr and in doing so, will get to keep the job. One by one we learn the patient's bizarre stories. The first story is of a young woman (Barbara Parkins) involved with a married man - he chops up his wife and puts her in a freezer. The young woman visits but finds the man in the freezer instead and she is attacked. The next story stars Peter Cushing as a customer of a tailor, he wants the tailor to make a suit for his dead son to be re-incarnated but the plans go array. The next patient is a delusional young girl (Charlotte Rampling) who has a split personality 'Lucy' (Britt Ekland) upon who she blames the murder of her brother and nurse. The final patient used to be a doctor and makes creepy robot models that have fully functioning brains and murderous intentions. Scary fun stuff with appropriate orchestral music to make sure you know when something weird is about to happen and the final twist reveals just who is Dr Starr."
