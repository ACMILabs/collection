        "As the title suggests, a Jewish family migrate from WWII Germany to Kenya in Africa and find themselves displaced persons and \"Nowhere in Africa\". The father Walter, previously a lawyer in Germany, goes on ahead to establish himself and then sends for his socialite wife Jettel and young daughter Regina to come as soon as possible. Struggling with temporary internment by the British and being sacked as farm manager, the family are soon re-established on a new farm and try to cope with being land mangers. The family are bound together, and to the place they now live, through their African cook, Owuor (Sidede Onyulo), who has a special bond with Regina. Letters from home confirm their worst fears as the family members they left behind are sent to live in ghettos and to 'work camps'. After the war, the family, now established in Africa, struggle with the idea of returning to Germany. A heartfelt and personal family drama located in an imposing landscape and set to a moving musical score. Nominated for an Academy Award in 2002 for Best Foreign Language Film and winner of five German Film Awards. Based on an autobiographical novel by Stefanie Sweig. Cast includes: Juliane Kohler, Merab Ninidze, Matthias Habich, Lea Kurka, Karoline Eckertz."
