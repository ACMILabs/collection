        "This Bollywood remake of \"Reservoir dogs\" (Tarantino, 1992) is a lot of fun to watch with its musical numbers and an inventive reworking of the central narrative about a gang of criminals who are infiltrated by an undercover cop. After pulling off a daring bank robbery, and lucky escape from the law, the band retreat to sniff out the nark among them. Featuring sprightly performances by Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Mahesh Manjrekar, Lucky Ali and Kumar Gaurav, the narrative also addresses ethnic stereotyping as the crew lament their treatment at the hands of the Los Angeles Police Department."
