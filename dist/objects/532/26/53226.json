        "This experimental non-linear work, about five students who embrace Maoism, heralded the second wave of Godard's filmmaking - The Revolutionary. Spending the summer in the bourgeois surrounds of a borrowed flat, the students become immersed in the doctrine of Chairman Mao's Little Red Book, discussing methodologies (which include terrorism and assassination) to overthrow governmental systems. Heralded by some as groundbreaking cinema that subverted popular notions of filmmaking (recall Godard's famous quote: \"A story should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order\"), \"La Chinoise\" also confounded many Godard admirers with its obscure polemic. Cast includes: Juliet Berto, Jean-Pierre Leaud, Anne Wiazemsky and Blandine Jeanson."
