        "The story of rival clans, hidden gold and a princess in distress becomes, in Kurosawa's masterful hands, a thrilling mixture of fairy-tale and Samurai movie, with the finest elements of a John Ford Western and a Shakespearean drama thrown in for good measure. Toshiro Mifune excels in a role which he subsequently made his own - the unmatched warrior - and his skill as horseman and swordsman is matched only by Kurosawa's skill behind the camera and in the editing suite. Misa Uehara as the princess in exile is a potent mix of strength and vulnerability, and the choreographed set pieces set cinematic precedents which are hard to follow. Also available on VHS [308157]."
