        "Powerful anti-war drama about an enquiry into the killing of two North Korean soldiers by a South Korean soldier on border patrol. Brought in to stifle a potentially incendiary situation, independent investigating officer Sophie Jean discovers that the group were once unlikely friends, sharing card games and good times. But subsequent enquiries reveal inconsistent versions of the tragic events that followed. A huge hit in Korea and Japan, \"JSA\" is a humanistic and sensitive examination of the discord between army officialdom and friendships amid supposed enemies. Adapted from the novel by Park Sang-myeon."
