        "Episode of Series \"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection\". Set in 2015, in a post-holocaust world, with half the population annihilated, this made for television animated series mixes science fiction, action, mystery and adventure with humour. Evangelion is the name of the most powerful combat weapon ever made by man, but one that requires a young human pilot to manipulate it. The first test on the new Eva turns into a disaster as the giant bio-human goes insane and runs amok. As Gendo unleashes the monstrous power of Unit 0:1's auto-pilot, it becomes all too apparent that the Evas are more than mere machines. This disc, Collection 0:6, contains episodes 18-20."
