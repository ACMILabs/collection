    "description": [
        "A compilation of short films put together and distributed just before the Australian Federal Government election in 2004. An anti-John Howard work summarising the controversial aspects of the Prime Minister's time in office up to that point: covers issues such as the War in Iraq, Anti-Terrorist Laws, Reconciliation, Mandatory Detention, GST, East Timor, Territorial Waters with East Timor, Refugees, Australian Muslims and the Trade Union Waterfront dispute. Made in just eight weeks with no budget (and no government funding!) this irreverent outpouring of anger and political opinion is an absolute testament to the dedication of the filmmakers (and a real test for possible sedition laws). Controversial but fine filmmaking with a mixture of animation, documentaries and satire. Presented by comedian and activist Rod Quantock."
