        "The third of Tati's films to feature the gangling form of Monsieur Hulot, \"Playtime\" is a surreal, comic vision of mankind's battle against the overwhelming depersonalisation of modern city life. Filmed upon one of the most ambitious and imaginative sets ever to grace the screen, Tati's cinematic magnum opus took three years and a reported one million pounds to shoot. The result is a startling triumph acclaimed by the international media as Tati's finest work. Also available on VHS [302002]."
