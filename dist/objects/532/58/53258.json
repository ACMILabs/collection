        "Hailed as the first feature ever in the Inuktitut language, this film won numerous accolades for its stunning cinematography and exceptional setting - ancient frozen lands of the Artic circle. Based on an olden Inuit legend, this fable is set at the dawn of the millennium, and is the story of a man, Atanarjuat, whose love for a woman (betrothed to another) sees him challenge his rival, enlisting the help of his powerful older brother. Romantic rivalry, jealousy, murder, rape and betrayal, all ensue as a menacing force - brought to their village by a shaman - beset the tribe. The period detail of the era is painstakingly recreated here, making the film, from an anthropological perspective, a fascinating view of a way of life untainted by Western influence. Shot of widescreen digital video on location in Igloolik, Nunavut, Canada."
