        "Jacques Tati's award winning feature debut is an hilarious expose of the modern obsession with speed and efficiency, set amidst the rural surroundings of a tiny French village. The arrival of the summer fair brings a frenzy of activity as children, villagers and showmen bustle to cram as much as possible into twenty four fun-packed hours. But when the local postman attempts the high speed methods of the American mail service the villagers experience a new kind of madness. Also available on VHS [301871]."
