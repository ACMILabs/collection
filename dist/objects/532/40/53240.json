        "In a future world, young people, disheartened by their bleak reality, are increasingly becoming addicted to an illegal (and potentially deadly) battle simulation game called Avalon. Ash (Malgorzata Foremniak) is a ruthless \"Class A\" fighter and reigning queen of the games who suspects a conspiracy at play and decides to face-off the ruthless programmers. Using highly stylized computer graphics, director Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the shell), presents an exhilarating psychological science-fiction thriller, that, with its dystopian setting, has the hallucinatory logic of a disturbing, if atmospheric, computer game."
