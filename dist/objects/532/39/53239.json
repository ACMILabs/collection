        "Orphaned as a young girl, Azumi is brought up by a masterly warrior to be a highly skilled, trained assassin. One of a band of children brought up in this manner, as adults the crew are sent off to eliminate corrupt warlords who are preventing peace in the land. In battle Azumi and her group encounter an array of fierce and exotic enemies whilst contending with their internal conflicts. Based on the Manga comic, \"Azumi\" is great fun with its colourful villains and incessant action sequences; although at times quite cheesy, the over-the-top nature of the director's aesthetic combines well with his flair for outrageous gore and mordant humour."
