        "Episode of Series \"The Blues Collection = Martin Scorsese presents The Blues a musical journey [DVD]\". Part of Martin Scorsese's \"The Blues Collection\", \"Red, White & Blues\" is directed by Mike Figgis with is his take on the influence of American blues music on musicians in the United Kingdom. A jam session recorded live in the studios at Abbey Road 2002 with some of the big names from the UK - Tom Jones, Jeff Beck, Lulu, and Van Morrison (to name a few) - provides an anchor point for the film and in between songs recorded at the session are interviews and music clips which make up this documentary. From the post-war years and a tradition of folk music and 'skiffle', the blues found a new audience and enthusiasts for the form flourished. Nightclubs featuring rhythm and blues bands became abundant; vinyl records were shared amongst friends and fellow musicians, spreading the blues influence until it exploded in the 1960s. Bands from the UK (such as The Rolling Stones and Cream) toured in America during this period whereupon names like Muddy Waters and B.B. King became household names in what otherwise may have been a lost art form in mainstream America. Some of the performers featured/interviewed include Booker T & the MGs, Big Bill Broonzy, Georgie Fame, Lonnie Donegan, The Beatles, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Alexis Korner, John Mayall, Eric Clapton, Eric Burdon and Mick Fleetwood."
