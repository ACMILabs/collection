        "A series of lectures by eminent American expert on foreign policy, Noam Chomsky, are centred around the issues of September 11 - the United States' response to the disaster, as well as the Government's participation in terrorism. Chomsky displays his signature articulation and intelligence in these illuminating pieces, providing a complex picture of world politics. He deftly places the terrorist attacks in the context of American foreign intervention throughout the decades: for example in Vietnam, Central America and the Middle East. In stark and uncompromising terms Chomsky presents his views that challenge widely held perceptions about America's motivations, in a refreshingly composed and astute way. Some lectures include question and answer forums with the audience."
