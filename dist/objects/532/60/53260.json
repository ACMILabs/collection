        "During the 1960s and 70s, Amicus Productions were one of the most popular horror movie-making studios. \"Dr Terror's house of horror\" was the first Amicus film, and with its portmanteau structure, features an array of supernatural settings. In a railway carriage sit five men; a mysterious doctor joins them and offers to tell their terrible fortunes. In them, a werewolf menaces a realtor; an art critic is terrorised by the severed hand of a disgruntled artist; a third man suspects his wife is a vampire; a jazz musician is pursued by a voodoo curse; a cottage is besieged by a monster vine. With its frightening narratives, and great cast, this is a wonderfully creepy classic horror experience. Also known as \"Blood suckers\"."
