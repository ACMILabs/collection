        "Emma-Kate Croghan made a great splash with her debut feature \"Love and other catastrophes\"; this, her follow-up work, was less successful, being a somewhat formulaic tale about love and destiny. The narrative centres around three friends, Alice, Judy and Sally, who are adrift in their late 20s, looking for love, career prospects and direction in life. Unbeknownst to them, three eligible men are also on similar paths, dealing with a variety of catastrophes and missteps. Will these six find love, career fulfilment and buffering from the trials and tribulations of life? Probably. Cast includes: Claudia Karvan, Naomi Watts, Alice Garner, Tom Long, Felix Williamson and Hugo Weaving."
