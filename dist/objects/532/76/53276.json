        "A wealthy and ambitious hunter gathers several guests to his expansive country estate with the intention of revealing that one is a werewolf. Initially baffled by their host's objective, the visitors soon become terrified that one among them may be a killer beast. Resembling an Agatha Christie mystery, this is a promising set-up, but offers little in the way of clues or intrigue, despite the invitation for audience participation to deduce the killer. The film features Christopher Lee as a lycanthrope expert, and there are 1970s blaxploitation overtones with Calvin Lockhart in the lead role. Also known as \"Black werewolf\"."
