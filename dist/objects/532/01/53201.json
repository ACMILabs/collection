    "description": [
        "A delightful slice of Australian life, this compilation of home made short films shot on 8mm film are sure to bring back memories or inspire new filmmakers. Memories of family life, beach holidays, careers, travel, weddings, music and fashion. Thirteen home movie filmmakers narrate a five minute edited version of their films dating from the 1930s to the 1980s, each ending with a contemporary portrait of the people involved. Aboriginal families, immigrant families, gay and lesbian protest movement and our first Paralympics team are some of the more fascinating works. Seeing a home movie shot in the 1930s and narrated by the filmmaker (the late Les Petty) is simply captivating."
