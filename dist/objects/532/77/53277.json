        "Four short stories are linked by a police investigation into the dire circumstances in which occupants of a haunted house perish. A mystery writer inhabits the house in order to finish his latest novel, but is overtaken by the idea that his fictionalised killer really exists. In the second episode, a retired businessman becomes obsessed with a waxwork figure of a beautiful woman. Thirdly, a single father to a young girl, who keeps her mysteriously separated from society, falls victim to witchcraft. In the final episode a horror-film actor, seeking authenticity in his work, is given the cloak of a real vampire. These stories are wonderfully creepy and rely not so much on bloodshed, as on supernatural thrills and gruesome trajectories."
