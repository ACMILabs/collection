        "Former United Nations weapons inspector Scott Ritter has compiled this series of interviews and footage into an interesting account of events leading up to the invasion of Iraq. The weapons inspectors were sent in on a supposedly non-political mission, their knowledge base being about weapons. Frustration with Iraqi officials denying them access to sites is shown and general dissatisfaction in the pressure brought to bear by politicians who were after a desired outcome. No definitive answers are given but the film provides some insight to the trying process the inspectors were put through. Please note that due to the nature of the original source material, the footage of \"In shifting sands\" is of a variable standard."
