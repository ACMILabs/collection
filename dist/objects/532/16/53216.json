        "Anecdotally hilarious documentary about the rise and fall of Brit-Pop in the 1990s and all it encompassed as a cultural phenomenon. This work assesses the mood of the times, or \"Cool Britannia\" as it was known, and the reasons why it was, for a while, great to be British; also addresses the role that Tony Blair and New Labor played, throwing off the drudgery of Thatcherism, embracing all that was new and youthful; and the band war between Oasis and Blur, played out on the pages on NME. Consisting almost entirely of interviews, the filmmakers have enhanced classic raw material with jazzy and judicious editing. From the insightful to the ridiculous, this is far from an exhaustive piece, but it provides an astute and witty snapshot of the times."
