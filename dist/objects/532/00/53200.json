        "Impressive thriller about a mild-mannered, nebbish bank manager who, due to an obsessive gambling addiction, embezzles the bank where he works for several million dollars. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Dan Mahowny as a man whose self-delusions run deep, and whose desire to not only to remain in denial but also to keep his covert life secret from others, leads to extreme measures. What makes the film interesting is the way that Dan's obsession and subsequent daring embezzlement builds slowly, spiralling out of his control. Hoffman depicts a man deluded but also conflicted by his choices that results in a great deal of suffering. Based on a true story."
