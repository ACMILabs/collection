        "A young college student, intrigued by the historical practices of witchcraft conducted in the 17th century, travels to a small town for further investigation. There she meets a mysterious end, leaving her brother and boyfriend to uncover the truth about the town's malevolent inhabitants. Filmed in black and white, and released the same year as Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", this horror tale is suitably menacing, relying very little on special effects, but more on atmosphere and a chilling narrative. Also known as \"Horror hotel\"."
