        "In this horror film, set in a haunted house in the late 18th century, Stephanie Beacham plays a young bride who is raped on her wedding night by a ghost who takes the form of a disembodied hand. When she tries to uncover the malevolant, dark secrets of her husband's ancestry she is thwarted at every turn, and those who try to help her end up dead. Utterly terrorised, her mental health begins to fail and a psychic doctor (Peter Cushing) is employed to cure her. Despite the dated special effects, this British thriller still has vintage appeal, drawing on the themes of demonic possession and a family curse. Also known as \"Fengriffen\" and \"Bride of Fengriffen\". Adapted from the novel by David Case."
