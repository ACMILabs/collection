        "Episode of Series \"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection\". Set in 2015, in a post-holocaust world, with half the population annihilated, this made for television animated series mixes science fiction, action, mystery and adventure with humour. Evangelion is the name of the most powerful combat weapon ever made by man, but one that requires a young human pilot to manipulate it. The war for the fate of mankind shifts to a new field of battle as a promotion for Misato sparks an introspective review of the events behind her early recruitment into NERV. Against a fresh wave of attacks, Shinji and Misato much face up to their conflicted feelings for their respective fathers, whilst trying to save the earth from destruction. This disc, Collection 0:4, contains episodes 12-14."
