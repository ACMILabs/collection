        "Crawling, slimy things terror-bent on destroying the world! So runs the tagline for \"The Brain eaters\", classic B-grade science fiction about a mysterious alien structure found jutting out of the earth, in small-town USA. After some studious investigating, a senator and a doctor discover that aliens have infiltrated and are controlling the townsfolk. The terror of a mind-controlling alien threat and subsequent loss of governmental power operates as an analogy for the fear of Communist invasion and the accusations of brainwashing that were likened to the \"Red threat\"."
