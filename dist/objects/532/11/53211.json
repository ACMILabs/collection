        "Finely crafted romantic drama about a young married woman who dutifully cares for her sickly husband, but whose feelings for a former beau reawakens her desire. Set amid the post-WW2 ruins of a small town, this film exquisitely portrays Yuwens longing, which contrasts with her efficient but cold care of her ailing and ill-tempered husband. Director Tian Zhuangzuang (The Blue kite), part of the fifth generation of Chinese filmmakers observes his protagonists through doorways and windows, providing an apt metaphor for their inability to connect. A film that allows the tension to build in a languid but effective manner, as the three angst ridden players make their choices. Cast includes Hu Jingfan, Wu Jun, Xin Baiqing, Ye Xiaokeng and Lu Sisi."
