    "description": [
        "Entertaining, illuminating and exhaustively researched Canadian documentary about the rise in power and stature of corporations, and the impact felt throughout the world. Many topics are examined over the course of this work including exploitation of developing countries, company fraud, environmental impact of business on the natural world, business ethics, corporate espionage, media power, censorship, globalisation, marketing manipulation, privatisation and protests. Featuring a wide array of interviews, witty graphics and a soothing voice-over, the filmmakers succeed in making the complexities of the issues at play here understood whilst enrapturing the audience. Winner of the Best Documentary World Cinema Audience Award at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. Interviewees include: Naomi Klein, Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky."
