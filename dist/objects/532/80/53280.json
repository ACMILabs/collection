        "The swinging sixties are reflected in this free-love erotica romance produced and directed by Radley Metzger. Portrayed via highly stylised costume and set design, the hedonistic lifestyle indulged by Marguerite (Daniele Gaubert) and her friends is in the realm of fantasy. How the very wealthy (or proteges of the wealthy such as Marguerite) spend their time - with wild parties, drugs and alcohol fuelling their passions. The swarthy Armand (Nino Castenuovo) arrives in Rome and instantly falls for Marguerite, upsetting the 'live for now' approach she has to love. They begin an affair that sees them run away to live on a yacht until Armand's father intervenes trying to save his son's money and reputation. Marguerite returns to her old ways and ends up relying more on drugs to get her through the pain of loosing her true love. They see each other again at a kinky 'prison' themed sex party and Camille ends up in hospital where the lovers are able to re-unite. The '2000' of the title not a reference to a year but to the number of lovers Armand would have to have before he could forget Marguerite! Based on the novel \"The Lady of the Camilias\" by Alexandre Dumas. Shot in Rome with music by Piero Piccioni. Cast includes Elenora Rossi, Robert Bisacco."
