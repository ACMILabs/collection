        "Episode of Series \"The Blues Collection = Martin Scorsese presents The Blues a musical journey [DVD]\". Part of Martin Scorsese's \"The Blues Collection\", \"Feel like going home\" is Scorsese's own directorial contribution, tracing the blues from the Mississippi Delta back to its roots in the Niger River, Mali. Musician Corey Harris acts as a guide along the journey, conducting interviews with a variety of musicians and engaging in song with several. Whilst examining the musical milieu of the Mississippi Delta, Scorsese addresses the work of Alan Lomax, the pioneering musicologist who recorded innumerable obscure American musicians and singers. Presents brilliant vintage footage of early blues men, such as Son House and John Lee Hooker whilst painting a picture of the rural poverty that dominated the lives of these future greats. Original performances include Willie King, Corey Harris, Taj Mahal, Keb Mo, Otha Turner, Habib Koite, Salif Keita, and Ali Farke Toure."
