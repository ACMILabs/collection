Old enmities erupt as hostilities break out amongst the guests as the party disintegrates into an alcoholic disaster. Cast includes Ray Barrett, Graham Kennedy, John Hargreaves, Graeme Blundell, Jeanie Drynan and Clare Binney. DVD special two-disc collectors' edition containing a 'must see' interview-style documentary (over two hours long), researched, edited and directed by Mark Hartley.
