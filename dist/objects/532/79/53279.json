        "This erotic fantasy film is set in an ancient Italian castle where a man and woman live with her adult son. Opening with the family viewing a pornographic movie and commenting on it, the trio then venture out to the local carnival where they meet the star of the movie now working as a motorcycle stuntwoman. They invite the woman back to the house to have a 'party' and watch the film together. Bizarrely she is no longer in the film and has been replaced. One by one the mysterious blonde seduces each of the family members resulting a sexual awakening for all of them, until in the end, physical reality is lost to them and they too become part of movie for others to watch. Highly stylised sets, costumes and funky music add to the swinging sixties feel of this Radley Metzger fantasy romp. Based on the story \"Hide and Seek\" by Michael De Forrest and Radley Metzger. Cast includes Silvana Venturelli, Frank Wolff, Erika Remberg, Paolo Turco."
