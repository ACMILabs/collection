    "description": [
        "Set in a sleepy US town by the name of \"Suddenly\", an attractive war widow and mother of young son \"Pidge\" is pursued by the local sheriff Todd Shaw (Sterling Hayden) with romance in mind. Todd gets word that the President of the United States is to make an impromptu visit to the town and the FBI arrive to set up a secure perimeter around the railway station. Overlooking the station is the home of the widow Ellen (Nancy Gates) and her father-in-law (James Gleason), an ex-secret service agent. The film becomes a hostage drama as three gangsters lead by John Barron (Frank Sinatra) attempt to assassinate the president with a rifle from the house on the hill. The film provides a commentary on the role of the hand-gun in a post-world war America. Because of the similarity of the plot to real life, the film was withdrawn from general distribution after the assassination of JFK. Part of a two-disc set, with one disc being an Audio CD. Also contains a booklet with information and photos of Frank Sinatra."
