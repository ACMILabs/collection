        "Informative and reasonably honest account of the life of Mick Fleetwood, drummer and leader of the legendary rock band Fleetwood Mac. Utilising stills, archival footage and a slew of interviews both with Fleetwood and his contemporaries, this work elucidates the incredible immoderation of a successful rock musician's life. Drink, drugs, women, limousines, jet planes, extensive travelling parties, money -- in short, excess of just about everything that is a feature of the lifestyle. Fleetwood admits the drugs were nearly his undoing as well as the (well documented) shifting relationships in the band and the claustrophobic environment of relentless touring and recording. Interviewees include: Lindsay Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie."
