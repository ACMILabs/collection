        "A fine film by Kurosawa, in which a wandering samurai exploits two gangs who are fighting for control of a village. Very much a tongue-in-cheek samurai film, with Toshiro Mifune quite superb as the warrior who teaches both warring factions a lesson. Reverred for its black humour and technical mastery, \"Yojimbo\", like many of Kurosawa's works, was later remade -- by Sergio Leone, as \"A fistful of dollars\". Also available on VHS [301894]."
