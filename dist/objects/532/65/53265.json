        "A sci-fi film about a 16-year-old albino boy who, having spent all his life living in his grandparents basement until their passing away, suddenly finds himself in a totally foreign environment when he is removed from his home and placed into school. Jeremy Reed (Sean Patrick Flanery) nick-named Powder, has special powers but his strange physical appearance and behaviour causes division within the school and the community with bigotry and hatred on one side and respect and friendship on the other. An unusual modern day fable. Cast includes Mary Steenburgen, Lance Henriksen, Jeff Goldblum."
