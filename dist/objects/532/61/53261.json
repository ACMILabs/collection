        "Film adaptation of the classic 19th century novel 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by American writer, Mark Twain. This is a story about Huck Finn (Elijah Wood), a poor uneducated boy who has run away from home to escape his abusive drunken father, and Huck's chance encounter with Jim (Courtney S. Vance), an escaped slave. Together the two follow the Mississippi River finding adventure and drama and some rather dubious characters by the names of the King (Jason Robards) and the Duke (Robbie Coltrane). Cast also includes Ron Perlman and Laura Bundy."
