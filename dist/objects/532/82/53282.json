        "Episode of Series \"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection\". Set in 2015, in a post-holocaust world, with half the population annihilated, this made for television animated series mixes science fiction, action, mystery and adventure with humour. Evangelion is the name of the most powerful combat weapon ever made by man, but one that requires a young human pilot to manipulate it. As the human race cowers in subterranean cities, a deadly war is raged between survivors and the mysterious beings known as Angels. As the Angels and the Evangelions engage in deadly battle, the mystery of why the earth was attacked remains unsolved. This disc, Collection 0:1, contains episodes 1-4. Also available on VHS [309090]."
