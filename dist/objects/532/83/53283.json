Set in 2015, in a post-holocaust world, with half the population annihilated, this made for television animated series mixes science fiction, action, mystery and adventure with humour. Evangelion is the name of the most powerful combat weapon ever made by man, but one that requires a young human pilot to manipulate it. In this instalment, the young pilots must overcome their personal conflicts, in order to stave off the enemy. This disc, Collection 0:2, contains episodes 5-8."
