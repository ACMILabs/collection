        "Sequel to Disney's \"The Shaggy Dog\" (released 17 years earlier), this family comedy is full of slapstick moments and a plot that takes you from the world of reality to the fantastic and bizarre. Dean Jones stars as the now grown-up Wilby Daniels, who is campaigning to become a district attorney and Keenan Wynn plays his villainous arch-rival, John Slade. The campaign is turned on its head when Daniels is transformed into a sheepdog and Slade into a disgruntled bulldog and it becomes a contest between the two canines. Cast also includes Tim Conway, Suzanne Pleshette, Jo Ann Worley."
