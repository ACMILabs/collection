        "Made before Kurosawa's breakthrough film \"Rashomon\", \"Scandal\" is about a young painter, Ichiro, who finds himself embroiled in a scandal, when, whilst holidaying, he offers a motorbike ride to a famous singer. When two paparazzi witness this innocent outing they transform the incident into a torrid affair between the two. Outraged, Ichiro decides to sue, but the lawyer he employs - himself in a compromised situation - is easily bribed. A morality tale about the freedom of the press versus the rights of the individual, Kurosawa addresses the Americanisation of post-war Japan with his melodramatic screenplay, co-written with Ryuzo Kikushima. Beautiful black and white cinematography and impressive performances by Yoshiko Yamaguchi and Takashi Shimura."
