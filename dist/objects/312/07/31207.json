        "An animated cartoon to help children explore why and how animals move as they do. A little boy discovers that he cannot compete with animals - monkey, snake, horse etc - by imitating the way they move. He only outdistances them when he climbs into a vehicle that can travel in any environment - proving that, while other animals are trapped by their environment, man, the inventor, isn't. An award winning film."
