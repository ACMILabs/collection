        "Opening with the traditional swearing-in ceremony of the Governor of Victoria (Sir henry Winneke) this film briefly surveys the historic beginnings of the Victorian Parliament, including its architecture and design. From there it shows procedures relating to Victoria's 46th Parliament. The work of the Governor, Legislative Assembly and Council, various committees and Officers of Parliament is viewed and there is a glimpse of the Parliamentary library."
