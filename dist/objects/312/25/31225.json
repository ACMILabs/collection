        "This is a dance of Russian dolls, as lively in its way as any performance of the Moiseyev Company. But these are painted wooden dolls, hollow inside and of graded sizes so that the largest holds all the rest. What the animator does with them makes for a charming film fantasy. They twirl, swing and sway to gay Russian tunes, never losing their fixed reserve. As the dance ends they hop up in turn into the mother figure, who then hurries off the scene. (Award: New York)"
