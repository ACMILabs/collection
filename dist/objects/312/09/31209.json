        "Wistful harmonica music drifting from an unknown apartment leads Sam and his little brother Ben on a search for its origin. Their discovery provides them with an insight beyond vision and a sense of beauty in the midst of gloom. Subtle tones of greys, greens and purples and the accompanying harmonica score enhance this poignant film. Based on the book by Ezra Jack Keats. Narrated by Charles Turner, music by Sugar Blue."
