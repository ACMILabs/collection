        "One of three films as part of the National Drug Education Program which takes an in-depth view of drug addiction in the day-to-day lives of ordinary people. The central character is a teenage boy who found the courage to give up heavy marijuana smoking. His motive was simply the challenge itself, but the price of his success is rejection by his lifelong friends and associates who accuse him of simply substituting one source of stimulation for another. Photography by Dean Semler. (See also \u2018Thirst\u2019 [012683] and \u2018All in the same boat\u2019 [012758].)"
