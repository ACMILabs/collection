        "Serious dedicated attention is characteristic of the play activity of a well balanced happy infant or child. Filmed in the Loczy Institute, the film shows how varied persevering and concentrated the activity of even the youngest baby can be if his play space affords the opportunity for many kinds of motor activity, and his play things are well chosen."
