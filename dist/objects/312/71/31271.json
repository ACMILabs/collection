        "Special Delivery looks like a detective story and sounds like a soap opera. A series of misadventures stretches the imagination to its limits, as Alice and Ralph Phelps battle with the snow and the dead mailman. A comic moral tale which warns of the perils of the slippery slope! Winner of the 1979 Academy Award for Best Animated Short."
