        "Episode of Series \"Mathematics in the Infant/First School\". The partitive and measure aspects of division are introduced when a group of children discuss two sharing situations and begin to make a wall chart. The program changes direction near the end to show children applying the four operations they have considered, to find as many ways of writing \"6\" as they can discover."
