        "An animated parable that deals with a familiar subject in an amusing way. We join in the business ventures of J.B. Edwards, an Easterner, who went West to create a fuel company called Consolidated Dragons. The company's profits were sorely affected when the supply of dragons started to dry up. A solution had to be found - and was. Designed to encourage discussion of energy conservation. (Awards: Yorkton, Rio de Janeiro)"
