        "Charlie is a shepherd. He has a cosy house, a big hat, a crook, a flock of fat sheep - and a tattered cloak. In the springtime, Charlie decides to make himself a new red cloak. He shears his sheep and fashions his new garment from the wool. This animated film, sparked by a whimsical Italian tarantella musical score, follows the process of making woollen cloth into clothing with charm and wry humour. The conclusion will delight - and not altogether surprise - the young viewer. Written and animated by Tomie de Paola from his book of the same name."
