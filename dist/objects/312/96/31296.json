        "In the African dawn, thunderclouds gather, welcomed by croaking frogs in the marshes. Monkeys swing on trees, lion cubs pull one another's tails and the gnu, antelope and giraffe suckle their young. The animals of the savanna hunt and play. The sound of a rifle shatters the magic. Animals disappear - one by one - in a dramatic climax that makes a poignant plea for conservation. Filmed, without spoken commentary, by Robin Lehman in Kenya, Tanzania and Zaire."
