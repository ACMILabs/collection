        "Tops are among man's oldest and most popular toys. This non-narrated film features 123 spinning tops from different lands. The essence of tops is captured as the stages of their movement are displayed. The second in the unfinished trilogy of toy films (ships would have been next). Music by Elmer Bernstein."
