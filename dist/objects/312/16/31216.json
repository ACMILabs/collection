        "Episode of Series \"The wonderful world of Paddington Bear\". During winter, the Browns have a bath house and sauna built in their backyard. Mr Curry notices the new sauna and decides to try it for himself. This dismays Paddington and the Browns, since not even Mr Brown has had a chance to use it. Paddington offers to put his combination padlock on the door to keep Mr Curry out but mistakenly locks himself in. Paddington fumbles with the lock but Judy eventually manages to open it. Narrated by Michael Hordern."
