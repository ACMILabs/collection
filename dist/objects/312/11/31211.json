        "An animated adaptation of a Pete Seeger Folk-song about a farmer who witnesses a bullfrog falling into the mud and makes up a catchy song about it. Soon the whole town is singing it. When the frog hears the popular song about himself he explodes with pride, imparting a valuable lesson to all. Buoyant illustrations seem to dance along the screen."
