        "A poignant study of adult illiteracy and its effect on the lives of one in ten adults in our community. The Department of Further Education is working on a new program that may provide an answer in the field of reading education. The aim of the film is to remove some of the shame illiterate people in the community feel, and to convince them they should do something about it."
