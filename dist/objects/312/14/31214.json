        "To the tune of \"Turkey In The Straw\", the little red hen Rosie struts across the barnyard keeping her country cool, while unknowingly leading a stalking fox into one disaster after another. The spirited country music accompanying Pat Hutchins' colourful illustrations make this suspenseful story a delightful fast-moving film."
