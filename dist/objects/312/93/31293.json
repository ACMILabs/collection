        "An example to educators of what can be done to arouse and maintain children's interest in the arts. Howard Spicer is known to thousands of school children all over Australia as \"Big H\" - the Operatic Bikie. Dressed in leather, he rides his motorbike into classrooms and introduces young people to opera. Using Spicer's work as an example the film illustrates the concept of innovative arts. Suitable for secondary years 7-12, teachers and tertiary level."
