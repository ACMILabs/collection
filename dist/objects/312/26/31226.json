        "A slapstick comedy in the manner of the old favourites directed and acted in by Gerald Patterson, who plays chauffeur to a partly eccentric business tycoon. Filmed in the winter playground of the Laurentians; the tycoon has a fondness for tobogganing and reading his financial news at the same time; inevitably he takes a headlong plunge downhill on a runaway sled with the chauffeur in hot pursuit."
