        "The lyrical quality of Maurice Sendak's rhyming verses lends charm to this story, designed to help teach the fundamentals of counting. The young viewer will be enchanted by the clever Johnny, who knows best how to rid himself of a whole houseful of unwanted company. An extract from 'Really Rosie' adapted from 'The Nutshell Kids' by Maurice Sendak, with music by Carole King. Suitable for lower primary level."
