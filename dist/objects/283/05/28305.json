        "Attention is concentrated on the temperate regions of the earth. These are shown to lie between the Tropical and Polar regions. Owing to the tilting of the earth's axis and its movement round the sun, the temperature of these regions is very different at opposite times of the year. This point is brought out by examining the position regarding temperature in these regions in June and December. Then the two transitional seasons, in March and September, are also examined."
