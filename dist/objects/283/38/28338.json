        "The boy decides to wag school because of a punishment given to him the previous day. He spends the time wandering around the docks smoking, thinking up excuses for his teacher, watching the loading and unloading of ships, standing, dwarfed in a drydock, hoping to fulfil his ambition to leave school and become apprenticed to one of the people he is watching - the welders, the painters, the carpenters. En glish adaptation by Peter Graham."
