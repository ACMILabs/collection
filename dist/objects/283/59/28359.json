        "A dramatisation of Benjamin Franklin's principle of human association as applied to modern salesmanship. The following rules for successful selling are suggested: Get the prospect talking; don't argue but be pleasant and helpful; agree with the customer, answering \"yes..., but...\"; don't contradict and avoid being too positive; make the most use of time, bringing points of direct interest to the customer with other points about the product."
