        "Odilon Redon was a major figure in the French Symbolist movement. He dedicated his art to \"bringing to life improbable beings\", searching for them in the world of dreams. The film shows many of his early charcoal drawings and lithographs and ends with his pastels and oils and the frescoes of \"Night\" and \"Day\" at the Abbay de Fontfroide."
