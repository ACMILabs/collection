        "This documentary on the life and work of shipbuilders on Scotland's Clyde River is historically notable as one of the last films on which John Grierson was creatively credited, preparing the outline treatment from which American Hilary Harris worked. Harris, who had previously produced interesting experimental work delivers inventive images and clever editing. Made for the Clyde Shipbuiders Association and the Films of Scotland Committee. Commentary by Bryden Murdoch. (Award: Oscar Best Short Subject/Best Live Action, 1961)."
