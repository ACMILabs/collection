        "An allegorical film suggesting the contact of matter and man; the encounter, sometimes obsessive, sometimes glorifying, of the human being and his environment. To develop his theme the film animator uses only photographs, creating varying perspective's through optical manipulation and changing colour. The effect is bold and provocative."
