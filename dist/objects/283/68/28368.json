        "When Mrs Morgan, a dependent and inadequate housewife, loses her husband, her two children become neglected and unwanted, especially when their mother decides to marry again - to a useless and workshy man who has no feeling for them. They lose their sense of belonging, and the boy, Martin, becomes unstable and drifts into delinquency. The story of this family, over a period of years, is seen through the eyes of a Child-care Officer from the Children's Department of the Local Authority, and through it, a picture of an extensive welfare service is built up."
