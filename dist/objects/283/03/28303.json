        "The continuity of this film is taken from a mid-fifteenth century illuminated manuscript, written by Rene, Duke of Anjou, Count of Provence and King of naples, and illustrated by his court painters. The story of the film contemporary with Spencer's Faerie Queen, tells of the King's dream in which he saw the Human Heart in its search for maturity and a place in the community of men of good will."
