        "This film deals with the international exchange of information through modern means of communication - press, radio, films, television, telegraph, cablegram. Half the human race does not have yet the means to hear the other half; half the human race remains a prey to superstition, poverty, ignorance, disease, fallacy and distortion of the truth. This is a history of the development of communications and how the UNO is working to break down the barriers to progress and international understanding."
