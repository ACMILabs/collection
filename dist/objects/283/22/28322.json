        "Shows how a secretary goes about arranging her work for the day. She begins by making out an appointment sheet for her employer and then deals with the mail, both business and personal; takes dictation, arranges her employer's itinerary, handles callers, writes letters and supervises other workers. Before she leaves work she makes out her duties for the following day. The film distinguishes between the work of a stenographer and that of a secretary and emphasises the value to a business of an efficient staff."
