        "Utilising over 400 photographs, the spirit of London of the 19th century is captured in dramatic style. Early modes of steam transport are shown, in particular the steam trains of the Underground. A familiar sight in the streets of London was also the horse-drawn vehicle. English people of the 19th century are also depicted at their jobs and in their leisure activities. Narrated by Anthony Quayle."
