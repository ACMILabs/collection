        "Photographed aboard the training ship, HMAS Australia, the film illustrates how young recruits are receiving practical instruction in technical trades and seamanship, preparing them for a career of travel and adventure in the Royal Australian Navy. The action of the film culminates in exercises, staged off the Tasmanian coast, in which naval forces from different parts of the British Commonwealth took part."
