        "Shows the volcanic activity of the island of Surtsey near Iceland throughout 1965-l966. Submarine eruptions create the temporary neighbouring islands of Syrtlingur and Jolnir, reduced to shoals soon after they cease erupting. After a quiescent period new eruptions begin on Surtsey itself. Meanwhile scientific investigations continue, a permanent base is established and plant life appears. A continuation of the film Birth of an Island (502828)."
