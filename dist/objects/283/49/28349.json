        "For 246 days Australian Infantry and British troops held the town of Tobruk. This film records the highlights of the seige which began on 9th April, 1941. Day and night the guns in and around the town were manned and only once was the garrison breached. The \"back door\" of Tobruk, the port, was kept open, although there were sunken ships in the harbor. Plans were made for the capture of enemy strongholds in Libya and the climax of the film is reached with the capture and holding of the El Dodo ridge by the Tobruk garrison. For nine days they held the ridge until the arrival of the British Eighth Army. Outlines the events leading up to and during the siege. Includes action shots of the capture of enemy positions in the course of breaking of the siege."
