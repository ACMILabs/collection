        "Episode of Series \"The Secretary\" A good secretary has the proper materials organised to respond quickly to the boss's call. She knows correct posture, how to indicate special instructions, when to interrupt and when not, how to \"key\" dictation to letters being answered, and other routine procedures. Less often, she may record phone conversations or take the minutes of a meeting."
