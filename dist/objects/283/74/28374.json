        "Episode of Series \"This Is Britain\". Countless guidebooks to the epicurean delights of the Continent have obscured to many, the traditional delicacies of the British table and cellar. This film shows some of the delicacies which have made Britain famous; the haggis, kippers and whisky of Scotland, the York ham, Oxford marmalade and the Stilton cheeses of the towns and cities of provincial England. In London, at the \"Cheshire Cheese\" tavern in Fleet Street, visitors may partake of the celebrated \"Pudding\" - made with rump steak, kidneys and oysters and weighing some 60 pounds."
