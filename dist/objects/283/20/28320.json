        "Begins by showing the difference between the work of a stenographer and that of a secretary. The importance of a systematic approach to work is stressed. The efficient secretary is shown at work. She keeps a card file of frequently-used addresses and knows the use of reference books. She uses a clear system in transcribing shorthand notes and checks her work while it is still in the typewriter, and is thus able to correct mistakes quickly and neatly."
