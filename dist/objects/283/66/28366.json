        "A sensitive issue in almost every plant: the question of whether a new, attractive job should go to the man who has served the company long and well, or to a younger man, low in seniority but who, in the eyes of management, represents a better long-term investment. A newly installed computer operation in a factory gives rise to such a dispute and, finally, to union grievance action."
