        "Examines the causes of violence and destruction and shows how violence operates in a cycle which in turn stimulates retaliation and revenge. Shows how the violent urge exists in childhood as well as adulthood, focusing on bullying in the schoolground and male to female violence in teenagers - both verbal and physical abuse. Covers the topic of boredom as the reason for violent destructive behaviour. Contains some animated scenes. Suitable for upper primary and secondary levels."
