        "Episode of Series \"Management Techniques\". One of a series of films about some of the problems of forecasting, and of trying to achieve control through forecasts, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized firms. Intuition and detached statistical forecasts are both highly vulnerable to the unexpected. Unless this limitation can be overcome, forecasting is of no use to management."
