        "Sadie Benning's video diaries form a unique record of the development of a young artist. Within the confines of her bedroom, she creates a dense experimental work about a teenagers search for sexual and non-conformist expression. 'If Every Girl Had a Diary' is an intimate insight into suburban malaise and alienation, as well as being a defiantly accomplished piece of video art."
