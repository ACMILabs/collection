        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". John Norton was one of Australia's earliest and most colourful, if not likeable, Press barons. He was an eccentric with a power complex who controlled a chain of newspapers which extended across Australia and New Zealand. Norton was a crusading journalist, the people's hero, the friend of the working class, but his overwhelming self interest eventually dominated his actions."
