        "A play written by Jim Allen and set during the 1977 Silver Jubilee. Britain seems to be in a state of rejoicing, and there seems to be plenty of money to spend on the festivities, but Pauline has nothing to cheer about. She has four children, the eldest is a Downs Syndrome child, she has no income and because of the family cannot go out to work. In theory the social service exists to help those in such situations. In practice there are tribunals, councils and welfare departments to be faced."
