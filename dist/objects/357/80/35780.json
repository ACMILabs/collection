        "Set in Melbourne's industrialised Western suburbs, \"LoverBoy\" is a dramatic story of love and revenge. It is the story of a love affair between a 16 year old boy, Mick, and a 45 year old woman, Sally. Brought together by loneliness and their bleak environment, they find some short- lived comfort in each other's arms. But what begins innocently, degenerates into bitterness and violence, and leads to a shattering conclusion in which their lives are changed forever. Cast includes Gillian Jones, Noah Taylor, Alice Garner and Ben Mendelsohn."
