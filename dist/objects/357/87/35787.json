        "The famous characters of Australia's most loved comic strip are brought to life in this full-length movie. Tracing the mischievous antics of Ginger Meggs, his friends and foes, the film is a series of vividly visual misadventures as \"Meggsie\" and his gang create havoc and uproar through their larrikin ways of dodging the law and, more often than not, plunging headfirst into trouble."
