        "Frank Hurley (1885-1962) was firmly established by 1925 as Australia's most famous photographer. After World War 1, having filled the position as the first official photographer of the Australian war effort, Hurley became interested in Papua New Guinea. In December 1920, he left Australia to record the work of Anglican missions in Papua and to make \"travelogue entertainment\". The result was this documentary, \"Pearls and Savages\" which was released in Sydney, in December 1921."
