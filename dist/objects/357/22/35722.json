        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Children Growing Up\". This program covers the range and pattern of normal physical development and, where possible, relates this to the emotional changes which occur. However, children of the same chronological age may vary enormously in their true maturity. This has implications for school assessment, relationships and the early choice of future careers."
