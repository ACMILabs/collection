        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". PGR looks at the First Aid kit, and what extra items are required when there are children in the house. We also show what to do in the event of a nose bleed or a tooth being knocked out. How childhood asthma affects children and their parents is also examined, with the support of the Asthma Foundation. Paula talks with a vet about the value of pets to children, and they discuss proper pet care procedures. Colin looks at the effects of poor co-ordination on young children, what parents need to watch for, and how training programs for clumsy children can make a big difference to their lives. It also includes an easy to remember guide on how to react to all first aid situations."
