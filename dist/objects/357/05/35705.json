        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". PGR discusses the question: who is the child's first educator?, and we talk with parents about their role as educators. The role of kindergartens is examined, and we demonstrate how to encourage a love of learning. We look at the importance of language in the learning process, at various aspects of early speech acquisition, and provide tips on the encouragement of a child to develop language skills. PGR also examines the role books and music can play in a child's early learning development, and we examine the social aspect of developing learning skills."
