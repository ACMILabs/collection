        "Episode of Series \"Oceans of Dreams - Currents of Change Series\". The last Pacific Kingdom, Tonga, has a unique history, social and political system. Tonga was the only Pacific nation not to be colonised. Its special relationship of friendship and protection by Britain gave way to complete independence in 1970. Today, Tonga is devoutly Christian, with strong traditional values and attitudes. It faces the problem of a rising population, decreasing supply of land and the changes which affect all Pacific nations. Tonga has countered some of the challenges by a policy of encouraging light industry and tourism. Its other safety valve is migration; an estimated 25 per cent of Tongans live abroad and the film examines this issue as well as portraying contemporary life in Tonga."
