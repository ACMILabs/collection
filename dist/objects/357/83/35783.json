        "This is the dog's tale: his first encounter with the sexy bitch Jess; his loyal devotion to Wal Footrot, whom he saves from a fate worse than death; his adventures with Horse, the cat with the barracuda jaw and fishhook claws; his brilliant cowardice and mighty nose, pitted against the dastardly schemes of the villainous Murphys, their hell hounds, and the croco pigs. Based on the comic strip of the same name."
