        "Unusually, the focus here is on the sexual and social rites of passage of two teenage girls in a male-dominated world. Debbie and Sue are accepted into the Greenhills' gang, an elite group occupying a particular stretch of Cronulla beach. As surfie groupies Debbie and Sue are required to submit to male whims. Although the girls are proposed as subjects the film maintains a humorously ironic distance from the awfulness of the scene, particularly through the use of narration. The boys, collectively dominant, are individually consigned to the margins. Debbie and Sue are the real mates who ultimately break out of the confines of male-imposed rules. Cast includes: Nell Schofield, Jad Capelja, Geoff Rhoe, Tony Hughes. Based on the book by Cathy Lette and Gabrielle Carey."
