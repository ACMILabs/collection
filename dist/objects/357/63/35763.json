        "Episode of Series \"Oceans of Dreams - Currents of Change Series\". Niue is the world's largest coral atoll and the world's smallest nation. A New Zealand protectorate from 1901 until 1974, Niue is now self-governing. All Niueans are New Zealand citizens and this has encouraged a trend in depopulation; 10,000 Niueans live in New Zealand, 2,300 live on Niue itself. The island enjoys a high standard of living but is isolated through poor transport and communication links. It also has the problems of a tiny economic base, and trying to retain a cultural identity. The film examines the contemporary issues and challenges facing Niue and its people."
