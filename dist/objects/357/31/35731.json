        "Danton, a film of highly dramatic power, at once a mature study of the revolutionary mentality and an absorbing intellectual spectacle. \"L'Incorruptible\" Robespierre holds fast to the ideals of the French Revolution as it turns into a reign of terror. Tired of the bloodshed, Danton pleads for a negotiated peace with the enemies on France's borders. Both are idealists. Both are right. Both are doomed. Stars Gerard Depardieu as Danton."
