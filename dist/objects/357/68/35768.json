        "Episode of Series \"Oceans of Dreams - Currents of Change Series\". The nine islands forming Western Samoa are the heartland of Polynesia. Western Samoa became the first independent South Pacific nation in 1962. Christianity first reached the islands in 1830 and was embraced enthusiastically. Many of its values complemented the Samoan customs. Today these forces co-exist in harmony and the national motto is \"Samoa is founded on God\". A fast growing population and changing trade patterns are among the challenges which Samoa is facing. The film examines contemporary issues and trends from the Samoans' own viewpoints."
