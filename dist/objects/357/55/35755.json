        "The Gold Rush, an immortal classic, is regarded as one of Chaplin's very best films, interweaving to brilliant effect the pathetic tale of the Tramp's apparently hopeless love for a dancehall girl with the funny story of the Tramp and his burly gold prospecting partner heading off to make their fortunes in the great Yukon gold rush. Through the entire film hangs Chaplin's finely perceived view of the contrast between the Tramp's selfless, humanitarian behaviour, and the unpleasant, brutish life of the gold town society. Rated: G"
