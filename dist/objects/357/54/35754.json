        "Harold Lloyd was a born comedian. Depending more on a storyline than many of his slapstick contemporaries, Lloyd was famous for his timid, bespectacled, \"nice boy\" characters and for thrill-comedy situations, involving dangerous and daring stunt gags. The triumphant climax of \"The Freshman\" became the opening scene of \"The Sin of Harold Diddlebock\" in which, 22 years later, the football hero has become a bent, prematurely old clerk, who is about to be pensioned off early. The film is an hilarious chronicle of his reawakening to the joys of life, as he is plunged into a whirlwind of wild and crazy exploits. \"The Sin of Harold Diddlebock\", a sound feature and Harold Lloyd's last film was also issued under the title \"Mad Wednesday\"."
