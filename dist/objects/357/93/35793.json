        "Anyone can have a bad day, but no one wants to have one quite as awful as seven year old Alexander's. Whether it's his mother forgetting to pack dessert in his lunch, or the dentist discovering he has a new cavity, nothing goes right for Alexander from sun-up to sun-down. Alexander will not only win children's sympathy, he'll remind the child in every adult how those little tragedies can accumulate to make an otherwise normal day seem like a catastrophe. Based on the best selling children's book by Judith Viorst."
