        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". The causes and symptoms of stress are examined here, and we look at ways parents can stop feeling tired and run down. A variety of relaxation techniques are demonstrated, and we discuss ways of relieving loneliness. Mothers talk about the stress associated with trying to live up to other people's expectations, especially when it comes to housework, and we provide hints on how to ease the housework load. Parents describe how they dealt with the anger they felt from the continual demands of their children, and we show how our parenting is influenced by the way we were brought up and what we can do to change it. There are hints on how to manage the end of the day and we discuss the value of your relationship with your partner in reducing stress."
