        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". Lola Montez was one of the most colourful women in Australian history. The adventures of this notorious, internationally famous singer and dancer took her from the dizzy heights of a Royal debut in London, to a Bavarian palace, to the wild goldfields of Australia. Her shows were as big a hit in Sydney and Melbourne as with goldminers in Ballarat. Lola was untrained as a dancer, but her stage presence, audacity and appeal, bewitched audiences wherever she went. Discovering in 1855 that she was terminally ill she toured in an effort to put aside money for her future."
