        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". In this title, viewers questions cover the topics of road safety, appropriate medications, how to handle dummies, the importance of immunisation, the dangers of smoking, and Government allowances for families. PGR also gives some tips for parents whose babies have been fitted with splints. We talk to a Speech Pathologist about childhood stuttering and demonstrate suitable exercises for women recovering from a caesarean. Finally, PGR answers questions specifically concerning SIDS, and we talk to parents about the syndrome."
