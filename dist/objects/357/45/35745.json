        "It's 1917 and the British campaign in Palestine has reached a stalemate. The story focuses on a four-man section of the Australian Lighthorse Regiment and climaxes with the last great cavalry charge in history. In a final attempt to save the attacking British Army from disaster, everything depends on the 800 young Australian horsemen who obey the seemingly impossible order to gallop their horses across 3 miles of open desert into a hell of shell fire and machine gun cross fire. Smashing their way through Turkish defences to win the precious wells of Beersheba, they change the history of the Middle East. The Lighthorsemen is a true and epic story of triumph, love, courage and adventure."
