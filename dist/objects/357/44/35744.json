        "Phar Lap, a big, bold chestnut horse, reigned as king of the turf in the Depression-gripped Australia of the 1930's. From humble beginnings the New Zealand bred horse raced on to become the hero of the nation. With fame comes envy, intrigue and danger. In the quiet streets of Caulfield on Derby Day 1930, an attempt was made to kill the champion. On Melbourne Cup Day, Phar Lap passed into history with yet another win. Phar Lap's fame spread to the United States where he won the Agua Caliente Stakes - the world's richest race - effortlessly, despite an injury. Success bred hatred. Sixteen days later Phar Lap was dead. Australia was in mourning. To this day his death remains a mystery, but the legend remains - the legend of Big Red."
