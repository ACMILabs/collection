        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". General Gordon Bennett is usually remembered as the Australian General who left his troops after Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 and fled back to Australia. He later claimed that he left his men to bring back to Australia first-hand information about the fighting tactics of the Japanese. After the war a Royal Commission praised Bennett's courage, but concluded that he was wrong to have left Singapore. Despite the controversy, nothing could stop Bennett from being present at the docks when his troops finally returned home."
