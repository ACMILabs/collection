        "Episode of Series \"Reel Australia\". Somewhere in the South Seas, a beautiful island has become notorious for the \"fetish and cannibal rites\" of the natives and the \"wild doings\" of the white population. The native chief, Trelua, leads an insurrection against the whites because of the degradation that his people have suffered since the arrival of the whiteman. A British cruiser comes to the rescue and the native rebellion is quelled, but not before the main white oppressor is killed."
