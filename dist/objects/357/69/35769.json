        "Episode of Series \"Oceans of Dreams - Currents of Change Series\". The largest of the newly independent South Pacific Nations (1975), Papua New Guinea, embodies many of the complexities facing the region. Papua New Guinea's land mass includes vast mountain regions, fertile river valleys, coastal flat lands and tropical islands. More than 700 languages are spoken. Old enmities and conflicts still linger on. The greatest challenge facing PNG is to bind its people together in the spirit of one nation. The film looks at the distinctive Huli people, traditional and contemporary life and the challenges which face this exciting nation."
