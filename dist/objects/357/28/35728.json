        "Dot ventures into the bush determined to finally locate the little lost Joey and reunite him with his mother the kangaroo. On her way she meets a silly bunny rabbit who tries to convince Dot that he is the lost Joey she is looking for. Dot politely explains to her new friend that Joeys have pouches and long tails, just like other kangaroos. Determined to convince Dot, the bunny fashions a pouch and a tail for himself from some shrubs and leaves. Dot is delighted and nicknames him Funny Bunny. Together they set out to search for the lost Joey and Dot tries to console Funny Bunny by explaining how important bunnies are especially at Easter."
