        "Angela Lansbury plays a prim and proper Eglantine Price, an amateur English witch who joins up with three cockney waifs to help save war-torn Britain from Nazi invaders. A film for all ages, Bedknobs and Broomsticks features ingenious animation, a hilarious soccer game where crocodiles, elephants, and other animals really kick up a storm. Brass beds fly, nightgowns dance, and airborne brooms sweep away young and old alike to a fun-filled world of fantasy."
