        "In this marvellous Hollywood version of British public school life, Tom Brown finds life at Rugby brutal, but eventually helps to become a civilising influence for his schoolmates. Immediately on arrival at Rugby, Tom is befriended by a character named East and together they begin the age old battle against the schoolyard bully. This classic novel is a story of courage, survival of the initiation ritual, and the struggle for acceptance."
