        "Episode of Series \"PGR Series\". In this title we commence by differentiating between self concept and self-esteem. We discuss how by the age of two, a child has a well developed self concept. The crucial role of parents in the development of a child's self-esteem is discussed, and we show how an understanding of child development is helpful in fostering good self-esteem in a child. We use dramatisations to show how parental behaviours influence child self-esteem, and conclude by discussing with two parents changes they made in their approach to their children."
