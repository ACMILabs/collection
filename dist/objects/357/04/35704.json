        "This humorous presents the associated health risks of smoking and passive smoking in an often graphic but factual manner. \"Confessions\" calls for a total ban on tobacco promotion and its message to viewers is clear. If you smoke, quit. If you don't , don't be conned into smoking and avoid being a victim of passive smoking. It is presented by Dr Arthur Chesterfield-Evans, whose experience in surgery on cancer victims led him to become an activist in BUGAUP (Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions) and in the legal activities of the Non-Smokers Movement of Australia."
