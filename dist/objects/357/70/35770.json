        "The Day of the Bunny Picnic is the most exciting day of the year as every bunny knows, because it is the day the `storyteller' arrives. Two bunnies, Twitch and Lugsy, are looking after their little brother, Bean. They are all on their way to visit their Great,Great,Great,Great Grandmother to borrow some thistle essence for their mother's picnic cake. Along the way Bean spots something that no one else has ever seen, a DOG. When Bean tells everyone that he has seen a dog, they think he is telling tales. When the barking dog appears they all run for cover but the story ends happily with Friendly the dog living amongst all the cute bunnies in the forest."
