        "A young woman, an aspiring writer, gets a job selling tickets in a New York porno cinema. She becomes intrigued by the milieu and begins to follow one particular customer who travels around in a chauffer-driven limousine. Her initial fascination grows into obsession; in her imagination fantasy and reality become increasingly difficult to separate. While the filmmaker provides access to the film through the pleasures of narrative conventions she ultimately seeks to disrupt and reverse the roles and conventions of the thriller form in order to directly confront representations of sexuality and male/female desire, more specifically a woman's developing fascination with her own sexuality. Christine's fantasised position oscillates between the one who looks, the one who is looked at and the one who observes the voyeur."
