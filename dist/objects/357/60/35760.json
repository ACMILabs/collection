        "Episode of Series \"Oceans of Dreams - Currents of Change Series\". The Cook Islands are a collection of small coral atolls spread over a vast area of the South Pacific Ocean. They are inhabited by Polynesian Maoris who are closely linked to New Zealand Maoris. The Cook Islands' other links with New Zealand are economic and political. Once a protectorate of New Zealand, the Cook Islands are now self-governing but their people are citizens of New Zealand. More of them now live there than in their home islands. A cultural renaissance is taking place in the Cooks, partly encouraged by tourism, the education system and by the wishes of the people. This is but one of the issues and changes which the film examines in a contemporary account of life in these islands."
