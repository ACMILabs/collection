        "This is an inspiring portrait of Carl Gustav Jung, a man whose genius and humanity caused his voice to reach far beyond the exclusive realm of psychiatry into redefining the essential nature of who we are and what we hope to become. More than just a linear biography, this program presents a fuller perspective of this healer, using rare home movies, archival footage, and a wealth of interviews."
