        "A 2D hand-drawn animation, 'Darn tootin' is a spoof on the masculiny of cowboys depicted in Westerns. The animation has many mixed references...An American accented cowboy rides into town and says hello to a cross-dressing Aussie accented blacksmith. Another American cowboy asks him for a drink, the two walk hand in hand into the saloon (USA pub) bearing a sign reading No Singlets, No thongs (an Australian reference). The foley used throughout places the 'Western' town in Australia with the sounds of Australian birds."
