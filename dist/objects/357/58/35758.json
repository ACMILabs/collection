        "Nothing in 11 year old Michael Baskin's vivid imagination can prepare him for the strange and enchanting adventure that he is about to embark on, an adventure that will change his life. Where an abandoned mansion holds a secret so frightening that it scares off little boys! Where friendly ghosts pass on magic potions made of peanut butter! Where an odd mystical artist paints pictures so real you can walk into them! And where magic and imagination are the most wonderful things of all. Rated: PG"
