        "The Yearling is a story of the Baxter family and their struggle to maintain their small farm. Jody, a twelve year old boy, yearns for a pet with whom he can share the last carefree days of his childhood. He adopts an orphaned fawn but their joyous times are tempered when the fawn grows into a yearling and becomes a threat to the family's meagre crops. Based on Marjorie Kinnen Rawlings' acclaimed novel."
