        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. A bizarre and comical look at a machine which processes different types of people and converts into the same looking character. This animted short depicts the way society homogenises the way people are meant to be and disregards anyone who stands outside of the accepted norm."
