        "A short created by a student for the 2004 ACMI Diegesis secondary school media festival. This moving picture describes bizarre events at a school.  A girl goes missing and two detectives set out to find her.  Once in the school they turn into students and are horrified when they experience ghostly sightings of the victim. They suffer mortal wounds and turn on each other as they are scared out of their wits. Finally they themselves become possessed and are forever trapped at the school, never to escape."
