        "Chris Cunningham's elegant film clip for Bjork's All is full of love depicts the construction and subsequent desire between two intertwined robots. Designed by Cunningham himself, the two machines, whose faces bear more than a passing resemblance to Bjork sensually move in and around each other as a milky white fluid flows over their sexualised bodies."
