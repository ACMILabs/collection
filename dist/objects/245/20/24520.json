        "Exploring the basic influences that shaped the beginnings of India's long and complex history, this survey recounts the early days of original inhabitants, of invasions, and of the rise of great leaders - Buddha, Chandragupta Maurya, and Asoka. The cultural contributions, notably Buddhism and Hinduism, made by successive peoples are seen to have their origins in early India."
