        "A simple presentation of the feedback idea, its growing importance in technology and the use of the data processor for continuous measurement, evaluation and correction in, for example, the petroleum industry and traffic control. Like most of the films by Ray and Charles Eames, this is not traditional in content or approach. Music by Elmer Bernstein."
