        "Japan's economical growth is approximately 10% per year. Japan's growth in the second half of the 20th century has been described as a miracle. Poorly endowed with raw materials it depends heavily upon its greatest assset - its people. They have developed industrial skills of the highest level and are applying them to the wide range of modern industry which make up the nation's economic life."
