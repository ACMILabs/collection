        "Shows how kans grass, a deep-rooted weed, has been spreading through the central plains of India, choking food crops. Shows how the Indian Government received aid from the World Bank, and the arrival in 1949 of 300 tractors purchased with the loan. These are shown as they plough deep to uproot the weed, and as they are turned to other uses such as clearing scrub and rain forests. Includes glimpses of Indian peasants celebrating at their harvest festival."
