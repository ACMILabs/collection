        "Demonstrates the correct method of lifting heavy objects. A flexible model simulating the human backbone is used to illustrate how discs are \"pinched\" when weights are lifted while the backbone is curved. Good posture, positioning, and smooth application of lifting power are shown. Demonstrations point out that using the powerful leg muscles with the back straight and vertical increases lifting power. Extremely heavy items can only be handled with a special lifting device."
