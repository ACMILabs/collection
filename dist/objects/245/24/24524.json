        "Episode of Series \"Educational Psychology\". The case study of a shy, slow child, who is different from his classmates and from his older, socially-adept brother, whose reputation is a constant reminder of his own shortcomings. Everyone needs to succeed, the film points out, and most of all those in terms of individual interests and capabilities. It is the job of the school to shape education to these individual needs."
