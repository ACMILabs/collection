        "An authentic history of America from the view point of its working people, from the early 1900's. Shows how the first unions sprang from bitter disillusionment and traces the history of the people against the background of World War 1, the Twenties, the Depression, the Roosevelt era, and the present day struggles for civil rights. Narrated by Robert Ryan."
