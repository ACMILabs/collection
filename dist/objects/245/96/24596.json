        "The life cycle of the Periodical Cicada. The camera traces it from egg-laying, through the years underground, and the emergence from the nymph state, to the mating of the mature adult. Time-lapse photography is used to show a nymph emerging, and the process that follows to development of the wings of a mature adult."
