        "Describes the growth of the Empire round the Indian Ocean. Barred from the East Indies, the British established themselves on the mainland of India, where they were followed by the French. The rivalry of these two great nations led to their entry into the politics of India, and intense trading, political and naval rivalry until the fall of Napoleon in 1815."
