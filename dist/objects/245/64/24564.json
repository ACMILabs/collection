        "Episode of Series \"PSSC physics\". Edward M. Purcell demonstrates that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass with force constant and that different objects may have the same inertial mass. Compares inertial and gravitational mass and shows how they are proportional. A continuation of the film \"Inertia\"."
