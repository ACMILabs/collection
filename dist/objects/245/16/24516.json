        "Sucksdorff, the distinguished Swedish director visited India in 1951 and made two films \"Wind and the river\" and \"Indian village\". \"Indian village\" was intended to be shown throughout India to persuade peasants to discard their centuries-old methods of cultivation and village administration and to adopt modern methods of co-operation. The story Sucksdorff has chosen is centred on a village in which the people are dependent on an old well which dries up in the hot season, bringing drought and starvation."
