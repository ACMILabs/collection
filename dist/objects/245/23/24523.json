        "Shows the effect of rapid population growth in Indian cities, particularly Calcutta, when rural workers migrate to the cities in an attempt to find work and feed their families. By studying the family of Sarat we learn of the problems of low wages, lack of work, inadequate housing and clothing, undernourishment and little or no education."
