        "Episode of Series \"Asian insight\". What makes this diverse chain of islands into a nation? Indonesia's national motto \"Unity in diversity\" is the film's starting point in its concentration on Sumatra, Java and Bali - the most populated areas. One of the most interesting sequences is an examination of the Indonesian concept of power - that there is a finite amount of it in the world. Another highlight is the Indonesian Army and its role as an essential ingredient in society - not, as so often in the West, as something appended to, or imposed on, society."
