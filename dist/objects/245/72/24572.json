        "Made for the IBM pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair, it attempts to clearly place the electronic computer in the context of human development, suggesting that it is a logical extension of our desire to connect and relate things. Explains the nature of data processing, beginning with primitive man and ending with the advent of machine simulation. Drawings and animation by Dolores Cannata, music by Elmer Bernstein."
