        "Shows the progress India is making towards an indpendent future. Highly competent scientists and technologists argue that India must make herself technologically independent quickly, and to do this she must invest heavily in fundamental research, even though many millions of her people still live in squalor. Shows the Plutonium factory near Bombay, the new steel town of Dargapur, and the first atomic power station under construction at Taraput. Presents the enormous problem of education facing India."
