        "A survey of the festivals of India, seasonal and religious, which take place in large and small communities throughout the land and during all months of the year. Vast numbers of people take part in processions, rituals, re-creations of events, songs and dances to request the assistance of various gods or to thank them for their help during the past year. Brief glimpses of some art forms and decorations associated with the ceremonies are shown."
