        "The great subcontinent of India, comprising both Pakistan and the Union of India, is examined in terms of its four major geographic regions. The range in climate and land forms of these regions is seen to affect both crop production and population density. Life in cities, as well as in rural areas, is surveyed as an aid to understanding these key countries of Asia."
