        "Episode of Series \"Industrial Safety\". Deals with the fundamental question - \"Whose responsibility is safety?\" Asked to prepare a speech on safety, Whitty is forced to take a candid look at his performance in accident prevention. In a dream sequence, he is brought to trial and his jury and witnesses are from work and home. This fantasy provides for some statements which will find their application in the safety experience of most companies."
