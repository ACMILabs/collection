        "Beginning with the rule of the Delhi Sultans in the 13th century, the film traces the subsequent growth of the powerful and enlightened empire of the Moguls, the decline of these rulers, the rise of European interest in India, and the conflict between Britain and France for control of Indian trade, culminating in the Battle of Plassey in 1760."
