        "This film centres on the trip to the market of an Indonesian farmer, Sukanta, and his ten year old son, Djuki. They live in a village four miles from the rapidly growing city of Jakarta. Farm and village life are seen in reflective scenes, and city life is seen through the eyes of Djuki as he accompanies his elder brother, Suriana, a scholarship student at the university, on a walking tour of Jakarta."
