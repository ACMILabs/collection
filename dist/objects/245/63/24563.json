        "Episode of Series \"PSSC physics\". Edward M. Purcell demonstrates Galileo's principle of inertia in experiments with a body moving horizontally with minimal friction and using low friction dry-ice pucks and multiple flash photography showing acceleration is proportional to force when mass is constant. Suitable for upper secondary level."
