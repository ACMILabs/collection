        "In 1931, with Nanook, Moana and Tabu behind him, Flaherty came to London to collaborate with John Grierson's new government-supported documentary unit at the Empire Marketing Board. By 1932, Grierson had recruited a number of young men to the unit who he coached on film projects. This documentary resulted from the collaborative efforts and contributions of such a team. The film celebrates the craftmanship of British workers and as it captures the skills of potters, machinists, glassblowers and other tradesmen engaged in their work. Photographed by Robert Flaherty with additional photgraphy by Basil Wright, Arthur Elton and John Grierson. Edited by Edgar Anstey and John Grierson. Narrated by Donald Calthrop."
