        "Indonesia, since gaining independence, has begun a series of new developments. Thousands of men and women are being taught to read and write as part of a campaign to eradicate illiteracy. An attempt is being made to control the spread of the disease Framboesia, commonly known as yaws. Those already suffering from the disease are given on the spot treatment. While this medical attention is being given research workers are constantly checking its results, and reporting to the World Health Organisation."
