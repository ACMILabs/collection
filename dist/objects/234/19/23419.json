        "Episode of Series \"Romantic vs classic art\". This film traces the disturbing story of Goya's career, the changes in which were apparent in his work. His early work depicted light hearted scenes. As a court painter he was one of the most sought after portrait painters in Madrid. After he became deaf he embarked on a series of etchings depicting a world of deformed bodies. Written and narrated by Kenneth Clark."
