        "From the series \"French from France\", this French language training film teaches students pronunciation of a broad vocabulary in the familiar setting of doing homework. The family all assist Monique in turn, and then her friends call and they all work together on mathematical problems and the theme of an essay. Their discussion of their work repeating key nouns assists in the learning of the vocabulary."
