        "A dramatisation of France's transformation from a shaky constitutional monarchy into a tyrannical republic (1791-1794). Focuses on the enigmatic figure of Robespierre, whose dedication and self-delusion are explored against a background of increasing upheaval and bloodshed by guillotine. In conclusion, the film moves from 18th century France to the masses brutalized by today's totalitarian governments."
