        "This is a special-purpose film prepared for showing by biology teachers for class-room use. The subject of cancer is introduced objectively and unemotionally as one of the basic phenomenon of growth. The concept of cell growth and cell division is presented in terms which provoke interest in the as yet unanswered questions of abnormal cell behaviour."
