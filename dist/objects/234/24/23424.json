        "A stream of electrons is accelerated through mercury vapour, and it is shown that the kinetic energy of the electrons is transferred to the mercury atoms only in discreet packets of energy. The association of the quantum of energy with a line in the spectrum of mercury is established. The experiment retraced in this film was one of the earliest indications of the existence of internal energy states within the atom."
