        "Documents Maier's thesis that frustration leads to fixation and other bizarre sysmptoms. Shows a modified Lashley jumping apparatus and describes the process of teaching rats to jump. Frustrated animals finally assigned to soluble problems persist in fixations in spite of opening correct doors, and although walking trials demonstrate that they know the correct choice. Includes demonstrations of catatonic and neurotic behaviour."
