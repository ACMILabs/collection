        "This film is a combination of live-action scenes with pictorial and sculptural masterpieces of the period. It recreates the chaotic events of the last days of the Old Regime in France. The rebellion of the Third Estate, the storming of the Bastille, the transfer of power from Versailles to Paris. With the establishment of the constitutional monarchy in 1789, the ideals of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, replaced the \"divine rights\" and special privileges of the Old Regime. Narrated by Michael Redgrave."
