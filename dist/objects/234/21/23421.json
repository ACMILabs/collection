        "An expression of the restless, unsettled spirit of the modern city and the women who have left the quiet home life of the previous generation for the competitive world in todays cities. For Francoise, work was an escape from a domestic role she found hollow and unsatisfying, but a career outside her home was not enough to fill the vacuum in her life. She found success without really wanting it. Her competence as an artist in an advertising agency won the approval of her employer, but also the overt hostility of other employees, both male and female. Cast includes: Jocelyne France, Benoit Girard, Mireille Lemelin, Ginette Letondal, Doris Lussier, Yves Massicotte, Gilles Normand."
