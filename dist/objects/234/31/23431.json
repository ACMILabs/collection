        "Made of film trimmings assembled by Arthur Lipsett, this experimental film conveys a flow of intense psychological impressions representing a new form of filmed perception. Compressed into an intermittent sequence of visuals, sounds, voices and bursts of music, this film makes a wry comment on modern man and his world. It suggests a surrealist dream of mankind's fall from grace into banality. (Awards: Montreal; San Francisco)"
