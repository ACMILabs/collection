        "With the voyage of Verrazano, in 1524, began the story of France in the New World. Tracing the pattern of exploration through Verrazano, Cartier, Champlain, Marquette, Joliet and La Salle, the film shows how soldier-explorers and missionaries planted the earliest of French settlements and laid the foundations for French strongholds in the New World."
