        "Based on the children's book by Leo Lionni this film tells of four grey field mice who diligently gather food in preparation for winter, and a fifth - Frederick - who quietly sits and absorbs the joys of summer. When, in the winter, the mice have exhausted their food supply, Frederick is able to cheer his companions by recalling the visions and sensations of summer. Animated."
