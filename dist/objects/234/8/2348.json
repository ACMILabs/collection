        "This CDROM has been funded by the Australian Film Commission and is primarily about the experiences of Timorese refugees living in Australia. The work is a contemporary look at identity, resistance and the dream of return to East Timor. The CDROM is shaped around the performance and cultural work (including dance, drumming and storytelling) developed by members of the East Timorese community who are based at the North Richmond community health centre. The work in this CDROM was developed in conjunction with the Timorese association of Victoria."
