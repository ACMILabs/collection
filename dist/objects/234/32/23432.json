        "Explains Percy Grainger's ideas about free music and shows the machine he had made with the help of Bernard Cross. The machine is very like a synthesizer and was meant to play Grainger's music, which proved an impossible task for people. A Melbourne Conservatorium expert was the first person to transcribe the music on graphs on to tape, and in Bernard Cross's presence it was played for the first time publicly."
