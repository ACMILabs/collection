        "This is a story of how rural social workers in British Columbia cover a large and rugged province, and of the ways in which they help people in many kinds of trouble to solve their problems. Taking four cases - a pensioner, a youngster in juvenile court, an unmarried mother and a family distressed by the threat of illness and poverty - the film describes how each case is investigated, and how people in need are put in touch with available aid, both government and private."
