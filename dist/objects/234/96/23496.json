        "Bill shows his fellow-farmers, by means of films, how other farmers are benefiting by marketing their crops co-operatively. Jake, an ultra-conservative, offers many objections to this method, but he is finally won over to the idea of starting a local co-operative society on a small scale. Such crops as celery, lettuce, apples and citrus fruits are grown and marketed co-operatively with great success."
