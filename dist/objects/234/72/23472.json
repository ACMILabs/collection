        "This film reviews the development of architectural forms from the basic column and lintel construction of Greek temples, through the Roman basilica style and Romanesque churches to the groining and buttressing of Gothic cathedrals. The importance of development of arch and the later lightening of structural appearance is pointed out. The film makes use of animation, plans, scale models and actual scenes of buildings and exteriors, including some French cathedrals."
