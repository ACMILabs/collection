        "This short film on the late, great, Italian film director was the first time motion picture cameras were permitted on the set to reveal his creative process. Harold Mantell's documentary uses footage shot behind the scenes and on the sets of of Fellini's film \"Juliet of the Spirits\" (1965) (304304) as a canvas to talk about this acclaimed director. The film shows the magnificent film sets, Fellini's character people (whose faces were invented for his films), the relationship with his actor/wife Guilietta Masina, and the cast and crew. The film also features his techniques of improvisation and interview material. \"Juliet of the Spirits\" is held in the Collection on VHS. While the film is crammed with interesting facts about Fellini, the man and creative artist, it is not intended as a guide to his body of work. Another documentary in the Collection on VHS, \"Ciao Frederico: A Portrait Of Frederico Fellini,\" was also made during the shooting of \"Satyricon\"."
