        "A schoolboy traps and cages four wild birds. When the teacher explains to his class the need to protect birds and to allow them freedom so that they can eat insects which would otherwise destroy the very food we eat, he has the courage to admit his guilt. The children go into the woods to return the birds to their natural home."
