        "The Mediterranean fruit fly is a serious pest of the fruit industry in Western Australia. It infests so many different types of fruit that it keeps alive throughout the seasons. It is the larvae that do the damage. It is necessary to keep orchards absolutely clean. One dirty orchard can affect the whole district."
