        "Based on the work of Dr Arnold Gesell at the Yale Clinic of Child Development. Analyses mechanics of locomotion and the stages by which the infant gradually attains an upright, walking posture. Points out various stages where natural, unassisted infant action makes for best progress. Illustrates how attained abilities are related and how some are normal outgrowths of others."
