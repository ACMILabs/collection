        "In Departure, Ian Andrews has used mostly analogue techniques to evoke the decaying process that occurs in a film or photographic image over time, but in doing so, he has created an altogether different visual landscape in which different layers of image contest and compete against each other. A small strip of found film footage of a man \"departing\" loops endlessly back and forth, and as it does so, the repeated actions of the man seem to physically alter the layers, the skin of film and image through which we watch this action take place. The figure is marking out the landscape by traversing it, by exiting the frame and leaving a ghostly trace of his presence - but it is the surface of the visual form itself that is left marked."
