        "Training children to speak in Victorian institutions for the education of the deaf. It is essential that deaf children begin education early, and at the Princess Elizabeth Kindergarten, children are taught to lipread in order to associate lip movements with vocal sounds. As they grow older, children continue to the Victorian School for Deaf Children where they continue speech training, commence primary education, play games, learn handcrafts, carpentry and domestic training."
