        "A lighthearted historical cross-section of the open air movement. This film covers outdoor sports/recreation activities throughout Danish history, commenting that Danes first started the scout movement in 1909 and the Youth Hostel movement in 1930 for example. Increasing urbanisation in the cities resulted in society becoming more inward, preferring to stay indoors rather than being sporty as their ancestors once were. As female clothing became freer, along with loosening social mores, people began to go outdoors once more. Chiefly based on original historical material-paintings, engravings, photographs and old films, contrasting with the final live action sequence of present-day. Danish language with English sub-titles. Music by Bent Fabricius-Bjerre and written by Tork Haxthausen."
