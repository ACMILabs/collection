        "A study and interpretation of the racist and capitalist philosophies. Two men, one white and one black, engage in a chess game, the stakes being $100 if the white man wins and the white man's expensive chess set if he loses. At first the white man thinks the whole bet is silly since he appears to be winning. But, as the tables turn he becomes more and more upset until he loses and is unwilling to give up his chess set."
