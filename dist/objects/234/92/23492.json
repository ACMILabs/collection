        "A tourist film of Australia. It is not a travelogue but a story combining humour with selling and entertainment with information; highlighting the difficulties of a producer, director and script-writer in the making of a short film which is to show all the tourist attractions of Australia. The film gently (and not so gently) laughs at all those aspects of the Australian way of life that are usually included in films about Australia, and also shows some of the not so well known attractions of the country. (Awards: Gold Award, Travel Category; Australian National Travel Association's \"Jedda Award\"; Kodak Silver Award for colour photography, Australian Film Awards, 1965)."
