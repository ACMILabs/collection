        "Episode of Series \"Ages and Stages\". Quite far removed from infancy, yet not across the threshold of adolescence, children of ten to twelve present an absorbing study of adults-in-the-making. We watch the children of one family in various situations in the home, at school and in group play, and find that much of their conflicting behavior is actually a normal part of the growing-up process."
