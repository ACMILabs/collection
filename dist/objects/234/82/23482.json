        "A critical view of the \"drop-out\" society includes a report on drug abuse among American Juvenile delinquents and their attraction to communities such as the San Francisco Hippies. Designed as a warning to young people against the dangers of drug taking, the film also claims that interest in drugs is stimulated by the mass media."
