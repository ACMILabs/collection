        "At Whipsnade Zoo, 35 miles from London, there is an unusual zoo; a great expanse of English downland is reserved for animals to roam as they do in their native habitats. To the reserve come naturalists and zoologists from many countries, for on these 500 acres of English soil, animal life from all over the world may be studied. The film makes use of interesting natural sound."
