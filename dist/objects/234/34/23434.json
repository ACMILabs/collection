        "Attempts to show that physical education is concerned with the education of the whole child, not only his physical well being. Shows need for a broad based and varied programme of activities; and how related work in other areas of the curriculum may spring from or lead to work in movement. Presents a composite picture of the balanced programme offered in a good primary school."
