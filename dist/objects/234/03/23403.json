        "Episode of Series \"PSSC physics\". Demonstrates the changes in observed motion of a freely falling body viewed from differently moving frames of reference. Donald Ivey and Patterson Hume discuss relative motion, accelerated and inertial frames of reference, and show the inadequacy of Newtonian physics, calling for calculation of fictitious forces to describe relative motions."
