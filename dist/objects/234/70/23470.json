        "Shows the effect that drinking parents can have on their children. Joe is deeply disturbed when one of his schoolmates, because of his drinking, is involved in a motor car accident. His conviction is strengthened because he see the results of social drinking and \"the cocktail hour\" in his own home, and in that of his girl-friend. He seeks advice from his coach at school, and attends a lecture by Dr Andrew C. Ivy, which results in his decision to \"leave it alone\"."
