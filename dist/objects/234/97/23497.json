        "Episode of Series \"Ages and Stages\". A study of the behavior of four-and-five-year-old children at home and at nursery school. At four the vacillation between infantile helplessness and vigorous self-assertion is seen, and at five the development of independence and the beginning of cooperation. Parents observe that, unpredictable as their behavior may be, it's fun to help in the development of the fours and fives."
