        "Notes the market research into consumer behaviour that is carried out by the Levi company prior to the launching of a special range of tailored clothes for men. Shows the breakdown of the market into five distinct groups which have different reasons for purchasing clothes - eg status, work, and comfort; how the target group for the new range of clothes is determined; and how consumer discussion groups with members of this target group elicit their responses to the proposed range. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
