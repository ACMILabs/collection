        "A study of Glen Miller, an ex-school teacher who went into farming in America in 1942, and who has since built up a huge acreage, coupled with a high level of capital invesment. His sons and grandsons help run the farm as well as maintain the huge and expensive machinery that lies idle all year round, except for the five weeks of harvesting when it is put to work seven days a week, eighteen hours a day. Suitable for lower and middle secondary levels."
