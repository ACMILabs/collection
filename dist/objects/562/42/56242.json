        "A poor, middle-aged Muslim archivist steals stationery from his office to support his family, only to find that the store to which he sells the stationery to is owned by his boss. He develops an obsessional guilt complex and compulsion to confess his dishonesty. A tragi-comedy, providing some incisive observations of the contemporary scene in Jakarta, in particular the gap between the rich and the poor. In Indonesian with English subtitles."
