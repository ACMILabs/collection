        "Jack Thompson examines the evolution of Australian cinema from the isolated production of \"The True Story of the Kelly Gang\" in 1906 to the increasingly confident films of the 1970s. Seventy years of triumph, heartbreak, frustration, hopes, fears and success. With the aid of film clips, this documentary also looks at various themes and attitudes expressed in the films of this period. Written by David Stratten. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
