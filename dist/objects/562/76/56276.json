        "Fifth in a series of nine animated films on the history of Western Civilization. Looks at the Industrial Revolution and some of its effects:  the movement of people into the cities;  the use of child labour; the exploitation of workers; the movement of capitalists into parliament to further their own interests and their use of police to quell the workers' complaints; and the development of monopolies. English version by Tricontinental Film Center. Suitable for lower secondary level."
