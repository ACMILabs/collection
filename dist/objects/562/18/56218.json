        "Looks at situations that could result in drink-driving, and also looks at the other options available through following the social life of a young Sydney group of friends made up of four males and one female in their late teens to early twenties. Covers willingness to intervene in a drink-driving situation; ability to say \"no\" to someone who wants to drive when he or she is unfit to do so; and alternative ways of spending an evening socialising without the risk of drink-driving. Features Gia Carrides. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
