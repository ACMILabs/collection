        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". Uses archival material to show the development of early photography, from the first photograph of 1827 through to the first slow motion study in 1901. Also illustrates how scientists, designers and engineers use time-lapse cameras to cheat time; to look beyond our human perceptions; and to study the world of high and low-speed activity."
