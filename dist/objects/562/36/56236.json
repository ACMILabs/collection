        "An animated satire on space travel, with a central character representing \"the man in the street\" who takes his rocket to a galaxy and to satellites, well ahead of the Russian and American astronauts. The various forms of simple animation used in this film would provide an excellent motivation for students of animation techniques. Suitable for middle and upper primary level."
