        "All over Australia trees are dying for reasons not fully understood. Scientists have termed this phenomenon \"dieback\". Within Australia a microscopic fungi and certain insects have been isolated as the cause of the massive destruction of jarrah, New England and eucalypt forests. Scientists are now looking at cloning techniques as a method of breeding trees that are genetically resistant to dieback."
