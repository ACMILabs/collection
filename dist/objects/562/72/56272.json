        "First in a series of nine animated films on the history of Western civilisation. This episode shows Europe emerging from the Dark Ages into a feudal maze of dukedoms and bishoprics. Covers the emergence of a new class - the merchants, and the development of new trade routes. Suitable for lower secondary levels."
