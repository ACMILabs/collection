        "Episode of Series \"Narritjin Maymuru (A)\". Narritjin Maymuru and his family are establishing a small settlement at Djarrakpi, an important Manggalili clan site on the northern head of Blue Mud Bay in the Northern Territory. Narritjin is a renowned artist and he and his family produce bark paintings and craft work to sell at Yirrkala. This program, together with Part 2 [507335], gives an insight into Narritjin's family life and, through his paintings, his role as an educator, teaching his sons about their clan land and its ancestral history."
