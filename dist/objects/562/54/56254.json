        "Episode of Series \"Cosmos: a personal voyage\". In a spaceship of the imagination, we start a journey from a far-off region of the universe and gradually approach planet Earth. Dr Carl Sagan, our guide, manoeuvres the ship between galaxies of many kinds, near quasars and supernovae, through clouds of gas and dust from which future stars will be born, and past the planets to our own. Adapted from Cosmos the television series by Carl Sagan."
