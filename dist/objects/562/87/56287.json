        "Provides a background to the development of the Cold War. Includes graphic footage of the plight of refugees in post-war Europe; notes the Truman doctrine of giving aid to free nations threatened by aggression, by providing a case study of Greece where partisans supported by communists strove to get rid of the monarchy; the Marshall Aid Program; the Berlin Blockade and the consequent formation of NATO. Suitable for upper secondary level."
