        "An Indian rajah's past is recalled by his exiled daughter (Madhur Jaffrey) and his ageing tutor (James Mason), interspersed with old movies from the rajah's archives. An absorbing character study which also reveals something of the complexities and contradictions of India and the role of the British in India. Written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
