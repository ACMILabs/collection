        "Third in a series of nine animated films on the history of Western Civilization. Examines the merchants' reactions when they had to pay road, bridge, market and money exchange tolls to local landlords after riches began pouring in from Europe. Shows how they plotted with the king to stop this \"exploitation\" and were subsequently successful in having new laws passed in their favour, to the detriment of the peasants and craftsmen. Suitable for lower secondary level."
