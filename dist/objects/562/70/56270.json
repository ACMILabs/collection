        "Adapted from James Sage's \"The Boy and the dove\", this non-verbal dramatic fantasy unfolds the story of Eva and her white dove. The bird does poorly at school for performers, but is transformed through Eva's dreams into a magical bird which leads Eva and her brother Franck to the kingdom of a mystical prince whilst teaching her a valuable lesson about freedom."
