        "Adapted from the book of the same title by Charlotte Zolotow. The story of a six year old boy who disturbed by recurring memories of his grandfather whom he has not seen for some years, discovers from his mother that his grandfather died some time ago. Highlights the fact that emotions experienced alone can be shared with others who have had similar experiences. Suitable for upper primary level."
