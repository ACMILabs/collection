        "The 'Last Film Search' was launched officially in Melbourne in October 1981 by The National Film and Sound Archive. Its main purpose was to recover early Australian films produced on nitrate stock, so that they can be copied before the nitrate decomposes and the film stock was lost forever. Michael Cordell provides details of the search and some of his finds to date. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
