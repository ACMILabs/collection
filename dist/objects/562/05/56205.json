        "After explaining the use and making of timelines, the film brings on an imaginary Time Machine Camera which can travel down a vertical timeline into the deep past. On command, the camera shows how the earth looked at any particular time. It searches for the beginnings of life, the presence of dinosaurs, for cave people, and the pyramids. The film dramatises the relative briefness of the history of the United States, and of human beings, and concludes by showing how all the events of history give us our sense of time itself. Suitable for lower and middle secondary levels."
