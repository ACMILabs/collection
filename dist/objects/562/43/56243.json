        "This documentary suggests that the Maori Wars of 1863-64, rather than the Sudan War of 1899-1901, were Australia's first experience of war, by noting New Zealand's governor, Sir George Grey's activities in advertising for, and recruiting volunteers from the Australian colonies. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
