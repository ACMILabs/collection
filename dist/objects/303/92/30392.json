        "Precautions taken to safeguard the food and drugs sold in Canada. This film is the story of how Canada's pure food and drug laws are enforced - the checking of food in retail stores, testing in Government laboratories, and destruction of faulty products. With new foods and drugs coming on the market daily, the film points out that constant vigilance is essential for the protection of the Canadian consumer."
