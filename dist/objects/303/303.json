        "This claymation tells the story of a lone desert dweller. The 'humanoid' animal one day comes across an injured albatross and sets about to nurture the bird back to health. Later in her explorations of the day she comes across a caged and abandoned male counterpart and proceeds to help him also. On contact with the male she telepathically sees the mans troubled past (the cause of his present condition) and responds with empathy and friendship."
