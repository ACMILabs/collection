        "Episode of Series \"The Twentieth century\". Traces the day by day events of the historic week in which Europe tottered on the brink of World War II. The week from the end of August and the beginning of September 1939 - the last peaceful days the world was to know for six years. It ended with Hitler's blitzkrieg into Poland, eleven months after British Prime Minister Chamberlain's \"peace in our time\" declaration followed the Munich Pact. Narrated by Walter Cronkite."
