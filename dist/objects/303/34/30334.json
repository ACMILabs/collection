        "The history of Westminster Abbey is the history of England. Here Parliament once met; here for centuries the Kings and Queens of England have been crowned; and here are buried illustrious Englishmen of all times - sovereigns, statesmen, poets, scientists, musicians. In the nave is the tomb of an Unknown Warrior, brought from Flanders in 1920 as representative of all the nameless British dead in the War of 1914-18. Westminster Abbey is a fine example of early English architecture. Concludes with scenes of the coronation of King George VIth. The film is accompanied by the Westminster Choir and the London Symphony Orchestra with original music composed and conducted by Horace Shepherd. Commentator: Alvar Lidell."
