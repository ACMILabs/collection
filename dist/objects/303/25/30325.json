        "To smile at the antics of children in a playground is to smile at oneself. This is a candid camera view of the schoolyard during recess, when hearts are broken, scores settled, secrets told, and where a bouncing ball or a turning rope can still tell the future to a chanted rhyme. Filmed without commentary, this is a small world and a brief one, but a world of childhood that everyone will recognize. Film without words."
