        "This is one of a series of films designed for elementary school science classes; it demonstrates that the alternation of night and day is due to rotation of the earth and not to the apparent motion of the sun around the earth. Two children and their father discuss the cause of night and day using a torch and a light globe to demonstrates the principles involved."
