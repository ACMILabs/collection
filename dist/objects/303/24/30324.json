        "A traditional Irish folk drama by John M. Synge, set in the east of Ireland, two or three centuries ago. The satiric theme - that sometimes it is better to preserve one's illusions than to face reality - is expressed through the episode of Martin and Mary Doul's miraculously restored sight. Part of the \"Short play showcase\" series."
