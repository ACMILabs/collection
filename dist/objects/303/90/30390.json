        "Episode of Series \"Canada carries on\". Roughly contemporaneous with Hitchcock's Spellbound, this NFB informational film is a survey of what was then the cutting edge of progressive psychiatry. Reflecting the new enthusiasm for pop-Freudianism in a North America seeking respite for it's traumatised World War II veterans. Although punctuated by some lighter moments, the melodramatic music scoring reflects the film's emotional tone. Although prone to many of the social prejudices of its day (witness gender politics), this film also provides an illuminating account of pioneering forms of psychodrama and child psychiatry."
