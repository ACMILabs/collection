        "Describes a number of research and demonstration projects contributing to solid waste management technology in the United States. It is intended to provide useful data for the comparative analysis of these emerging new systems without the necessity of making expensive field trips. Though semi-technical and specifically intended for public officials who authorize and fund solid waste collections and disposal operations, the film is also understandable to non-technicians."
