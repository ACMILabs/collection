        "Uses children's art from all over the world with commentary by the children as they talk about each of the clauses of the \"Universal Declaration of the Rights of the Child\" an what they means to them. Juxtaposes the children's artwork and their views with often quite graphic photography of war , famine, poverty, and violence. Includes artwork from Terezin Concentration Camp and disturbing camp stills. Not for children's viewing."
