        "In this epic of the autumn harvest on the Canadian prairies, there is artistry in what the film shows of the seas of golden grain and the bold geometry carved on them by the invading fleet of combine harvesters. Canadian Northern is still the wheat of top quality. This film shows some of the men who grow it, as well as those who keep it moving to world markets."
