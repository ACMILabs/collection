        "What is it that distinguishes the living organism from the non-living, the particular quality common to all living forms? This animated film provides lucid explanation, arresting in colour and form as the facts are presented. It shows what biophysics and biochemistry now perceive as the facts of life concerning evolution and the genetically determining factor of the DNA molecule."
