        "Green Valley, a Housing Commission estate 25 miles west of Sydney, has been subjected to harsh criticism over the years by sections of the media. Supplied with Film Australia equipment, the residents were invited to show themselves and their daily lives. The core of the film is the work of half a dozen Valley residents who selected the subject matter, filmed it, and supervised its editing."
