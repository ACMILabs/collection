        "How a rural district came alive under the stimulus of a community recreation programme. Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, is the centre of a district of two hundred square miles. We watch the scheme gathering speed and scope, from the formation of the first committee, through the acquisitions and renovation of property and the training of district young people as leaders, to a variety of activities extending from a women's softball team to the formation of a regional library. Join planning for recreation can open a new world of creative interest and accomplishment."
