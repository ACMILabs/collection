        "Through an experience in outback camping in South Australia, a number of secondary school students learn the value of group co-operation. The decisions necessary to establish a comfortable and smooth-running campsite are made by the students themselves. Also, the shortcomings in their planning are shown - often humorously. Each student has an important part in a sequence of activities."
