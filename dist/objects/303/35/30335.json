        "Candid glimpses of Indonesia and its people, in and around the capital, Jakarta. Following where chance leads, the film captures the flavour of life in this fertile crescent of tropical islands as it focuses on the Indonesian people caught between the past and the conflicting options of the future - to change or not to change from long-established patterns of life to ones more influenced by western technology. Awards: Melbourne, Atlanta, San Francisco and Toronto."
