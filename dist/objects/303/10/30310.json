        "A fantasy which satirises the obscure symbolism of some \"experimental\" films. Skilled montage of quite disconnected shots adds up to excitement, and often to irony. However, the theme of disenchantment in marriage is treated only lightly, and is soon lost in a desire to exploit the effects of seeping, oozing liquids, intercut with portraits of problem people."
