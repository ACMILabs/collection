        "Many forces wear away the land, but what is worn away in one place goes to build up in another. Shows how rocks are decomposed; how caves and sink holes are made; and how glaciers are formed and the work they do; how blowing sand erodes the surface of the earth; and how the waves are reshaping the coastline."
