        "Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam addresses a group of young people on the subject, \"How do you tell right from wrong?\" He points to the basic facets in our heritage of history and of faith which can be used to measure the effects of choices one makes. He demonstrates ways in which the best of science, history, poetry, drama and religion can be brought to bear on decisions which may touch not only one's own personality but those of others in the family, community, nation and world."
