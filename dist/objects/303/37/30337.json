        "Illustrates a century of progress in the design of oil tankers dating from the time when oil casks were first lashed in the holds of cargo vessels. The film explains how the problems of dealing with escaping gas and of increasing the weight of cargo without imposing too great a strain on the hull of the tanker, were ultimately solved."
