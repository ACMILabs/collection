        "Spinning and weaving was part of the ancient heritage in India and many villagers earned their living by making textiles. When machine-made materials were imported these villages were thrown out of work and many starved. Ghandi recognised that the revival of cottage industries was essential for prosperity and through his influence the home woven textiles again became popular. The growing of cotton, spinning, carding and weaving and the marking of very simple machines to carry out these processes are shown in the film. The spinning wheel has been adopted as the symbol of prosperity for India."
