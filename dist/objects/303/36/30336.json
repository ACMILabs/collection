        "A case study of the Murray Darling River system which examines man's relationship with his environment. Shows how the demands we have placed on this important river system for navigation, irrigation, water supply and recreation, have greatly altered it from its original condition. Poses the question, are we altering the ecology of the wetlands to a point where we may no longer derive the benefits we hope to enjoy from this river system?"
