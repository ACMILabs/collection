        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Kindergarten child series\". Kindergarten children are observed here responding to the rhythm of music. The teacher, while playing a guitar, encourages different responses at different times, sometimes the rhythmic cadence of sticks and sometimes a vocal response. At the conclusion the children disperse in an orderly way for refreshment and \"quiet time\"."
