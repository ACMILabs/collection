        "Based upon a fictional story of suspense and drama, this film involves two school-children who come across an unexploded World War II bomb. The discovery awakens the curiosity of one child and the fear of the other. Designed to alert children to the various types of dangerous explosive devices they may find in Canada and be tempted to tamper with, the film clearly identifies the devices. To ensure the film's effectiveness, the filmmaker presents the information in a highly dramatic format. Cast includes Todd Nixon, Debbie Viau, Les Carlson and Steve Pernie."
