        "Episode of Series \"Chemical Education Material Study Series\". The model for the electron probability distribution in the hydrogen atom is provided by quantum mechanics. Confidence in this model is justified because the calculated energies agree closely with the experimental energies obtained from the hydrogen atom spectrum. The probability distribution of the electron is demonstrated by analogies. Animation shows the outstanding features of the hydrogen atom."
