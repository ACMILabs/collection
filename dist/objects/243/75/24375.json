        "This film demonstrates how skilled workers may be freed from unnecessary labour by the use of simple mechanical devices and for rearrangement of personnel. As the result of employee suggestions for improvements, labour and time saving devices are adopted, leading to increased production. Such increased productivity can lead to shorter hours and higher wages."
