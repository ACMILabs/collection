Children sing about and experience a number of things that bring happiness: The pleasures of smelling and eating good things, a bubbly bath, waking up on a sunny morning; the accomplishment of learning to drive, the inner satisfaction of being helpful without thought of reward and the warmth of sharing a friendship."
