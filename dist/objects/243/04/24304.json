        "Contemporary account of changes to gender roles and social identity. The marriage of a young couple and their subsequent struggle to make their relationship work provides continuity in a montage of dramatised and animated scenes showing the feelings, ideas, fantasies and images inherent in sex role expectations for men and women in our society. The effects of stereotyping in relationship between the sexes and in individual lives raise provocative questions for discussions. Although ostensibly challenging traditional stereotypes, the program promotes more than a few itself, eg exclusive WASP cast in the dramatised segments; no reference to homosexuality, etc. Animation: M. Borczynski."
