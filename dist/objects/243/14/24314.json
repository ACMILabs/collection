        "A glimpse of life as far north as it can be lived, with scenes of walrus, seal and polar-bear hunts. Taking us northward to Greenland, the camera records the year's round for the Inuit of Thule. In the lengthening daylight of spring, they cross the sea ice by dog sled in quest of seal and polar bear, racing towards land with their catch as the ice bridge begins to melt and crack. When the autumn days shorten, the hunters, in final preparation for the months of Arctic night, set out in boats to harpoon walrus."
