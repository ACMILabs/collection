        "Episode of Series \"The Springs of learning\". The most significant development of the child in his third year is his use of language. His mother can help him greatly by talking and listening to him, reading stories and nursery rhymes and sharing picture books. At this age a child develops an increased sense of his own identity, words such as 'you' and 'I', 'yours' and 'mine' take on meaning."
