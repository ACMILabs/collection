        "Following a typical middle class Japanese man and his family, this is an account of the importance of human relations in Japanese culture which stems from strong familial traditions and in turn effects the wider corporate and social environment. It discusses relevant Japanese traditions and terms, and uses animated diagrams to illustrate concepts."
