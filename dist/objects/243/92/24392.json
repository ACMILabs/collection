        "Episode of Series \"Children of Canada\". When nine-year-old Nadia is allowed to attend a regular school, she knows the kids will tease her but she'll \"find a way to deal with it.\" Nadia has spina bifida, a congenital condition that has caused a lack of sensation from the knees down. She uses crutches in order to walk. Nadia, in her own candid way, makes it clear that she is not looking for sympathy. She can do many things that children do, only she has a different way of doing them. (Ten Awards including Oscar, Hollywood; Salerno; Dubuque)"
