        "While the camera follows Joe through a typical American business man's day, his heart speaks out about what Joe is doing to it. Animation in a machinery metaphor illustrates the heart's functions and the effects upon it of anxiety, tension, smoking, faulty diet and overweight. Joe's heart attack and a coronary shutdown are detailed along with the step-by-step lifesaving procedures in an Intensive Care Unit. While Joe's recovery lessens the fear of the fatality of a heart attack his experience brings home a lesson that can prevent heart attacks from happening."
