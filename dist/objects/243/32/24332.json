        "Antoine Hodek, the Czechoslovakian mime demonstrates the art of pantomime. We learn that mime is a cross between ballet, the theatre and opera. In disarming fashion, Hodek leads the viewer into the pantomimist's world, devoid of props, scenery and voice. Pantomime and body language are just two of the many techniques used by people to communicate with each other in non-verbal ways."
