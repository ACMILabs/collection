        "John Cartner Ronson spends a typical Sunday alone with his memories in his home in a huge block of London flats. Old miner, old soldier, old gardener, and old age pensioner, he has been living on his own since his wife died nine years ago. An old man's life has become the ultimate expression of that much discussed twentieth century condition, the failure of communication."
