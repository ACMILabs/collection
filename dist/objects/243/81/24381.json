        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\" If a mother does badly in bringing up her child in the first 5 years of his life, then the child has almost no chance of success in school. Child psychologists can now measure a new-born baby's capacity for solving complex problems and they have found that the infant's motivation is the sheer joy of solving the problems, but if the potential is not developed the damage is irreversible. The results of this research are having major implications for education."
