        "A series of 3 \"trigger\" films designed to stimulate discussion, led by a discussion leader. Part 1 - \"Debbie and Linda\", concerns a 16 year old schoolgirl who thinks she is pregnant, and turns to her friend Linda, who is expecting a baby. Following this, a doctor is seen interviewing another pregnant teenage girl. Part 2 - \"Clinic Talk\" - Deborah has just had her pregnancy confirmed - is paying her first visit to the ante-natal clinic. Now, as she waits for her boyfriend she meets Sarah, who is expecting her second child. Part 3 - \"Sarah and Eric\". Sarah arrives home from the ante-natal clinic and tells her husband Eric that she has been told to take it easy. Eric persuades her to keep working, as they need the money, and adds that everything was all right when they had their first child."
