        "A picture of life in Cuba by a filmmaker who believes in getting into people's lives and letting ideas seep out of what he finds. Among the people shown are a doctor who came back to Cuba, a high-school student whose school-based radio-assembly work and classes last until 10:00 p.m., and a tobacco farmer who now owns his land. For all of them the new Cuba has done much and promises more."
