        "Episode of Series \"West\". Joe Fafard knows cows - the way they tuck in their forelegs to lie down and ruminate, the way a calf romps in the barnyard. He also knows people - all his friends and neighbors of the farming community of Pense, Saskatchewan. And he sculpts them all, in clay, in eloquent little miniatures. Joe's work has been exhibited throughout western Canada as well as in Paris and New York. Here you see what he does."
