        "Leon Barsha of the American Cinema Editors has taken a sequence from the motion picture \"Baby Face Nelson\" to illustrate film editing techniques. Actors Mickey Rooney, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Carolyn Jones are shown from our angle as on a stage. Then Leon Barsha shows how the same scene was heightened in mood and drama by editing with use of inserts - two shots, close-ups and extreme close-ups."
