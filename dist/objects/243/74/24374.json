        "French language training film - all dialogue is in French. A visit to Prince Murat, a descendant of Napoleon, who describes Napoleon's activities as an administrator, and creator of the Civil Code and the Legion d'Honneur. He also founded a boarding school at St Denis for daughters of members of the Legion d'Honneur. A visit to this school shows how the traditions established by Napoleon are still being maintained."
