        "Episode of Series \"History of the Motion Picture\". A condensed version of the classic silent film of the Victor Hugo novel which was a masterpiece of film-making. Shows details of Lon Chaney's elaborate makeup for his role as the hunchback Quasimodo and ends with an epilogue in tribute to the remarkable star. Dubbed \"The man of a thousand faces\", Chaney's portrayal of Quasimodo is not the only outstanding feature of this production. The set which took a year to build, the enormous cast of extras and night photography adds to the epic grandeur of the film which also starred Brandon Hurst, Nigel De Brulier and Patsy Ruth Miller as Esmeralda."
