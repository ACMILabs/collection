    "description": [
        "A number of Ballets Russes companies were formed in the wake of the dissolution of Serge Diaghilev's Ballet Russe. Between 1936 and 1940 three of these companies visited Australia in tours orchestrated by the entrepreneur Colonel Wassily de Basil. Dr Ewan Murray-Will was a Sydney dermatologist and amateur filmmaker who befriended and filmed a number of dancers from the Monte Carlo Russian Ballet during their 1936-1937 Australian tour. His friendship allowed him to capture unique images of one of the world's greatest dance companies. Various incarnations of the Ballet Russe conducted three tours of Australia between 1936 and 1940 and were incredibly influential on the future direction of contemporary dance and ballet in Australia. Murray-Will often filmed parts of the impromptu outdoor dance sequences in slow motion which provided a more detailed study\u00a0in balletic\u00a0movement. This film forms part of the Chesterman Collection, a series of 16mm films made by Ewan Murray-Will which are held at the National Film and Sound Archive."
