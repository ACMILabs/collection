        "As the only one of its kind in Australia, the Maffra Beet Sugar Factory was in operation for 50 years from 1898 to 1948, the end coming when local beet growers realised there was more money to be made in the dairy game. Produced by the Progressive Gippsland Publicity Campaign in 1921, this film shows the beets' journey from the paddock to the sugar sack: starting with the Clydesdales pulling them from the fields, to the back-breaking work of the 'shakers and toppers', then back to the Clydesdales, onto a VERY LONG steam train, and finally the factory. From here we bear witness to a punishing series of machines \u2013 The Washer, The Slicer, then onto The Diffusion Battery \u2013 where the sugar is extracted. It's then limed, filtered, evaporated, separated, granulated, bagged and stacked - an exhausting process! Then finally, as we bid goodbye to the Maffra Beet Sugar Factory, we are farewelled by the bovine beneficiaries of all that's left of the beets."
