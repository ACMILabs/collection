        "This free talk was held at ACMI on 17 July 2013 to celebrate two exhibitions, ACMI's 'Hollywood Costume' and RMIT University Design Hub's 'Walter Van Beirendonck; Dream the World Awake'.  Chris Dercon, director of London's Tate Modern, and Kaat Debo, director/curator at Mode Museum in Antwerp, discussed the particulars of exhibiting fashion and costume, and explored the dialogue between art and fashion.  They investigated the ways a curator can animate clothes through multisensory and multimedia experiences, Dercon and Debo looked at the approaches taken by curators, identifying interesting narratives for exhibiting garments and took the audience behind-the-seams of fashion and costume exhibiting."
