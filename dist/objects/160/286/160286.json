    "description": [
        "Harry Hawker was an aeronautical aficionado, setting many records in his lifetime, including a British endurance record in 1912, flying 8hrs 23minutes to win the Michelin Cup. He became best known to Australians when he teamed up with the promoter Albert Sculthorpe to bring a Sopwith Tabloid airplane to tour Australia in 1914 to demonstrate its aeronautical prowess. Hawker's first major demonstration, which the footage depicts, was in Melbourne at the Caulfield Racecourse on the 7th of February 1914.  The event was not without controversy, with angry letters written in to the Argus about 'the commercial use of Caulfield Racecourse Melbourne'.  However, on the day itself it drew a crowd of over 25,000, with an extra tram service added to transport the crowds of people to the Racecourse. The footage shows the police trying to control the crowd, who broke the containment lines and crowded the area which Hawker was to use as his runway. Hawker had to drastically alter the show that he was to put on, as at this time people didn't realise the importance of a runway for the take-off and landing of a plane. Indeed, it was reported that several of the spectators got clipped by the propellers when the plane landed!  We then see Hawker take off and climb to a height of 6000ft, before returning to the ground to pick up a passenger, a Miss Ruby Dixon, who was the first woman to fly in a plane in Australia. She paid 20 pounds for the experience (a hefty sum at that time).  The demonstration was deemed a success and spurred the fledging interest in aviation in Australia."
