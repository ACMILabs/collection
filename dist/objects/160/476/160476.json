        "Multi award-winning musician, songwriter and producer Gotye is no stranger to collaboration. His music videos are a testament to this, utilising the talents of diverse directors, artists and animators. Often involving a range of complex animation and filmmaking techniques, visual worlds are created floating seamlessly against his music. Natasha Pincus, Andrew Goldsmith, and directors of Rubber House animation studio Ivan Dixon and Greg Sharp disscus a selection of Gotye's most renowned videos. These include 'Easy Way Out', 'Seven Hours With A Back Seat Driver', 'State Of The Art' and the international chart-topping 'Somebody That I Used To Know'. Hosted by film and music critic Megan Spencer, this event provided a fascinating insight into the collaborative journey, from initial concept and creative development, through to final clip production."
