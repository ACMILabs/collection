    "description": [
        "The development of aviation in Australia opened up our vast country not long after the turn of the 19th Century. Journeys that had taken days over often inhospitable terrain turned into trips of several hours in relative luxury. Take a look at this potted history of aviation in Australia, from some of the earliest aeronautical footage of the showman and test pilot Harry Hawker demonstrating the Sopwith Bi-Plane to a crowd of 25,000 at Melbourne's Caulfield Racecourse. To the final advertising campaign for Ansett Australia before their demise after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Centre that sent shockwaves around the international aviation industry."
