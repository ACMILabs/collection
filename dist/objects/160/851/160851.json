    "description": [
        "The year is 1921, and we find ourselves in the 'Go-ahead town' of Traralgon, situated in the La Trobe Valley of Gippsland, Victoria. Established in the early 1860s, the township and surrounding area became known for its fertile farmland, which was mainly put to use by the dairy industry. By 1921 Traralgon was well-established, as shown in a series of slow pans across the rooftops and streets. The iconic Post Office building can be clearly seen, amongst other examples of fine architecture from the period. Moving on to a local school, we see a bunch of kids who were either very excited to be at school, or otherwise whipped into a frenzy for the camera - for the teachers' sake we can only hope it was the latter. When the school bell rings, we head out of town and into the nearby Tarra Valley for some motoring and a rest by the falls. Bliss!"
