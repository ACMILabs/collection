    "description": [
        "'Absolutely Ansett' was one of the last major advertising campaigns that Ansett Airlines ran before its demise, initially after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York on September 11, 2001, and then after a failed reprise, the airline ceased operations on the 5th May 2002. This advertising campaign adopted the Vanessa Amorosi song 'Shine'; with a lyric change to 'Absolutely'. It was a last ditch effort by the company, who by this stage were already in financial strife, to lift its public profile and garner support. They called on a myriad of well-known identities from all walks of life to contribute the campaign, covering such diverse fields as art, fashion, entertainment, politics and sport, there was something for everybody! See who you can spot! Source: NFSA"
