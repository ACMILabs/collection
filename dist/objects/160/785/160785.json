    "description": [
        "Allara's skipper, Tom Challenger takes us from Hobart to Storm Bay where a barracouta fishing fleet is at work. The boat sails down the Derwent River and rounds the 'Iron Pot' beacon at the mouth of the Derwent River. Barracouta are caught landing on the deck of a boat using a jig attached to a pole. The fish are then cleaned and filleted. The site for a proposed factory at Parsons Bay to process barracouta for stock feed and oil is shown, and proposed methods of catching the barracouta with trawl and purse-seine nets is also illustrated with diagrams.
