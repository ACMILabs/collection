        "CEO and co-founder of DreamWorks speaks exclusively about creating, leading and inspiring the world's largest animation studio in this rare one-off Australian event. A must-see for filmmakers, animators, fans and would-be moguls of tomorrow, hosted by Channel 10's Executive General Manager, Russel Howcroft (best known as The Gruen Transfer's advertising media personality). Katzenberg began his career at Paramount Pictures before moving to Walt Disney Pictures where he is credited with turning the ailing animation studio around. Under his management, Disney produced some of their most critically acclaimed and highest grossing features to date, including 'The Little Mermaid' and 'The Lion King'. He also secured a successful partnership with Pixar Studios and helped bring Miramax Films to Disney. Katzenberg eventually joined forces with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen to start DreamWorks SKG. Under Katzenberg's leadership, DreamWorks has become the largest animation studio in the world releasing 28 animated feature films, which have enjoyed both critical and commercial success, earning nine Academy Award nominations, twice winning Best Animated Feature. In 2013, Katzenberg was awarded the prestigious Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his outstanding contributions to humanitarian causes. Together with his wife Marilyn, Katzenberg provides support and leads fundraising efforts focused predominately on healthcare, education, the arts and the environment.  Proudly supported by the United States Consulate General Melbourne."
