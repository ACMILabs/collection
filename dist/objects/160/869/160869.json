        "Join the Mathews family for an idyllic boat trip from the beachside town of Mallacoota to nearby Gabo Island, in this home movie from 1959. Opening with an impressive array of undersea life, the anchor is soon raised and we're on our way. As things start to get a little choppy, the excitement is clear in the passengers' faces \u2013 although one little boy looks like he is ready to disembark. Luckily for him, Gabo is growing on the horizon! After clambering ashore we encounter a fleet-footed and camera-shy penguin, who leads us on a merry dance through the ferns. Other island activities include sorting the day's (significant) catch and a run along the beach. All in all it's a beautiful record of one family's day on the coast."
