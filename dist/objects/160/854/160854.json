        "35 years after we fell in love with the beauty of \u2018The Gippsland Lakes\u2019 (1939), the delights of East Gippsland are once again on show. This time \u2018round the soundtrack is more swinging and the poetry dialed back as we climb aboard the Victorian Ministry of Tourism's 'Press Tour' bus, to witness the region through the eyes of a mid-70's journo. We take in Mallacoota and Port Hicks before arriving in oil-country; the rigs and refineries of Sale having come a long way since the humble pipe-into-a-corrugated-tank proudly featured in 1939's travelogue. Back on board the bus, we are whisked off to the spectacular Buchan Caves \u2013 home to a host of delicate limestone formations. Our final stop on the tour is Lakes Entrance, where we trade in our wheels for a pair of wings, and a final spectacular view down 90 Mile Beach. Not bad for a day's work!"
