        "A brief but detailed history of Ansett Airlines. Started in 1931 by Reginald Ansett as a road passenger transport business (Ansett Roadways); in 1933 the company soon changed tack after the then Transport Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, prohibited commercial companies from competing with routes that were already serviced by the state-run rail service.  Reg Ansett was already gaining an interest in aviation at this stage and by 1935 he established Ansett Airways with a single engine, six-passenger, open cockpit Fokker Monoplane and opened a service from Hamilton in regional Victoria to Melbourne.  From here the company flourished, throughout the second World War, expanding in the 1950s and 60s to include hotels and even an island (Hayman Island in the Whitsundays, Queensland)as he saw the way clear into providing package holiday experiences.  After the successful takeover of its competitor airline ANA in 1957, Ansett was well on its way to being a major player in the Australian domestic airline industry and remained that way until its demise in 2002."
