        "Go behind the scenes of DreamWorks Animation's incredible success story with one of the key architects of its amazing 20-year journey - Chief Creative Officer Bill Damaschke. From overseeing the creative production and development processes for the studio's feature projects, to shaping the creative teams behind each project and growing the studio's creative talent pool, Damaschke has played an integral role in bringing the DreamWorks worlds to the big screen. Damaschke joined DreamWorks in 1995 and served as a producer and executive producer on a number of the studio's feature films before being named Head of Creative Production in 1999, Head of Creative Production and Development in 2005 and Co-President of Production for Feature Animation and President of Live Theatricals in 2007. During his tenure at DreamWorks Animation, Damaschke has overseen the release of a range of key DreamWorks titles, from the Academy Award-winning blockbuster 'Shrek' in 2001 through to the highly anticipated 'How to Train Your Dragon 2'. In Australia to celebrate the opening of the 'DreamWorks Animation: The Exhibition', Damaschke joined us for this one off event to discuss his exceptional creative career, his central role in DreamWorks Animation's future releases, and his insights into the creative hub of one of the world's most influential animation studios. Hosted by Walkley Award winning journalist, author, broadcaster and presenter of ABC News Breakfast Virginia Trioli."
