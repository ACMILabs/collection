    "description": [
        "A documentary that takes a light-hearted look at the ingenious methods that Aboriginal men living in remote communities employ to keep their automobiles running. Without a trade certificate between them, these men have developed the unique craft of 'bush mechanics' adapting available resources for use as spare parts. The stories they relate provide an unique insight into this practical and philosophical approach to car maintenance and highlight many of the adaptive techniques desert people have developed through necessity over the last seventy years. This documentary spawned a television series produced by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in association with Warlpiri Media.
