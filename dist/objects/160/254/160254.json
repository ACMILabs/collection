    "description": [
        "ACMI's 'Australian Perspectives' film season frames contemporary Australian filmmaking against a backdrop of archival classics and special guest presentations. This question and answer session with a panel of Australian film industry figures, was held on Saturday 7th September 2013 as Part 2 of the 'Australian Perspectives' season 'Carlton New Wave', following a screening of Nigel Buesst's 1971 film 'Bonjour Balwyn'. Hosted by Rochelle Siemienowicz, the panel included Nigel Buesst, Peter Hourigan, Alan Finney and John Flaus. The discussion highlights the key role of Melbourne, and Carlton in particular, as a centre for independent filmmaking in the 1960s and 1970s. The memories and anecdotes recounted by the panellists illustrate the vibrancy and creative energy of the Melbourne scene and the socio-economic context that allowed it to flourish. NOTE: Part 1 of the 'Australian Perspectives' season 'Carlton New Wave' was an August 2013 screening of Brian Davies' 1966 film 'Pudding Thieves'."
