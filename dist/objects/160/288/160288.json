        "This film was produced by John Kingsford-Smith, nephew of the renowned aviator Charles Kingsford-Smith. John Kingsford-Smith became a successful and prolific producer of documentaries from 1948 to the 1980s. During this time he produced 327 sponsored films and commercials and played a key creative role in all of them (as writer, director, cinematographer or editor).  This film is a combination of his two passions, aviation and filmmaking; one may wonder how many people were spurred on to learn how to fly after watching this film!"
