        "In a faraway world lived two clans, Dezminus and Akai. Their only connection was a trade route, trading Dezminus' ores for Akai's wheat. But one day Dezminus's food supplies stopped coming. So Dezminus decided to declare war and conquer the Clan of Akai. So they sent a warship to declare war on Akai. The captain of that vessel was...you."
