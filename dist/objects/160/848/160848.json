        "From the outskirts of Melbourne to the breakers of Mallacoota and everything in between, Gippsland takes in a great swathe of our great state. In this package of films from the collection of the National Film and Sound Archive, we've brought together a collection of Gippsland gems \u2013 from a pioneering Wilsons Promontory camping trip, to a bustling beet sugar factory, to the romance of the Gippsland Lakes and beyond \u2013 sit back and be transported east to 'Victoria's Riviera', with a couple of stops along the way."
