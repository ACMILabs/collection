        "In this interview (filmed as part of activities associated with the ACMI Exhibition \u2018Angelica Mesiti: The Calling\u2019) the artist reflects on the structure, approach and the processes involved in creating the work.  'The Calling' is a three channel video installation that focuses on whistling languages, ancient forms of non-verbal communication which are still used in 2013 to communicate in isolated and difficult landscapes.  To conduct research for 'The Calling', artist Angelica Mesiti travelled to the village of Kuskoy in Northern Turkey, the island of La Gomera in The Canary Islands and the Island of Evia in Greece where whistling languages are still in use."
