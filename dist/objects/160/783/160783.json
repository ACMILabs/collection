        "A short historic record of a match filmed on 19th July, 1924 in Burnie. The inter-district Australian Rules football match was well attended and played to a crowd of 12,000. We are first introduced to the Hobart team members followed by North West Coast. Hats seem to be the order of the day and many spectators crowd the edge of the playing field in order to get a good vantage point! North West Coast wins the match of the day by 7 Goals 21 behinds to Hobart's 6 Goals 11 behinds. Source: NFSA"
