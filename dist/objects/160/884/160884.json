        "The development of synchronised sound technology in the late 1920s sparked enthusiastic support for talking pictures from Australian filmmaker and cinema entrepreneur Frank W Thring. In 1930, Thring sold his share in Hoyts (after ensuring that Hoyts would screen his pictures) to set up his own production company, Efftee Film Productions. (He also established Efftee Studios, the first talking film studio in the country, to produce locally made films.) Thring believed that talking pictures had the potential to build a competitive local production environment where Australian films could stand up against American and British imports. He was a strong advocate for a quota system to ensure Australian films were supported locally. [Source: Poppy De Souza; Australian Screen] Between 1930 and 1935 Efftee's also produced several stage productions and over 80 short films. 'Melody and Terpsichore' is filmed in two parts; the first a flamboyant variety performance staged by violinists, the second a short segment of classical ballet with a performance led by ballerina Dorothy Hutchinson.
