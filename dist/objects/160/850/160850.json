        "Produced by Pathe Home Cinema on behalf of the Progressive Gippsland Publicity Campaign, this promotional film sets its lens on the 1921 Korumburra Show. Following a panorama of the grounds and a very dignified parade, all of the usual suspects are featured: we are treated to a judges-eye view of a very impressive line-up of Ayrshire cattle as they are paraded for the camera, followed by the misleadingly titled segment \u2013 Incidents at the Trotting Race \u2013 which seems to have actually been entirely incident-free (undoubtedly to the relief of both riders and mounts)! Next up are a prize litter of Yorkshire pigs, an interlude of horse jumping, before more prize winners \u2013 this time it\u2019s sheep and the cattle featured in solo shots. All this excitement is followed by a visit to the Korumburra Co-Operative Butter Factory - all in all, an exhilarating day out in Korumburra!"
