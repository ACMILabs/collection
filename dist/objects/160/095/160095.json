    "description": [
        "To celebrate the exhibition 'Shaun Tan's The Lost Thing: From Book to Film' a special evening with the Oscar\u00ae-winning animator, author and illustrator, Shaun Tan was held on 24 July 2013. He discussed the making of the exhibition, talked about his body of work and shared insights into his creative processes. Shaun's books, including 'The Rabbits', 'The Red Tree' and the acclaimed graphic novel 'The Arrival', have been widely translated and enjoyed by readers of all ages. His work as a feature film concept artist can be seen in films like 'Wall-E' (2008) and his Academy Award\u00ae-winning animated short 'The Lost Thing', which he also wrote and co-directed. In 2011, Shaun received the prestigious Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award in Sweden. His attraction to children's stories with confronting or puzzling ideas is reflected in his work, which encourages dialogue between adult readers and younger listeners."
