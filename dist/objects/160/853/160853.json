    "description": [
        "Commissioned by Victoria Railways, most likely to boost ticket sales on its Melbourne to Orbost Line, this documentary from 1939 sings the praises of this most picturesque corner of East Gippsland. To the backdrop of a soaring orchestral score and (almost overly) poetic narration, we open on a sweeping aerial shot of 90 Mile Beach and the 'world of romance' that is the Gippsland Lakes. As we come to ground, a young couple drive into view and lead us down the Princes Highway into a wonderland of aquaplaning, beachcombing, ferry rides and general fun in the sun. When the play is over and it's time for work, fishing nets and oil wells overflow as Mother Nature bestows her bounty on the lucky citizens of the Gippsland Lakes. If this didn't have you packing your bags for a lakeside holiday, then surely nothing would."
