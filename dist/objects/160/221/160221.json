    "description": [
        "Throughout 2013, the NFSA is celebrating the 100 year anniversary of Film Australia, the Australian Government's film production unit. Film Australia and all its predecessor organisations, commenced with the appointment of Bert Ive in 1913 as the first Official Commonwealth Government Cinematographer. Over the hundred years since Ive started his work, the government made thousands of films which are now part of the National Film and Sound Archive's collection. We are proud to be able to present some of those films here and make them available to Australians for generations to come."
