        "It's a moonless night... Let's go explore a mansion. In 'The Mansion', a nameless character finds himself with the task of searching an old mansion. Although he can't understand the lost children it doesn't take a true connection to know only he can help. The story is told through a platformer format, inspired by games such as Super Mario Bros."
