        "An early promotional film shot by Bert Cross, Pathe newsreel photographer and Australian film pioneer. Sponsored by the Government Tourist Bureau, the film follows a party of tourists as they travel from Melbourne to Wilsons Promontory in South Gippsland.  Having travelled from Melbourne to Benniston Station by rail, the party continues by foot and horse to Darby River, where we take in some beautiful scenery and a very neatly laid-out row of tents. Our intrepid tourists hit the beach in their most unlikely of surf-ware, following which dinner is served and a makeshift barbershop opens for business, preparing the campers for the party to follow. A survey of some of the other local wildlife includes a \"unique gymnastic display\" from a koala (we can only hope that no animals were harmed in the making of this film). The campers round out their journey with a visit to the Wilsons Promontory Lightstation, before a final swim - in more appropriate attire this time round!"
