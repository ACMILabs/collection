        "Margaret Scott had a crucial influence on the development of ballet in Australia. On the outbreak of World War Two, Scott began study at the Sadler's Wells Ballet School in London with other ballet luminaries such as Margot Fonteyn and Robert Helpmann, and by war's end had joined the famous Ballet Rambert. In 1953 she moved to Melbourne where she became a dance teacher, and with the help of the legendary Nugget Coombs, lobbied for the establishment of the Australian Ballet Company in 1962. She was founding director of the Australian Ballet School, which under her leadership became an internationally recognised dance institution and a nurturer of young talent.
