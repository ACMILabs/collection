        "DESTINY DEACON has shown in exhibitions including the 2001 Yokohama Triennale, Das Lied von der Erde at the Museum Fridericianum in Kassel, the 2000 Biennale of Sydney and the 1995 Havana Biennial and the Yokohoma triennial. Using people and objects close to her - friends and family, dolls and other toys - the artist creates strange, unsettling images that address some of the most difficult aspects of contemporary Australian life. Cultural stereotyping, domestic violence and the status of Aboriginal women all inform Deacon's photography, and her gift for storytelling and biting sense of humour provide her work with a compelling edge. With her photographic series Forced into Images (a title taken from a poem by Alice Walker), a dramatic narrative unfolds, following a girl's troubled life from birth to womanhood."
