        "Writes Silver, `These tapes can be seen as small sketches, snatches of overheard conversations, or as advertising that doesn't sell anything.' Fragments is an ongoing series of short tapes, each designed to be shown between other videotapes; that is, no two 'fragments' in the series are to be shown one after the other."
