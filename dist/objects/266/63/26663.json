        "Episode of Series \"Life Around Us\". Here we trace one of the most revolutionary findings of this century: the discovery of powerful forces deep within the earth that move continents and shift oceans. Shows how geologists, oceanographers, palaeontologists and mineralogists gather and analyse supporting data for the theory of \"continental drift\", the dynamic system which is reshaping the earth's surface."
