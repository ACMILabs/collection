        "Made to publicise the English GPOs ship to shore radio service, this was the first documentary film to pay its way in Britain by getting theatrical release in commercial cinemas, and for this achievement it was a special triumph for the pioneering documentary filmmakers. \"North Sea\" tells the story of the big gale of 1937. The crew of the trawler \"John Gillman\" are introduced as they leave their homes in Aberdeen to rejoin their ship. As the \"John Gillman\" and crew ride out the gale, wives and families wait anxiously at the Wick Radio Station. After 48 hours of silence a signal finally comes through."
