        "A cinematic \"poem\" that straddles documentary and experimental traditions capturing the atmosphere of San Francisco. Shows fresh and unexpected scenes of the city and its people in addition to San Francisco's landmarks. The narration, spoken by Vincent Price, is taken from a descriptive essay on San Francisco written in 1882 by Robert Louis Stevenson."
