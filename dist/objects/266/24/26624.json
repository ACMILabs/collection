        "This film is designed to illustrate how infant motor function can provide a valuable diagnostic tool for early detection of intellectual impairment. Employing extensive clinical footage, the filmmakers have sought to depict characteristic defects of co-ordination where these exist either independently of, or as a result of, childhood brain injury."
