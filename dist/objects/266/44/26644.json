        "Episode of Series \"African Continent\". The interaction of the modern with the colourful and traditional characterises Northern Africa. This geographic region is greatly influenced by three factors: its primarily Arab background and culture, its age-old lack of water, and its long history of European influence. Shows oasis farming, craftsmanship, and modern industries and cities; and views some of the problems that face Moslems and Europeans."
