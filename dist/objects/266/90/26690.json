        "Explores the handsome woodcuts that illustrate the Nuremberg Chronicle - a history of the world published in 1493 - giving the account of history as it was known in 1493 from the Creation to the Final Judgement that was predicted to be coming soon. The film conveys something of people's hopes, fears and beliefs at a time in history when old ways and ideas were changing radically."
