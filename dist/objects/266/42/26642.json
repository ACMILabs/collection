        "A summary of the agriculture and industries of Northern Ireland. Following an introductory map, we see farm scenes and typical farming activities; hay making and harvesting oats and potatoes, harvesting and treatment of flax, digging peat for fuel; dairying and fishing. The film ends with the industries of Belfast, linen mills and ship building, and the export from Belfast of the products of Northern Ireland."
