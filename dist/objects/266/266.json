        "Skip Blumberg presents, in his customary fashion, a series of short films examining the bizarre and the sublime in America in the 1980s. 'Summer Ski Jumping' follows the 33rd annual event ski enthusiasts who take over the Olympic ski jump in Lake Placid on the 4th of July and execute jumps over imported snow sometimes during temperatures reaching 100 degrees. 'Ugly Dog Contest' presents a subversion of the traditional dog show with a series of unusual looking dogs in line to take the prize of ugliest dog. 'Festival of the Saw' captures the international celebration of saw playing in Santa Cruz, with an examination of the demise of saw playing during the 1920s and its subsequent revival."
