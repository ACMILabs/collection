        "Tourists come to admire the physical and cultural beauties of Norway, but there is more to the country than that...there has always been the sea. Norwegian fishermen are responsible for 5 percent of the global catch. The film goes on to cover the problems associated with agriculture, the drift to the cities, industrialisation and pollution."
