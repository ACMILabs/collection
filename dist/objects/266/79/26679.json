        "Traces the history and current status (at the time of filming) of the nuclear arms race: documents continued international efforts at control; and explains the dangers of both vertical and horizontal proliferation. Scenes of muclear experiments from several countries serve to strengthen the film's plea for disarmament. Suitable for upper secondary level."
