        "In this short animation film the triangle achieves the distinction of principal dancer in a geometric ballet. The triangle is shown splitting into some three hundred transformations, dividing and sub-dividing with grace and symmetry to the music of a waltz. The film's artist and animator is Rene Jodoin, whose credits include Dance Squared and several collaborations with Norman McLaren. Film without words."
