        "Dealing with the problem of assimilation of migrants, the film shows how newcomers to Australia are finding new friends and happiness in the land of their adoption through the co-operation and sympathetic understanding of ordinary citizens. They begin their new life in a country town and through the personal interest of the editor of the newspaper, the newcomers become part of the life of the community."
