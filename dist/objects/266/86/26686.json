        "Two visitors from Britain travel across the Nullarbor Plain from Port Pirie to the \"golden city\" of Kalgoorlie in a luxurious air conditioned diesel electric train with music, good service and ever-changing colours of the desert. At small settlements along the line, they meet groups of local inhabitants, including aborigines, and the Flying Doctor. Commentary by Tanya Halesworth."
