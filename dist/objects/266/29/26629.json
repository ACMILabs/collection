        "Toronto-born Norman Jewison first gained prominence producing for Canadian television, then went on to greater success making Hollywood theatrical features. In this film he is seen directing a large international cast and crew in the film version of the musical hit Fiddler on the Roof. Between scenes, Jewison talks freely about many aspects of the film industry and some of his experiences in it. A candid study of a director in action."
