        "A film about the life of an Indian fisherman of the prairie provinces. For commercial fishermen the film shows simple but effective sanitary measures to protect the freshness and attractiveness of freshwater catches. For general audiences, there is a view of Indian life and enterprise. The commentary is spoken by the fisherman as he goes about his work. He recalls his boyhood when the men of his band freighted by canoe for the Hudson's Bay Company. But he talks about much more than fishing and hunting. He speaks of education, of sickness and health, of family, of poverty, of the pleasures of a Saturday night dance, and he demonstrates the tricks of his own trade - when to set a net, how to handle fish, and what it all costs in money, time, equipment and skill."
