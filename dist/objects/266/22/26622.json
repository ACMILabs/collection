        "The everchanging daydreams of a small boy are viewed with suspicion by his friends, his parents, and his doctor. However, when his parents realise that his dreams have commercial value, the boy is exploited until his dreams, like the flowers that inspire him, wither and die. Animated with music and sound effects. No spoken language. Animators: Janoslav Doubrava, Josef Hekrala, Vera Macesova"
