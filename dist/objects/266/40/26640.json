        "Image and music work together--either by contrast or analogy--to conjure up the look of Canada. Moods and activities; far-ranging landscapes; a bird's-eye view of great industrial complexes: all this and much more are fitted into a compelling visual composition that suggests, rather than spells out, the many ingredients that have slowly built a nation. A film without words."
