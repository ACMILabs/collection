        "The forest industry is the main export industry in Sweden, but it is also the main polluter of the water courses in the country. In 1969 Sweden made new stringent environmental protection laws, and in 1970 the pulp industry began pollution control projects. Investment requirements in the pollution control sector are considerable and in order to obtain the best possible basis for these investments, a research project - The Forest Industries' Water and Air Pollution Research Laboratory - was started. Some examples of pollution control measures in the pulp industry are shown."
