        "Using music and natural sounds, without narration, emphasises numerals in a child's largely urban environment. Car license plates, house numbers, speed limit signs, a petrol pump at the garage, numerals on money, labels on food, a cash register, show that numerals are everywhere. Encourages children to develop an awareness of numerals in their everyday experience."
