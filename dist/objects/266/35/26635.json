        "On patrol with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of the eastern Canadian Arctic, north of the 60th parallel. This film shows the day-to-day routine of constables who police the vast area that includes Baffin and Ellesmere Islands. For those who might choose northern service, the film provides clear impressions of the requirements of this detachment; for the general audience it gives an interesting overall view of the people, life and environment in the eastern Arctic."
