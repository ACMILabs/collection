        "'Cinema verite' account of illicit drug use in Melbourne's inner city; a critical response to the dominant media sensationalism of the 70's. Looks at the social and legal proglems of young drug addicts and discusses their emotional dependence on drugs, feelings of exclusion from society, and the unsuitability of the criminal process being applied to drug offenders."
