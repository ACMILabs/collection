        "A glimpse of Sydney's soup-kitchens and the down-and-outs for whom they provide meals. This documentary film gives a glimpse of the institutions and of the lives of the men they assist. Its frankly emotional approach avoids any attempt to explain causes or to offer solutions. In fact it suggests that strong personal pride is characteristic of these men, and would prohibit any easy solution."
