        "Minerals of all kinds have a key role to play in Australian development. Peko Mines at Tennant Creek and ore deposits in the surrounding areas of Juno, Ivanhoe and Orlando; iron ore deposits south of Darwin; bauxite prospecting at Gove; manganese production by Groot Eylandt Mining Company; and potential oil and gas deposits in the Amadeus Basin, are attracting capital investment and resulting in new centres of population being established."
