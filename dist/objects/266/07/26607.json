        "A 5-minute version of \"Let's keep our teeth\" suitable for young children (8-11 years of age) which shows the tough primitive diet of the Eskimos. Children are attracted by the food sequences which, linked with points about the reasons for tooth decay, make a quick transition from amusement to instruction. Vividly portrays life in the Arctic."
