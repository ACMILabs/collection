        "Gives a picture of the various parts of Nigeria, and their peoples, and of Nigeria's social problems. In the north, near the Sahara desert, the people are Mohammedans. In the central plateau live pagan peoples who herd cattle or practice a hoe agriculture. Near the coast, in the eastern provinces, live another pagan people, who get their living from the rain forests. In the western provinces, European influence is greatest. A Nigerian doctor living here explains some of Nigeria's problems, especially in regard to health and food supply."
