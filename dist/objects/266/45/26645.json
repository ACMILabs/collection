        "The story of the Queensland Coast and Torres Strait Pilot Service told by four of the master mariners of the service. Each year the pilots take some 1500 overseas and coastal vessels through these hazardous but beautiful parts. Beneath the beauty of the Great Barrier Reef there are hazards; strong tidal streams, saw-toothed reefs, the skeletons of wrecked ships, and other menaces."
