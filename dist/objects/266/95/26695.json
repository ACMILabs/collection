        "Episode of Series \"Nutrition\". Animated sequences explore this theme, while two voices discuss the significance of each scene. They explain the importance of choosing food from all of the basic food groups to provide a balanced diet. They also explain how proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals are used in our bodies, how digestion changes the food we eat so our bodies can use the nutrients, and how exercise and rest are needed to help us grow strong and healthy."
