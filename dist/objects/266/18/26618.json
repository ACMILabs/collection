        "The everyday life of a typical nomad family in the jungles of Malaya. In the dense tropical forest this group lives entirely on natural resources without agriculture or husbandry. The film shows how the family group secures and cooks its food, builds shelters, a bridge, and a raft. The film also shows how they adopt to changes in the climate and their environment. The story centres on the development of a boy, the chief's son, who is approaching maturity, and his preparation for adult responsibilities."
