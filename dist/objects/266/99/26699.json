        "One of the first films in the Free Cinema movement in British documentary production, Lindsay Anderson offers an insight into the British working class culture. Margate Amusement Park is depicted less a site of innocent levity than of vicarious sadism and quiet desperation. This observation of proletarian entertainment becomes as much a testament to the failure of Atlee's social democracy as Orwell's \"1984\". A powerful film."
