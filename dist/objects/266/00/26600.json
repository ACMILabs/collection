        "Mexico exemplifies one of the developing world's major problems, the serious impact of rural migrants on cities of every size. Cities containing industry are becoming increasingly less viable as unskilled people from the country swarm to them in search of jobs and a decent living standard. As automation cuts even deeper into work opportunities, overpopulated cities face growing crisis's. The U. N. World Food program is assisting Mexico in promoting labour intensive \"food-for-work\" projects designed to encourage rural people to stay where they are by raising rural living standards. Mexico is also bringing light industry to the countryside in the hope of raising rural incomes to Mexico City levels."
