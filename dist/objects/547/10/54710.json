        "Traces an underwater adventure in a colour fantasy of oceanic forms. Takes the viewer to a dark mysterious world, accented by an electronic music score. The diver encounters colour caves of sea anemones, the pastel shades of which build to an exciting brightness, and then returns to the blue surface. Stills set to music. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
