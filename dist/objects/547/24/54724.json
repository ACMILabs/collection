        "A film story exploring the state of mind of a teenage girl when she learns she is pregnant. The film slips in and out of the present, past and future in a way that communicates her feelings in an almost subjective way. Her need to tell her parents, her boyfriend, her school principal, and to find some help in her predicament is the heart of the film. Cast: Bernard Blumer, Yael Brandeis, John Kastner, Dona Saunders, Sandra Scott, Kay Tremblay. (Awards: Five including Montreal; New York)"
