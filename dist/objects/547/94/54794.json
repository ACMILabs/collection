        "Adopts a light-hearted approach to the topic of the body's need for sleep. The benfits of adequate sleep for children are shown as are the health hazards of insufficient sleep. The abundant energy of the children who enjoy regular sleep is contrasted with humorous pictures of children who are unable to keep their eyes open, due to poor sleeping habits. Suitable for middle and upper primary and lower secondary levels."
