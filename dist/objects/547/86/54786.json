        "Episode of Series \"Forest town fables\". This film uses a puppet story to explore the fallacy of belief in superstition, emphasizing self-reliance. It shows how Oni and the other puppets find out whether or not a good-luck charm really works when Oni reluctantly enters the spelling contest without it. Awards: two Emmy awards. Voices by Ruth Franklin and Marshall Izen. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
