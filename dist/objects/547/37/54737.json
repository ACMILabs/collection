        "A film about the people of Saigon as seen through the experience of three young American journalists who, in 1970, explored in their own way the consequences of war and of the American presence. It is not a film about the Vietnam war, or the rights or wrongs of it, but about the people who lived on the fringe of battle. The views of the city are arresting; but away from the shrines and the open-air markets lay another city, swollen with refugees and war orphans, where every inch of habitable space was covered. (Seven awards, including: Melbourne, Toronto, Robert J. Flaherty.)"
