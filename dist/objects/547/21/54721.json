        "Animated adaptation of Anatole France's story of a juggler named Barnaby who is given shelter in a monastery. To start with, the seemingly worthless Barnaby and his antics displease the monks, but one night his juggling causes a miracle, and the monks realise the worth of Barnaby and his talent. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
