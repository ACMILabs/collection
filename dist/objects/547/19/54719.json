        "Part of a series on the Netsilik Inuit as documented by the Education Development Center. In this film, it is full summer. The skin tents are up, and it is time to fish. The men go into the river to form enclosures to trap fish. Once trapped, they are speared with three-pronged leisters. A woman cleans the catch, which has been strung on a thong. Everyone enjoys bits of raw fish. Film without words."
