        "One of a series of films created originally for day-time television panel discussions to introduce to the public the range of social services available from Government and other agencies. This programme deals with the problems of unmarried mothers and in particular, with Joan, who worked at an assortment of jobs in order to keep her daughter. The film looks back at her life and at how she and her daughter have come through difficult years. It also highlights a social welfare group known as CHUM - Care and Help for Unmarried Mothers - where social interaction and support are available for women of all ages who are single mothers."
