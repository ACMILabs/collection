        "Australian Paralympians don't often receive as much publicity as their non paralympic counterparts. This video attempts to even out the balance by providing highlights and victories from previous Paralympic Games, which began in 1960. Highlighted on the video is Lizzie (as in lizard), mascot of the Paralympic Games who symbolises the dreams and motivation of the competitors. This section is narrated by Olivia Newton-John. Suitable for primary and secondary levels."
