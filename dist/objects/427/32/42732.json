        "Live action, animated sketches and maps are used to provide a detailed demonstration of how a forest fire is brought under control. The film describes the various factors - water supply, road transportation, type of timber stands, and direction of wind - which firefighters take into account in planning their attack and deploying equipment. It shows the actual fighting of a fire, and the mopping-up operations and close watch that must follow to safeguard against a renewed outbreak."
