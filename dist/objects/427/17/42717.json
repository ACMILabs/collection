        "Using as its source a radio interview from the ABCs current affairs program, The World Today, in which a Queensland mother recounts how she came to learn of her sons shooting in 1995, Dennis Tupicoff explores terrain somewhere between documentary and animation. As an animator he gives an added dimension to the documentary nature of his subject matter by dividing the film into two halves, one an animated re-enactment of the crime, the other an understated lyrical and visual poetic presentation of the overwhelming nature of grief. This short film is both compelling and powerfully affecting."
