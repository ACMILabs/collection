        "John Travolta cemented his position as the most versatile magnetic screen presence of the decade in this film version of the smash hit Broadway musical of the same name. Recording star Olivia Newton-John made her American film debut as Sandy, Travolta's naive love interest. The impressive supporting cast reads like a who's who in this quintessential musical about the fabulous 50s. Grease is not just a nostalgic look at a simpler decade, its an energetic and exciting musical homage to the age of rock'n'roll. Grease is the word! Includes new, retrospective interviews with the creators and cast of the hit musical."
