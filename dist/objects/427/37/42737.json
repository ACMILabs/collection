        "This is the story of Beatrice Lynn, a high society author, who heads into the wilds of northern Australia in search of an Aboriginal tribe ruled by a white king, Mara. Along the way she is kidnapped and taken through the bush, encountering pituri smugglers, and battling a killer before finally being sold to Mara. In the tradition of true melodramas a love conflict develops between the white chief and Beatrice and leads to an epic Chauvel finale. Filmed in North Queensland and Palm Island and featuring spectacular rainforest and river cinematography, director Chauvel made this film in an attempt to break into the American market. Censorship problems relating to nude swimming as well as violence were eventually overcome for the Australian release while a censored version was released on the overseas market."
