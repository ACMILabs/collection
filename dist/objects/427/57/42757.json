        "A children's feature set in Britain during World War II that focuses on the experiences of two London boys sent to board with a farming family during the period of heavy bombing. On one particular day the pilot from a ditched German bomber saves one boy from drowning and the boys must then decide whether or not to tell the English authorities of the German's whereabouts. Useful for discussion about the sense of war, concepts of right and wrong, the nature of friendship and loyalty, peer group pressure and family relationships. Based on the novel by Michael Morpurgo."
