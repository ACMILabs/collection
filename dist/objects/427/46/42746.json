        "This is the story of three generations of the O'Riordan family, battling bushfire, drought and cyclone to settle rugged frontier land. Based on the true story of the O'Reilly family, it took two years to make this film in the wild mountain terrain of southeastern Queensland. In this film Charles Chauvel realises his romantic vision of Australians as spirited rural people conquering a hostile land. Its power lies in the strong performances of the cast and in the striking landscape, which frames the human and elemental conflicts."
