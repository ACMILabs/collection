        "A bored white collar office worker finds meaning in the 25 second elevator ride to his office. In this secret time alone, he progresses from simply undressing to his shorts (and then re-dressing) to a multitude of relaxing pass-times, all at ultrafast speed. One day the lift gets stuck and later opens to reveal a much older man apparently dead of old age. (Won Palm D'Or, Cannes, 1976.)"
