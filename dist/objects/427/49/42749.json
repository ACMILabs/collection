        "Picnic parties, picture shows and promenading. Festivities, fashions and frontiers. Living in the first half of this century in Western Australia had an elegance even in the hardships of its isolation and pioneer lifestyle. Watch Perth grow into a capital city and centre of commerce. Its streets and suburbs flourishing around the Swan River. Travel to rural centres where the whole community gathers to watch a race and to its frontier towns where gold is the currency of life and death. See everyday life as sheep are dipped, cattle are paraded at the Agricultural Show, and people picnic at the zoo, frolic on the beaches and run errands down the street. Made up of rare archival footage from Western Australian sources and from the National Film and Sound Archive this fascinating video includes newsreels, documentaries, and actuality footage from 1902 to 1952."
