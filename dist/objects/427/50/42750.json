        "This is the story of the rise and rise of a self-confessed \"smut-peddler\", Larry Flynt (Woody Harrelson) and his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and his building of a publishing empire, of which \"Hustler\" magazine is the figurehead. Along the way Flynt gets dragged to court by several exponent of the religious right, intent on defending the \"decent folks\". At every turn, Larry fights back, using a tactic of high antics and retreat behind the \"First Amendment\". Courted by the Pentecostal movement and Ruth Carter (Jimmy's sister) played by Donna Hannover, he finally converts, only to give his campaign for \"free speech and porn for all\" the overtones of a crusade. The true life story of Larry Flynt is rich in sex, drugs, making money - and an assassination attempt. Who is Larry Flynt: a hedonistic, obnoxious pornograph or or an unlikely freedom of speech campaigner whose ardour is only tamed by drug addiction, mental illness, and Althea's failing health? This film won two Oscar nominations to Forman and Harrelson. Winner of Golden Bear, Berlin - 1997. Includes cameos by Larry Flynt, James Carville (former Clinton '91 campaing director) and Donna Hannover."
