        "Robert Carlyle stars as Gaz in this irreverent comedy set in the middle-England working class town of Sheffield. He is a jobless steel worker who dreams up an outrageous scheme to pull himself and his mates out of the personal and financial doldrums of long term unemployment. After seeing the money and adulation lauded upon the male exotic dance team The Chippendales by the females of the town, he rounds up willing and reticent participants for a review to be named the Full Monty. They are a collection of pigeon-chested, pot-bellied, heavy drinking, pale, wrinkly middle-aged strippers with one solitary gimmick - it all comes off! Cast also includes: Tom Wilkinson, Mark Addy"
