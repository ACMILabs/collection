        "The Big Easy is a sexy thriller romance set in New Orleans. When a member of the mafia is murdered in downtown New Orleans, Remy McSwain (Dennis Quaid) and Anne Osborne (Ellen Barkin) are unwittingly forced together as they pursue the murderer who may or may not be a cop. Barkin's starchy D.A. prosecutor disapproves of the shady ethical practises of McSwain and his 'Big Easy' co-workers, who view bribery as a normal way of life. Remy McSwain, who comes from a large family of New Orleans policemen starts to reevaluate his values and life as he and Osborne become closer. Jim McBride has created a rivetting and fun film which revels in it's complex characters and in the sizzling chemistry between Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin. Ned Beatty and Charles Ludlam are good in supporting roles and the film pulses with great cajun music and a sense of life in New Orleans."
