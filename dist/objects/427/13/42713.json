        "The voice of an Auschwitz survivor (voice provided by Zsuzsi Weinstock) is presented against a backdrop of images, both hopeful and tragic. She speaks of her childhood impressions, of a belief that she couldn't avoid her fate and the impact of Hitler's voice. Footage from \"The Wizard of Oz\" is juxtaposed against images of haystacks and has a personal significance to the narrator who wished she could go 'home', but realises she has none to go to."
