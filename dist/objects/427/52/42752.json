        "An extraordinary depiction of life aboard a German U-boat and the courage of those who manned it, this suspenseful, exciting and realistic war drama set in 1941 chronicles the horrific experiences of a greenhorn crew and their courageous captain as they battle the Allies out in the rough waters of the Atlantic. Much of the film was shot in a real submarine to create a genuinely claustrophobic feeling. Though it features little dialogue, the anti-Nazi sentiments of the story are clearly evident. This release of the video has been digitally re-mastered (sound and image) and features over an hour of never-before-seen footage and is in the original widescreen format. In German with English subtitles."
