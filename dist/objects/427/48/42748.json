        "Almost all of Queensland's film production for the 1890s has survived, and it offers a rare opportunity to see Australias colonial era come to life. This video contains highlights of the motion picture legacy of the of the pioneering exhibitors and filmmakers. Thoroughly researched and narrated by film historian Chris Long, this video opens a window into the colonial era and is a timely reminder of the crucial role played by factual film in the film in the first hundred years of cinema."
