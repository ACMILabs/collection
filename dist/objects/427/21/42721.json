        "This is a portrait of Chinese politician Deng Xiao Ping, a man who holds no official office in China, but runs the country as a virtual dictator. He has been credited as beign the one man who brought China from the brink of starvation to become one of the leading developing nations of the world. His policy of socialism is viewed by many in the West as being a form of Capitalism, but he will be remembered most by his people as the one dictator in 5,000 years of Chinese history who was determined to suppress a non-violent protest with extreme force - Tienamen Square."
