        "Based on the true story of the Leopold-Loeb murder case, Orson Welles stars as lawyer Jonathan Wilk, whose defence against capital punishment saves the lives of two teenagers , Judd and Artie. The two homosexual teenagers were charged with murdering a young boy as an example of their intellectual superiority. Bradford Dillman and Dean Stockwell star as the two accused, one sadistic, the other submissive, in this dramatic character study based on newspaper reporter Meyer Levin's bestseller."
