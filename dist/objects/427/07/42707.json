        "Witness the movie that brought attention to Arnold Schwarzenegger. For some athletes, sculpting their body is to attain near perfection. This classic film traces the fortunes of body builders Arnold Schwarzenegger, Louis Ferrigno, Mike Katz, Ken Waller, Ed Corney, Serge Nubret and France Columbu. Witness their attempts at body building supremacy as they vie for Mr Olympia. The contest seems to lie between two contenders; Schwarzenegger and Ferrigno in a real life clash of the titans. Based on the book of the same name written by Charles Gaines and George Butler."
