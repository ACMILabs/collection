        "Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro play contestants battling for huge cash prizes and instant fame on a top-rated quiz show in the mid-1950s. When charges surface that the hit program is fixed and players are being given the answers, it becomes far more than a game. Contestants, producers and the network itself get caught in the centre of an escalating scandal. Nominated for the 1994 Best Picture Academy Award and based on a true story that shocked the United States, this is a very compelling film."
