    "description": [
        "This 1918 Australian feature is one of the most significant surviving treasures of a silent film heritage which is now largely extinct. The story takes the concept of primitive justice - an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth - and extends it to a sister for a sister. Ralph Manton discovers that his sister Marjory has been seduced and demands to be told the name of the man. Faithful to her lover, she refuses, but later Ralph discovers his identity and confronts him. The tables are turned. Starring Australia's first film star, Lottie Lyell, the film was a critical and commercial success and offered audiences more than just a melodrama. It questioned the social mores of the day and the double standards of morality in regard to the men as the seducers. Musical accompaniment is by members of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, conducted by composer Donald Hollier."
