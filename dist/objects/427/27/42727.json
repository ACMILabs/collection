        "Narrated by Kate Nelligan, the film takes us on an odyssey across North America and Europe to capture the 'stolen moments' of lesbian history. Lesbian culture in pre-war Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam; the experience of women in Nazi concentration camps; and the butch/femme scene in New York in the 1950s, are just a few aspects of lesbian history and identity explored in this provocative film. Writers Joan Nestle, Leslie Feinberg and Audrey Lorde share their insights of love, life, sexual politics and feminism. The film also explores such contemporary cultural scenes as women's motorcycle clubs, dance bars, lesbian stand-up comedy, the Michigan Women's Music Festival and lesbian athletes and their participation at the Vancouver Gay Games.  A press kit complements the video and is issued as a separate loan item."
