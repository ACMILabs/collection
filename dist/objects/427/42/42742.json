        "A Comprehensive overview of a fascinating decade in the history of Melbourne and its environs, and a tribute to the many filmmakers who recorded the major - and minor - events which occurred in Melbourne in the 1950s. Told through clips from an astonishing range of newsreels, documentaries, travelogues, advertisements, home movies, dramatic features and short subjects - with a detailed commentary by Melbourne broadcaster Paul Higgins this vast array of footage has been arranged in six sections: Institutions (places, personalities, pasttimes) ; Growth (the baby boom, new government initiatives, urban sprawl) ; Events (sporting and cultural) ; The Games (the 1956 Olympics) ; Arrivals (fads and fashions, television and Tattersalls, celebrities and the consumer revolution) ; Change (or the lack of it!)."
