        "Based on Amy Tan's best-selling novel, \"The Joy Luck Club\" tells the story of two generations of Chinese women. Four are mothers and wives who emigrated from China to build new lives and families in the United States. The other four are their Chinese-American daughters who are struggling to define their own identities against the expectations of their mothers and the American society where they live. Wayne Wang masterfully interweaves the stories of the eight women which spans from feudal China to modern America, highlighting the similarities and differences between the two generations. \"The Joy Luck Club\" is a beautiful film to watch, with lavish production values which make the characters' stories even more compelling."
