        "Comedy troupes come and go, but in Australia one conglomeration has had them rolling in the aisles longer than any other. The team of Fast Forward have become an institution in this country, making a television career out of sending up TV. The brilliant talents of the writers and comedians take the mickey out of the serials, the ads, the soap operas, the video clips - the things we see day in day out on the small screen. Relive such classics as Magda Szubanski in the Sorbent ads, Marg Downeys Jana Wendt, Michelle and Ferret, the Dodgy Brothers, Victor and Sveta (the Russian Newscasters), Bobby Batista (the visually-impaired American newscaster) and Gina Riley imitating a bunch of pop musicians in well-known video clips."
