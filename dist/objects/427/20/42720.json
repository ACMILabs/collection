        "Looking for the fast track out of suburban hell, two natural born losers scheme an impossible bank heist. They feel they have strong credentials, as they spend their days watching crime dramas on television and it's about time they put what they've learnt into practive. Kev, angry, unemployed, and an accident waiting to happen gets the guns. Mick, slack, cynical and also unemployed, masterminds the plan. Cast includes Ben Mendelsohn, Jeremy Sims, Robyn Loau and John Polson."
