        "Sally Ingleton's documentary charts the fortunes of best friends Sun Jian and Guo Pei, as they prepare to stage their first designer collection in Shanghais annual Fashion Week. Their timing could not be more auspicious, Maoist austerity, the iron rice bowl and blue or grey tunics are out. For those too young to remember the Cultural Revolution, workers demonstrations have given way to makeup demonstrations. Matchmaking programs on TV and personal consultants are all the rage. This intriguing film captures the whirlwind pace of change in todays China."
