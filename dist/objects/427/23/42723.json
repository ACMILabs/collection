        "One of the most inhospitable and desolate regions on Earth, the Simpson Desert was to fight off many challenges to penetrate its seemingly impenetrable heart. Expedition after expedition tried and failed. Men died but still they came. This video faithfully reenacts the 1939 expedition of Dr. Cecil Madigan who successfully crossed Australias last frontier."
