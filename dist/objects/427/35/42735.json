        "Heritage explores 150 years of Australian history through the nationals myths of the visionary, the pioneer and the nation-builder. Opening with an historical reenactment, this film evolves into a fictional story of the hard-living, hard-drinking James Morrison and his wife, fiery Irish girl, Biddy OShea. Although they go their separate ways, their paths and those of their children, cross as a nations destiny unfolds. Working with a very small budget , Chauvel was still able to achieve striking set pieces, such as the opening tableau. This film won the first prize in the 1935 Commonwealth Government film competition. For a nation emerging from the Great Depression, it showed pride in the past and faith in the future"
