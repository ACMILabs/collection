        "Bobs luck changes when he mistakenly becomes a Taxi Driver of the Year finalist. As he performs his PR duties with unusual success, he starts to feel just a little impressive - impressive enough to make a move on Kaz, the base secretary hes been secretly admiring for two years. Unfortunately before he manages to ask her out, he is disqualified from the competition in well publicised disgrace. His impressiveness in tatters Bob must decide whether or not to go for Kaz anyway."
