        "Pierre Brasseur plays a surgeon who adopts extreme measures in his attempts to restore his daughter's face (Edith Scob), horribly disfigured in a car crash. His obsessive efforts require him and his loyal assistant (Alida Valli) to kidnap young women and graft their features onto his daughter. Director Georges Franju and cinematographer Eugen Shuftan transform the pulp horror material into an eerie and surreal Cocteau-like nightmare. Eyes Without a Face has been remade twice by Spanish director Jess Franco, first as 'The Awful Dr. Orloff' and later as Faceless. Described by Franju as 'an anguish film', this film contains some haunting images, none more striking than Scob's tortured eyes staring out from her stark, white expressionless mask. Music by Maurice Jarre. Based on a novel by Jean Redon. Also known as 'The Horror chamber of Dr. Faustus'. In French with English subtitles."
