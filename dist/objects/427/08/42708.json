        "The first of Wajda's unplanned war trilogy (with \"Kanal\" and \"Ashes and Diamonds\") offers a strikingly unsentimental appraisal of heroism in this tale of a cocky Polish youth who decides to fight the Nazis after he falls for a pretty Resistance leader. Barely out of their teens, he and his brash friends approach their first mission - to help escapees during the Warsaw gheto uprising - like a game of cops and robbers. Inevitably the game turns deadly and the innocence of a generation is lost under the gruelling conditions of war. Adapted by Bohdan Czeszko from his novel. In Polish with English sub-titles. Cast includes Roman Polanski"
