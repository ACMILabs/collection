        "Jude Fawley is a stonemason who loves learning. Inspired by his childhood schoolmaster, he longs to attend university and singlemindedly studies in the hope of gaining a place. His studies are interrupted when Jude blindly falls for and marries Arabella Dunn, the daughter of a local pig farmer. After a brief and unhappy marriage he moves to Christminster to be closer to his beloved scholars. There he meets and falls fatally in love with his cousin Sue Bridehead. The ill-fated lovers join in an illicit union that flouts society's conventions and tragedy ensues. Based on the novel \"Jude the obscure\" by Thomas Hardy."
