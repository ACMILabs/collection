        "As unpredictable as ultimate destiny, disasters can strike at any time. They are major misfortunes, occurrences that cause great suffering or privation, and are usually accompanied by the sudden and unexpected loss of human life. Throughout the 20th century, Australian cameramen and documentary filmmakers have recorded on film the great disasters that have befallen this nation, often at the very real risk of personal injury. This video looks at train collisions, aviation crashes, bridge collapses, mine explosions, fires, floods, droughts, earthquakes and cyclones."
