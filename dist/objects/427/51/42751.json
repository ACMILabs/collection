        "One of the most hotly debated subjects in educational circles worldwide is the trouble many boys are having with traditional schooling and growing up in general. This program provides some practical and desperately needed examples of how two diverse secondary schools are helping their boys to help themselves. Boort Secondary College, a small, country Victorian school where the academic performance and social growth of boys is encouraged through the Building blokes program. Cleeleand Secondary College, a large, tough school in a disadvantaged and multicultural outer Melbourne suburb which helps its boys with the Gateway Project and Make a difference program. An excellent follow up program to \"The Trouble with boys\". Study guide included."
