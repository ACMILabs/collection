        "Louka is a middle-aged Czech who loves women, hates the idea of commitment and owes more money than he can earn playing the cello in a funeral orchestra. When a friend suggests he make a little 'easy money' by entering into an arranged marriage, with a Russian woman seeking citizenship, Louka reluctantly agrees. But it's a decision that will throw his life into chaos...and change it forever. When the marriage is completed his new 'wife' is on the first plane to Germany leaving behind her five year old son for Louka to care for. So now this confirmed bachelor must become a father.. this grumpy old man and an innocent kid must learn to live together, even though they don't speak the same language. This is a funny, touching and unforgettable story that will touch your heart. Winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Contains Czech and Russian language with English subtitles."
