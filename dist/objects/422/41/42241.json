        "Minyaka is a town in need of miracles and happiness. Desperate for water and ruled by dishonest councillors they cannot even afford a swimming pool. A mysterious stranger, known only as the 'Fluteman' promises that he can create rain, for a cost. The councillors, (not believing his promise) agree to the sum of $5,000. The Fluteman creates rain, much the the relief of Minyaka. The councillors refuse to pay the amount promised however and Fluteman, like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, leads the children out of town in retaliation. Only a young school teacher with the assistance of her mute student can locate the children and expose the councillors to the rest of the township."
