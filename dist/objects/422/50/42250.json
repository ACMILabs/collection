        "Tubby the Tuba, jealous of the beautiful melodies his fellow orchestra members create embarks on an adventure to find a melody of his own. On his travels he looks after a group of dancing elephants and together they travel to Singing City, the home of orphan tunes. Will Tubby find the melody he's looking for? Based on the story by Paul Tripp, the songs, fun and friendship of Tubby's adventures will delight children of all ages."
