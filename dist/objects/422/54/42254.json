        "Ireland 1916, His dreams inspired hope, his words ignited passion and his courage forged a nation's destiny. \"Michael Collins\" (Liam Neeson) is the story of a real-life patriot whose bravery and unswerving dedication to the Irish people changed history as it made him into a legend. Collins quest would bring a man raised on war into an even more dangerous battle for peace. It would cost him his life and make him a hero for the ages. This film encompasses romance, violence, valour, rage, burning hope and fiery tragedy. The performances given by Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Stephen Rea, Julia Roberts, Aidan Quinn and Charles Dance are superb and linger long after the movie finishes."
