        "Matthew Gore's life is just like any other 12 year olds, until he meets 'Chocky'. What makes Chocky different from Matthew's other friends is that she cannot be seen, speaks inside Matthew's head and is an explorer from another world. Matthew develops new physical and mental capabilities through Chocky's guidance, however it also isolates him from family and friends and eventually throws him into the media spotlight. Matthew is forced to make some adult decisions about his unique friend and their relationship. Based on the novel by renowned science fiction writer John Wyndham."
