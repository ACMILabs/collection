        "This colorful adaptation of Emily Bronte's timeless novel follows the structure of the original story. Cathy and Heathcliff are childhood sweathearts whose love in adulthood is thwarted by the social conditions and expectations surrounding them. Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche are beautiful to watch although they don't catch the intensity of the doomed lovers of Wuthering Heights. The Yorkshire moors make a picturesque backdrop and Ryuichi Sakamoto supplies beautiful music."
