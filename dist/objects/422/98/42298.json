        "A sex eductional film which uses a factual but informal style. Discusses social attitudes towards sexuality and shows the effectiveness of a variety of contraceptive methods (somewhat out of date!). It also discusses women's issues and the freedom of women to own and control their own body. Please note this film was made in 1972 and pre-dates AIDS."
