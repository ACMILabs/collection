        "A humorous film based on a short story by Damon Runyon and told through voice-over narration. This film is set in Manhattan in the summer of 1931 when the unemployment situation drives a bunch of hoodlums to approach famous safe-cracker Big Butch with a plan: if he carries out a job they have arranged, they will split the payoff. Butch foresees just one complication, his wife is away for the evening and he is babysitting John Ignatius Jnr."
