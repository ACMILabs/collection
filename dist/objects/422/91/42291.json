        "Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, transported by his friend Doc's, time machine to 1955. Marty rubs shoulders with a much younger version of his parents and sees a side to them he never knew existed. The only problem is that the car responsible for sending him back to 1955 has run out of the plutonium required to fuel the car. Marty must convice Doc that his idea for a time machine, conceived in 1955 was a reality in the 1980's. As a further complication Marty must ensure his parents-to-be meet and fall in love."
