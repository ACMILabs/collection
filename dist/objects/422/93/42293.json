        "Kermit and Fozzie Bear star as twin reporters, who together with the rest of the Muppet gang travel to Great Britain in search of jewel thieves. Catching the guilty culprits seems to be the only action to redeem themselves with their boss for letting the thieves escape under their very noses. During their stay Kermit meets Miss Piggy posing as fashion designer Lady Holiday (Diana Rigg), the woman whose gems have been stolen. While the Muppets are in Britain another of Lady Holiday's diamonds is stolen and Miss Piggy is arrested on suspicion of theft. Now there is even more at stake than their jobs as the Muppets race to clear Miss Piggy's name and stop another theft from occurring. Features cameos by Peter Falk, John Cleese, Peter Ustinov and others."
