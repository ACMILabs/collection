        "In one special season Gary Ablett redefined the way Australian Rules football's rich history will judge him. Having set standards rarely matched by other players since his career began, Ablett's 1993 was quite extraordinary - even for a man prone to producing the extraordinary. We follow Ablett's path through the season, hear him speak on his performance and his place in the Geelong team and travel to Nauru with him as he umpires the local Grand Final. This is a fine tribute to one of the legends of the game."
