        "Anne Frank has been described as one of the icons of the 20th century with her diary the second most read book of Western non-fiction after the Bible. Narrated by Kenneth Brannagh, with Glenn Close reading excerpts from the famous bestseller, John Blair's film is effective in placing Anne's story firmly in its 20th century context. This is not just her life in Holland and her death in a Nazi concentration camp, but the impact the diary has had in the half century since. Suitable for Upper Secondary level student, this packi includes a comprehensive study guide."
