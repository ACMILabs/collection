        "Based on Tolstoy's short story \"Father Sergius\", the Taviani brother's \"Night Sun\" is a brooding portrait of one man's search for truth. Baron Sergio Giuramondo (Julian Sands)is set for a comfortable life in the kings court when he discovers that the woman he is about to marry is the king's mistress. He joins the priesthood, eventually becoming a monk with a growing reputation for saintliness. \"Night Sun\" is a beautiful film to watch, with plenty of lush italian palazzi settings and rural vistas of. Julian Sands is mesmerising as the tortured Father Sergius. In Italian with English subtitles."
