        "Spotswood is an ordinary place where nobody is ordinary, and where business as usual is very unusual! Anthony Hopkins plays Wallace, a time and motion expert who has come to Spotswood to turn the workers at the local moccasin factory from a bunch of eccentric oddballs, into a well-oiled working machine. This quirky film has a great cast, including Ben Mendelshon, Russell Crowe, Bruno Lawrence and Alwyn Kurts and is an epic saga sweeping two suburbs that is refreshing and uplifting comedy at its best!"
