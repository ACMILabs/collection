        "A documentary record of a three-day conference held in Steinberg Limited's lodge north of Montreal. Here, faced with the stepping down of Sam Steinberg as president, ambitious top-level executives thrash out their differences in matters of corporation policy and objectives, ever aware of the crucial issue: who will be president after Mr. Sam? Sprinkled with Sam Steinberg's reminiscences and reflections on business, full of insights into the workings of a large corporation and clashes of interest and character, the film presents an unusually close view of a struggle for power and position."
