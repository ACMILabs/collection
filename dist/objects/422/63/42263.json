        "Primitive humans employed animals to supplement their own strength and labour power, and this method of production has been common to all civilizations. Technological development which went hand in hand with the increase in the complexity of European civilization, particularly the development of machines, gradually replaced the labour-power of men and draught animals in many aspects of production. The social and economic implications of industrialisation are noted."
