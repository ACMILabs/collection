        "Between their studies, children of all ages and in all parts of Japan have time for fun and frolics. This film shows the games children play: on stilts, with hoops, in the snow, wrestling, ball games and shadow play and cats cradle. They also skip, play baseball, hopscotch, roller skating, shuttle cock, fly kites and model aeroplanes as well as painting, playing in sandpits, dressing dolls - and have a wonderful time in playgrounds."
