        "Jim Mason is a 15 year old street struggling to stay on the right side of the law. He lands a job on a tugboat from Platypus Cove and things seem to be looking up. His peace is shattered however when he becomes the number one suspect for a sabotage attempt on the boat. It's up to Jim and his crew of friends to catch the real culprits in a race around Sydney harbour. No year of production available."
