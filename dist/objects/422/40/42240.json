        "Wayne Wang's \"Smoke\" is a beautifully crafted film that weaves together the stories of a group of characters whose lives intersect at Augie Wren's (Harvery Keitel) cigar shop. Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) is a writer who is trying to recover from the death of his wife. He runs into 'Rasheed' who is looking for his father. Meanwhile Ruby McNutt (Stockard Channing) is trying to convince Augie that her heroin addicted daughter is his. Keitel acts as an anchoring force in \"Smoke\" as the characters' stories unfold lesuirely and lovingly. (Awards: Winner of the 1995 Berlin Film Festival International Critics Prize and Special Jury Prize)"
