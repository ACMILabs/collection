        "The potentialities of the beef cattle industry in northern Australia. An agricultural survey by CSIRO of a large area in northern Australia, coupled with recent research based on experimental farms that have set the stage for a major revolution in agricultural production. Outlines the present status of the cattle industry and illustrates research into beef production. How fodder crops and the by-products from some cash crops, both of which can be grown locally, could bring about a great improvement in the nutrition of beef cattle in the region."
