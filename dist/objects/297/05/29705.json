        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Transference of Heat\". The film is divided into three parts: the first part shows convection in water as illustrated by the working of a central heating system and a motor coar cooling system. The second part shows convection in air with ventilation in a room with windows first open and then closed, as examples. The third part of the film illustrates the difference between a sea breeze and a land breeze."
