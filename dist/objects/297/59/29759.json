        "Episode of Series \"Plant Supervisors Problems\". Historically interesting film - to be taken in context to the year it was produced, ie the 1950's! A supervisor, Brad, discusses his objections to a new woman worker with the Personnel Manager. He recalls trouble with previous women employees: one kept her desk like a dressing table and objected to moving to a different one; another engaged girl gave insufficient notice of leaving to marry; then there was absenteeism. The Personnel Manager suggests that it is up to Brad whether the new \"girl\" adds up to trouble. The audience is asked: \"What is Brad's trouble?\" Useful for feminist theory studies."
