        "Episode of Series \"Golden West Series\". Filmed in the Jarrah and Karri forests of Western Australia, shows the felling of trees and transport by whim and rail to the mill. Aspects of reafforestation and fire control are also shown. Historically interesting film in light of when it was produced (1948) and the current debate in the year 2000 surrounding the logging of these forests in Western Australia."
