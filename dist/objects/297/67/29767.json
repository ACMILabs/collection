        "Episode of Series \"Anglers' Corner\" In a fast-flowing, rocky river in Yorkshire, we watch the angler casting into the areas where he suspects the trout is lying. These northern rivers of Britain produce a meaner, more hungry trout, who needs less tempting than the southern variety. Three flies are used in the wet fly technique, placed about a yard apart on the line. With the aid of an underwater camera we see the trout being played and caught."
