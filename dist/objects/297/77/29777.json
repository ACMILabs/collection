        "In a city high school, a jazz combo needs a trumpet player. Randy is the natural choice since he is the most talented, but the music teacher favors Bruce, a black student. What should come first? The band? The opportunity it affords to Bruce? The teacher's pleasure? These are questions for the audience to decide."
