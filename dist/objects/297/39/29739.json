        "On Tower Hill stands the fire-scarred shell of Trinity House; but although this building was damaged during World War 2, the work of the organisation it housed goes on regardless of war or bombs. Trinity House is responsible for the administration and maintenance of Britain's 1217 lighthouses, 87 lightships, and countless buoys, pilot boats, markers, and other aids to navigation. Trinity House pilots steer ships through shoals and past hidden reefs and rocks in British waters."
