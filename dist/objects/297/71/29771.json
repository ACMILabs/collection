        "A dramatic reconstruction of the British counter-propaganda campaign against the popular German forces program from the Belgrade Radio. The theme song \"Lili Marlene\" introduced the German \"Message from Home\" session. The film shows how the Germans came to use the song, how the British captured it and how the BBC turned the song to our advantage during the African Desert campaign. The British Eighth Army adopted \"Lili Marlene\" as their own special marching song. Appearance by Marius Goring."
