        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Transference of Heat\". Explains how heat sources emit radiations both as heat waves or infra-red waves and as light waves; how objects absorbing heat radiations rise in temperature; how heat is produced in glass-houses and how such glass-houses are cooled; explains the effects of clouds on radiation from the sun; shows how the shape of the earth results in different concentrations of the sun's radiation at the poles and at the equator."
