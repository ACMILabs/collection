        "Java is a tropical land, its fertility constantly replenished by volcanic ash. We board a train in a bustling seaport on the coastal plain and proceed gradually up the mountain slopes, stopping frequently to observe the people at work. As the train climbs, the climatic conditions and the crops change. Java produces great wealth in oil, rubber, teak, and quinine, as well as crops of tea, rice, sisal, kapok."
