        "A history of the toothed wheel. This film provides a clear exposition of the historical development of the means of transferring power from the simple lever to the wheel and pulley, and finally the gear. This film has become famous throughout the world for the imaginative parallel it draws between the development of mechanisation and the general progress of industrial civilisation."
