        "The production of certified seed in Australia - each state operates its own scheme. Explains the advantages of certified seed; required standards of a maize, clover, rye grass, phalaris cocksfoot or other crop; inspection of seed sewing and later harvesting; purity and germination tests before \"labels\" are assigned. Provides maximum protection for the Australian farmer, and to the growing export consumer."
