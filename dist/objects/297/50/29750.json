        "Episode of series \"The Earth and its peoples\" The Amazon River drains two-fifths of the continent of South America and varies in width from a mile to 800 miles at its mouth. Rain falls nearly every day, the climate hot and humid and the rain forest is almost impenetrable. Travel is almost entirely by water. Products are rosewood, brazil nuts, rubber, jute, cocoa. We are shown a family living in primitive conditions and the effect an unhealthy climate can have upon people and their development."
