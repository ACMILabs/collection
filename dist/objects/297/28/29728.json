        "In this film we are introduced to a farmer and his son who, in 1934, were distressed by the damage wrought by drought and wind to their farm. At the suggestion of the Forest Service Officer, the farmer decided to carry out a Forest Service plan for planting trees to act as wind-breaks and shelter-belts on his farm, as part of the Prairie States Forestry Project \"The Shelterbelt\" which extended from North Dakota to Texas. By 1939, this kind of tree planting was being encouraged all over the prairie farmlands in the United States with participation by the farmers an essential part of the program."
