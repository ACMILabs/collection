        "For all children, but especially for those studying natural science in elementary grades, this film shows an aspect of life they will understand and enjoy. A motion picture camera linked to a high-powered microscope shows the miracle of the leaf as it turns sunlight into chlorophyll. The film also shows how a tree feeds, breathes, and grows."
