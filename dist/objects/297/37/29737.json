        "Illustrates six different classroom situations. Trigger 1 raises the issue of the lecturer's responsibility in stimulating the students' interest, in addition to presenting information; Trigger 2 considers the function of lectures in the teaching-learning process, focusing on a communication model; Trigger 3 emphasises the fact that teaching may not result in learning, by focusing on teaching techniques; Trigger 4 demonstrates that there may be a gap between verbal and non-verbal communication; Trigger 5 raises the question of relevance, and the differing perceptions of students and staff; Trigger 6 portrays an incident which often provides a basis for teacher-student conflict. Designed to encourage discussion about teaching and learning situations."
