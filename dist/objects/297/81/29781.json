        "Using puppets, engravings, stills and newspaper cutouts this film describes the propaganda systems which are often used to cover up or distort the truth. Explains that recognition of these guises, combined with careful examination of all the facts, leads to finding the truth. Includes hints on how to recognise propaganda. Based on the book by Elsa Bailey."
