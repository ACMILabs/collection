        "Episode of Series \"Listening to Music\" The film introduces the trumpet, horn and trombone and shows in close-up the basic techniques of producing sound from the instruments. The use of the lips to produce a harmonic series is clearly demonstrated. In the case of the trumpet and the horn the use of the valve mechanism, and the slide in the case of the trombone, are also explained."
