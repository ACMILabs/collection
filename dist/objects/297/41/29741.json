        "Arthur Lipsett's incisive look at human might, majesty and mayhem, compiled from some peculiar newsreel items of the twentieth century. The filmmaker calls this 'additional material for a time capsule', but his arrangement of pictures combined with Ron Alexander's soundtrack makes it almost explosive. There are hundreds of items, once front-page news, but all wryly grotesque when seen in this reshuffle of the past. (Awards: San Francisco, Venice)"
