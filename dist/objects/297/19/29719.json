        "As the Hook Continental express leaves Liverpool Street Station, a passenger starts to guess where his fellow passengers are going. In his imagination the journey becomes interwoven with scenes of his travelling companions at their supposed destinations:  among the windmills, diamonds and cheeses of Holland; at a Rhine wine festival; on Mount Pilatus in Switzerland; in Denmark and Germany."
