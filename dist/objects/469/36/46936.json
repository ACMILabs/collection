        "Pilot Jimmy Garrett (Mathew Broderick) finds himself working on a special military assignment as punishment when he is grounded for misconduct. His mission is to teach chimpanzees to fly through the use of flight simulators, and he quickly discovers an affinity with the animals who he begins communicating with. When he befriends researcher Teri (Helen Hunt) and her number one student, a chimpanzee called Virgil she has successfully taught sign language to, Garrett discovers something that wasn't in the brief - the real purpose of \"Project X\" is to test the limits of human endurance by subjecting the experimental primates to radiation. Teri and Jimmy are forced to question their loyalties to science, their careers, and the animals that have become friends. Cast also includes Bill Sadler, Johnny Ray McGhee and Jonathan Stark."
