        "This documentary traces the history of Aboriginal country music over six decades, revealing how Aboriginal Australians have long been inspired by country music and have used it to tell their stories - of everyday life, the connection to the land, the fight for land rights and the struggle for equality. It combines rare archival images and recordings, interviews with musicians, including Jimmy Little, Harry and Wilga Williams, Bob Randall, Roger Knox, Bobby McLeod, Vic Simms, Auriel Andrew, Lionel Rose, Herbie Laughton, Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Troy Cassar-Daley, who speak about the challenges of performing, the discrimination they have faced and the support they have received. The film is both a celebration of the rich tradition of Aboriginal country music and a moving record of indigenous Australia. Based on the book of the same name by Clinton Walker.
