        "John Hughes wrote and and directed this teen farce. Gary and Wyatt are two unpopular geeks in high school who fantasise about having beautiful girlfriends and being the coolest kids in school. Inspired by a clip from the classic film \"Frankenstein\", the two decide to try their luck at creating the woman of their dreams. The result is Lisa - beautiful, saucy and the answer to every man's dream - who becomes a mentor to the two libidinous youths, her mission being to help them get the young women they want. Cast includes: Anthony Michael Hall, Kelly LeBrock, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Paxton."
