        "The first musical blockbuster by the immensely successful Rice and Weber song writing duo, this straight-to-video recording of the spectacular stage production features Donny Osmond as Joseph. Based on the Biblical story of Joseph and his coat of many colors. Joseph is the favorite son of Jacob (Richard Attenborough), but his eleven brothers resent the attention their father showers upon him and sell him into slavery. Eventually, the favored son finds himself in jail, however his favorable interpretation of the dreams of the Pharaoh win him the admiration of the all-powerful leader, and soon Joseph is one of the most powerful men in Egypt. Songs include 'Close Every Door to Me, 'Go Go Go Joseph' and 'Any Dream Will Do'. Cast also includes Joan Collins and David Grindrod."
