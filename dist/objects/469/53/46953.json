        "Fuel gas as a source of energy in modern society. Compares the use of gas at the turn of the century with its present-day use for cooking, water heating, space heating and refrigeration. Production processes for three types of manufactured gas are described; coke oven gas, carburetted water gas and oil gas. Research work on improved methods of gas production is illustrated including the method based on the catalyst cracking process."
