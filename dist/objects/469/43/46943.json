        "Ry Cooder went to Cuba in 1996 to meet with a group of legendary musicians of the 1930's, 40's and 50's. The result was the Grammy Award winning album Buena Vista Social Club. When Cooder travelled to Cuba again in 1998 to record a solo album with Ibrahim Ferrer - again with all the musicians of the Buena Vista Social Club - Wim Wenders accompanied him with a small film crew, observing the musicians in the studio and tracing their lives in Havana."
