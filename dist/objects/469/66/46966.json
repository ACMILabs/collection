        "It's five years from where \"Once were warriors\" left us, and Jake the Muss has turned his back on his family - breaking old habits is not as easy. His long suffering wife, Beth (Rena Owen), has left him and is living with someone new. Jake too has started a new relationship which is punctuated by violence and alcohol abuse. He is reunited with Beth and younger son, Sonny (Clint Eruera), at the funeral of Nig, who died in a gang fight. Tensions flare between Jake and Sonny, and as Sonny delves deeper into the dangerous world of gangs to gain retribution for his elder brother's death, Jake must face, once and for all, the demons of the past and open up to the possibility of change, and survival."
