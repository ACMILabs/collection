        "These adaptations of some of Hans Christian Andersen's stories have been produced as a teaching aid for Australian schools. The presentation has been designed to enhance children's listening and concentration skills and to inspire their imaginations. Each story is beautifully illustrated with full colour drawings. Narrator Grant Denyer's lively storytelling comes from his experience in education and television, giving the stories a crisp easy listening feel. Volume one contains an introduction and the stories \"The emperor's new suit\", \"The tinder box\" and \"The princess and the pea\"."
