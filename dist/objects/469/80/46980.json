        "Automobiles play a dominant role in 20th century society, making a personal statement about the owner and providing them with a functional vehicle, and for some - an obsession. These 4 half hour segments are united by the fascination between people and their cars. \"Affairs of the heart\" (Dir: Steve Westh): Dennis, proud owner of Marilyn Monaro - a 1975 Holden Monaro GTS coupe reminisces about past journeys in the vehicle as he prepares to put it on the market. His wife, Rhonda, describes how she copes with her husband's obsession, meanwhile, we get to spend a day with employees and potential car owners at Melbourne's Cheapest Car Supermarket. \"Wrong way: go back\" (Dir: Catherine Marciniak): Follow Vic Roads traffic clearer Neil Dwight as he makes sure the arterials of Melbourne are free from obstruction. The program also follows the decision making process of the Knox City Council as they grapple with the proposed Scoresby Freeway. \"Til death do us part\" (Dir: Fiona Hergstrom): Speed, alcohol and young males, what is the correlation? A young male involved in a car accident involving alcohol describes how it has affected his life since then. We also witness young drivers at a driver education centre as they go through the ropes of safe driving. \"A Little inconvenience\" (Dir: Helen Gaynor): Louise scours for someone to insure he Renault after it is involved in a minor accident. The process proves to be a lot lengthier than anticipated."
