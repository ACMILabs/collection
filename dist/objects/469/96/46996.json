        "Beginning with the 1999 British production \"Mamma Mia\", this fascinating documentary flashes between past and present to effectively capture the band who were phenomenally successful for 25 years and continue to capture new audiences today. Agnetha, Benny, Bjorn and Anni-Frid talk candidly (to varying degrees) to the camera, the first time they have been united since the band split up. We follow their success in the 1974 Eurovision song contest with \"Waterloo\", their quick breakthrough from the one hit wonder tag to chart success in the UK and America, how they perfected their unique sound and look, the musical careers of the four prior to forming together, their marriage and separation, and their respective lives today - all interspersed with concert and recording studio footage. Interviews are conducted with fans like Bono, Tim Rice, and Australian director Stephan Elliot who attempts to explain why the band have attained a cult following with the queer audience, a somethat dubious fan- Malcolm McLaren, as well as Lasse Haalstrom who directed the band in \"Abba: the movie\", following their Australian concert with a movie camera."
