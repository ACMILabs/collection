        "Newsreel report on developments in penicillin research. Gives a brief history of the discovery of penicillin in 1929 by Alexander Fleming, and the subsequent work 10 years later in Oxford to isolate the germ killer within penicillin and producing it in stabilised form. Film is shown of work progressing in the laboratory of the research teams and in the new production plant. An interview with Frank Doyle, head of the chemical department, discusses a new oral form of penicillin being developed, and new compound [Selbenin?] which combats resistant staphylococcal bacteria in hospitals."
