        "Shot during the Berger Inquiry into the Mackenzie Valley pipeline, this film presents the Native people's point of view. The majority feel it would destroy their ancient hunting grounds and upset the balance of nature, and that Canada's title to the land is far from settled. This film raises important questions about northern development in general."
