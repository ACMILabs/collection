        "Jacob Singer is a Vietnam veteran working as a postman who is deeply haunted by a horrible experience in battle, the details of which he cannot clearly recall. When strange and violent hallucinations begin to invade his everyday life, together with the discovery that his fellow battalion members are also seeing the same demons, he begins to suspect covert Army involvement. As the visions become darker and more terrifying, he suffers severe panic attacks related to the chaos that may be reality or that may merely exist in his own mind. Cast includes: Tim Robbins, Elizabeth Pena, Danny Aiello, Matt Craven, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Jason Alexander."
