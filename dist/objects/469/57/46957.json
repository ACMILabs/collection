        "The uncontrolled spread of the gypsy moth is creating a serious problem that is difficult to estimate economically. In this film the audience sees the type and extent of the damage caused by these prolific insects, as well as the ease with which they are transported from one area to another by unsuspecting humans. The moth was introduced to North America from Europe in 7869 by a scientist, and has now spread with insufficient naturel predators, thereby causing great damage to Canada's forests and crops. Superb photography."
