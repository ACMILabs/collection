        "14 year old Graham's experience with a failed science experiment leads him into a life long obsession with poisons and their effect on those around him. Failing to do away with his first victim - his best friend - Graham charts the slow demise of his step-mother, in the interim maiming his older sister. Once the young poisoner's crimes are discovered, he is detained in a centre for the criminally insane. From this point on Graham's battle with redemption and the desire for infamy are followed with dark humour. Deemed to be beyond his unfortunate psychopathic beginnings, Graham finds life outside of 'Harshurst' all too seductive for a young poisoner to bare, his new colleagues coming to this realisation just a little too late. Based on the true story of the St Alban's poisoner."
