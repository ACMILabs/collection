        "Set in Sydney's King's Cross, 19 year old Jimmy (Heath Ledger) finds himself in debt to a local gangster, Pando, played by perennial Australian actor Bryan Brown, when a simple job goes wrong. Jimmy's life depends on his locating the $10,000 he has lost. As his scheme to replace the cash is played out, two street kids are enjoying a shopping spree with the original loot. The black humour of the film progressively darkens as the story unfolds. Rose Byrne co-stars as country girl, Alex, who becomes involved with Jimmy and his increasingly dire situation."
