        "Episode number 5 of Series \"What Do You Think\". Are there circumstances in which one group may justifiably deny to another a chance to have its say at a public meeting when a question concerning both is at issue? This problem comes to the fore in a clash between a teenage group and a community center committee. The young people are accused of destructive behavior and are, without a hearing, denied the use of the center. In retaliation they hire a hall to publicly voice their protest. The committee feels it too should be heard at the meeting. The question is left to the film audience."
