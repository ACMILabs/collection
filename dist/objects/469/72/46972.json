        "It is 1999 and Opera Australia need a hit at the box office. They decide to stage Puccini's masterwork- about a passionate young diva caught in the political turmoil of 19th century Rome- as a lavish production to lure the patrons. However, with a tight budget rehearsal time is cut to the bone and cast and crew are given just three weeks to prepare before the curtain is raised. Backstage drama and tensions build as opening night draws rapidly closer, Director Trevor Graham (who also directed 'Mabo: Life of an island man') was granted unrestricted access to film behind the scenes, from day one of rehearsals to opening night at the Sydney Opera House. This production stars Joan Carden as Floria Tosca and is conducted by Roderick Brydon."
