        "A dowdy and repressed young woman, a colonel's daughter who has led a sheltered life, is irresistibly attracted to a man who is romantic and reckless, a rejection of everything her family background and upbringing have stood for. After their marriage she finds that he is a liar and, she suspects, a murderer. She comes to believe that he plans to murder her. Although the ending is apparently not what Hitchcock originally intended, the film as it now stands does not run counter to his interest in the themes of paranoia and the fragility of relationships. Cast includes Cary Grant, Joan Fontaine, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Nigel Bruce and Dame May Whitty. Adapted from the novel 'Before the Fact' by Francis Iles."
