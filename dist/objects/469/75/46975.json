        "A documentary about the Australian military chaplains who served in Vietnam. Combining archival footage with interviews with chaplains and soldiers, the film considers the issues they were forced to confront on a daily basis. The underlying theme is the evident humanity of the chaplains, who had to deal with their own trauma while providing support for soldiers emotionally and physically torn apart by the brutality of the Vietnam war. The film also discuss the negative reactions the military chaplains faced from other clergy when they returned from Vietnam due to their involvement in an unpopular war."
