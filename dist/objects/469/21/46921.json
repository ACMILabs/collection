        "The drama begins on the morning of 17 April 1961, as news of the Bay of Pigs invasion reaches the Black River area of the Escambray Mountains in central Cuba. Tirso Fabre, a militiaman and member of the Black River co-operative farm, and Chano Carrillo, a counterrevolutionary hiding behind his front as a Castro sympathizer, receive the news in different ways, in line with their antagonistic ideological positions. The film traces a long-running personal feud between the two men of which the roots go back to the pre-revolutionary years, in a story told in flashback and flashforward. Cast includes Sergio Corrieri and Nelson Villagra. In Spanish with English subtitles."
