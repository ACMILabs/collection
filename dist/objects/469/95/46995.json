        "Mildred Hubble (Fairuza Balk), a student at Miss Cackle's International Academy for Witches, can't do anything right. Her disastrous spell-casting constantly attracts the displeasure of her teacher, Miss Hardbroom, and the ridicule of her classmates, in particular, snobby teacher's pet, Ethel Hallow. After Mildred accidentally turns her into a pig, Ethel decides to get her back by sabotaging her broomstick just prior to the much-anticipated Halloween celebrations. The resulting chaos forces the premature departure of the Grand Wizard (Tim Curry), and Mildred is so ashamed that she decides to run away. While flying over the countryside, she stumbles upon a coven of wicked witches, and learns of their fiendish plot to take over Miss Cackle's Academy. Will Mildred be able to redeem herself by saving the Academy, or will she fail, and be forever known as the worst witch?"
