        "In July 1996 the Rights of the Terminally Ill act was successfully passed in the Northern Territory. It made the territory the first and only state in Australia to pass a voluntary euthanasia bill. In September of the same year, MP Kevin Andrews tabled a bill in federal parliament opposing the NT act, his actions creating the now infamous \"Andrews\" bill. \"Where angels fear to tread\" follows pro Euthanasia Activist Dr Philip Nitschke during the months of December 1996 to March 1997 when the Senate eventually sat to reach a decision. Nitschke is frank about his opinions towards his opponents, the relationship he has with patients he's assisted to die, and acknowledging the tag of executioner. The viewer is privy to his media campaign and the pro Euthanasia movement as it struggled against a more organised and media secretive Euthanasia No campaign - backed by influential religious leaders and the AMA in Darwin. Featuring interviews and footage with Bob Brown, Senator Harradine, patient Janet Mills, the Bishop of Darwin, AMA members and Tony Burke - campaign manager of Euthanasia No, what emerges is not only a struggle between the right to die with dignity and a doctor's hippocratic oath, but also the autonomy of the territory to create and uphold their own legislation."
