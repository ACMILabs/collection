        "Told from the point of view of Harry, a black labrador, F.I.D.O. follows the controversial path of the Fairfield Industrial Design Object - appropriately named F.I.D.O. The project materialises itself in real life in the form of a proposed public art structure - a 6 metre high dog with lights and a moving tail. We hear from the artists themselves, outraged residents who feel like they have been left out of the democratic process, and a supportive Darebin Council member. Regardless of the outcome and opinions expressed, two things remain - there are a lot of dogs in the City of Darebin, and the face of Fairfield is changing."
