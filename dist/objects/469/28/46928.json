        "Road safety film made in Sydney using a parallel with the Alice in Wonderland fairytale to discuss issues of pedestrian and driver safety. Focusses on Alice who is more intent on her shopping than on paying attention to the traffic. She meets up with her boyfriend, \"The Mad Hatter\" and they go for a drive in the country and demonstrate the dangers of admiring the scenery instead of the road. Gives statistics comparing road deaths in NSW with WWII casualties. Features flashback footage of Sydney in 1908."
