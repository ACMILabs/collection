        "John Hughes wrote and directed this film which was to become the quintessential high school drama of the 80s. Claire, the princess; Andrew, the jock; John, the criminal; Brian, the nerdy brain; and Alison, the basket case are all faced with spending nine hours together in Saturday detention. They begin the day as strangers having nothing in common, but as the day progresses, they slowly develop a bond in recognising that they are not as different as their places in the high school caste system would have them believe. Cast includes: Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy and Paul Gleason."
