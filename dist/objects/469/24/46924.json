        "Today the Gold Coast (Africa) is no longer a backward country. New roads and buildings are being constructed, people are learning new skills and trades and the country is making rapid political progress. However, democracy canot be superimposed from above. The people of the country must be educated to accept new responsibilities. This film shows how new schools, technical colleges and training centres are being built to bring formal education to the young people of the Gold Coast. At the adult level, mass education projects are under way, through which the adults of the community are learning to read and write, and, more important, are learning how to raise their standard of living."
