        "This film shows how positive and negative charges are created: defines such basic concepts as insulator, conductor and electric field; and introduces Coulomb's law, used to measure electrostatic charges. A laboratory demonstration of Faraday's ice-pail experiment is presented. The film also shows how the principles of electrostatic charges and forces can be used to explain the operation of the Van de Graaff generator."
