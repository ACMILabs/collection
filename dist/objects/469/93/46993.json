        "During the London blitz widower Tom Oakley (John Thaw) is one of many residents of a close knit community asked to do their bit for the war effort by billeting children from war torn London. Thus, shy, young and awkward William Beech (Nick Robinson) finds himself living with \"Mister\" Tom. Initially apprehensive because he doesn't know much about children - a thought echoed by the rest of the parish who think he's a grumpy old man, a touching relationship develops between the two. Through Tom's care William learns to read and write, makes friends, discovers he has an artistic talent, and is treated with love and kindness for the first time - gaining confidence never possible with his abusive mother. When William returns home Mister Tom realises how much he has grow to care for the boy and sets out to rescue him, begging the question, \"Why is he so fond of the boy\", and could love have developed between the cantankerous widow and his surrogate son? Based on the popular children's novel by Michelle Margorian, \"Goodnight Mister Tom\" is a testament to the strength of humanity and the belief that, regardless of age, people have fundamental human experiences such as grief, suffering and hope that they can share and learn from. Cast also includes Annabelle Apsion, John Cater and Geoffrey Hutchings."
