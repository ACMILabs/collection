        "Mario (Massimoi Troisi), works as a postman on a small Italian island to only one customer - the poet Pablo Neruda (Phillippe Noiret). Hiding on the island to avoid political problems in his native Chile, Neruda receives bags of fan mail daily from women all over the world. Mario is a wanna-be poet and a helpless romantic who has no luck with attracting women, and sees Neruda as the solution to all his problems. Unfortunately seeking help is not easy, as Neruda is unfriendly and aloof, but eventually they become friends, and with help Mario is able to become the poet he wants to be, and win the heart of the woman he loves. Oscar nominated for Best Picture in 1995. In Italian with English subtitles"
