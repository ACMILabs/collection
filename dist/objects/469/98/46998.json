        "Hugh Grant plays William Thacker, owner of a travel bookstore in London's Notting Hill. A chance visit to his store by famous American movie star, Anna Scott, played by Julia Roberts, sparks a complicated romance between the two. The worlds of celebrity and everyday people in collision creates a series of misunderstandings and dilemmas which divide and reunite the pair on more than one occasion. In an adventurous finale William rallies his ensemble of old friends and a mad flatmate to try one last time to get the girl. A British romantic comedy from the makers of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\". Cast also includes Hugh Bonneville, Emma Chambers and James Dreyfus."
