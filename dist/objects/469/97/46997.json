        "Daphne du Maurier's classic story of love, jealousy and secrets is revamped here with a British cast that includes Charles Dance, Faye Dunaway and Diana Rigg. Emilia Fox plays the modest and shy young woman, who meets, falls in love with, and eventually marries Maxim de Winter, a widower on vacation. When the new Mrs de Winter arrives at Maxim's mansion, Manderley, she finds a house of hostile servants, most notably the housekeeper who works with sinister cunning to keep alive the influence of her late mistress, Rebecca."
