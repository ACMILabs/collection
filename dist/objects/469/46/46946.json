        "Describes how new strains of clover and grasses are evolved at the Welsh Plant Breeding Station by crossing elected strains, careful pollination and then breeding from hybrid progeny. The film then shows recommended practices for farmers in sowing , fertilising, cutting and threshing clover and rye grass for seed production. Grasses dealt with include red and wild white clover, perennial rye grass and cocksfoot. The necessity for use of certified seed in seed production is stressed."
