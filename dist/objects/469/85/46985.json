        "Ted Harrison settled in the Yukon in 1967. He has been living and painting there ever since. The Yukon proved to be a challenge Harrison had to come to terms with. The result is an artistic style characterized by bold, brilliant colors. Harrison's perception of Canada's North contradicts its traditionally bleak portrayal. His brightly colored houses and figures suggest a toyland dominated by mountains, snow and sky. The film is a fine introduction to the artist, his work and the geography that has so profoundly influenced him. (Award: Yorkton)"
