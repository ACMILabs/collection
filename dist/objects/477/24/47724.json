        "The Hunger seamlessly melds gothic horror with a chic, contemporary edge in this erotic tale of sex, blood and desire. The icily beautiful vampire Miriam (Catherine Deneuve) and her latest consort, John (David Bowie), spend their nights scanning the hottest nightclubs in New York for new prey. When John suddenly begins to age at an alarming rate, they seek out Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), a doctor researching links between blood disease and ageing. Disbelieving at first, Sarah rapidly becomes enmeshed in the nightmarish reality of Miriam's world. Based upon the novel of the same name by best-selling author Whitley Strieber."
