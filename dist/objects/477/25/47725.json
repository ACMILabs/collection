        "Private Benjamin is a pampered upper-middle-class Judy Benjamin, widowed on her wedding night. She enlists for a three-year, all-expenses-paid sojourn in the U.S Army, or so she was informed by a persuasive recruiter while trying to decide what to do with her life. With such unrealistic expectations, the results can only be disastrously funny - and they are - in this now-classic tale of a fish-out-of-water coming of age via the rigors of basic training and European adventures that test her new independence."
