        "In this noir mystery thriller, a wealthy heiress (Claudette Colbert) wakes up hysterical on board a train from New York to Boston with no idea how she got there. When she contacts her husband (Don Ameche), he informs her that she disappeared after threatening him with a gun. On her return he urges her to visit an eminent psychiatrist. Soon it becomes clear that her apparently loving husband is in fact plotting to drive her to insanity then kill her and collect her fortune. Though dismissed by Sirk himself, this is a tautly paced thriller, with Joseph Valentine's expressionist photography giving rise to a suitably nightmarish evocation of insanity and shifting appearances. Cast also includes Robert Cummings, Rita Johnson and George Coulouris."
