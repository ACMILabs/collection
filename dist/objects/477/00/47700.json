        "Set in the oppressive period of communist rule following the 1956 uprising in Hungary, this film focuses on the connections between political and sexual repression. Eva, an outspoken journalist at a state-controlled newspaper becomes attracted to Livia, a married colleague. Her self-expression as a writer and a lesbian is crushed by the state but she refuses to stay silent. As the relationship between the women deepens, they are no longer prepared to limit the expression of their love for each other to clandestine trysts. Livia's defiance of her husband and Eva's defiance of the state brings about a tragic end to a love affair that was doomed from the outset. A politically courageous, touching and intelligent plea for tolerance by Hungary's best known director, based on the semi-autobiographical bestselling novel by his co-scriptwriter Erzsebet Galgoczi. Cast includes Jadwiga Jankowska-Cieslak, Grazyna Szapolowska and Josef Kroner. In Hungarian with English subtitles."
