        "When three men (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Brent Briscoe) find a duffle bag full of money in a plane wreck in the Minnesota woods, they decide to hold onto it. If no-one claims the money they'll divide it between them and leave town. If it is claimed however, they'll burn it so that it can't be traced to them. Even the simplest of plans can start to unravel though when there's a 4.4 million secret at stake. A taught thriller which shows just what lengths some people will go to to acquire the American dream."
