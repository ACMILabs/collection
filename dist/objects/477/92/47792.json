        "Cuba has been embargoed by the USA, abandoned by Russia, is one of the remaining issues of the Cold War and is close to bankruptcy, but the citizens of the country still fervently support their leader Fidel Castro. This documentary tells the story of Castro's rise to power, the revolution of 1959, his reform programmes and his program of relations with the world's superpowers as well as regional neighbours. It also investigates why this charismatic man is so adored by his citizens and how he has maintained his 'beloved' status for so long."
