        "The devil sends Don Juan back to earth to deflower Virtue (Bibi Andersson), the daughter of a naive country parson. She finds his advances amusing rather than irresistible. Bergman playfully contrasts the elaborately staged scenes of Hell with the reality of the pastor's household, producing a film with a comic tone that is absent from his previous work. Cast also includes Jurl Kulle, Stig Jarrell and Gunnar Bjornstrand. In Swedish with English subtitles."
