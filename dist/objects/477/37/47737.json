        "Following the suspicious death of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, his newly named successor, Maximus (Russell Crowe) - the former emperor's key advisor and most loyal general, is accused of his murder, leaving Marcus' scheming son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to take over the throne. As a result of his accusation, Maximus is stripped of his title and position in the army and sold to slave traders, forced to become a gladiator - men trained to fight to the death as entertainment for a paying audience. Using his new fame and power he vows to fight the man responsible for his dishonour. Includes the making of documentary. Cast also includes Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed in his final screen role (Reed died before the movie was completed). Awards: winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Actor (Russell Crowe) and Best Film (2000)."
