        "This program features five short acted scenarios demonstrating different business management styles. Each situation is analysed and the likely outcomes of each management approach is examined. Also highlighted is the issue that each manager is different and that no manager uses only one of these styles - they adopt different styles based on the circumstances of each situation faced. Management styles discussed include: consultative; laissez-faire; autocratic; participative and persuasive. Video support notes included. Suitable for Mid-Upper Secondary students."
