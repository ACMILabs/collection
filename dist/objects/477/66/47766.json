        "This charming short, based on an Aboriginal healing ritual, is about a young school girl, Ada, who attempts to hide her school report card from her Gran. When her Gran finds out, she takes Ada out to a nearby tree and introduces her not only to some magic but also to a moral lesson about attitude and outlook on life. Suitable for primary school children."
