        "One of the first important works of the \"New Queer Cinema\", this acerbic and very witty black comedy is a bout a gay hairdresser (LaBruce) who falls in love with a young skinhead. The skinhead, unsure of how he feels about the hairdresser's attentions seeks advice from his sister but she is a lesbian separatist filmmaker and not much interested in what goes on between men. Gleefully upsetting the expectations of both the heterosexual and homosexual mainstreams, \"No Skin off my Ass\" is a film that mixes up gender, sex roles and ideology. LaBruce is uninterested in \"positive\" images of gay men. Instead he wants to celebrate the absurd irrationalities of desire."
