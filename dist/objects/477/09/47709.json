        "This unusual early feature from Rolf de Heer is an intergalactic love-story between a woman from the outer space, who is sent from the planet Epsilon to pass judgment on the shameful way in which humans have mishandled their planet, and an earthbound man. Stunning land/nightscapes (the outback, great cities, and vista's full of stars) are major characters as the two map the spaces, times and places of the heart. Cast includes Ulli Birve and Syd Brisbane."
