        "Tom Jones (Albert Finney) is found as a newborn in a wealthy squires bed. The illegitimate child grows into a man attractive to all women who happen to pass him in 18th century rural England. Throughout this comic soap opera of love, family and Bruegelesque debauchery, Tom Jones is certainly put through a lot before the lengthy and irreverent film's conclusion. The plot follows Tom as he is kicked out of home and travels to London, pursued by the woman he loves. There are plenty of adventures along the way, including much feasting, heaving of breasts, sword fighting and a masked ball, just to name a few. The truth of Jones' parentage is always in question, he doesn't even know who his real parents are. None of the hardships faced during Tom's adventure bother him and it's not often that the smile leaves his attractive face. Based on the classic novel by Henry Fielding, this precursor to 'Alvin Purple' is both satirical and bawdy."
