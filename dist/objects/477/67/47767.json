        "Daisuke, Hana and Tetsu are three young Japanese tourists who share a flat in Sydney's Bondi Beach. Daisuke has to return to Japan to work in his father's butcher shop but his return is made bitter because of his falling in love with Hana. Featuring a fragmented narrative utilising video and 16mm film, this beautifully shot short film was voted the Best Short Film of 1999 by the Critic's Circle of Australia."
