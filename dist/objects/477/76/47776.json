        "A docu-drama based on the shocking terrorist attack initiated by the French government on the Greenpeace flagship vessel the Rainbow Warrior. The ship which was the centrepiece of the Greenpeace protest against nuclear testing that was being undertaken by the French in the Pacific, was moored in Auckland in August 1986 when it was blown apart by a bomb blast, killing one of its crew. In this dramatization, Sam Neill and Jon Voight play two polar opposites - a hardbitten cop and a eco-activist, respectively - who team up to track down the bombers uncovering an international conspiracy in the process. Cast also includes Bruno Lawrence and Kerry Fox."
