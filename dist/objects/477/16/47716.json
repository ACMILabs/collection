        "Gibson and Glover reprise their roles in this sequel to the original Lethal Weapon, this time with the addition of another unforgettable character - Leo Getz (Joe Pesci). The villain this time is a South African diplomat (Joss Ackland) who doubles as a drug dealer. Though Riggs knows what's going on, thanks to character witness Leo, he can't touch the villain because of \"diplomatic immunity.\" This movie contains one of the best -and funniest- suspense scenes ever filmed: Mel Gibson agonizingly attempting to extricate a terrified Danny Glover from a booby-trapped toilet seat. There is an additional five minutes of previously unseen footage in this version."
