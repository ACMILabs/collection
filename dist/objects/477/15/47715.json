        "Mel Gibson stars as Martin Riggs, a loner cop with a tragic past which drives him to act with reckless disregard for his own safety. Danny Glover also stars as dependable family-man cop Roger Murtaugh, just turned 50 and facing retirement, just wants to live long enough to see that day. When he is teamed with Riggs the possibility that he will seems very unlikely. The main villain is The General (Mitchell Ryan), a drug dealer responsible for the death of the daughter of one of Murtaugh's oldest friends. The General is also in charge of a deadly, militia-like gang of smugglers. Adding fuel to the fire is The General's chief henchman, played with all stops out by Gary Busey. With the addition of seven minutes extra footage to the original movie, this version of one of the classic 'buddy' movies provides new action and additional insight into the characters."
