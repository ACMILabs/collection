        "Arthur Penn's adaptation of Thomas Berger's novel shifts from comedy to drama as it depicts the horrific effects of American Imperialism. 121-year-old Jack Crabb narrates the story as the sole white survivor of the battle of Little Big Horn which saw the fall of General George A. Custer. He recounts his life story beginning with his adoption by Cheyenne Indians, where he was taught to live peacefully with nature. He later finds himself once again in the white world and is taken in by a preacher and his wife for religious education and guidance. He swaps his bible for a gun and be-friends Wild Bill Hickock, only to abandon even that to settle down and marry. Returning to the Cheyenne by chance, Crabb finds that he prefers this life, but is soon made aware of the carnage wreaked by white man. Cast includes: Dusitn Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, Martin Balsam, Richard Mulligan, and Chief Dan George."
