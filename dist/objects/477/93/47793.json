        "This natural history documentary looks at Fraser Island, the world's largest sand island and the only known one on which a significant rain forest exists. The geology of sand dune formation and dune movement, and the creation of the island's freshwater lakes are clearly explained. The program looks at the ecological balance of the native plants and wildflowers and the introduced animals such as dingoes and brumbies as well as the growing pressures placed on the island from recreational fishing and tourism."
