        "In this fourth instalment of the Lethal Weapon series Mel Gibson and Danny Glover reprise their roles as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh - a pair of mismatched police detectives who over the course of their relationship have learnt to love and appreciate each other's contrasting styles. The over-the-top opening sequence establishes what the film has in store - glib throwaway lines, explosive action segments and faint hints at the importance of friendship to these two old buddies. Both Martin and Roger face a period of transition - Martin is to become a father (with Internal Affairs officer Lorna Cole - played by Rene Russo) whilst Roger is to become a grandfather. And the bad guys? Well represented by the Chinese triads who are involved with an illegal people-smuggling ring. Highlights of this film are the fight sequences, featuring Asian star Jet Li, staged by Hong Kong director Corey Yuen. Chris Rock (utilising his signature frenetic comedic shtick) plays a new cop on the block with unstinting passion for his job."
