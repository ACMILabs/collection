        "This historical drama about British leader Winston Churchill, one of the 20th century's great public figures, is based on his autobiography \"My Early Life\". It chronicles his tumultuous rise to power from childhood to the age of twenty-six, when he delivered his first speech in the House of Commons covering his time as a war correspondent in India, his involvement in Kitchener's Sudan expedition, and his capture and escape during the Boer War in South Africa. While it glosses over some of the less savory aspects of Churchill's character, it nevertheless reveals him as a complex and very private man. The cast includes many esteemed British actors such as Robert Shaw, Ian Holm, Simon Ward, Anthony Hopkins, Edward Woodward and John Mills. Churchill's mother was played by Anne Bancroft."
