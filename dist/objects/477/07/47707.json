        "Meeting at King's Cross rail station one day, ex student housemates and friends Hannah (Katrin Cartlidge) and Annie (Lynda Steadman), are reunited after 6 years apart for a weekend of reminiscences. Initially hesitant around one another, as time progresses we are privy to their insecurities, loves and animosities, both past and present, that they shared together and apart. Annie, initially a painfully shy young woman with a noticeable skin condition has gained confidence through the years and her skin has cleared up. Hannah still has a quick tongue and will do anything to avoid the 'psychobabble' inflicted on her by people who attempt to understand her. Throughout the weekend they meet people who remind them of the events that have shaped their lives, awakening them to the realisation of where they've come from, and where they are headed to. Cast also includes Mark Benton, Kate Byers and Andy Serkis."
