        "Makin' Up! (1992, 54 mins.) is an endearing comedy that focuses on the friendship between two women, Frenzy (Katja Riemann), a cynical, independent cartoonist, and Maischa (Nina Kronjager), a nurse desperately trying to find Mr Right. When Maischa scores a date with a man she has been lusting after, Frenzy is reluctantly forced to entertain his friend for the night. Neither of these interactions turns out as they expected and while both women are forced to re-evaluate their attitudes to romantic love, they realise that while men come and go, their lasting friendship will always provide them with constant pleasure and emotional support. \"Makin' Up!\" is peppered with laughs, never taking itself too seriously. It is characterised by strong writing, inventive direction, and a rare chemistry between the two main characters. \"The Most Beautiful Breasts in the World\" (1990, 15 mins. prods/dirs, Thomas Wobke, Rainer Kaufmann) is a frivolous fantasy about a businessman who unexpectedly finds he has acquired a pair of prominent breasts. Both films in German with English subtitles."
