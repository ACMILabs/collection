        "For Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) death is a great way to make a living: ridding haunter houses of their unwelcome \"guests\". But as it happens, he's working with the very ghosts he promises to evict. Unfortunately in his sleepy little hometown of Fairwater, an unspeakable evil has awakened, townsfolk keep dying of heart attacks and Frank is the prime suspect. Desperate to find the true culprit and exorcise his own personal \"demons\", Frank crosses the ultimate barrier into a realm where even death can't stop a killer. Cast also includes Trini Alvarado, Dee Wallace Stone, Peter Dobson and John Astin."
