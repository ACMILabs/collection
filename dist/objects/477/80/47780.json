        "Norville Barnes is an inexperienced college graduate who finds his first job working in the mail-room of the very profitable Hudsucker Industries. After Hudsucker Industries' founder and Chairman falls to his tragic death, leaving behind no will and a stunned and panic-stricken board od directors, Vice-President Sidney Messburger sees a brilliant opportunity for taking over the company. He promotes the naive Norville to Company Chairman so as to devalue Hudsucker stocks so that the Board may acquire controlling interests. All doesn't go according to plan, however when Norville's new product, the Hula Hoop, is a raging success. Cast includes: Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Newman, Charles Durning, John Mahoney, Steve Buscemi and Peter Gallagher."
