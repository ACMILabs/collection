        "Four very different Australian veterans of the Vietnam war, all permanently affected by shellshock, return to Vietnam as part of the process of healing the trauma they suffered. This documentary follows the veterans as they travel together, flashing back to their individual war stories which are illustrated with unique home video footage. The high moment of the film occurs when they meet with veterans from the other side: ex Viet Cong guerrillas who, just like the Australian vets, are suffering from post-traumatic stress. A film about redemption that provides some startling insights into the nature of war."
