        "This is an anthology of four short comedies. The first episode, Rossellini's (Ro) farewell to cinema (he worked in television thereafter), is a light-hearted play on the difference between the 'Anglo-Saxon' and 'Latin' character and the idea of cinematic illusion. The Pasolini (Pa) segment is located on the set of a biblical epic, (Orson Welles is the director) and is full of ideas which Pasolini developed elsewhere in his novels, poetry and films. Godard's (Go) episode is a kind of science fiction story, foreshadowing Alphaville, set in a Paris transformed but not destroyed by a nuclear bomb. Gregoretti's (G) piece is distinguished mainly by the presence of the great comic actor Ugo Tognazzi. Contents: Illibatezza Chastity (31 min.) ; Ricotta Curd cheese (b&w, col., 35 min.) ; Nuovo New world (19 min.)--Pollo ruspante Free-range chicken (32 min). Cast includes Rosanna Schiaffino (Illibatezza), Orson Welles (Ricotta), Jean-Marc Bory (Nuovo mondo) and Ugo Gregoretti (Pollo ruspante). In Italian and French with English subtitles."
