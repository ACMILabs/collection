        "Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman portray former lovers briefly reunited amid the chaos of World War II. The film tells of the lonely owner of a nightclub in Nazi-occupied Casablanca and of the brief return of his former lover fleeing the Nazis with her resistance-hero husband. Only Bogart can help them escape, but he refuses...until Ilsa reawakens his idealism. Also stars Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt. An all-time classic. This version of the film has been restored and digitally remastered. Also included is a documentary on the making of this classic, \"You must remember this\", narrated by Lauren Bacall, as well as the 1942 original theatrical trailer and the 1992 re-issue theatrical trailer, and an all-new introduction by Lauren Bacall."
