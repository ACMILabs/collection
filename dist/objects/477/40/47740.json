        "Based on the novel by Andrew Neiderman and directed by David Wheeler, \"Tender loving care\" is an interactive movie where the viewer's involvement can alter the outcome. The story revolves around the Overton couple who are suffering the trauma of a personal tragedy. When a psychiatric nurse comes to their aid, all sorts of mysteries and secrets begin to unfold. In between scenes the view is given thematic apperception tests about the characters and also personal views and interpretations. Clues are also discovered by navigating through the 3D environments or certain parts in the film. Guided by Doctor Turner (John Hurt), your journey through \"Tender Loving Care\" is a psychological experience that changes each time you play. Cast includes Michael Esposito, Beth Tegarden and Marie Caldare."
