        "An experimental documentary that explores identity politics around sex and gender that were prevalent in the 1990s. Arguing that sexual labels have become a political tool which can both empower or dispossess people, the film questions the limits of the stereotyping and categorizing that works to maintain the divide between gay and straight, male and female. Using Sydney's long institutionalised Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras as its departure point, it moves on to challenge accepted labels within homosexual culture. Interviews with people who blur and subvert rigid categories of gender and sexuality by their refusal to be labelled, are combined with a poetic exploration of the ways that sexual and gender identities are literally inscribed upon the body. A provocative journey into queer culture featuring Quentin Crisp."
