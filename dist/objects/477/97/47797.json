        "Steven Carter (Ben Silverstone) is in his final year of high school. Apart from the normal pains of adolescence - taunting from the school jocks, an unsympathetic father, the pressure of school and exams - Steven is also looking forward to the day he can be open about his homosexuality. One day after school, while visiting one of the local \"beats\", Steven is propositioned by school's star athlete John (Brad Gorton). From fumbling and clumsy beginnings the two young men begin a tender affair but it is a relationship that John refuses to make public. Steven finds himself caught between his desire to be honest to his friends and family and his knowledge that \"coming out\" will place his relationship with John at risk. \"Get Real\" is an entertaining story about teenage sexuality and teenage friendships, humorously examining homosexual and heterosexual courtship rites with tenderness and delicacy. A talented young cast assist in making this a joyful and optimistic film about youth. Based on the play \"What's Wrong With Angry?\" by Patrick Wilde, who also wrote the script."
