        "Emmanuelle is the story of a young French girl (played by Sylvia Kristel), and her transformation from shy coquette to sensuous, worldly woman through a series of erotic encounters with both friends and strangers. Newly married, Emmanuelle flys to Bangkok to join her husband, Jean, but soon succumbs to the boredom of her circumstances. When Jean encourages her to actively seek out new sexual adventures with men and women, she is momentarily taken aback. However, after being pursued by the nymphette, Marie-Ange, and seduced by her friend, Ariane, after a game of squash, Emmanuelle decides to seek out Bee (Marika Green), an archaeologist working in Bangkok, for friendship and fun. The consequences of this encounter convince her to meet with the elderly Mario (Alain Cuny), who offers to further her sexual education, promising her that he will free her from a life of moral slavery. Under his expert tuition, Emmanuelle is finally able to throw off the last vestiges of guilt, and abandon herself to the pleasures of free, unbounded sex. Advertised as \"X was never like this!\", the film was a smash hit around the world. \"Emmanuelle\", the first feature film by Dutch director, Just Jaekin, is the highest grossing French film of all-time, spawning six official sequels, numerous \"copycat\" sequels, and a French TV show. Based on the banned, scandalous 1957 novel \"Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman\", by Emmanuelle Arsan."
