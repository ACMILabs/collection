        "Within the surreal confines of an old-fashioned bookstore, an eccentric proprietor wages a constant battle against time, insects and the occasional customer to maintain his beloved collection of books. Above the dusty store, his crippled Granny waits for him to supply her with a tin of her favourite Irish Stew as she knits and devours televised rock and roll wrestling. Things take a bizarre twist as a mysterious \"book-worm\" wriggles into Granny's ear, making her crave the work of T.S. Eliot. Winner, Best Animation, ZOOM! SA Shorts Fest 1999."
