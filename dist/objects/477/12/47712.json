        "An evocative and hard-hitting story of a drug run urban battlefield where Strike (Mekhi Phifer), a 24-hour drug dealer known as a 'clocker', finds that his time of success on the street is running out. Nursing an ulcer and spending his spare time playing with model trains and hanging around with his brothers outside the project houses, one day Strike is given a tip off by the local drug lord, Rodney, for what seems to be an opportunity for advancement. However, when a rival dealer ends up dead and his own law-abiding brother confesses to the murder he finds himself caught between two homicide detectives, only one of whom is concerned about the truth, and the wrath and cover ups of his street-wise colleagues. This film poignantly explores the complex machinations of a neighbourhood spiraling out of control where few can be credited with looking after anyone but themselves. Layered with issues of social and racial upheaval and prejudice and the evocation of the qualities and disparities of human behaviour this is another example of powerful filmmaking from director, Spike Lee."
