        "George (Robert Carlyle) is a bus driver working in Glasgow who has a strong independent streak and has developed a serious crush on one of his regular passengers, a woman from Nicaragua named Carla (Oyanka Cabezas). Carla is occasionally short of money for her fare, so George lets her ride for free; when his boss finds out it is added to his list of insubordinations, and George is fired. George keeps in touch with Carla and discovers that she is actually a refugee from Nicaragua suffering emotional problems that stem from the disappearance and probable death of her boyfriend, a Sandinista supporter who is believed to have been kidnapped by US-backed Contra rebels. The largely apolitical George travels with Carla to Nicaragua at a time when the Contra-rebels are about to launch their final, lethal assault on the Sandinista government."
