        "Isabelle Huppert portrays the infamous Parisian courtesan Alphonsine Duplessis, mistress to the son of Alexander Dumas. Alphonsine, a country girl, was sold by her father to a wealthy neighbour, introducing her to a round of living in expansive palaces and keeping company with wealthy aristocrats and eventually Alexander Dumas himself. By the time she and Dumas meet she is suffering from tuberculosis, and her life story (from seamstress to prostitute to courtesan) becomes the inspiration for Dumas' story of Camille. Her father then intervenes and denounces Dumas for romanticizing her life - the same father who sold her off in the first place. This lavish production tells the \"true\" story of her life and amorous adventures during the decadent period of the Second Empire. Original Italian version dubbed in English."
