        "Tim Burton continues to give this popular comic book hero his own fractured spin in this moody, atmospheric sequel to \"Batman\" (1989), primarily drawing influence from the darkness of the original comic conceptualised by Bob Kane in the 1939. This time, the angst-ridden Batman (Michael Keaton) must save Gotham City from plunging into chaos after the sociopathic Penguin (Danny De Vito) surfaces to reclaim his birthright, then plots and schemes a path to mayorhood, aided by the evil industrialist Max Schreck (Christopher Walken). Shreck inadvertently creates another problem for the caped crusader after his browbeaten secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) mysteriously metamorphoses into Catwoman after a bad day at the office. Batman suddenly finds he has his hands full trying to expose the corrupt workings of the Penguin's rise to prominence while fighting his attraction to the felonious feline whom is determined to kill him. Set amidst a world of fairground freaks and the surreal, noirish space of Gotham City, this film explores the duality of human nature and the fine line that separates the heroes from the villains."
