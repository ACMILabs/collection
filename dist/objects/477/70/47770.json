        "Della is an ageing jazz singer who is in a destructive relationship with petty crim and drug user, Dale. This haunting and confident short film examines the betrayals and compromises of love and age. The cinematography and script are first rate and the performances by Gillian Jones and Aaron Blabey outstanding. Cast also includes Stephen Curry."
