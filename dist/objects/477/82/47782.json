        "'Hoop Dreams' follows two star basketball players over five years, beginning when they are just fourteen and heading for high school careers that will make or break their dreams of becoming stars in the NBA. Arthur Agee and William Gates emerge as distinct characters, engaging the audience in an almost heartbreaking degree of emotional identification with the hurdles they both have to overcome. Unlike many sports films that climax with the supreme triumph of victory in the big game, this film challenges the definition of what constitutes winning. Winner of the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 1994."
