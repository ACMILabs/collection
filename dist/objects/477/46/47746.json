        "Episode of Series \"Bonanza\". This episode from Season Six of 'Bonanza' (first screened 13/12/64) stars Charles Bronson as a half-Comanche Harry Star, whose flight from prejudice stops at the Ponderosa when the Cartwrights mistakenly think he needs their help. Their good intentions falter when it turns out that Starr has other plans. Cast includes Lorne Greene, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, Pernell Roberts and Charles Bronson."
