        "When a has-been, drunken rodeo star reduced to starring in breakfast cereal advertisments finds out the multi-million dollar racehorse he is expected to ride for a publicity stunt has been drugged, he steals it, riding it out into the Nevada desert where it can recuperate. Seeing a good story, a newswoman (Jane Fonda) follows him, staying one step ahead of a posse of pursuing police. By the time they reach a remote rendezvous high in the Utah mountains, she is in love with both the cowboy and his convictions."
