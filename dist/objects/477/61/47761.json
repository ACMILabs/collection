        "Although Renoir was a pioneer of location shooting and the use of non-professionals in feature films, his films resist easy classification. \"La Bete Humaine\" is no exception. Relocated in the 1930s, Renoir invests Zola's story of a man apparently driven by forces outside his control with both careful observation of the working class milieu and a passionate and lyrical poetry which goes beyond Zola's naturalism. Inspired by the novel by Emile Zola. Cast includes Jean Gabin and Simone Simon. In French with no subtitles."
