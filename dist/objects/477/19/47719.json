        "A murderer is on the loose in San Francisco, constantly staying one step ahead of the police. Criminal psychologist and noted author Helen Hudson (Signourney Weaver) notices the killer's pattern. He is a copycat and is imitating the serial killers in one of Helen's novels. She reports this to the police and assists Homicide detective Monahan (Holly Hunter) in the investigation, depsite being agoraphobic and unable to leave home. As their investigation gets closer the catching the killer, they realise his real target is Helen and she must fight to stay alive."
