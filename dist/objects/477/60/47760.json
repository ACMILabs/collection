        "Using footage shot during five expeditions, Wildest Antarctica stunningly documents the fragile beauty of this extraordinary continent. Despite increased awareness of the environment in recent years, Antarctica and its inhabitants are still under threat from the effects of global warming. This documentary examines the current state of the continent, and examines the day-to-day lives of the wild creatures that roam its vast expanse. Penguin breeds discussed in detail include Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo, Emperor, Royal, Rockhopper, and Magellanic. Seals, whales, dolphins, and sea birds, and their fight for survival against pollution and predation, are also documented."
