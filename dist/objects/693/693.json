        "Writes Forgacs: \"Sensual and unknowing - perhaps this is the best metaphor to characterise the film. The families find protection from the terrors of socialism in the private sphere and the ancient human dramas, muffled amorous dependencies. The hardly visible yet palpable relationships are grasped by the viewer's eyes.... In civil life, everything goes on even if the spontaneous actors do not see what they look at. This private film is exactly what is seems to be: the never-before-seen denouncer of invisible and sensual relationships.\""
