        "Inventions are a social phenomena, although the influence of one person always tends to make them seem the result of a miraculous individual effort. This film shows the social conditions which gave rise to the invention of the battery, the ground connection, the electro-magnet, the telephone, telegraph, cable, and radio, thus making possible much more rapid and reliable communication services than had been possible in the pre-electric age. These more rapid communications were essential if industrialisation was to develop and expand."
