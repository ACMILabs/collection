        "This video contains three short episodes of 'Dinosaur Junction' which uses animated dinosaurs to illustrate in a fun way how children can learn to cope with problems they face such as peer pressure and fighting. 'Doin' it you way' looks at decision making and peer pressure; 'The fight' looks at controlling your temper and dealing with anger; 'What's in a name' looks at self esteem and fitting in. Suitable for Primary level students."
