        "The Taviani Brothers' first English language film is a bitter-sweet and joyous celebration of the early days of Hollywood movie making. Based on a true story, the film is a piece of pure and thrilling cinema and features an acclaimed performance by Charles Dance as the legendary director D.W. Griffith. Two Tuscan stonemason brothers decide to leave Italy for the New World when their father's firm becomes bankrupt. They travel to Hollywood and wangle their way onto the film set of Griffith. They fall in love and celebrate a double wedding, however war soon intervenes to threaten their happiness."
