        "This story is like no other, a celebration of the short life of Diana, Princess of Wales. The fairytale story of a shy 19 year old girl who married HRH Prince Charles, whose life is cut short 16 years later by a tragic accident. As Earl Spencer said at the funeral \"A very British girl who transcended nationality, a woman who's beauty both internal and external will never be taken from our lives\". Diana was a woman who tried to break down some of the barriers surrounding royalty. This was shown right from the beginning with her wedding which was telecast to over 500 million people worldwide, how she wanted her children-Prince's William and Harry brought up and her approach to all the charities which she was associated with. Her compassion towards AIDS and Cancer sufferers and the victims of land mines will always be remembered. This video shows us a small vignette of her life, from the world press who promoted her to superstar status and had a somewhat one sided love affair to all the people she came in contact with and the impact on their lives. Diana had an exuberance for life and this came through in everything she did, her wish was to be known as the \"Queen of People's Hearts\", she will always be remembered as The People's Princess."
