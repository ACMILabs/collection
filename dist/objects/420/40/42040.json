        "This tape contains two episodes of the 'Frontline' series. 'Heroes and villains', tables turn when a book publishing company manipulates the media generally and Frontline in particular to portray a dull textbook as a racially potent controversy and gain publicity, the irony being that Mike Moore is more homophobic than the book's author! 'Keeping up appearances', Mike has a P.R. nightmare: he's the subject of a front cover story in the first issue of Brave - a new gay magazine. Jan's efforts to change his image lands Mike in several ludicrous situations. On the other hand the plight of a disfigured prostitute is a public relations and ratings triumph for Frontline, though Brooke seems far more interested in her own appearance prior to a Lachlan Murdoch interview than with the woman's facial injuries. Roleplay game \"Newsflash\" and \"Frontline\" script included."
