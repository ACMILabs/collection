        "The filmmaker uses the term \"laceration\" to describe his film suggesting something of the violence with which his camera breaches space-time as it bores through urban spaces in a looped-concertinaed movement first forward and then back in retreat. The term wormhole in astronomy refers to a tunnel between regions in space, entered via a black hole."
