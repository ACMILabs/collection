        "Football is a game capable of inspiring incredible emotional responses from both players and supporters. Michael Cordell captures the highs and lows of the 1996 season as seen from players and two loyal fans. Key players are followed through their injuries, as are the politics of management. What emerges is a team of players and supporters united by their love for the game and the Footscray Football Club."
