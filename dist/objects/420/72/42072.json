        "Guiliana (Monica Vitti) struggles to fit back into her life after suffering from a mental breakdown. Her husband doesn't seem to be able to help her yet she is drawn to Corrado Zeller (Richard Harris). \"Il deserto rosso\" is Antonioni's first colour film and he uses colour, landscape and sound masterfully to reflect Guiliana's state of mind. Ravenna is transformed into an industrial landscape yet Antonioni manages to make it beautiful by framing objects so that they appear as abstract paintings. Monica Vitti is rivetting as the fragile Guiliana. In Italian with English subtitles."
