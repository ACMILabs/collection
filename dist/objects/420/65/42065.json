        "Describes a plan for more efficient irrigation of an old property. The chief problem is poorly designed and maintained supply and distribution ditches. In some areas, trees are small and deformed through lack of water - in others flooding is so bad that neighbours complain of seepage. Suggests immediate plan requiring cleaning and modification of supply and drainage channels. The long term plan put forward suggests the use of concrete channels and underground pipelines, which would result in perfect water distribution and in this case, room for more trees in place of open channels."
