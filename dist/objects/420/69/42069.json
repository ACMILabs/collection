        "When Snaporaz (Marcello Mastroianni) follows an attractive woman off a train she leads him into the midst of a feminist seminar. So begins a fantastic journey as Mastroianni's Don Juan finds himself meeting a bizarre coterie of female characters. In \"La citta delle donne\" Fellini confronts feminism in all its guises. Fellini is at once self-critical and indulgent but, as usual, his wonderful sense of fantasy makes this an enjoyable film to watch. In Italian with English subtitles. Note:During last 10 minutes of film some white lines may appear on screen. Adjust tracking on video player."
