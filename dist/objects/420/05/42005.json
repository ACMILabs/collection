        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Alcheringa (A)\". Demonstrates how the aborigine crafts the boomerang. The diligent search for the exact right piece of wood, the burning off of the outer bark, the tedious, laborious whittling with a sharpended stone and the fashioning of the slight twist at each end to git it its unique quality of returning to its point of departure. Introduced by Bill Onus."
