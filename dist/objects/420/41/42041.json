        "This video investigates why it is important to know what time it is as well as how to tell the time! It shows how various types of clocks and watches aid in the understanding of what the numbers on a clock mean, the function of the clock hands, the meaning of seconds, minutes, half hours and hours. Children will see that different kinds of clocks and watches, such as the sundial, hour glass and stopwatch, all help to keep track of the time. They will also gain an understanding of how the eart spinning on its axis causes day and night. Suitable for Kindergarten and Lower Primary level students."
