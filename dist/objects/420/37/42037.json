        "The fantastic creatures and heroic adventures of Ancient Greek literature come to life as students view three of the most exciting tales handed down from the classical world. There are three stories in this program; Jason and the Golden Fleece, Daedalus and Icarus, and Pandora's Box. Greek myths have been told for thousands of years and have survived the ages because they offer insight into human nature and lessons about morality and justice. Suitable for Primary and Secondary level students."
