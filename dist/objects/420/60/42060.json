        "Niccolo (Thomas Milan) needs a female for his next film project, but his ideas for both project and protagonist are somewhat vague. As his relationship with his girlfriend dissolves - she leaves him to move in with another woman, - he embarks on an affair with a young actress, but she, too, eventually eludes him. Perhaps Antonioni's most beautiful film, this is not only the story of Niccolo's search for his ideal woman, it is the search for his own identity which drives this film to its poignant conclusion. In Italian with English subtitles."
