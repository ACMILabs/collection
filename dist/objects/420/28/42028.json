        "Animated Norwegian production aimed at preventing sexual abuse in young children. The documentary begins with notions of uncomplicated 'trouble', such as being scared of a dog or not cleaning your room. There is a bigger item on the agenda, sexual abuse, and the documentary moves onto the area in an open and frank way. There is a case study presented of a young girl who is sexually abused by her uncle. She describes what happens and how she feels. The solution to her trouble is telling someone, which is the message the film portrays- that telling someone will drive the trouble away. The documentary is confronting in a way which is appropriate to the subject matter and perhaps necessary for instructing children about abuse. A leaflet accompanies the video. No other production detail available."
