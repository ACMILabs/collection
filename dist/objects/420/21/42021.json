        "Includes guide in both English and German. The second installment of Wagner's Ring des Nibelungen follows the tragic destiny og Brunnhilde, daughter of Wotan (Master of Valhalla). Sent by her father to murder Siegmund and Sieglinde, the twins borne to Wotan by a mortal, she is moved by the love she witnesses and disobbeys Wotan's command. Wotan's punishment is to hold Brunnhilde in a magic sleep, making her a defenceless prey for the first man who passes by and wakes her. Moved by his daughter's plea for mercy, Wotan agrees to her request of being guarded in her sleep by a circle of flames that only a true and unrestrained hero can traverse to reach and awake her. See also: The Rhinegold (1) Siegfried (3) and Twilight of the Gods (4) of Wagner's famous tetralogy."
