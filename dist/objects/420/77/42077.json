        "Aims at instructing pre-adolescent and adolescent girls in the physiology and hygiene of menstruation, emphasizing the normality of the process. The story is woven around 13-year old Mary and is introduced by showing her and her friend on the school playing field. Photographic shots are used to show how all young creatures grow up - chickens, calves, tadpoles, and humans. Animated diagrams illustrate the physiology of menstruation and the development of the human foetus. Photography is then used to demonstrate the hygiene of menstruation and the reasonable precautions necessary while menstruating."
