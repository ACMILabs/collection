        "The behaviour of the reproductive cells (wherein according to one theory the determinants of heredity are thought to be contained), together with the division of the nucleus in ordinary cell division, and the formation of reproductive cells, are illustrated by animated diagrams. Fertilization is explained by both animation and direct photography, and examples of the basic Mendelian principles of segregation and recombination are shown in rabbits, guinea pigs, and cattle. The white angora rabbit and the single-combed fowl are used as examples of the emergence of new types from the crossing of parents exhibiting independent pairs of Mendelian characteristics. The results of selective breeding of horses and dogs are also shown."
