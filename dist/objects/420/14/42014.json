        "Naples in 1959, a society entrenched in cynicism, is the setting for the final sceneds in the life of Renato Caccioppoli - a brilliant intellectual, admired academic and political non-conformist. His rejection of Italian society that lacks social and political will is implicit in his actions, whilst his tolerance towards everything and everyone that surrounds him is diminishing fast. The film follows the mathematician's last week, from his arrest as a vagrant in a railway station, to his release and his bitter farewell to his friends and beloved. Italian language with English subtitles."
