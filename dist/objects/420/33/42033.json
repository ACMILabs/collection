        "This two-part series explores ancient teachings on death and dying. It was filmed over a four-month period on location in the Himalayas where the original text still yields an essential influence over people's views of life and death. Narrated by Leonard Cohen, Part 2: \"The Great liberation\", is a docu-drama which, in the company of a Buddhist lama and a 13-year-old novice monk, leads us into the very foundations of Buddhist philosophy - the search for compassion and truth. Pema Choden, the monk and Tubten, the young novice read from the texts of the 'Tibetan Book of the Dead' as they conduct the 49 days of final rites for a deceased Himalayan villager. We must all face the death of somebody we love, as well as our own death. This film helps us prepare for these inevitabilities."
