        "No other large wild animal is being wiped out at the rate of Africa's black rhino. If this rate of slaughter continues the black rhino may not survive this decade. This video shows the extraordinary efforts that are being made in an attempt to save this animal from extinction. in a bid to svave them, rhinos are being dehorned, poachers are being shot on sight and rhinos are being transported to safe areas within Zimbabwe and to captive breeding centres overseas. Following the journey of nine black rhinos taken from the wilds of Zimbabwe and flown to Western Plains Zoo in outback Australia. It is hoped that the offspring of this herd will one day be returned to their home in Zimbabwe."
