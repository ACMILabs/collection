        "In the words of the director himself, \"Au revoir les enfants is drawn from the most dramatic experience of my childhood. In 1944, when I was eleven, I was boarding in a Catholic school near Fontainebleau. One of my classmates, who had arrived at the beginning of the year, intrigued me a great deal. He was different, secretive. I was getting to know him, learning to love him when, one morning, our little world fell apart. I have tried to rediscover that first, and most powerfull, friendship that was so abruptly destroyed; and my introduction to the absurdities of the adult world with its violence and prejudices.\""
