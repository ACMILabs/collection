        "Nimbin is best known as Australia's answer to Woodstock. A one-street town where the residents lead an alternative lifestyle. Land is owned collectively and the values of peace love and happiness are put into practice. This video is in threee parts; \"Peace, love and burnt rice\" is a look at how Nimbin came into being, \"Sects, drugs and rock 'n' roll\" is a look at the prevealence of drugs in the town, and \"Sensitive New Age guise\" looks at the spirit of the town which has developed community living and tribal life. It investigates the practices of sharing land, buildings, and sometimes partners and children - experimenting with life beyond the nuclear family, does it work?"
