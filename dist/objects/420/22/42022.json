        "Siefried is the third part of Richard Wagner's cycle of four operas known as \"The Ring of the Nibelung\". This opera follows the adventures of Siefried (Siegfried Jerusalem) as he slays the dragon Fafner to gain possession of the ring which gives mastery of the world. He also rescues Brunhilde (Hildegard Behrens) from the ring of fire where she was imprisoned in \"Die Walkure\", the second opera from the cycle. This Metropolitan Opera production of \"Siegfried\" is entertaining, with great sets and strong performances from the entire cast. The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra is conducted by James Levine. There is no subtitling, enabling the viewer to concentrate on the music and performances. Includes guide in English, Italian and German."
