        "Can a father's health and behaviour affect the health of his children? Although often overlooked because of a cultural blindspot, research is indicating that drug use, chemical therapies, cigarette smoking and environmental and occupational exposures in the father before and during conception can lead to problems during pregnancy, birth defects and childhood cancer. The evidence presented is startling and must be seriously considered. Suitable for Secondary and Tertiary level students."
