        "A documentary on Canadian artisans from New Brunswick revolving around a sculptress and her husband who is a potter. Shows how they decorate, glaze and fire the pottery and each year open their house as a showroom to lovers of art. We meet their friends who are silversmiths and get inspiration from the sea and rocks and use stones to make jewellery. Also shows wool being dyed and woven into cloth for sale to the USA and overseas."
