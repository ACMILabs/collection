        "Dramatic cinematography and timelapse photography convey the drama of nature's spectacular display. 'Global winds' demonstrates global circulation and how these movements depend on great convection cells set in motion by differences in temperature. 'Clouds and precipitation' looks at how clouds form and vanish and explains the differences between the types of clouds we see. 'Violent storms' examines the causes and effects of thunderstorms, thunderheads and tornadoes. Suitable for Upper Primary and Secondary level students."
