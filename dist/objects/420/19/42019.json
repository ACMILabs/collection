        "During a March morning in Palermo, Tommaso Scalia commits three murders. Coldly and inexorably, he kills the superior who had recently fired him; then the man who took his position at the Facist Confederation of Professionals and Artists; finally he kills his wife. He then goes home, prepares something to eat for his son, and stretched out on his bed, waits for the police to come and arrest him. In the courtroom, the trial is about to begin. Based on the book 'Porte Aperte' by Leonardo Sciascia. In Italian with English subtitles."
