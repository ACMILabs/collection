        "Behind the Frontline is a behind the scenes look at the process by which a single episode of 'Frontline' is put together. All aspects of the pre-production, production and post-production process are examined, from casting to editing. This tape also includes the completed episode. 'Divide the community, multiply the ratings' sees a slow news day which is shattered by racial violence in the community, which Frontline is more than happy to encourage - even to the point of cultivating conflict in a televised debate and defying the police requests not to inflame community tension! Roleplay game \"Newsflash\" and \"Frontline\" script included."
