        "La terra trema tells the story of the Valestro family and their struggle to survive as fishermen in the Sicilian village Aci Trezza. A fantastic example of neo-realism, Luchino Visconti uses non-professional actors and focuses on the tightly knit Valestro family to create a gripping and moving account of poverty in Southern Italy. With beautiful photography by G.R. Aldo and narration by Visconti and Antonio Pietrangeli. Won the Special Prize in the 1948 Venice Film Festival. Franco Zeffirelli worked as an assitant director. In Italian with English subtitles."
