        "This was the film which brought Antonioni to international prominence, and was the first part of a loose trilogy which comprised 'La Notte' and 'L'Eclisse'. Out of the slight story of a young woman who disappears on an island during a cruise in the Mediterranean, Antonioni conjures one of the defining texts of 1960's 'art cinema' - highly formalised, deeply personal and quintessentially cinematic. Starring Monica Vitti. In Italian with English subtitles."
