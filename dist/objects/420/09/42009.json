        "Through an amusing cartoon interpretation of an Aesopean fable, children learn that size alone does not determine how helpful a person can be. We see the king of the jungle, a lion, laugh at the idea that a tiny mouse could ever help him. But when a speck of dirt gets into the lion's eye, it is the little mouse who removes it and proves to be a helpful friend after all."
