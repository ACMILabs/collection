        "Designed to explain the important part played by forests in paper manufacture. Photographed in the Boola-Boola area of Gippsland, Victoria, various operations are shown in which timber, removed for papermaking, is being replaced by seedling pines which will mature for use in future years. The film includes views of the residential area of Traralgon, the manufacturing processes at the Maryvale mill, and also lists various uses of paper products."
