        "Driven by passion, intelligence and imagination, Maggie Tulliver ia a rare free spirit in the convention-bound world of Victorian rural society. Despite the fierce love between her and her stolid but resourceful brother Tom, who is incapable of understanding Maggie's waywardly emotional nature, she turns to others for the companionship she craves. Denied the friendship of Philip Wakem, the son of her father's implacable enemy, she meets and is drawn irresistibly to the young and handsome Stephen Guest. Torn between love and devotion to her family, she is rejected by Tom and only an act of supreme courage can effect a final but tragic reconciliation. Filmed in the beautiful rural heartlands of England, this outstanding new production is a vivid portrayal of George Eliot's compelling story of love, rejection and reconciliation."
