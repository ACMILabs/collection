        "This production examines the events associated with the Eureka Stockade, which occurred at Ballarat, Victoria, on 3rd December 1854. The Eureka flag was unfurled by protesting diggers on Bakery Hill prior to the Stockade, a potent symbol of their fight for democracy and human rights in a new land. The issues investgated include the flag's design, manufacture, conservation and the sometimes debatable uses made of it by political groups. This video draws in a wealth of material provided by the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery and the Public Record Office of Victoria, as well as interviews with a number of people directly associated with conserving and promoting the flag in the 20th century."
