        "Inspired by a short story by Julio Cortazar, Antonioni uses the narrative structure of the detective story and employs spatial depth and appearance to question the viewer's sense of what is real and what is not. Set against a backdrop of London, the film follows young fashion photographer Thomas (David Hemmings) as he snaps his way through the world of 1960s British counterculture. While wandering through a park one day, he photographs two lovers, only to discover while printing and enlarging the images in his darkroom, that he may have inadvertently photographed a murder. Cast includes Vanessa Redgrave, Sarah Miles, John Castle and Jane Birkin. Music by Herbert Hancock. Cinematography by Carlo di Palma."
