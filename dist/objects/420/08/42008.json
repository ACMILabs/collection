        "Uses animation to dispel some of the mysteries about computers, while systematically presenting the basic ideas about computer operations. Explains storage of information, processing of input data, and printing out of responses. Demonstrates use of a flow chart and the diagram logic circuits of the AND, NOT and OR relations. An excellent and interesting explanation for beginners. Writen by Stan Hayward."
