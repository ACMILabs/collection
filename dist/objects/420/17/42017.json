        "Based on the book 'Toto il Buono', acclaimed director Vittorio De Sica has produced a captivating fable, co-written by long-time collaborator Cesare Zavattini, mixing his sometimes harsh reality with fantastic characters and events in an increasingly unreal setting. The main character Toto, himself a rescued foundling, is a philanthropist, determined to help his fellow man in the way he was helped by the woman who adopted him. Mingling De Sica's trademark neo-realism, in this case the shameful treatment of displaced persons after the War, with whimsical fantasy, this film won Best Film award at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival. Italian language with English subtitles."
