        "Why are women so absent in terms of story, character and integrity, age and exprience in mainstream cinema? Is it just too threatening to have women portrayed as they are in real life, or is it that women's issues are not real issues? Why could women on screen in the 30's and 40's be much more than the undevelopped romantic props they often are today. Hear what top Australian critics think and then have your say."
