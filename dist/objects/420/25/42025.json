        "This program, from the 'Reel to Real' series investigates why cinema and TV are so Anglo-Celtic, and aimed at middle America and suburban Australia. Top Australian critics discuss cinema in its wider context and cover topics such as: does being politically sound guarantee non-stereotypical filmmaking? How did the immigrant character break out of the gangster stereotype? How did black actors break out of servant roles or the musical exception. Spike Lee may be black, but what is he doing for women? Should he be applauded or marauded? This documentary will stimulate deep thinking about film, modern culture and society, and how they in turn, effect each other."
