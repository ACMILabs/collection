        "This two-part series explores ancient teachings on death and dying. It was filmed over a four-month period on location in the Himalayas where the original text still yields an essential influence over people's views of life and death. Narrated by Leonard Cohen, Part 1: \"A Way of life\" is a path-breaking documentary containing remarkable footage of the rites and liturgies surrounding and following the death of a Ladakhi elder. The Dalai Lama explains his own feelings about death, while other scenes within a palliative care hospice in San Francisco depict the use of the texts to counsel dying patients. This film, by revealing ancient teachings on how to think about death and dying, can be a valuable source of counsel and comfort."
