        "This is a charming fantasy excursion which creates a wonderful world of endless imagination through music, dance and special effects. Rex Harrison stars in the madcap adventures of a 19th century English doctor who walks and talks and squarks with the animals. Based on the stories of Hugh Lofting, the good doctor gets himself into all sorts of funny predicaments in this fun film that earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. With terrific music, fine acting, loveable creatures and a joyous fantasy tale, \"Doctor Doolittle\" is a classic for young and old alike."
