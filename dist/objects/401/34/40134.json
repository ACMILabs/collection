        "Bob and Bobek are two lovable white rabbits who will delight children up to the age of eight years. Their adventures are always fun and well suited to younger children who will identify with the characters and the situations in which they become involved. We follow their misadventures as they try to earn a living. In \"Around the corner\" they find themselves in search of a job but disaster follows their every move. A job \"At the zoo\" is hard work until a lion escapes. They try their hands at being removalists in \"Moving\", and are left to run \"The restaurant\" with chaotic results. Their final attempt is to become \"The rangers in the park\" where they deal with a mischievious dog."
