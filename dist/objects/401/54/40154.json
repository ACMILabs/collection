        "Barbra Streisand is a knockout as Dolly Levi, the woman \"who arranges things... like furniture and daffodils and lives\". The plot concerns Dolly, a young widow and professional matchmaker who sets her sights and whatever else she can muster, on conquering tight-fisted Yonkers merchant, Horace Vandergelder, beautifully played by Walter Matthau. How she does it has to be the grandest musical there ever was! So, spend a magical evening with the incomparable Barbra and enjoy a great musicals. Also stars Michael Crawford."
