        "More adventures of little Madeline, narrated by Christopher Plummer and based on the beloved books by Ludwig Bemelmans. \"Madeline and the forty thieves\": At the old house - and all over the neighbourhood - hats, gloves and scarves are missing. Madeline and Pepito investigate with Detective Moreau and uncover some very unusual thieves. \"Madeline and the dog show\": Even though she out-performs the competition, Genevieve is disqualified from a dog show because she is not pure bred but the judges change their tune when she rescues the Mayor's dog."
