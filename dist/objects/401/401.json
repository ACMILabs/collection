        "A meditation on the narcissistic nature of the consumption of advertising images, 'Suspension' consists of footage of hundreds of models' head shots taken from magazines that Discenza has repeatedly re-taped and re-scanned into an endlessly mutating image of cut-and-paste beauty. This hypnotic video artwork literally suspends the viewer in a cycle of visual engagement, an energetic interchange from eye to eye, viewer to model, consumer to consumed."
