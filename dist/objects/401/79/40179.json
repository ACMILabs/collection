        "How do we appear to the animals that share our lives? From the two million dustmites that inhabit our beds every night to the Macaque monkey picking 800 coconuts every day - animals are an integral part of human life. As well as providing companionship and food, they live on our bodies and influence the climate and the air that we breathe. But what do they see? What is the influence of our actions on their behaviour? This unique six-part BBC TV series provides the answers using stunning and innovative film and video techniques to truly show how our lives appear through animal eyes. Narrated by Andrew Sachs and contains the last three episodes - \"Life and soul\", \"Human life\" and \"Life in the balance\"."
