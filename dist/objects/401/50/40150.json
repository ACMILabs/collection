        "A spoof of \"Top Gun\" in which Charlie Sheen stars as Topeer Harley, an ace fighter pilot who's recruited to join a team of crack (or is it cracked?) jet jockeys for a top-secret mission Led by their incompetent commander (Lloyd Bridges). The squadron includes a half-blind pilot named 'Wash-Out' and a vain and smug golden boy. Together they train for operation 'Sleepy Weasle', a lightning strike against a desert kingdom. Meanwhile they spend their nights carousing in a nightclub where the beautiful airbase psychiatrist moonlights as a sexy chanteuse. To round out the insanity, a devious contractor is out to sabotage their mission."
