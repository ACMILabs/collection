        "This is a dramatic documentary of the 50 year history of the Federal Liberal Party in Australia. Beginning with the formation of the party, which first swept to office in 1949 at the height of the Second World War, led by the charismatic Robert Menzies and follows its transistion through the leaderships of Harold Holt, John Gorton and William McMahon; and the turmoil of the Vietnam War. After 23 years the Liberals lost office in 1972 only to regain it again in 1975 under the leadership of Malcolm Fraser. It delves into the turbulent internal atmosphere which has existed within the party since the rejection of Fraser as leader, looking at the leaderships of John Howard, Andrew Peacock and John Hewson and the \"Fightback\" package. This is the history of the Federal Liberal Party until the loss of the 1993 election and the appointmen of a new leader, Alexander Downer."
