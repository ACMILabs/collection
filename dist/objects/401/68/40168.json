        "The recently widowed, and new owner of the Cleveland Indians has a plan: field the worst team ever, watch the attendance fall, then move the franchise to glorious sun-drenched Miami. So she signs a punk-pitcher (Charlie Sheen), a gimpy-kneed womanising catcher (Tom Berenger), a third-rate third baseman (Corbin Bernsen), the outfielder Willie May Hates (Wesley Snipes) and a 'wayout' field of other crazy misfits. The perfect plan? maybe not, but it is the perfect ingredients for this riotous and inspiring comedy."
