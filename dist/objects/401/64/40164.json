        "Destined to be a modern classic, Paul Verhoeven's effort has brought new definition and brilliance to the \"femme fatale\" of the film noir genre. It is all here, temptation, sex and murder, and all in the guise of a voluptuous beautiful woman. Michael Douglas plays an ex-undercover cop, burnt out and recovering from drug and alcohol addiction when he becomes involved with the investigation of a brutal murder. The prime suspect is a very rich, very beautiful young woman (Sharon Stone) who's calm and collected exterior belies a predatory and hedonistic soul. Shocking, controversial and explicit, this film is not for the squeamish. Also stars George Dzundza. WARNING - SEXUALLY EXPLICIT."
