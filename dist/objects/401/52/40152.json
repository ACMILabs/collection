        "This is one of the most successful comedies of the eighties and stars pint-sized hero Macaulay Culkin. In a chaotic frenzy to get to the airport on time, the McCallister family forget one thing - eight year old Kevin. When two bungling burglars attempt to break into the McCallister household, Kevin is left home alone to defend himself and his house. He outwits the burglars by waging war the only way he knows how. A John Hughes film co-starring Joe Pesci, \"Home alone\" is a modern-day classic."
