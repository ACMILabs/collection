        "This is a heart warming and touching story about the friendship that develops between an abandoned child living in a foster home and an Orca (Killer Whale) who is confined in a too-small tank at Pacific Northwest aquatic park. At night Willy cries out to his family who frolic in the nearby bay. No-one can undestand his cries and moods - no one except Jesse (Jason James Richter) a 12 year old boy who knows what it is like to be without a family."
