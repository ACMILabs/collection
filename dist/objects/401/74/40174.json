        "Three characters live in isolation amidst the coastal sand dunes of the Corrong in southern South Australia. In a shack on the beach live Tom, a fisherman and his young son; out amongst the dunes lives an aborigine, 'Fingerbone Bill' who forms a friendship with the boy, naming him 'Storm Boy'. The story is conveyed with simplicity with many events left unspoken and undetailed. The relationships between the characters, and the scenes where the boy and his pet pelicans play together are subtley sketched and never lapse into the cloying sentimentality apparent in so many children's films. Burton's photography effectively captures the wild beauty of the Coorong."
