        "Orphee et Eurydice, directed by Stefanos Lazaridis, music by Christoph Willibald Gluck, libretto by Ranierie da Calzabigi, and adapted for the French performing edition by Pierre-Louis Moline, tells the tale of lovers separated by death. Orphee must go on a quest to Hades to find his dead wife Eurydice and bring her back to the living. The voyage is full of peril, and it is only after much heartache that he is reunited with his own true love. Features singers David Hobson (Orphee), Miriam Gormley (L'Amour), Amanda Thane (Eurydice), and The Australian Opera Chorus. Also features the Dancers of the Meryl Tankard Australian Dance Theatre and Dancers of The Australian Opera choreographed by Meryl Tankard, and The Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra conducted by Marco Guidarini. Recorded live at the Sydney Opera House on 20 September 1993 and produced for television in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Sung in French with English subtitles."
