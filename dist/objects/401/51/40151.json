        "Episode of Series \"The Shirley Temple collection\". Shirley Temple portrays the spirited young heroine of Johanna Spyri's popular children's novel giving her rich emotion and infinte charm. When her Aunt tires of caring for her, orphan Heidi is taken to the Swiss mountains to live with her gruff grandfather (Jean Hersholt), a hermit who comes to adore her. However, the Aunt returns to steal Heidi and sells her to a family whose invalid daughter (Marcia Mae Jones) needs a companion. Bullied by an evil governess (Mary Nash), Heidi still charms the entire household and never stops trying to return to her beloved grandfather. Colourised version."
