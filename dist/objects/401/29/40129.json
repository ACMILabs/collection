        "This is the captivating true story based on the book by Tobias Wolff. Growing up is never easy but for Tobias Wolff (Leonardo DiCaprio) it's sheer hell. His mother, Caroline (Ellen Barkin), has just married Dwight Hansen (Robert De Niro), a psychotic disciplinarian who rules with an iron fist and an explosive temper. Instead of the bright future his mother promised him, Tobias must now endure constant brutality from his sadistic stepfather. There is a way out though; and with the will to fight and courage way beyond his years, Tobias just might find it. An absorbing and thoughtful story is brought to life by the gripping performances of the stars."
