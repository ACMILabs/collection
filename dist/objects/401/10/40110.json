        "Episode of Series \"Human development: enhancing social and cognitive growth in children.\". Parents and teachers are ambitious for their children to become good students. Questions about how to develop intellectual growth and achievement have been the focus of many psychological studies. Examines myths such as predicting later ability on early achievement in childhood and the importance of hands on activity as opposed to observation. Factors determining IQ, using twins and adoptees raise interesting questions regarding the nature versus nurture debate, as well as looking at factors during pregnancy which may affect intellectual development."
