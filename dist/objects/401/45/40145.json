        "People remembered Jack Sommersby as a bitter, loutish man but when he returns home after the Civil War, he's tender, caring and resourceful. Has the war changed him... or is the man calling himself Jack Sommersby an impostor? Richard Gere and Jodie Foster are a match for the ages in Sommersby, a period romance rich in mystery, detail and splendid performances. They portray Jack and Laurel Sommersby, whose love grows as the suspicions about Jack mount. If he isn't the man she married, Laurel knows he is the man she always wanted, but an ultimate test of their love and Jack's identity awaits. Jack must stand trial for his life and the outcome makes for a memorable film."
