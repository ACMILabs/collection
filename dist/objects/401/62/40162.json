        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Animals of Farthing Wood\". The animals of Farthing Wood have waited a very long time to hear welcoming words from the White Stag. As survivors of the treacherous journey from Farthing Wood to the nature reserve at White Deer Park, the animals are at first happy to settle into their new habitat. However, it soon becomes apparent that life in White Deer Park is not without its dangers and after surviving so much together they now depend on each other. So, after renewing their Oath of Mutual Protection, Fox finds that he must once again act as their leader as they struggle to survive the long, hard winter. Added to the cold and the hunger, they also face the ever-present threat of poachers and the vicious attacks of the resident Blue Fox, known as Scarface."
