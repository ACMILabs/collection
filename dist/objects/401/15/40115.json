        "The Palestinian journalist, Raymonda Hawa Tawil, has been a prominent Palestinian activist since the 1960s. For her commitment to Palestinian self-rule she has been arrested several times by the Israeli authorities and now lives in exile in Paris. But her equally passionate commitment to feminism and to questioning the role of violence and masculinity in Arab culture has meant that she has been a controversial figure for many Palestinian activists. Based on her autobiography, also called \"My Home, My Prison\", this documentary examines the history of the Israeli Occupation and details the often humiliating experiences suffered by Palestinians living in the Occupied Territories. Compassionate and with a keen sense of justice, Tawil believes that no peace is possible until the Jews and Arabs commence a dialogue not predicated on fear or hate. \"My Home, My Prison\" is an exhilerating film made by two Jewish women who were inspired to investigate her life after reading her work."
