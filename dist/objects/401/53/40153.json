        "Episode of Series \"The Shirley Temple collection\". Shirley Temple stars in this delightful old-fashioned musical comedy. The cutest little girl with the biggest dimples, sings and dances her way from poverty to stardom. Ever cheerful, Little Dimples sings for money in the Bowery while her thieving Grandfather pickpockets the crowd she attracts. When a society lady adopts her, Dimples is discovered by the woman's nephew who needs someone to play Little Eva in his upcoming production of 'Uncle Tom's cabin'. Charming and entertaining, this film is packed with laughs, tender moments and rousing musical numbers. This is a colourized version of the original black and white film."
