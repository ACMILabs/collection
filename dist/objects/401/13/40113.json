        "A wonderful compilation of Australian short films from the early 1990's. The films are: \"He and She\" (Dir: R. Herbert) - a bickering couple get picked up by the police; \"Drive\" (C. Birmingham) - a mother and son take to the road after killing the \"old man\"; \"Lullabies\" (R. Gallois) - a gut-wrenching experimental film on the trauma of a dissolving relationship; \"Just Desserts\" (M. Pellizzari) - a delicious comedy about an Italo-Australian girl's sexual awakening and her love for her mama's cooking; \"Excursion to the Bridge of Friendship\" (C. Andreef) - a sophisticated Sydney woman decides to invite her folk-singing Bulgarian cousin to Australia. A very funny \"silent\" film about culture clash."
