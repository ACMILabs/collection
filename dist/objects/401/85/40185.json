        "You are about to be drawn into an amazing alternative reality. 'Myst' is a game that was designed from the ground up to draw you in with little or no distractions on the screen to interfere with the feeling of being there. It is non-linear, with the most depth, detail and reality you've ever experienced in a game. The key to playing the game is to lose yourself in this fantastic virtual exploration, and act and react as if you were really there."
