        "The scenario is an ambiguous one of double identity and meaning. Brodie (Geilgud) is a British novelist turned spy who travels to Switzerland under an assumed name. With him is his fictional wife, (Madeline Carroll), and an eccentric hired assassin known as \"The General\", (Peter Lorre). Their mission is to find and kill a German spy, but first they must guess who he is. Based on the novel \"Ashenden\" by Somerset Maugham, \"Secret Agent\", has many features of the quintessential Hitchcock."
