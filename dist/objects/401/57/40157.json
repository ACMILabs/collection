        "Wallace likes a nice bit of cheese with his crackers, so when the eccentric inventor finds his fridge empty and the local corner shop shut for Bank Holiday, he is forced to look further afield for his cheddar. His faithful dog Gromit is used to his master's flights of fancy, but this time his ears prick up with excitement as the two plasticene heroes blast off in their home-made rocket on the ultimate day-trip to the Moon! For children and adults alike, the animation techniques used in this production are quite incredible."
