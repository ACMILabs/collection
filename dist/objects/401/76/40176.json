        "John Wayne portrays a former Union officer searching for a traitor in this post-Civil War action drama directed by Howard Hawks. The war is over, but Col. Cord McNally (Wayne) is still hunting the informer who caused the death of a young officer. His quest brings him to the town of Rio Lobo, where he joins forces with two ex-rebels, helps save this small piece of Texas from ruthless outlaws, and finally comes face to face with his quarry. Featuring Jennifer O'Neil, Chris Mitcham and Jack Elam, this film brings together the talents of two Western legends."
