        "Bruce Willis stars as New York Detective, John McClane, newly arrived in Los Angeles to spend the Christmas holiday with his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia). But as McClane waits for his wife's office party to break up, terrorists seize control of the building. While terrorists leader Hans Gruber and his savage henchmen round up hostages, McClane slips away unnoticed. Armed with only a service revolver and his own cunning, McClane launches his own one-man war. A crackling action thriller from beginning to end, \"Die Hard\" explodes with heart-stopping suspense. Also stars Alan Rickman, Alexander Godunov and Bonnie Bedelia. From the novel by Roderick Thorp."
