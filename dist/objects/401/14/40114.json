        "The second part of an innovative and dazzling selection of Australian short films from the 1990s. The films are: \"Mr. Electric\" (Dir: Stuart McDonald) - in 1953 an Aboriginal man (Ernie Dingo) returns to the country home of his adopted white family to give them the gift of electricity; \"Rhino\" (Anna Johnson) - a kinetic black and white film combining animation and live action; \"Terra Nullius\" (Anne Pratten) - a confronting and disturbing film about a young Aboriginal woman dealing with her history as a survivor of incest by her adopted father; \"A Passion Play\" (Tony Twigg) - a haunting animated film that utilises symbols and paintings to reflect on the nature of communication; \"Secrets of the City\" (Cathy Linsley) - an animated dream; \"Etcetera in Paper Jam\" (Michael Bates) - a hilarious short about a photo- copier that turns on humans. Anyone who has worked in an office environment will enjoy this witty attack on \"office culture\"."
