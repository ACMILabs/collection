        "Loosely based on Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\" this delightful animated film from Sweden tells the story of young Ferdinand's escape from slavery on the island of Plutonia to the magical island of Melonia. On Melonia he meets Miranda, her father Prospero, Hobb, a friendly spirit and the ever-complaining gardener, Caliban. With their help he returns to Plutonia to rescue his fellow slaves and defeat the island's evil rulers Muck and Myer."
