        "A child is kidnapped by spies to ensure his silence, but he springs into action. There are memorable sequences in the film involving a dentist, an East End mission and the Albert Hall. This film was later remade by Hitchcock in America but the earlier version is more acclaimed. Peter Lorre is excellent as the sneering villain. Cast also includes Leslie Banks and Edna Best."
