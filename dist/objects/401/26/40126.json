        "Peter Blood, a young doctor unjustly condemned for treating rebels is sentenced to slavery. Arabella, the beautiful niece of a cruel plantation owner, buys him, but Blood and his mates eventually escape and begin a career of piracy, gallantly fighting off adversaries on the high seas. After a strange twist of fate, Arabella and Blood meet again and justice and romance prevail. This film, with its thrilling sea battles launched the careers of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the title roles."
