        "Artists record their work at the Third International Symposium on Electronic Art, Sydney, 1992. Through a series of interviews, performance, electronic theatre, this video looks at ways in which artists challenge the emerging technological realm known as \"cyberculture\". It also examines issues such as gender, the body, the homogenisation of culture and the social and environmental implications of new technologies. Three of the artists interviewed are Char Davies, Stelarc and Myron Kreuger."
