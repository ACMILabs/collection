        "This excellent kit attempts to answer the questions \"What is traditional culture?\" and \"How and why do cultures change\". The kit comprises five films on two videocassettes, an audio tape and a comprehensive study guide for teachers which includes discussion topics and detailed background notes. The two video casssettes comprise films from \"Towards Baruya manhood\" - a series of ethnographic films which provide unique insights into the life of the Baruya tribe when their traditional culture was little changed by European contact. The second video contains \"New Guinea Patrol\", which follows an Australian patrol officer in the Western Highlands during the period of colonial administration, and excerpts from \"Yumi yet\" which covers Papua New Guinea's independence celebrations. All of these films are also available individually."
