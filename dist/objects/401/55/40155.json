        "Episode of Series \"The Shirley Temple collection\". The first big film created especially for her, 'Bright eyes' helped make Shirley Temple a huge box-office star and features her most famous song, 'On the good ship Lollipop'. The little darling of a group of aviators, Shirley splits her time between her pilot Godfather, Loop and her long-suffering mother who is a housemaid for a selfish, wealthy family. When a tragic accident suddenly leaves Shirley orphaned, Loop sets out to adopt Shirley - until he learns that he is not the only one determined to keep the adorable youngster. This is a colourized version of the original black and white film."
