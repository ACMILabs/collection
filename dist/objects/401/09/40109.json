        "Episode of Series \"Human development: enhancing social and cognitive growth in children.\". Explores the development of peer relationships in children of various ages. Young children tend to form transient peer relationships based on superficial play, whereas between the ages 8-11, children become more discerning in the selection of friends based on more enduring criteria such as character. Sociometry, mapping out the peer groups in classes, can be used to define those students who are popular, ignored or rejected so that appropriate strategies can be developed to ensure that all children develop healthy peer relationships."
