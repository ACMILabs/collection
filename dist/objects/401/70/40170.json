        "The wonderfully versatile Tom Hanks stars as Josh Baskin, a 12 year old who is transformed overnight into a 35 year old man when his wish to be 'big' comes true. Confused and frightened, Josh runs away to New York, where, by sheer luck, he lands the perfect job in a toy company. Suddenly he's got freedom, money, toys and all the junk food he can eat. But he's not prepared for what happens next when a sexy co-worker falls in love with him! Also stars Elizabeth Perkins and Robert Loggia."
