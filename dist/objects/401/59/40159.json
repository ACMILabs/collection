        "Once again our plasticine heroes are plunged into a hilarious tale of skullduggery involving an extraordinary pair of automated trousers and a villanous penguin. Posing as an innocent lodger, the fiendish fish-eater sets about recruiting mild-mannered Wallace as unwitting accomplice to his dastardly plot; a diamond heist. It is left to the faithful Gromit to turn detective and save the day as malice and mayhem culminate in a breathless train chase around the sitting room."
