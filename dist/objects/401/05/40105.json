        "This kit is a useful new education resource designed to address social factors that undermine the formation of a healthy and respectful relationship between the police force and young people. It is a joint production of local police, young people and community from the inner urban area of Flemington/Kensington in Melbourne. The kit consists of a video and a set of linked, but autonomous education modules. The video is a realist documentary style production that aims to give a 'slice of life' view of a neighbourhood and its young people; police work in the neighbourhood; and situations of conflict of distrust that arise between young people and the police. The themes underpinning the video are picked up and expanded in the five specific education modules which include: young people, conflict and the police; high-rise living and the police; communication, cultural diversity and policing; young women and the police; the role of the police."
