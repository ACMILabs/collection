        "Based on the novel by G.M. Glaskin, this multi-award winning adventure is about two young children who, after their mother dies, decide to run-away to England to stay with their only surviving relatives to avoid being put in separate orphanages. The first stage of the journey involves walking 107 kilometres from an inland West Australian wheat belt town to perth. They are befriended by a young aboriginal man and his family, survive a bush-fire, eat off the land and eventually reach Perth to media and public acclaim."
