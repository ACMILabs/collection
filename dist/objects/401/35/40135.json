        "Bob and Bobek are two lovable white rabbits who will delight children up to eight years of age. Their adventures are well suited for younger children who will identify with the characters and the situations in which they become involved. We follow their misadventures as they travel the globe. Bobek becomes a hero \"At the airport\" when he accidentally catches a smuggler. They go \"On board ship\" for a trip on a paddle steamer that they will never forget. A monster \"In the forest\" is scaring all the animals until the two rabbits arrive. They upset a champion athlete \"At the athletics carnival\". The abominable snowman upsets their fun \"In the mountains\". A nasty man steals their magic hat/home and plans a worse fate for them in \"The hat\"."
