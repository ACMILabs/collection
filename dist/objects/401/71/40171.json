She is a tycoon's mistress and he is engaged to an heiress. Their sudden, but undeniable love affair leads them to make a vow - that they will break off their current relationships, get jobs and meet in six months to continue their affair. However, a tragic accident prevents Terry from keeping their rendezvous and the lovers future takes an emotional and uncertain turn."
