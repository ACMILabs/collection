        "Boss breathing down your neck? Bank manager screaming? Family driving you crazy? Then it's about time you took a break on the the wild west side! Die hard city fellas Mitch, Phil and Ed are edging 40 and desperately searching for their lost youth. When they try to recapture it with a two week cattle-driving vacation in the midwest they discover that playing cowboy is more than just ridin', ropin', and sleepin' out under the stars. These city slickers thought surviving mid-life crisis was tough. That's nothing compared to the ride they're about to take. Stars Billy Crystal and Jack Palance in an endearing and funny adventure that will have the whole family in stitches."
