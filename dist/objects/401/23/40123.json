        "No film in history has captured the world's imagination like Walt Disney's first full-length animated feature. Regarded as a milestone in filmmaking, this beloved masterpiece unites generations of moviegoers who have been enchanted by its delightful charm and breathtaking beauty. \"Once upon a time\"... so begins the fairy tale of Snow White, the beautiful princess whose life is threatened by the jealous Queen. Snow White finds safe haven with seven of the most lovable characters ever created: Doc, Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful and Dopey until a mysterious old woman arrives with a poison apple, leading to the ultimate storybook ending. Adapted from Grimm's Fairy Tales, this film is pure enjoyment with bountiful humour and unforgettable music. This video version also features a short segment which shows rare, behind-the -scenes archival footage of the making of the film."
