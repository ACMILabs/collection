        "Hollywood's most wanted men return in a blaze of glory to shake the west once again. Down, but definitely not out, the three surviving members of the infamous Regulators, Billy the Kid, (Emilio Estevez), Josiah 'Doc' Scurlock, (Kiefer Sutherland), and Chavez Y. Chavez, (Lou Diamond Phillips), reunite for their greatest adventure. Joined by his pal Arkansas Dave Rudabaugh, (Christian Slater), and two unlikely recruits, Billy is as reckless and irreverent as ever as he rounds up his new gang and heads for the west. But things have changed since the Regulators last rode through. The Kid is cornered by ruthless cattle kings and double-crossed by corrupt officials. Tracked by his one-time friend - the newly appointed sheriff, Pat Garrett - the Kid leads the Regulators down a treacherous trail towards Old Mexico... and to their destiny."
