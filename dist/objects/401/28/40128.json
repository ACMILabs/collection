        "Starring Cameron Daddo, Phil Morris, Robert Vaughn and Nicholas Eadie, this is a story about two men from opposite ends of the earth; and their ideals, hopes and dreams. In 1903, two men are using their talents to win themselves a place in the sun. Don Walker, a champion Australian cyclist drags himself from the depths of urban poverty to the height of glory. He is a man determined to win on his own terms. American Marshall W. \"Major\" Taylor, a grandson of slaves, is a dedicated professional and the first black American athlete to smash his way through the colour bar. They have everything to lose and everything to win."
