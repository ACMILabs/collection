        "A remake of the 1931 film, but greatly expanded to allow for the dancing of Fred Astaire and Leslie Caron. The story is that of a French orphan whose schooling is sponsored by an American millionaire, on the stipulation that she will never know who he is. His secretary (Thelma Ritter) is so touched by her letters of gratitude, delivered by the school, that she persuades him to visit. He is then enchanted by the elegant, lovely girl and falls in love with her - and she with him, without knowing who he is. The film contains a wide range of music including a jazz with drums by Astaire, a ballet danced by Caron, several dream sequences with Astaire imagining himself as a playboy and a rich cowboy, and Johnny Mercer's memorable song 'Something's Gotta Give'."
