        "This five-part television documentary explores New York's rich history as the premier laboratory of modern life. A sweeping narrative covering nearly 400 years and 400 square miles, it reveals a complex and dynamic city that has played an unparalled role in shaping the United States and reflecting its ideals. Two versions of the series are available: the original ten hour version originally broadcast in the US (NTSC) and the truncated 275 minute version broadcast in Australia. A comprehensive website based on the documentary can be found at http://www.pbs.org/wnet/newyork/"
