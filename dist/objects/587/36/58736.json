        "JAZZ is a comprehensive 4 volume series directed by Ken Burns that presents a detailed history of the musical form from its beginnings in the early 19th Century to its development up to the present day. Researched and produced over a six year period it is a thorough and broad study of the history of Jazz and its musicians and includes musicians' biographies, renowned and rare recordings, footage of live performances, interviews with artists, historians, writers and critics and rare film clips and still photographs that form an extraordinary mix of interpretations of and insight into the characters, origins, development, techniques and reshaping of the diverse musical form that is Jazz."
