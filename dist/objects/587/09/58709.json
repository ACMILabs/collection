        "This is a definitive collection of important Australian artists from the period 1788-1991. It investigates the European traditions, the Heidelberg School and the beginnings of Post-Impressionism and abstraction. From Margaret Preston to Brett Whitely, controversial modernist art, and the influence of American styles such as Abstract Expressionism. It also investigates experimental art - Performance and Happenings, the influence of Feminism and the international and commercial success of Aboriginal art. Key works from galleries across Australia and a lively commentary provide an informed history emphasising critical developments in Australian art. Includes high-resolution images, multi-level presentations and commentary, full lists of artists with additional information, close-up views of any part of each image and a detailed study guide with key to the works."
