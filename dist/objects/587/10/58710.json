        "Our bodies are machines in motion, capable of sheer strength, complicated thought and graceful coordination all at the same time. This is due to a network of specialised systems and teams of organs that work in perfect harmony. This series investigates those major systems, using actual footage of working organs as well as clear demonstrations with everyday materials to illustrate both the way in which they function and the purpose they serve. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students."
