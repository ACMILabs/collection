        "Three part series covering the centuries beginning and ending the Roman occupation of early Britain. The series traces the social, political and cultural impact of the Roman Empire on early Britain and the future of the country and investigates various historical landmarks and events that signal the significance of the Roman presence and influence. Other subjects discussed include culinary, architectural, religious and community planning traditions of Roman Britain, all illustrated through interviews with historians, archaeologists and re-enactment troups as well as investigation of artifacts and characteristics and representations of this period in contemporary England. \"Roman's in Britain\" is a comprehensive investigation of the history of Rome and of Britain, and their mutually influential position in classical history."
