        "Public hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for and broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002. Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The programs style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture."
