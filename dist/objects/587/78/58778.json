        "Created by Reg Watson and screening a total of 692 episodes between 1979 and 1986, \"Prisoner\" was one of the first television series to tackle issues such as rape, homosexuality and violence. It did this through the relationships between a cross section of women and the women who work around them at the Wentworth Detention Centre. This groundbreaking serial funded by the Grundy Organisation was screened in countries throughout the world and was remade in Germany and the U.K. The complete title of the series overseas was \"Prisoner: Cell block H\". PLEASE NOTE: the dates recorded in entries pertain to copyright year and usually preceeds the screening year."
