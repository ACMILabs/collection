        "Art critic Robert Hughes considers his relationship to Australia, 35 years after leaving the country in this television documentary series. Contemplative after his near fatal car accident, Hughes reflects fondly on his childhood in Australia and explores contemporary Australian culture with an appreciation that only came after he was forced to question his mortality. Written by Robert Hughes."
