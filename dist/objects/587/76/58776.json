        "Espionage, fantasy and a healthy dose of unresolved sexual tension abound in this slick series that has proved to be one of the most successful television series of all time. Originally aired in the UK between January 1961 and September 1969 and comprising of 161 episodes, the series went on to screen in a record number of 120 countries. John Steed (Patrick McNee) was always an Avenger, appearing in all episodes - Mrs Peel (Diana Rigg) was his third and most enduring partner. The series was resurrected in the mid 1970s, episodes of which are also available in the collection."
