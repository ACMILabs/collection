        "A series of five, half-hour documentaries, made for television, that examine very different challenges facing five contemporary Australian families. The filmmakers' methods range from strictly observational (fly-on-the-wall), to active involvement (where the director is a participant in the family's drama). Each episode features a different family facing a turning point in its collective life, that forces family members to face challenges of love, loyalty and change, whether they are striving to find a place within one's family, to keep a family together, to create a new family or to change an old one. A study guide is available from http://www.roninfilms.com.au/related/2365104851-0.pdf"
