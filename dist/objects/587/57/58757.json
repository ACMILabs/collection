        "A five part series which analyses the Australian Constitution and its prospects for change in the 21st century. The programs discuss a variety of issues related to the Australian constitution, with each focusing on specific subjects that define the content of the interviews with and commentary from politicians, academics, media commentators and legal counsel that make up each episode. The subjects covered by the series include the history of the Australian Constitution and its founding ideals, the possible make up of an Australian Republic and the necessary adaptations to the Constitution, the Australian Parliament and the Executive as well as their distribution of powers, the rights and guarantees contained in the Constitution for the community, issues of aboriginal reconciliation in the Constitution and the future of the Constitution through the political channels for change such as referendums."
