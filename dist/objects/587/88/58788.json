        "A series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain. Each film provides a thought-provoking survey of an artist's work and ideas, featuring the artist in discussion and illustrated by sequences captured of key exhibitions and installations around the world. The films offer a rare and personal insight into the influences and creative processes that lie behind the artists' creations, and provide an accessible means of engaging with the pleasures and puzzles of art in the twenty-first century. An excellent introduction to contemporary artists and their works, theEYE is an ideal resource for a wide range of audiences, including schools, universities, art practitioners and art-lovers."
