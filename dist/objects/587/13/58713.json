        "Between 1958 and 1978 British duo Peter Rogers and Gerald Thomas became a national institution as they regularly churned out a steady stream of saucy, slapstick, commercially successful \"Carry on\" films. They worked with a regular troupe of actors including Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Sidney James, Bernard Bresslaw and Barbara Windsor, although international comedy figures also made guest appearances. Rogers and Thomas were constant factors throughout the series, although production companies would change behind the scenes. \"Carry on Colombus\" - a commercial failure, was released in 1993, the year after Roger's death."
