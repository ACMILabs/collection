        "Television series aimed at pre and young teens about a group of kids who land the after-school job of their dreams, testing computer games. The Crash Zone is the place where the five friends, Mike, Pi, Marcello, Bec and Ram go to test drive the games created by Alexandra Davis, owner of the software company Catalyst, before they go on the market. Combining technological fact and fantasy with issues such as friendship, teamwork and loyalty, the series follows the exciting online and real-life adventures of the friends, who range in age from 11-16. Although aimed at 9 to 13 year olds, \"Crash Zone\" is thought provoking and appealing to all age levels and can be used to encourage discussion about cultural, social, philosophic and technological issues related to 'new media', information systems and the rights of individuals in a 'networked world'. Teaching resources can be found at: http://www.actf.com.au/learning_centre_new/Learning_frameset.htm Accompanying website at: www.crashzone.tv"
