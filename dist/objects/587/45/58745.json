        "Bill Peach describes how the discovery of gold changed the course of Australia's history. Through dramatised re-enactments and historical footage, the effects of the new economic force on population, the location of towns, wealth generation, the development of transport networks and the introduction of a representative democracy are all investigated. In this series Bill Peach traces the story of gold from its earliest discovery to the early 1980s."
