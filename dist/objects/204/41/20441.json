        "1.3 million Arab refugees now live in camps on both sides of the Jordan, in Gaza, and in neighbouring Arab lands. Since 1949 the U.N. relief agency has been working to provide emergency food and shelter, education and long term job training. But the presence of these proud, angry and uprooted people must continue to be an obstacle to peace - they are humans being denied fundamental rights."
