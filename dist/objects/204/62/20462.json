Shows how erroneous beliefs have arisen and analysis of the mistaken ideas that tuberculosis is no longer a serious disease; that it is easy to control with drugs; that long periods in hospital are not necessary; that it does not affect old people; that people who feel fit cannot be infected. The simple precautions of chest X-ray and skin tests are explained."
