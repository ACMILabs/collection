        "Vision only. Film seems to be about the techniques employed to make waterlogged land usable for crops. Footage includes old-style farm vehicles and machinery being used to achieve this. Nice shot of 6 new red tractors driving through the terrain. Also features an amusing moment where two men push a large poll into the ground to prove how soft the soil is. General shots of cattle are scattered throughout. Nice, kitsch begining and end illustrated titles. Good 'The End', possibly for postcard."
