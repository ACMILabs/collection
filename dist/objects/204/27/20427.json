        "Discusses briefly five of the most destructive of the family Aphididae which attack apple trees and fully illustrates the life-cycle of one of them, the green apple aphis. Using micro-photography techniques the various stages in the life-cycle are shown - from the emergence of the nymph from the egg through to mating and reproduction. A final diagrammatical section summarizes the life-cycle."
