        "The countryside of Flanders, Brabant and Wallonia in Belgium has for centuries attracted artists who have interpreted the changing seasons and depicted various types of inhabitants of the regions. This film shows how these sources of inspiration have remained unchanged. Comparisons of the work of artists of different periods with the landscape and types of inhabitants to be seen in Flanders and the surrounding districts today. Artists whose work is illustrated include P. Breughel, Rubens and Van Eyck."
