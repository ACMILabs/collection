        "Through the story of Aroha, daughter of a Maori chieftan, we see how the Maori people of New Zealand are integrating their ancient tribal customs with the ways of their non-Maori neighbours and progressing toward a fuller equality as citizens of New Zealand. Aroha, a student of Wellington University, is able to bring her people to a greater acceptance of the non-Maori's ways when her father is brought back to health in a modern hospital. Depicts Maori customs and concludes with tribal dances. No other credits available."
