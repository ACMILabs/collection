        "Scientific methods during the war (World War II) were used both to save and destroy life. Science has made the modern world, as is illustrated by the development of electricity, it also maintains the world, for example, by purifying our water supplies. It is also expanding the modern world through such means as wireless waves and radar. This is a look at how science affects the lives of everyday people, and how having a better understanding of science can be helpful to society. No other credits available."
