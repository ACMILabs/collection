        "Melbourne is an art conscious city, the centre of which is the National Gallery, housing many old masters and other works of art. The film shows the contribution to this interest in art being made by the annual Dunlop Art Contest. The film shows some of the work involved in the unpacking, cataloguing and judging of the hundreds of entries from all over Australia, and concludes with views of the 1951 winning entries with comments on each by the judges. No other credits available."
