        "Episode of Series \"Basic Television\". Part of a series of films designed for screening to students studying television principles and servicing. This episode uses animation and live action to illustrate directivity and the characteristics of the basic dipole antenna, and to show a typical step-by-step installation of an antenna. It includes demonstrations to illustrate a chimney strap mounting, the use of stand-offs, the use of the Rawl drill, and the installation of the lightning arrester and ground rod. NB: This film may be considered out-of-date but useful for basic instructions (11/97)."
