        "Alan Watts discusses the art of meditation as an alternative to the pressures and frustration of modern life. The film brings him right into the midst of the viewing audience who can follow along as he leads them step by step in the disciplines of body posture, breath control and concentration, toward that state of relaxation that stops \"the chattering in the skull\". The film does not set forth the principles of meditation in academic fashion, it is experiential, leaving one with a feeling of peace and well-being."
