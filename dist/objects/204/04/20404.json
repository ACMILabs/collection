        "Traces the early investigation into the control of Anthrax disease in sheep and cattle. The film recalls the losses, in early days, amounting to hundreds of thousands of sheep and cattle, and then proceeds to show how the problem of this disease has been largely overcome to-day. The danger of Anthrax to humans is also stressed. No other credits available."
