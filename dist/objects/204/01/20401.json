        "A record of the operations of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition, from November 1947 until April 1948. Meteorologists, metallurgists, geologists, zoologists and biologists took part in the expedition. A meteorological station was established on Heard Island, south of Fremantle. Another party set out for Macquarie Island, with the intention of landing on the mainland of Antarctica, to carry out a geological survey, but pack ice prevented this, making it impossible for the party to land."
