        "Discusses social conformity, citing everyday incidents as examples of obedience to custom in present day society - the little boy who felt his birthday gift would not be liked because it was different; the housewife who flew into a frenzy of tidying up when the door-bell rang; the teenage daughter who believed she must adopt behaviour beyond her years in order to be accepted. The film concludes with an interview with Dr Brock Chisholm, psychiatrist and former head of the World Health Organization, who comments on the importance to our society of the visionary who looks beyond the confines of convention."
