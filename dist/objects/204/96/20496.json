        "This film defines and gives examples of the five basic elements in film making that lend themselves to artistic control by the film maker, and the critical analysis by the film \"consumer\"; composition, lighting, editing, filming of movement and the use of sound. The film maker uses these to express his ideas with artistic selection and sensitivity."
