        "Treasures from the National Gallery of Art in Washington are used to present the development of Western art from the thirteenth century. The film opens with a discussion of Byzantine and early Italian painting and explains the gradual development of realism during the Renaissance. The work of famous artists such as Velasquez, Rembrandt, Van Eyck and Goya illustrate the development of art up to the nineteenth century. The film concludes with examples of French Impressionism and Post Impressionism."
