        "A record of the final manned flight to the moon in the Apollo series, this film shows the astronauts, Eugene Cernan, Harrison E. Schmit and Ronald E. Evans - one of them in this case, a geologist - examining the moon's surface, probing it and collecting samples and setting up various testing apparatus. With clearer photography than seen in earlier films, there are some excellent views of both the earth and the moon recorded from space. Also includes intercuts of Skylab, the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz co-operative and the space shuttle.The sub title derives from a saying of Sir Isaac Newton, who, when his work was praised, modestly replied that his achievement was due to the fact that he was carried to his goal on the shoulders of giants."
