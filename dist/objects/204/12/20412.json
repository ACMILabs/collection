        "A tongue-in-cheek history of a girl who could be anything she wanted - but her parents gave her dolls. In High School she decided to stand for class president but had to settle for being secretary. Vocational guidance placed her in nursing, rather than medicine. She then tried sports but a boy beat her. While developing her mind, she read cookbooks. Finally, she decided to be a woman - whatever that is!"
