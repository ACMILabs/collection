        "An analysis of Aristotle's contribution to the development of scientific method. Departing from Plato's ideas, Aristotle made observations based on his experience, classified his data, performed experiments and sought to arrive at generalizations or principles. Also examines how his work laid the foundation for such sciences as botany and zoology. No other credits available."
