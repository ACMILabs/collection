        "Part one deals with the study of the external features of spiders, and their habits including different methods of web-building and catching food. Types of spiders include: garden spider, water spider, and raft spider. Coition and the spinning of cocoons to protect eggs is also shown. The second part of the film supplements the above material, showing biological relatives of these spiders, including the primitive sea scorpions, found only as fossils, the aquatic king crab, land crabs, carnivorous harvestmen, and the ararina, including the cheesemite, red spiders, sheep tick, and the so-called sea spiders. Commentary by Carleton Hobbs, photography by Charles D. Head and F. Percy Smith. No other credits available. Suitable for secondary school level."
