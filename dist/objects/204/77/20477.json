        "A film which uses animation to tell the tale of the Acoma Pueblo Indians about a boy's search for his father, entailing his voyage on an arrow to the Sun, trials he undergoes in the sky village until he is recognised by his father, the lord of the sun, and his return to earth to spread the sun's warm delights. Based on the Caldecott Medal winning book by Gerald McDermott."
