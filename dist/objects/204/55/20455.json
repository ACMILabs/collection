        "Life at the tiny outpost of Masi, on the edge of the vast Finnmark plateau over which the nomadic Lapps have wandered for centuries. Lapp children are shown at their lessons in a school built be the Norwegian State. Out on the plateau a family is shown living a primitive tent life, and preparing their sledges and reindeer to migrate to the coast in the spring. No other credits available."
