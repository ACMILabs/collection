        "The Army Apprentices School at Balcombe, Victoria, offers training in numerous trades for a period of three years. For a further year boys are attached to an Army unit, and then the apprenticeship is completed and their qualifications as tradesmen will be recognized by civilian standards. This film illustrates the facilities offered for training in toolmaking, welding, carpentry, plumbing, blacksmithing, and machining. It points out that all apprentices are given theoretical training in English, Mathematics and trade science."
