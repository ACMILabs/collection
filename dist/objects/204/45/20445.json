        "The Voortrekker Memorial, the story behind it and its dedication in 1949. Bas-reliefs on the memorial and re-enacted sequences show the Voortrekkers setting out across the Brakensberg to the Free State, Natal and Transvaal, the massacre of Piet Retief's party by Dingaan and his Zulu warriors, the subsequent Voortrekker victory at Bloody River, and the establishment of new farmlands. The celebrations at the dedication of the Memorial and the sentiments behind it."
