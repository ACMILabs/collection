        "A long film report of a new and daring step toward understanding what lies under the Arctic ice. This is the story of an Arctic diving expedition led by Dr. Joseph MacInnes and a team of scientists, during two months of continuous springtime daylight. The dives are a test of both men and equipment as well as an exploration of the high northern marine environment. What they discovered is interestingly documented in this film."
