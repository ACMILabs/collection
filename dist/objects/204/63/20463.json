        "This film describes the methods used by State and Municipal authorities and C.S.I.R.O. to eradicate the Argentine Ant in large suburban and city areas. The efforts of individual householders to eradicate the pest have proved unsuccessful. The film shows, in detail, the large scale methods developed by the C.S.I.R.O. which have been used systematically and methodically in attempting to eradicate the pest."
