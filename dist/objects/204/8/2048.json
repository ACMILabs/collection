        "Propaganda piece highlighting Victoria's development as the foremost producer of pork in Australia. Competition received a record number of entries and the winning score of 93/100 for a carcase was the highest total ever in Australia. Winner was a 'new Australian' from Italy.  The cracases are beautifully displayed and almost fetishised as if in an art gallery. Everyone involved takes great joy, interest and pride in the meat displayed to an amusingly earnest extent. The images are high-contrast with vibrant reds and greens. A combination of the above provides a beautifully surreal quality to the piece.  Amusing sound grabs from narration such as \"Here we have a veritable paradise of pork\".  Interesting 'The End' illustration, good for Postcards, etc."
