        "World-wide water shortage. Today increased demands for water and increased pollutions of rivers have brought us to the verge of a world-wide water crisis. Using unusual animation techniques, this interesting film outlines the problem and stresses the need for international control and co-operation. Scans the many difficulties which surround the provision of adequate clean water to the growing world population, for agriculture, industry and health."
