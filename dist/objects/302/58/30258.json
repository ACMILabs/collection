        "The prairies are the incubators of vast numbers of Canadian waterfowl, principally ducks, but, as much land is drained and cultivated there are fewer breeding grounds. This film shows the immense flocks of birds, their habits, and their dependence on the wetlands of the prairies. How to maintain living space for the ducks without having them pose a threat to farmer's grainfields is a problem being studied by the Canadian Wildlife Service."
