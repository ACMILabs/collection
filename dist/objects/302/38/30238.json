        "The Coober Pedy Solar Still was constructed outside the opal mining town in 1966. It covers an area of almost two acres, and is now distilling plentiful supplies of brackish water into a reliable supply of domestic fresh water. Explains with animated diagrams how a Solar Still works, and shows an earlier prototype in Western Australia. Only recently has enough been learned about the thermal behaviour of Solar Stills for an economical design to be developed."
