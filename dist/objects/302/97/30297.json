        "This film was made in a refugee camp in Europe to show conditions in which the refugees have been living for many years. It depicts, as an almost everyday incident, the bitter disappointment felt by a refugee family when their application to go overseas is turned down. Includes a statement by the High Commissioner for Refugees on the efforts made by his office to clear the camps in Europe by the end of 1960."
