        "This film was made at the request of Victoria's Forest Commission. Bush fires all over Australia and indeed all parts of the world create havoc not only on the environment of humans but also on the delicate balance of the natural world. A training film directed towards forest workers on how to use water on forest fires and the follow-up after the fire has been contained."
