        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Ways of seeing\". One of a series of films by art critic and author John Berger which explores the ways in which we look at pictures. He looks at oil paintings over the last 400 years of the nude and interprets painting as being made for a male audience. He asks whether there is a difference between being naked or nude. How do European oil paintings of nudes compare with the images of modern advertisements? Finally, he asks women for their comments on how men see them or have seen them in the past and on how this influences the way women see themselves. Attempts to explain the difference between nudity and nakedness in art. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
