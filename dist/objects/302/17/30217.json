        "A survey of the world energy crisis using such examples as the power shortage in the UK in 1973. Workers were put on a three-day week, some pubs and shops reverted to gaslight and a 'Switch off' campaign saved 20 percent of power usage. Architects with this in mind start to design energy saving buildings. Wind power and solar panels are discussed and demonstrated. Third world man-power in agriculture is contrasted with the developed world's high output of farm produce with modern techniques using large energy consuming machines and fertilisers made from petro-chemicals. Narrated by Tom Dunn with camera by Joseph Cabbibo. Also produced by The New York State Education Department and The Ontario Educational Communications Authority."
