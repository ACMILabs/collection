        "Episode of Series \"Look at Britain\". ''Free cinema'' documentary about the work and leisure time of a group of teenagers in an urban industrial community. Shot in and around a Kensington youth club, this film is pitched between social documentary and personal expression. Gives an idea of the realistic way in which the club is run, but concentrates on the young people themselves, their involvement with life, their problems and potentialities. While some comment is made, the young people are mostly left to speak for themselves, with their expressive hands, watchful eyes and the richness of their words. Commentary by Jon Rollason. Music by John Dankworth."
