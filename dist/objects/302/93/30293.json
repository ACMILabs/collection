        "This film is about development. Focussing on the discussion group that appears in the film has a connection with the title of the film. The group covers, among other things, migrants, Aborigines and the relationships between rich and poor nations and the consequences of preaching Christianity without due reverence for other cultures. The film stresses the need for commitment to action"
