        "Weaving, one of man's oldest arts, still offers pleasure and opportunity for self-expression to both beginner and expert. We watch a class of weavers, under expert guidance, \"dress\" their looms and weave the useful and attractive articles of their choice, a delicate evening scarf, fabric for a suit, or the practical table mats woven by a beginner. The process of weaving is seen in close-up and slow motion. Traditional Scottish and European designs are shown with excellent contemporary work from every part of Canada, indicating the popularity of the craft today."
