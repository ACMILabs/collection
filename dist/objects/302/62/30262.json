        "In South Australia, the driest state in the driest continent, water, particularly underground water, is of more than seasonal importance. Questions such as - \"How does the water get there? Does it maintain a certain level? Is it of a consistent quality? Who needs the water and how is it distributed, controlled and metered?\" are dealt with, as well as other aspects of this essential resource, in particular how the water is used and in some cases abused."
