        "Episode of Series \"Australia today\". Illustrates our dependence on water and our inability to exist without it. Tells why Australia has water shortages and what is being done to irrigate the great inland tracts from mountainous regions of heavy snowfall and abundant rains. Australia has the largest artesian basin in the world, from which thousands of square miles have been made productive. Scientific progress has been made in the fields of rainmaking by chemical cloud dusting, and desalination of sea water."
