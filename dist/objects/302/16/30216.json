        "...The high childbirth death-rate, mortality among young children from accidents and environmentally caused diseases, boys and girls put into time-wasting and dead-end jobs for want of better education and vocational guidance, able-bodied men unemployed, and the aged drifting hopelessly to death, are the hard facts in many parts of the world today. Capping all this in the needless wastage of human manpower is the frightful toll of war Quoted from a review published in the 'Sun News-Pictorial' Melbourne 14 April 1950."
