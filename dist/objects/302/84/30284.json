        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Ways of seeing\". John Berger, art critic and author explores the ways in which we look at pictures particularly the way paintings are now most frequently seen: reproduced in the form of postcards, books, television and films. Illustrates how the images of art can be manipulated and demonstrates how they can be obscured by the false religiosity and mystification so often surrounding them."
