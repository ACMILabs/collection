        "Canada's role as a world citizen, participating through the Colombo Plan and UNESCO in a program of material aid to underdeveloped countries in Southeast Asia, is examined. In Ceylon, we see the kinds of projects in which Canada's contributions are being used. Canadian educators, doctors, agriculturalists, scientific experts, as well as Canadian-made equipment, are shown in the front lines of the war on want, working with the people of Ceylon to improve the island's economy."
