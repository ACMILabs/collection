        "A train trip in the land of the midnight sun, through more than 500 tunnels. Per Host shows the grandeur of Northern Norway, which until recently very few Norwegians had ever seen. It is a geographical anomaly that here, north of the arctic circle, one can sun-bathe and swim in the fjords amid the towering peaks and plunging ravines."
