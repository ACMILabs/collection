        "The story of water - its numerous values and its potential destructive power unless controlled. This film develops the theme that water is essential to all life; the most valuable water is that which soaks into the ground where it falls as rain or snow. Destructive water is that which is permitted to run off uncontrolled from the ground on which it falls. The disadvantages of a very low rainfall, or a very high rainfall, are demonstrated, and remedial measures which can be applied through the use of soil and water conservation practices are shown."
