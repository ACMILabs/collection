        "Episode of Series \"Advance Australia\". Although our main beaches are well patrolled by lifesavers, it is in the rivers and creeks, where we must rely on ourselves, that many drownings occur. The film shows many ways in which we can help ourselves in an emergency and suggests precautions to take before swimming in unknown places. Commentary by David Low."
