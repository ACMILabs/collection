        "Describes methods for irrigation of lands which receive an irregular rainfall. At the Sydney University Animal Husbandry Farm experiments were carried out on dry pastures and it was found that irrigation dams, supplied by run-off from the farm, made available a plentiful year-round supply of water. Portable sprinkler systems were used to distribute the dam water. Another irrigation system is the Keyline System, the main feature of which is the off-contour ribbing of land so that water is collected where it falls and used when required. Dams along the ribs provide storage for excess water."
