        "In socialist centres, planners are able to evolve and implement their plans unhindered by market prices. Warsaw, which was almost completely destroyed during World War 2, provided an opportunity for the planners to give complete expression to their aims. The film shows how the planners overcame problems of radical transformations of the town, with reconstruction and restoration of the most valuable historical and architectural groupings."
