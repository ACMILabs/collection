        "Migrating waterfowl are filmed as they stop to feed and rest in the marshes near Wheaton, Minnesota. The Franklin gull, gadwall, spoonbill, green and blue winged teal, the diving ducks, blue and lesser snow geese, whistling swans and others are shown on the water and in flight. Feeding habits and identifying field marks are explained. NB: In this film waterfowl are seen as potential targets for sporting shooters and so must be conserved to keep the sport going!"
