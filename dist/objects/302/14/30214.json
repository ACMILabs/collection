        "A new town in a coal mining area, Washington in the United Kingdom was the twenty-first new town to be built in post-war Britain. The third to be built in N.E. England. Reflects on the days of the coal mining towns and the low standard of living. Washington represents a new world of living in modern England surrounded by new motorways - industrial areas separated from residential areas - social and industrial development. Washington is made up of several villages with a proposed town centre to unite the villages. Directed and photographed by David Cox."
