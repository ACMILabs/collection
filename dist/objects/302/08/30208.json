        "In a whimsical twist of an old theme, Warty is vain about his ugliness and feels sorry for animals who are not as ugly. But when the butterfly, together with the turtle, grasshopper and frog save him from the hognose snake, Warty learns that there are things more important than how you look. For primary grades."
