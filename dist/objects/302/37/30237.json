        "In Iraq, a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation team surveys dry desert lands; the Iraq Government builds dams to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates. In Central America, during the six months' dry season, the well that supplies the village of Loa de Ramos in El Salvador dries up. A World Health Organisation team works out plans to use water from a nearby spring."
