        "Slum abolition and housing projects in the university city of Uppsala, Sweden. Compares favourable living conditions in a modern suburb with the slums, and associated child delinquency, in othe parts of the city. Under Government and municipal housing schemes, the city is being reconstructed and individual homes and blocks of apartments built on a tenant ownership system to accommodate white collar workers, students, and labourers. Aspects of the scheme include low rentals, housing subsidies, rebates on yearly rents for each child under sixteen, well planned playgrounds, and hobby-rooms for recreation."
