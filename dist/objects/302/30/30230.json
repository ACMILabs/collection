        "The movement of water is traced through its cycle of eternal change from ocean to sky and back again to the ocean. The relation between evaporation, condensation, saturation, and precipitation is explained. Animation is used to explain how the water table is formed, how water passes through plant bodies and returns to the atmosphere. Direct photography vividly shows the surface run-off from raindrop to ocean, and the function of vegetation and damming in controlling this run-off."
