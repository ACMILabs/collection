        "A little of the history of measurement. Metric is the whimsical story of the ubiquitous metre, It promises to do nice things for us, like wiping out confusion. It even promises to be simple and logical, a luxury we can hardly afford to neglect. Or is the whole film just a pretext for entertainment? In any case, the film comes up with mathematics that are eminently digestible, even to the arithmetically disinclined."
