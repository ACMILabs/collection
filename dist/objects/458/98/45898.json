        "Over time major climatic and geological changes have rocked the earth. Many animals - the best example being the dinosaur, were unable to adapt, and consequently became extinct. Using a combination of animation and live action footage, the horseshoe crab, dragonfly, cockroach, nautilus and scorpion, and the amazing features they have used to stay alive are explored in more detail during their induction into \"The Living Fossils Hall of Fame\". Topics such as extinction, adaptation and animal behaviour are discussed in detail. Includes a brief teacher's guide."
