        "The narrator reflects back on his youth spent with a cousin who suffered from cerebral palsy. The memories evoked supply images of superheroes, liquorice smells, the way he broke a finger of someone who picked on him, and the separation that occurs as the two cousins grow older and further apart. Narrated by William McInnes. This clay animation film forms part of the autobiographical trilogy that includes \"Uncle\", \"Brother\" and \"Cousin\"."
