        "In the northern summer, Inuit (Eskimos) gather together from all over the Arctic Circle. They meet 800 km north of the Arctic Circle to participate in the Northern Games, the traditional games passed on through generations of Inuit. Most of the events are based on the skills and physical endurance so necessary for survival in the Canadian Arctic. Not only do they come to compete in such contests as canoe racing, harpoon throwing and the good woman competition but also to meet friends and relations, to sing, feast and dance the age old drum dances. (Awards: San Antonio; Budapest; Rovaniemi)"
