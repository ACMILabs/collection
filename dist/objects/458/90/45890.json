        "Adapted from the 'Saturday Evening Post' serial of the same name name by Robert Carson, this taut World War II thriller reunites the stars of John Huston's earlier hit,' The Maltese Falcon'. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Leland, a tough, cynical Army officer given a bogus dishonorable discharge and sent undercover to hook up with Japanese sympathisers on the eve of Pearl Harbour. Aboard a freighter bound for the Orient, he plays a ticklish game of matching wits with the enigmatic Dr. Lorenz (Sidney Greenstreet), spiced by the presence of the mysterious and beautiful Alberta Marlow (Mary Astor). Huston made this film the year after making his directorial debut with 'The Maltese Falcon', and like that classic, this film is full of cool and subtle characters, sharp dialogue, and a plot chock full of twists and turns."
