        "An experimental film in which an attempt is made to focus attention on the work of the textile designer. The film consists of five miniature solo ballets, each being based on new patterns for fabrics sketched by the textile designer. No explanatory commentary on the ballet is provided - the story of each ballet is left to the imagination of the audience."
