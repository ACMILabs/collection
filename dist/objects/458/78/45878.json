        "In flashback, Don Domenico recalls his wartime romance with Filumena. He is so enamoured with her that he finances her escape from the bordello where she lives and works, and sets her up as manager of his business. Later, he finds a place for her as his mother's domestic help. Whilst he continues to provide for her, he is not interested in making their union legal, expecting her to act as servant by day and mistress by night. Years later, Filumena lies on her deathbed, and Don Domenico finally consents to marry her, only to find she makes a full recovery immediately after the vows have been taken. He tries to weasel his way out of this fraudulent arrangement, but is mollified by Filumena's insistence that one of her three sons is his. Cast includes Sofia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. It Italian with English subtitles."
