        "This documentary introduces students to a variety of basic facts about meteorology, with emphasis on the causes and effects of cold and warm fronts, the three main types of clouds, the formation of a tornado, and the origins of lightning. Discusses innovations which have improved the accuracy of foretelling the weather, and shows how the weather data compiled at several American schools assist a meteorologist in Washington DC to prepare his television forecasts. Includes a brief teacher's guide."
