        "This documentary tells the story of the Samoan fa'afafines: boys who are raised as girls and play an important domestic role in traditional Samoan culture. The film explores the traditional role of the fa'afafines, the anthropological records of this phenomenon and the impact of the westernization of Samoa, particularly the threat posed by the infiltration of the Western 'drag' scene. Through interviews with fa'afafines, Samoan elders, academics, anthropologists and other western inhabitants of Samoa, the film explores and contrasts differing cultural constructions of gender and sexual identity and society."
