        "This was Antonioni's return to filmmaking after suffering a stroke in 1985. He presents 4 vignettes linked thematically by notions of desire, as well as a fictional director in search of a story (portrayed by John Malkovich). In the first story two beautiful lovers, Silvano and Carmen (Kim Rossi Stuart and Ines Sastre) are unable to consummate their love because of his pursuit of perfection. In the second story John Malkovich's character meets a woman (Sophie Marceau) who confesses to killing her father. The third story involves a man (Peter Weller) who must decide between his wife (Fanny Ardant) and his lover (Chiara Caselli). In the final story a man (Vincent Perez) becomes obsessed with a woman (Irene Jacob) who is \"satisfied\" with life and is about to enter a convent. Screen legends Jeanne Moreau and Marcello Mastroianni make a brief appearance and have an overall involvement to the story rather than being directly involved with any of the vignettes. In French, Italian and English with English subtitles. Co-directed by Wim Wenders."
