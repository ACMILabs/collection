        "Episode of Series \"Totally Gross Anatomy\". Unlike the sense of touch which covers the whole body, the senses in your head - sight, hearing, smell, and taste - cover only a small territory and respond only to specific stimuli. That's why they are called the special senses. Using animation, graphic diagrams, and easy-to-understand demonstrations, the video reviews the four special senses and shows some of the many ways in which they enable us to learn about our world. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's Guide included."
