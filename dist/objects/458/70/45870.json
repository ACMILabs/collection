        "This video begins with a look at the discoveries of Benjamin Franklin and other early inventors who investigated electricity. Students also learn how Edison and his team relied on the basic principles of electricity in their quest to create a practical incandescent light. The video introduces the concepts of current, conductivity, circuits and magnetism. It also looks at modern electric power systems and how they are based on many of Edison's ideas. Narrated by Gene Galusha."
