        "This video tells the tragic story of West Papua through the eyes of Arie Van Klinken : a Dutch patrol officer in the 50s and 60s ; William Zongannau: a prominent West Papuan politician in the 1960s ; and Hugh Lunn: the only living journalist who witnessed the farcical 'Act of Free Choice\" for West Papua in 1969. Through access to secret documents, the film uncovers how Australia colluded with Indonesia to keep the so called \"Act of Free Choice\" a secret from the outside world. Contains Dutch home movies, newsreel footage and previously unseen film coverage of the \"Act of Free Choice\". Music by David Bridie and Arthur Lyman."
