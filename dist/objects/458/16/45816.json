        "Six Vancouver policemen have formed the Odd Squad - a team of officers dedicated to capturing the thoughts and feelings of drug addicts in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside as a means of preventing drug use by young people. They initially began with a camera that captured vignettes with an anti drug message, then moved onto a movie camera so that addicts could tell a story in their own words. Most of the addicts are willing to take part in the anti drug war in the only way they can - by courageously using themselves as examples. Through the process the Odd Squad develop tenuous relationships with the addicts and discover that the people they meet had lives prior to their addiction. This powerful educational tool contains coarse language and graphic scenes. Preview is recommended."
