        "Marty (a concerned student) and Rick (a detective) search for an answer to the plight of vanishing wildlife, investigating the causes of extinction. They focus on five endangered animals in an attempt to discover why they are in danger of becoming extinct. The species covered and the identified reasons for being endangered include: African black rhinoceros (illegal animal trade), Orangutans (habitat destruction), Peregrine falcons (pesticides), Manatees (human activity), and American burying beetles (unknown). The video deals with the issue that it is important to find out about the plight of animals and to help if possible - the more people who help restore habitats, raise money and increase awareness, the easier it will be to save endangered species. The goal is to save animals from extinction by finding a balance between human needs and the needs of all animals. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's Guide included."
