        "'The Ten Commandments' according to Kieslowski are ten 55 minute dramas made as a television series (although two were also released in longer form as theatrical features), set in and around a Warsaw housing estate. Together they constitute something like an analysis of the shortcomings of contemporary Polish society, although the individual dilemmas are quite universal. The moral imperatives of the Commandments are tempered by an underlying sympathy for the characters. Parts 1-5 include: I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt have no other God but me (53 min.)--Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain (57 min.)--Honour the Sabbath Day (55 min.)-- Honour thy father and mother (55 min.)--Thou shalt not kill (57 min.) Scripted by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz."
