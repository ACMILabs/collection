        "Introduce your children to the gentle art of yoga with this colourful and enjoyable video, filmed on the beach and in the Australian rainforest. With the use of poetry, playful illustrations and the help of seven children, yoga teacher Rachel Zinman demonstrates 18 Australian animal postures to show how easy and how much fun yoga can be. This exercise program is presented in two sections of approximately 15 minutes each, so that it can be broken into smaller parts for practice in the home. It is designed for children aged 5-12 and parents should take care to adhere to the cautionary warnings at the beginning of the tape."
