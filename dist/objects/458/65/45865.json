        "An episode from the series: \"The Terrific adventures of the terrible ten\". One of the boy's of Ten Town falls ill and is taken to Ten town hospital. The boy hero of the story discovers dead fish in the dam and figures out that the aerial spraying from a crop duster is poisoning life in the area. He runs to tell the adults - there is no one in the police station - and the council water engineer won't listen, so the hero goes and shuts down the town water supply to prevent poisoning.
