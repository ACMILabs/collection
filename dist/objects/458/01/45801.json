        "In 1975, as a Bicentennial special, one thousand American history buffs put on period uniforms and re-enacted the 1775 march of General Benedict Arnold's troops into Quebec. This short film takes a page of our history which has, perhaps, not yet been completely written. Voice and narration by Griffith Brewer."
