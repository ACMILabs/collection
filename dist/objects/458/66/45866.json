        "Asia is the largest of earth's seven continents. Extending over 44 million square kilometres, it dominates the landmass it shares with Europe. Of the world's four oceans, three - the Arctic, the Pacific and the Indian - border Asia, while the fourth - the Atlantic - is connected to it by the Mediterranean Sea. This video takes viewers on a journey from the deserts that sweep through southwest Asia, across the center of the continent to the mountain chains that dominate central and southern Asia, from the frozen tundra north of the Arctic circle south through the taiga, the largest expanse of coniferous forest in the world, onto the grasslands of central Asia. Also examines the peninsulas and islands of monsoonal southeast Asia. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's Guide included."
