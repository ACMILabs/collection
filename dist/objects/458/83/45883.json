        "Nights of Cabiria is Fellini's bitter-sweet account of a resilient Roman prostitute desperate to find love and respect in marriage. Cabiria, played by Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina, is the prostitute with a heart of gold who is in love with love. Endlessly searching for true love, Cabiria is continually disappointed by men - abused, deceived and betrayed - but she never loses hope. In Italian with English subtitles."
