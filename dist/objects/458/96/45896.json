        "Episode of Series \"Geokids\". This animated and puppet adventure is designed to teach young children about one of nature's greatest magic tricks - metamorphosis. When Sunny the Australian honey possum finds a weird looking pod hanging from a branch, Uncle Balzac de Chameleon explains it is a pupae, a sort of sleeping-bag where a caterpillar becomes a butterfly through metamorphosis. Curiosity leads Sunny and Bobby, the African bush baby, in search of other big-change artists such as frogs, mosquitoes, dragonflies, and more. Suitable for pre-school aged children."
