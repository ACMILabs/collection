        "How Darryl Kerrigan, average working joe, and his small time suburban lawyer mate, Denis Denuto ended up in the High Court of Australia is the story told in 'The Castle'. The Kerrigan family live at 3 Highview Crescent, Cooloroo, on the edge of an international airport, in total obscurity. That is until the consortium owning the airport decide to expand and the land surrounding the airport is to be compulsorily acquired from the residents. What the powers-that-be did not count on was the dogged determination of Darryl Kerrigan, greyhound racer, tow-truck driver with a keen eye for a bargain, to whom his house is his family' home and a very happy one at that. Ordinary family."
