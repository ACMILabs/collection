        "This film examines the variety and complexity of the natural landscapes of the European continent. Europe displays a surprising wealth of wildlife and natural beauty despite its small size, high population density, and intense industrialization. Students will observe Europe's long, irregular coastline, from Norway's fjords to the Black Sea. They will travel to some to some of Europe's many peninsulas and islands and appreciate the continent's close links with the sea. They will learn about the effects of the sea on climate and natural vegetation. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's Guide included."
