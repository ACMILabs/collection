        "This film shows how the mental health volunteer fits into the treatment of mental illness. It shows that patients in a mental hospital respond more quickly to treatment if kept in touch with the outside world. A film of importance to mature men and women who may wish to offer their services as volunteers. (Award: Columbus)"
