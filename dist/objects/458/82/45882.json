        "Director Ettore Scola focuses on a large dysfunctional family living in a shanty town on the outskirts of Rome. The stingy patriarch, Giacinto, is personally wealthy but morally bankrupt, and his repulsive view of life trickles down to every member of his clan. Not content with corrupting his own flesh and blood, Giacinto spreads his philosophy throughout the entire village, where he functions as slumlord. Although the surroundings and characters exist at the lowest level of society, their misery is very funny at times, imbued with enormous energy in a daily fight to maintain their survival. In Italian with English subtitles. Cast includes Nino Manfredi, Maria Bosco and Giselda Castrini."
