        "The adventures of Anna and Tom, a pair of newly-weds who are unpacking their wedding presents and thinking about furnishing their new flat. The couple each make a wish, and two angels appear: one named \"Design\" and the other named \"Arty\". Arty introduces the couple to showy art-deco style furnishings but Anna and Tom's common sense wins over and they choose Design's well-made and practical \"style\". This film offers the viewer three questions: Does it work? Is it well-made? Is it attractive? Hmmm."
