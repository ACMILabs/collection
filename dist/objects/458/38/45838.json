        "The Newmarket Citizens Band, one of Ontario's best, has been playing the rousing marches of John Philip Sousa for over one hundred years. While other small-town bands may be fading, the Newmarket band is still going strong. To this film's toe-tapping rhythms you learn the reasons why. (Award: Montreal.)"
