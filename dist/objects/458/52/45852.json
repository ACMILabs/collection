        "An account of the work of Scottish Fisheries Research to determine the causes of reduced fish catches in the North Sea. Sampling the sea-water and plankton at various depths, tagging fish, calculating the age of fish from their scale-ring, discovering the causes for the premature destruction of young fish - these are aspects of the research work which will prove of great importance to the fishermen of Scotland."
