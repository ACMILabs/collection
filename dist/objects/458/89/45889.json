        "'The Ten Commandments' according to Kieslowski are ten 55 minute dramas made as a television series (although two were also released in longer form as theatrical features), set in and around a Warsaw housing estate. Together they constitute something like an analysis of the shortcomings of contemporary Polish society, although the individual dilemmas are quite universal. The moral imperatives of the Commandments are tempered by an underlying sympathy for the characters. Parts 6-10 include: Thou shalt not commit adultery (58 min.)-- Thou shalt not steal (55 min.)--Thou shalt not bear false witness (54 min.)-- Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife (58 min.)--Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's goods (57 min.). Scripted by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz."
