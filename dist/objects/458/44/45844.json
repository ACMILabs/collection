        "A driving safety film profiling the character Hal Johnston, a safety conscious family man, an average American, a careful and considerate person - but a complete monster behind the wheel. Hal eventually befalls a bitter end and the narrative steers into sequences of more sorroful driving, a pretty girl with a big facial scar and a young couple with missing limbs. This film received an award from the National Committee on Films for Safety and was estimated that over 15 million people saw this film in the first year of its release. Prosaically narrated by Lowell Thomas."
