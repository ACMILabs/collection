        "All over the earth animals undertake incredible journeys called migrations - over land, through air, and in the water. Animals migrate to find food, to escape seasonal changes in weather, and to breed. This video follows several species on their migratory paths, including gray whales, zooplankton, Mexican free-tailed bats and wildebeest. Whatever the reason, however long or short the journey, migration is one of the most fascinating animal behaviours. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's Guide included."
