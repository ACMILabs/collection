        "Balancing moments of strong emotional impact with cool-headed logic, this documentary explores the phenomenon of faith healing. Scenes of Kathryn Kuhlman's dramatic performance before 25 000 people at the Ottawa Civic Centre are balanced by interviews with articulate doctors and scientists who argue both sides of the \"healing\" issue. (Award: Columbus.)"
