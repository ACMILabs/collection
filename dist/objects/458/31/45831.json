        "Episode of Series \"March of Time\". Yesterday's education in the United States was typified by the proverbial Little Red School House and today's (1947) emphasis is upon the scientific principles of psychology - but all good teachers know that their methods are as individualistic and personal as any other artist's; all realise the importance of developing in their pupils the ability to think as well as a knowledge of the facts. The film presents the pros and cons of \"progressive education\" and points out to the American citizen their responsibility for the quality of the education the community provides for its young."
