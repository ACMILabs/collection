        "Made to show the work involved in producing the half a pint of milk issued each day to all Tasmanian school children under the free milk scheme. The film shows those parts of Tasmania most suited to dairy farming, the yearly round of work on a typical dairy farm, the breeding of dairy cattle and the pasteurisation and bottling of the finished product at the milk factory."
