        "On his income as an independent woodcutter, Bill Mosher of Charlotte County, New Brunswick, was able to bring up a family of five sons. Some of them have chosen to earn their living in the same way, but they are having a difficult time competing with the large pulp and paper corporations they supply. Today, corporate forestry controls the market. This film describes the situation in New Brunswick, and the steps that are being taken by the independent wood producers to counteract the power of the eleven companies that control the pulp and paper industry."
