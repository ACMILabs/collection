        "The concluding chapter of Kevin Smith's New Jersey Trilogy, \"Chasing Amy\" is a comedy about Holden, a successful comic-book creator, whose life takes a turn when he falls madly in love with Alyssa, a fellow artist. The first major shock awaiting Holden is Alyssa's apparent lesbian orientation. The second one comes after the two develop a strong friendship, and Alyssa decides not to limit her chances of love to women only. The two begin an affair, despite Holden's nagging doubts about her promiscuous past. Cast includes Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Jason Lee, Dwight Ewell, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith."
