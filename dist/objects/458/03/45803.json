        "For five or six months at a time Frank Ladouceur lives alone, trapping muskrat in the vast, desolate wilderness of northern Alberta. His family last visited him there some fourteen years ago, and Frank's own visits to the family home in Fort Chipewyan are few and far between. This is the story of an independent Metis who is remarkably determined and self-sufficient, and who is ceaselessly called to return to the bush."
