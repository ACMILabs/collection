        "Rats are the destroyers of millions of dollars worth of food each year, as well as carriers of dangerous diseases against which scientists war constantly. The city dump, breeding and feeding ground from which the rats spread through towns and villages, must be replaced with modern garbage disposal techniques. The rat-proofing of cellars and storage buildings must be done with intelligence and common sense to match rat strength and cunning. Only by depriving them of food and shelter can man eliminate these filthy disease-carriers."
