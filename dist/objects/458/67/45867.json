        "Africa - the second largest continent - lies almost entirely within the tropics. It is the only continent found in all four hemispheres, divided by both the Prime Meridian - which separates the eastern and Western Hemispheres, and the Equator - which separates the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. North and south of the Equator, Africa's symmetrical pattern of landscapes and climates is apparent : there are tropical forests, savannas, semi-deserts, deserts and mountains. Africa has numerous waterfalls, such as Victoria Falls, the longest river in the world - the Nile, and the world's largest desert - the Sahara. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students. Teacher's Guide included."
