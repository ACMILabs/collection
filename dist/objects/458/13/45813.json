        "A working woman arrives home to the apartment she shares with her mother to discover that the cat has been locked inside - again. It is a stark reminder of her mundane existence, and to make matters worse, sausages are on the menu again. As she cooks up the bangers she lets out all of her frustration. Cast includes Cate Blanchett and Lynette Curran as the mother and daughter."
