        "Through the narration, we recall events in the lives of two young brothers growing up in the suburbs. We learn about \"getting the blame\" for things you didn't do, and that if the devil doesn't get you then karma will. Above all we see how two brothers deal with an alcoholic father, disease and asthma. Narrated by William McInnes. This clay animation film forms part of the autobiographical trilogy that includes \"Uncle\", \"Brother\" and \"Cousin\"."
