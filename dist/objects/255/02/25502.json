        "The story of how Local 100, an affiliate of a national union, was formed. The sudden dismissal of an employee makes the others realise their lack of job security, and discussion of this problem leads to the suggestion that they organise a trade union. The film relates the steps that followed - the approach to the national union, the assistance given by an organiser from union headquarters, and the signing up of the workers which resulted in Local 100 being declared the legal bargaining authority. We see, too, how collective bargaining was carried on to obtain a contract providing job security and improved conditions. The democratic procedure followed throughout proves the contention that free trade unionism is one of the strongest pillars of democracy."
