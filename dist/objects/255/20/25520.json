        "Photographed at the Australian Antarctic Research Station, Macquarie Island, the film shows the bird and sea elephant life of the island. The black browed albatross with its nine feet wing span, the royal penguin, the rock hopper penguin and the gentoo all came there in the spring to nest and rear their chicks. Sea elephants also come there to have their pups and to grow new coats. Photography: George Lowe"
