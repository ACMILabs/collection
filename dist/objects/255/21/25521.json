        "Dramatized story of a young woman's journey out of the dark hours of emotional disturbance. Shows the process of psychiatric treatment candidly and completely. Caroline Cram, after a suicide attempt, seeks help from psychiatry, and learns to recognise the relationship between her past experiences and present problems. To show, for contrast, a healthy childhood environment, the Dunn family is seen at a picnic. The parents curb and soften their children's demands and rivalries, and build their emotional strength. Narrator: Frank Silvera"
