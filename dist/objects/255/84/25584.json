        "Louisiana Story is an enchanting record of the infatuation of a French Cajun boy with the wild landscape of the forest marshes of South Louisiana. With his pet racoon, he hunts, fishes and explores the quiet waterways and larger rivers. When a bulldozer crashes through the reeds he is fascinated by it and goes on to find a floating oil derrick anchored in mid stream with a tower a hundred feet high and a deep plunge into the river bed. The tempo of industrialism is heard as the drill of the oil searches is driven into the depth of the earth. The whole story of the boy's activities is shown as an enchantment and delightfully portrayed. Photographed by Richard Leacock. Music by Virgil Thompson. Edited by Helen van Dongen."
