        "One of the most practical and productive of innovations in educational visual aids was the 8mm single-concept film loop contained in a cassette inserted into a projector simple enough for a young child to operate. This film tells how a series of such loops for people with learning disabilities were developed with the advice of psychologists, and shows situations in which they can be usefully employed."
