        "A re-creation of a legend of the Indians of British Colombia, using carved ceremonial masks of the Indians and animated drawings. The loon is a North American water bird. The story tells of Kelora, a blind medicine man. During a hard winter, his village suffers from famine, and is attacked by hungry wolves. Using his magic bow, Kelora is able to kill the wolves. In Spring, Kelora seeks out the loon, his \"father\", and the loon gives him the power to see. In gratitude Kelora takes his most precious possession, a bead necklace, and throws it round the loon's neck. That is how the loon came to get his collar of bright feathers."
