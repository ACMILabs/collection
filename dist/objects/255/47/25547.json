        "A film on venereal disease. Set largely in a public health clinic, information is presented informally by a physician and a public health investigator. Animation is used to present facts, while discussion by a group of young people presents attitudes to help dispel the sense of shame. Subjects emphasised are ease of treatment, symptoms, spread of the disease, the reasons for identifying contacts, and modes of prevention."
