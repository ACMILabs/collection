        "The story of a typical local newspaper - an actual one, the Newbury Weekly News - and of the market town community it serves. Mr Hugh Turner, the editor, a familiar figure in the town, directs the paper, as his father did before him, independently of any big financial group and without fear or favour. The weekly newspaper, local in ownership and range of interests, goes out to be read eagerly and talked over throughout the whole community."
