        "Made to encourage people to visit museums and to show how to mkae the best use of such visits. The film studies critically three pieces of sculpture in the Victoria and Albert Museum; a Madonna and child carved in whalebone by an early Anglo-Saxon, carved in wood by Veit Stoss and in terra-cotta by Rosellino. The film comments on the general characteristics of art in the Romanesque, Gothic and early Renaissance pieces respectively. Commentary by Michael Redgrave."
