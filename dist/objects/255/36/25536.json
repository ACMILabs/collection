        "The life and religious ceremonies of the Longhouse people - Iriquois Indians who adhere to the old religion. We see how the Iroquois of today, although fully adapted to the ways of the white people, still maintain a link with their proud past through observance of the customs and beliefs of their forefathers. Highlights of the film show an outdoor dance in supplication for rain, a healing ceremony performed by men of the False-Face Society and a dance in celebration of a newly chosen chief."
