        "A story from rural Canada, showing how 16 mm. documentary films have been applied to improvement of conditions in the community. Commences with the annual meeting of the film council - the voluntary organisation which fosters the use of films in the programs of local groups. Explains how the film council was formed following a diphtheria epidemic which the local doctor blamed on ignorance and inertia. Excerpts from the life of the community illustrate some of the many ways in which the use of films contributed to the welfare of the community and to the enlightenment of its citizens."
