        "Episode of Series \"Vassar studies: studies of normal personality development\". Presents the social growth of the six, seven and eight year old child. They move into a bigger world, seeking the support of their own age group, through which traditional activities, games, magic and customs are handed down. At school, they learn not only the three R's but something of human relationships. These children are marked by outgoing interest in the world around them, a powerful drive to acquire both skill and knowledge and the characteristic cleavage of the sexes in these early school years."
