        "The design of London Transport's trains and vehicles, buildings, equipment and furniture reveals a style which is characteristic of the whole undertaking, and which this film shows dates from 1916, when Frank Pick commissioned a new type face for use in London Transport's public notices. Since then, and not least in its printing and posters, London Transport has sought to maintain a high standard of good looks throughout the field in which it operates."
