        "Some of the 2,000 animals on the Hollywood film set of 'Dr Doolittle' illustrate the importance of animal classification. While showing the difference between birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals, the film introduces Flower-Face, the trained hippo; a giraffe that can be ridden; a chimp that smiles on command; along with unusual reptiles and birds."
