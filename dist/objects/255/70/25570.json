        "An experimental film in which percussive rhythm is integrated with simple geometric abstractions, both visuals and sound being created by the artist, Norman McLaren. Visuals and sounds are drawn by hand directly on raw film with ordinary pen and ink. Neither camera nor sound recording equipment has been used in the making of this film."
