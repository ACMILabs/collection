        "A picture of life in London. Follows the course of a typical day: arrival of early-morning fruit and vegetables at Covent Garden; invasion of the City by a million workers from the suburbs; the parks of London, havens for office workers during lungh-time; diversity of shops and busy streets; the zoo; Crown Jewels in the Tower. After dark, the cry of \"Time, gentlemen, please!\" in the public hotels brings the day to a close."
