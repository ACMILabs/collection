        "A documentary about Melbourne's Underground Rail Loop, its effect on the entire metropolitan railway system, and on the future of public transport in Melbourne. Shows the route the loop tracks and tunnels will follow around the city, the sites for the three new underground stations to supplement the present two stations, how passengers will travel from suburban stations when the loop is operating, how the loop is being constructed, and the benefits for train travellers of having five city stations close to shops, theatres and offices. Photographed by Volk Mol, sound by Don Boardman, edited by Geoff Wright, narrated by Michael Pate. Produced for the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop Authority."
