        "A young dance and movement therapist, Janet Adler, presents and illustrates her belief that movement awareness is essential for children, and at times may substitute as a means of communication where normal methods fail or are not possible. Working with body awareness produces new experiences and emotions which eventually lead to a basis for verbal communication."
