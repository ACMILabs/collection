        "This ingenious cut out animation is the chase film to end all chase films. Borrowing images and characters from various Hollywood classics, 'Fast film' then distorts and twists our understanding of where these icons of Hollywood folklore belong. Ultimately mutating into a new narrative where the suave Cary Grant and Frankenstein's monster happily co-exist side by side."
