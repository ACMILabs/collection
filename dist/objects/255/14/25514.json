        "From London a vast national railway system radiates: at the railway terminus in London, 1,704 trains enter and leave the station every day. Millions of urban workers depend entirely on the railway system for their daily transport to and from central London, and, in addition, there are many expresses and goods trains which span the length and breadth of Great Britain. Music composed by Horace Somerville, played by London Symphony Orchestra under Muir Mathieson."
