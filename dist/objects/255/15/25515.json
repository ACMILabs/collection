        "By use of timelapse photography, this film gives an impression of travel by train at approximately the speed of sound. Photographed at two frames per second (instead of the normal twenty four) from the train driver's cabin, every foot of the rail track is seen. Whereas the journey from London to Brighton takes an hour at an average speed of 65 miles per hour, this unusual journey takes four minutes at an average speed of 800 miles per hour."
