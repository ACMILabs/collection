        "Episode of Series \"Young Children in Brief Separation\". Lucy, 21 months and in foster care for 19 days, is too young to carry a clear image of the absent mother and readily accepts her foster mother's care. The film shows in dramatic fashion the conflict of emotions that Lucy experiences when required to leave her foster mother's care even though she is happy to return to her natural mother."
