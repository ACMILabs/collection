        "'Loony Tom' is a mixture of \"plein-air\" ballet and the old silent slapstick comedies - with the sole exception that here the hero is so devoted to his single-minded pursuit of the eternal feminine that he has no time for the violent \"gags\" that liberally puntuated the Sennet pictures. This film will be relished as a pure comedy, but those who are familiar with James Broughton's other works will quickly perceive its poetic overtones and philosophic implications. Kermit Sheets mimes the title role; Ralph Gilbert composed and plays the piano accompaniment."
