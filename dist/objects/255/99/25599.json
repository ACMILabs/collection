        "Episode of Series \"Earth and it's peoples\". A survey of the lumbering industry of the North Western States of USA. Draws attention to the careful planning necessary for the best use of the forests; seed blocks and logging areas must be organised and new forests started to maintain the timber crop; also timber felling must be regulated to prevent waste and destruction. Describes how other natural resources add to the productivity of these states."
