        "The work of L.S. Lowry, a Manchester-born artist, who has lived and worked in that area all his life. He has been described as an English 'primitive', but he is first and foremost a painter closely related to the world he knows. Shows many examples of his painting and reveals much of the artist's personality and his relationship to his work."
