        "For over a thousand years the Maya civilisation grew and flourished in the rain forests of Central America until it was discovered and destroyed by the Spanish conquistadores. Eric Thompson, well-known authority on the Maya, describes the struggle to comprehend the vanished civilisation, and the fight to preserve its treasures for posterity. Sites featured are Tikal, Palenque, Yaxchilan, Copan, Quirigua, Chichen Itza, Uxmal and Tulum."
