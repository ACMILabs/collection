        "Was has left its mark on Korea. Three million refugees joined the ranks of the homeless and hungry and the countryside was maimed and scarred. This film tells of Kim Tai Yung, a farmer from North Korea and one of those refugees who made their way to the South and freedom in 1951. As a background to Kim's gradual progress the task of United Nations rehabilitation and reconstruction is seen to take shape and move into action."
