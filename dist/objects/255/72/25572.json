        "Presents the story from the book \"The Lorax\" by Dr. Seuss. A fanciful tale with a serious theme: clean up the environment before it's too late. In this delightful story the student is introduced to the needs of everyman. And the Lorax? Who is he and what does he do? Only Dr. Seuss can describe the creature - which he does with typical Seussian logic."
