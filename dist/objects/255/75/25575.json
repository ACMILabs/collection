        "An introduction to Indian Cclassical dancing, showing four types of dance which have been part of Indian culture for centuries. Indian classical dancing is a vital part of Indian mythology and religion, tracing its origins to religious rituals and performed as a form of worship. Indian dancing has its own grammar, the language of the dance having been developed to a point where every movement of the dancer's body is eloquently expressive. As in European ballet, dancers begin their training as children, and dancing becomes their life. The first dancer introduced in this film is Ram Gopal, one of the most famous Indian dancers. The dance he performs illustrates the manner in which various highly stylised movements, known as dance phrases, express what might be put into words to form a phrase; it is from such a movement that the film takes it name; the dance performed by Ram Gopal is in the tradition of south-eastern India. The second dance, performed by Shevanti, is typical of the dances of the north-east of India. It doesn't tell a story, as Gopal's dance does, but simply invokes and expresses a mood. The third dance by Rajeshwar is an example of the Kathakali or dance-drama of southern India and tells the story of bees and the lotus flower, entirely in terms of movement of his face and hands. All these dances form part of Hindu culture. The fourth dance by Chandupanikar has been preserved under Muslim influence in the north-west of India. The final dance is created from the movements of traditional classical dancing. Photographed by Keki Mistri. Commentary by Sarah Erulkar."
