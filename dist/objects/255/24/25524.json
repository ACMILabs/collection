        "Thornton Wilder's play is perhaps more of a saga than a story. It traces ninety years in the history of one family through a series of Christmas dinners. All action takes place around the dining room table, laden with imaginary food and drink. The portals to right and left, through which the characters pass, represent birth and death."
