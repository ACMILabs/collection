        "Multi-Emmy Award winning series which brilliantly portrays the everyday lives of a New Jersey crime family. Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), though ostensibly in the Waste Management business is really one of the heads of a large Mafia family. With a consistently brilliant cast, tough and witty writing and a complex examination of materialism and contemporary American society, \"The Sopranos\" manages to create an ambiguous moral epic out of its study of power, corruption and money. Violent and uncompromising, the series delivers a narrative sweep that has the breadth of the classical nineteenth century novel but its language, vision and cynicism plants it firmly in the twenty-first. Created by David Chase and featuring direction by noted independent directors such as Nick Gomez, \"The Sopranos\" deserves the acclaim heaped upon it. In its moral complexity, insight and daring it leaves the products of the Hollywood motion picture industry for dead."
