        "Narjiic's passion for music and dance began in Year 10 when he was asked to perform for NAIDOC Week. From there he joined various dance groups performing all over Victoria including his home town Echuca, finally enrolling  at Swinburne. Today he blends a fusion of traditional dance with hip-hop as a way of expressing his thoughts and emotions. Dance has become a part of his life. Music by Fonetik."
