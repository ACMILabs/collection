        "A sensitive and warmly told story by Heather Ellis, mother and wife, diagnosed HIV positive in 1997 upon returning to Australia from a trip to Africa. Heather's greatest fear is the stigma which may be attached to her son Ethan who is HIV negative but yet she feels privileged that medication is available in Australia for recovery and prevention of positive babies being born. In Africa they do not have this privilege."
