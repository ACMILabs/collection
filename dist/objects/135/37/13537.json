        "\"Bad day\" recollections by students from Carlton Primary School"
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Twelve students from Grade 6 at Carlton Primary School create their own individual story about a \"bad day\" from their own perspective. Some examples of the stories include getting chased by snarling dogs in the park, falling over and ruining a new pair of jeans, losing a kid sister at the shops and getting lost in Safeways. The children involved in making this collection of one-minute works were mostly refugee children who live on an inner Melbourne housing estate and speak English as a second language. \"Twelve tuff tales\" was created as a school-based multimedia production and funded by an Arts and Culture grant from the City of Melbourne. It was produced at Artplay: the centre for contemporary arts for children. The stories include: 1.  Bandaids by Abir Musa 2.  The Horrible day by Dunya Ahmen 3.  Bullies at the park by Hashem Alhassan 4.  Lost by Hodan Yusuf 5.  Feeding the fishes by JD Bautista 6.  Blown away by Meriam Abubeker 7.  Untitled - no credits 8.  Two big dogs with sharp teeth by Mustafa Housain 9.  Untitled - no credits 10. The Shower by Sadam Ahmed 11. Grounded by Thao Le 12. Lost in High Point by Shukri Ismail"
