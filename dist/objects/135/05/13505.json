        "Hannan Kuea reminisces about her childhood and life in Sudan and especially her wedding day - this very special day to be the last of the families getting together in Sudan before the married couple move on to Kenya and finally to Australia. On this wedding day the families (one side from North Sudan, the other from South Sudan) danced their traditional tribal dances in celebration. It would be many years later before the families reunite to dance once again in their new land on the other side of the world."
