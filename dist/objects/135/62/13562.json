        "A psychosexual drama which launches the viewer into the inner-space of the male psyche in order to depict the way the modern male constructs sex. The film excites and disturbs the viewer with the use of a split screen, which allows for the pitching of two images against each other in order to create a sense of both excitement and voyeuristic curiosity. Cast includes David Wenham, Amy Pedersen and Jared Turner"
