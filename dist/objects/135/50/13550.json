Within this framework a broad range of material is presented, from profiles of the day-to-day workings of community organizations to documentaries and political animation. Plug-in presents material on indigenous rights and reconciliation, migrant issues, environment, education, health, culture, arts and dissent. In 2005 Plug In TV won 2 Antenna Awards (Australian Community Television Awards) for best editing, and best sound and was nominated for best show of the year."
