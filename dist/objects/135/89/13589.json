        "When a strange batch of unlabelled records start arriving in record shops, customers are drawn irresistably to them. But when played, they cause weird dreams which turn the dreamers into zombies. What are these records?  Are they the work of alien beings from another planet, using dreams to manipulate mankind?  What is the true story? A reporter examines this unusual situation."
