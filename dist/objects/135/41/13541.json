    "description": [
        "Based on an abridged version of the well-known story of \"The Happy prince\" by Irish writer Oscar Wilde. It tells of the efforts of a statue, the Happy Prince, to bring relief from poverty to the people in his town with the assistance of a dedicated swallow. This digital video was made with a class of grade 6 students in a small village school in Dromohaire, County Leitrim, Ireland in late 2003-2004, and directed and edited by Michael Buckley. Sue McCauley was creative producer. The production combined fine art practices and theatrical improvisation with digital media. The whole work was shot in the classroom at the school with backgrounds and animation added through compositing technique to create a visual richness through multi-layering of the imagery. The vision for the project was to make a work for an audience of children, primarily by children using a theatrical, ensemble, improvisational technique. Funded by the Australian Council for the Arts."
