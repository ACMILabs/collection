        "The Australian performing arts makes its debut on the interactive stage with this vibrant CD ROM. Embark on an exciting tour of the theatre, visiting the various studios to construct a costume, create a script, or design and direct your own show. As you explore backstage you will discover a wealth of information on Australia's entertainment industry. Take a tour on stage with a stage manager, or hang out in the Green Room with the artists and discover the range of performing arts companies. This CD ROM was made possible through a collaboration between NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art), the University of Wollongong, The Australian Ballet, Opera Australia, and the Sydney Opera House. Easy to install, nice graphics and good sound. Comes with an instruction sheet to assist with navigation."
