        "A visually beautiful film about the pain, fear and courage of the 19th century novelist Fanny Burney, who had her right breast removed without anaesthetic in 1811. It is based on a letter Fanny wrote to her sister some months later. Cast includes Skye Wansey as Fanny Burney and Rachel Blake as the voice of Fanny Burney. The original letter now resides in the New York Public Library."
