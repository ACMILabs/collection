        "As the country's most famous and prolific fast food company, Crispy Aussie Chook (CAC) maintains the highest quality standards that its customers deserve. Unfortunately, their customers don't realise that they deserve tainted, genetically modified, and altogether non-chicken material in their \"Fun Fried Fancy\" packs. As part of their new marketing strategy, CAC is seeking a mascot that epitomises the essence of their company: country fresh, with just a 'touch' of enhancement. One willing dupe has come forth, little realising just what is in store. The thing is, neither does CAC. Their latest money-saver in using barmy British bovine in their \"Cheeky Chook Chunks\" is about to hit a small, but very effective bump in the road. Witty animated cartoon produced as a possible series pilot. Animators - Adam parton, Kelly Lynagh, JC Reyes, Ann-Marie Denham, Adam Duncan. Music - Jaedyn Conley."
