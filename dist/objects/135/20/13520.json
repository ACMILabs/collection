        "The allegedly true story of Darwin Edward Cole, a serial killer on death row, who claims to have deflected Tesla\u2019s Comet from its intersection with the earth\u2019s orbit, thereby saving the world from certain destruction.  He also claims to have returned with a new virus that only kills \u201cdeviants\u201d, thus ridding the world of another plague. He confesses to the murders and insists that he is sane, refusing all attempts to have himself declared unfit to plead."
