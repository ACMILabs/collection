    "description": [
        "\"Hairy tales\" is a group-devised story made by children about a group of children who get lost in the Australian bush and who are finally rescued by a magical emu that shows them the way home. The work was commissioned and made by a group of children who attended a filmmaking and drama workshop over three weekends at the Artplay Centre in Melbourne - a new children's contemporary art centre established by the City of Melbourne. The children developed the narrative using theatrical improvisation techniques taught in the workshop. The visuals were created by compositing live action and animation using a \"black screen\" technique providing opportunities for either drawn or filmed backgrounds that were added in post-production. The children participating in the workshops created all the content for the film. The film was directed and edited by multimedia artist Michael Buckley and produced for Artplay by creative producer, Sue McCauley."
