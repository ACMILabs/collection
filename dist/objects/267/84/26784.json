Some of the many subjects covered include comparative shopping, home ownership vs renting, baking low cost bread, repairing old furniture, credit and money management, family relations, operating a child care centre on campus, and other pertinent studies. Student response is evident in lively group discussions and in scenes filmed in the actual classroom."
