        "An advertising film with a difference: Into a strange computerised future where women \"run things\" by controlling huge colourful computers that go bleep booble bob bob ping etc, comes Yockoo, the boy from the bush, with his satchel of dried fruits. Slowly the women overcome their cold, futuristic ways in light of Yockoo's size, shape and overall manliness. Eventually they unearth their deep feminine sexuality and cook Yockoo a feast of dried fruit dishes using cooking utensils from their local museum. Music by Frank Smith, Photographed by Lars Gundlach, Written and designed by Weatherhead & Stitt."
