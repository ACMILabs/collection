        "Presented by William Holden, this film uses scenes from Bridge on the River Kwai to illustrate a fairly simplistic approach to character study and its development through film narrative and montage. How believable events, characters and conduct combine to make a memorable experience, whether in a book or in a film. Made from footage filmed behind the scenes in Ceylon, during the production of \"The Bridge Over the River Kwai\", including scenes of David Lean directing Alec Guinness in rehearsal, and several clips from the film itself."
