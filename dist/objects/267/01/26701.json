        "Documents probably one of the most important social psychological experiments ever designed. The film records Dr Stanley Milgram's experiments at Yale on obedience to authority: an attempt to determine how a person reacts when asked to carry out orders that conflict with their conscience. Subjects are shown administering electric shocks to another person as penalties for mistakes in learning."
