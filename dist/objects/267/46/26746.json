        "Olga Korbut is the Soviet gymnast who, at the age of 17, won three gold medals at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972 with a performance that caught the hearts and imaginations of a world-wide audience. This is a study of the hard and uncompromising disclipine that is a necessary part of a world champion's daily life."
