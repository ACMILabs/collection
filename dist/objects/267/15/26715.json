        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Critic and the Film\". Basil Wright analyses Carol Reed's direction in \"The Odd Man Out\". He traces, with the help of blackboard illustrations, the time limits of the story in connection with the movements of Johnny (James Mason), the main character. This main storyline is impinged upon by other characters at various times, the total dramatic impulse being carried forward by these contacts with the hunted man. Mr. Wright then breaks down sequences to scenes, then to shots, underlining his reasons for claiming the title of \"masterpiece\" for the film. Scenes are shown 'silent' and the subsequent showing of a sound version demonstrates the director's use of unseen factors and sound to lift tension."
