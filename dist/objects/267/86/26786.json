        "A zany spoof with plenty of violence borrowed from the very source it seeks to parody, this film is about a housewife who has lost her family to the television set. Characters spring from the screen to invade her home and take over her life. She is saved by Buck the cowboy, who shoots everyone dead and rides off with her. Sam, her husband, witnesses the departure on his TV set. Stars: Edward Allen, Paul Berval, Christien Delmas, Basil Fitzgibbon, Gilles Pellerin, Joan Stuart, John Vernon, Chris Wiggins, Trudi Wiggins, Leslie Yeo, Ted Zeigler. Written by Stan Daniels; photographed by Jean Roy and Thomas Vamos; edited by Kathleen Shannon; sound by Ron Alexander, Andre Hourlier, John Knight and Roger Lamoureux."
