        "Modern miracle drugs cast out demons in ways never dreamed of by the witch doctor or medicine man. This film takes you into a world of pills and potions for an intimate survey of how this modern healing magic is concocted, and an equally remarkable survey of the beneficial effects today's drugs are having in the cure of diseases that not long ago were fatal."
