        "Palm-oil and palm kernel oil have been used since the Pharoahs imported the products from West Africa 3,000 years ago. At a plantation in the Cameroons, we follow production through picking, separating, fermenting, and pulping, to the extracting of the oil from the palm fruit. The oils are used in food manufacture, margarine, chemical industries, soap and in processing leather and textiles."
