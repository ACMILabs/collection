        "This award-winning documentary tells about life in New York's Bowery, the haunt of alcoholics and derelicts. No attempt is made to sensationalise; it is simply an objective, but at the same time stark and moving, account of men who have passed the point of no return and live in a half-world of cheap drink, argument, theft, card-playing and bread and soup from the local mission."
