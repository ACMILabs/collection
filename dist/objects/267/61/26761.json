        "Modern Greece, the end product of a civilisation 3000 years old, is a poor country. It is a mountainous peninsula and its towns and cities are scattered along the seacoast and its many islands. The film introduces us to Constantine, a boatowner, who carries cargo between the island and the coastal cities. We follow Constantine on his journey from the island to the coastal cities visiting small villages and Pireus, the port of Athens."
