        "An animated story of a beggar who repairs an old box, in order to set it up and ask for donations. As he stands in the street he gets cold, so he climbs into the box to keep warm. At once a spectacular star descends from the sky to the box and when it returns to the sky, it takes with it the ghost of the beggar. A film without words. (Awards: Chicago; San Franscisco; Melbourne; Dubuque: Los Angeles; Les Menuires.)"
