        "Present day Puerto Rico is the subject of this film, but the film's innovative format provides an unusual opportunity to study communication techniques. The same film footage is repeated three times accompanied by three distinct and doctrinaire texts. The viewer is thereby challenged to evaluate whose \"faith is being propagated\" and by what means."
