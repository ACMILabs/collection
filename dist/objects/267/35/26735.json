        "Quebec produces many of the feature films made in Canada. The film looks at this unique, controversial industry; at the people who have succeeded in it (Genevieve Bujold is one) or failed; at its movies, which run the gamut from hard-core skinflicks to such highly acclaimed films as Mon oncle Antoine, and at its audiences, which number in the millions."
