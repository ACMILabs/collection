        "Episode of Series \"Background for Social Studies\". Colonists floating down the Ohio River helped to settle the present cities of Pittsburgh, Cincinatti, Louisville, Huntington and Wheeling. Today the Ohio is America's busiest inland waterway. Its enormous volume of water and nearby coalfields have attracted steel, chemical, aluminium and atomic energy plants, and efforts are being made to solve problems of water pollution, flood control and increasing traffic."
