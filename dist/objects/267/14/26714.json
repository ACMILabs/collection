        "Tells the story of the star batsman (the \"hero\") being bowled first ball. This film made by fifth form students of Bairnsdale Technical School, was an experiment to find the shortest film that could be made without crippling the educational worth of the project, which was completed in a month, with minimum expense. Eight periods of class time were spent out of doors in actual filming. For the other three weeks, students wrote the script and edited the film under normal classroom conditions."
