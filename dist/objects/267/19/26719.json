        "Originally created for the IBM pavilion at the Osaka EXPO, Japan, 1970. this animated film treats the subject of the environment and pollution in terms of Far Eastern mythology. Looks at the history of man's relationship with nature, and the changing role of the demons. A gorgeous animated whimsy that employs a charmingly naive graphic style based on East Asian art. The elements, depicted as gruesome colourful archetypes are the enemy of man's endeavour, mechanisation vanquishes extant demons but in turn creates new foes of environmental degradation. Ultimately, our everyman hero finds a solution in digital technology. A genuinely \"funky\" film; from its lurid, childish demons to Quincy Jones' elaborate score for keyboard, percussion, and vocal extemporisations."
