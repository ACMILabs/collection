        "Episode of Series \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\". Narrated by Rod Serling. This cinematic companion to Cousteau's book, \"Octopus and Squid: The Soft Intelligence\" seeks to dispel some long standing misapprehension's about this gorgeous aquatic chameleon. Fantastic underwater cinematography attests to the octopus' fluid grace and delicate sensuality. In the Mediterranean Sea, Captain Cousteau and his divers explore the underwater world of the octopus. He demonstrates that it is a small creature of great shyness. In a laboratory tank we see the courtship and breeding of a male and female, and the octopus embryos are followed through the remarkable process of birth. Cast includes Jacques Cousteau."
