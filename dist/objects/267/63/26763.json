        "The film shows the work of the army during the Hunter Valley floods of 1954 which necessitated the almost complete evacuation of the city of Maitland in collaboration with the Navy and Air Force. In the aftermath the army contributed to the tremendous task of cleaning up, restoring communications and repairing water, electrical and sewage facilities in a race against time to prevent the outbreak of disease."
