        "An experiment in the fluoridation of drinking water by Beaconsfield Council, Tasmania. The local chemist was the driving force in having the Council add the necessary one part fluoride to a million parts of water. Comparisons over the years of teeth of children brought up on Council's fluoridated water supply and the teeth of children from outlying areas using tank water amply justifies fluoridation. The benefit to general health, cost and lack of adverse effects on persons or industry."
