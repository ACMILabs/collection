    "description": [
        "This poetic yet intellectually rigorous documentary begins as an essay on Sengalese women but transforms to become an essay on the very subject of documentation, historical truth and Eurocentric \"objectivity\". Trinh T. Minh-ha's work has been pivotal in challenging cinematic assumptions about the representation of being \"other\". Combining passionate theory with elegiac images \"Reassemblage\" is a critical history of the documentary and ethnography and one of the key works of Post-Colonial cinema."
