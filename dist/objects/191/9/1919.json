        "reLOCATED was a community arts project documenting the lives of residents from the Kensington Public Housing Estate who were relocated when the estate was redeveloped. Bailey and Costi's photography, writing and audio recordings have been combined into short video works especially for the MAP project that allow us to observe instances of beauty in city life while also celebrating the multiple forms of community and history to be found in Melbourne's inner-West. The Venny was the local playground for kids from the estate, and 'The Venny Kids' pays tribute to a place that has seen many happy times."
