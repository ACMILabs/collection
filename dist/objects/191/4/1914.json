        "Collingwood - 'Hit the North. The north is where they put most of the wogs.' Utilising excerpts from Christos Tsiolkas' novel 'Loaded', 'North' is a lyrical and haunting work about space and place in Melbourne's inner-city northern suburbs. This short work reveals a history of migrant alienation and regret submerged underneath the asphalt, mortar and concrete of the modern Australian city."
