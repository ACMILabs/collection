        "This early key work by Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson follows a group of young English men and women going out and exploring the jazz clubs of London. Made as part of the Free Cinema documentary movement, Momma Don't Allow is observational rather than didactic, capturing the joy and pleasure of music, going out and being part of a gang."
