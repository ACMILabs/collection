        "Video recording of the construction and exhibition of 'Boothlite'"
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Video recording filmed by artists at Swinburne University as they complete the construction of 'Boothlite', an interactive multimedia installation. 'Boothlite' exhibited in 1996 in a collection of installations, footage of which appears in the video without title. A steel, rubber and perspex booth for one, 'Boothlite' features both an internal and external monitor. The internal monitor and keyboard allow the spectator to interact with a series of digital images and sequences; the external monitor invites those outside 'Boothlite' to go inside. In the video, the various artists involved discuss the work and battle against a sleepless block of 48 or more hours in order to get it finished in time for installation.  James Verdon is one of the artists who originally created a work know as 'the Booth'. The Booth is a mini cinema which Cinemedia has commissioned James and others to build."
