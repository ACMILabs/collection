        "A survey of the measures carred out by the British Government to safeguard the people's health: pre-natal clinics, maternity hospitals, child welfare centres, and school medical services help to ensure that the rising generation is healthy, but the importance of environment is not overlooked. Slums are being replaced by modern housing estates, and special measures are taken to combat industrial diseases which cause ill-health among industrial workers."
