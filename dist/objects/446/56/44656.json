        "A feature drama about a girl torn between two cultures, the English-speaking community of Vancouver where she grew up and the French-speaking Quebec where the film opens. Her uncertainty extends to her lovers, one from Vancouver who wants to take her home and the other from Quebec who would like to continue their pleasant, if inconclusive affair. The settings show a Quebec winter and British Columbia spring. (Award: Toronto.) Cast: Sharon Acker, Daniel Gadouas, Paul Guevremont, Robert Howay, Monique Mercure, William Needles, Lucie Poitras, Aileen Seaton, Alexandra Stewart, Francois Tasse."
