        "This two-part series is about a cultural exchange between China and Australia and sixteen young primary school children between the ages of 9 to 11, eight Chinese students from different cities and rural areas of China and eight Australian students from various schools and States in Australia. Part I: The Middle Kingdom - We follow the Australian children through the fascinating land of China, beginning with their introduction to a Chinese primary school in Canton, where differences of language and culture are soon overcome. Their travels take them on a boat trip down the Li River, to the Children's Palace in Shanghai, the Great Wall, to see the giant pandas at Beijing, Tien An Men Square, the Great Hall of the People, and finally, to meet Madame Kang Kequing, Vice Chairman of China. Part II: The Lucky Country - Following the Australian children's visit to China, eight Chinese children make the long journey to Australia, a vast island continent of extremes and so different to their own country. The children are accompanied by three of the young Australians who went to China. They meet the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, row a surf boat, watch a parade of wild penguins, visit an outback sheep station, take part in a lesson by radio in the famous \"School of the Air\" and sample life in Sydney and Melbourne. Narrated by Peter Sumner."
