        "This school, organized by concerned parents, broke with tradition by introducing subjects that are of particular relevance to its pupils. Indian legends, traditions, languages and crafts balance the program of academic subjects required by the Ontario Ministry of Education. The experience of the children at Wandering Spirit is contrasted with the very different life experienced by their parents, educated in the old residential schools."
