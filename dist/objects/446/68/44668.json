        "Pee Wee Herman's Big Adventure is Tim Burton's feature film direction debut. It is the surreal tale of Pee Wee Herman, the grown-up kid with impeccable dress sense, and his most prized possession, his awesome bicycle. When Pee Wee discovers it has been stolen from outside Chuck's Bike-o-rama, he is devastated and embarks on the long journey to find it. He hits the open road and encounters riotous adventures with bikers, bums, cowboys, an escaped con man, a phantom trucker and a waitress who dreams of travelling to Paris. His quest leads him to the Warner Brothers studio in Hollywood where security is tight and Pee Wee's bike is in the hands of a spoilt child star. He eventually manages to steal it back drawing the interest of a Hollywood producer who makes Pee Wee's story into a James Bond send-up. The latter includes special appearances by James Brolin, who stars as P.W. Herman and Morgan Fairchild, his assistant and lover. Includes music by Danny Elfman. Cast includes: Pee Wee Herman, Elizabeth Daily, Mark Holton, Diane Salinger and Judd Omen."
