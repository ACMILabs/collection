        "Richard Kwietniowski's 'Love and death on Long Island' is a clever reworking of Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice'. Based on Gilbert Adair's novel, the film stars John Hurt as renowed British author Giles De'Ath, whose secluded existence keeps him out of touch with the rest of the modern world. D'Arth and the 20th century eventually collide when one day he accidentally stumbles into a cinema screening of an American teen film called 'Hotpants College 2', starring the latest teen sensation Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley). D'Arth instantly becomes obsessed with Ronnie and decides to travel to the actors home in Long Island in the hope that he can meet the object of his desire. Hurt is excellent in his role as the ageing, out of touch author, and in an inspired bit of casting, Priestley's character resonates with irony, due to his own status as the resident teen idol in the American soapie 'Beverley Hills 90210'. Cast also includes Sheila Hancock, Fiona Loewi, Maury Chaykin, Gawn Grainger, Elizabeth Quinn (Awards: 1998 New York Film Critics Circle Awards for Best First Film)"
