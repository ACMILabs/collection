        "This program aims to instruct people about the knowledge and skills required to fully understand the structure of meetings, as well as appreciating that it's an opportunity for contribution to the ongoing development of the organisation. It covers the importance of defining the purpose of the meeting and establishing goals related to the purpose, the benefits of preparation, including developing possible responses, as well as covering the concept that meetings are a forum for negotiation and consensus, as distinct from argument and conflict."
