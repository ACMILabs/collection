        "Set in 1906, a lonely outpost of American soldiers is left in Manila to train the Philippine Constabulary in the ways of war. They must prevent further uprisings from opposing tribes hidden in the jungle, or face continued oppression. An idealistic Doctor (Gary Cooper) clashes with the captain in charge (and the father of the woman he has fallen in love with), on how the native Moro's can best be trained, and whether they should defend the outpost or take the battle to the jungle. As the water supply is sabotaged by the jungle tribe, the soldiers and Moros reliant on the precious water face a natural disaster as devastating as the tribal violence, cholera. Based on the novel by Charles L. Clifford. Cast includes Andrea Leeds, David Niven and Reginald Owen."
