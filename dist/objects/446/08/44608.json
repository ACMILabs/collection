        "These seven short animated films from the National Film Board of Canada are united by their inspiration from the 1990 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Each film addresses a specific right that was agreed upon by the convention. They are designed to encourage children to think about the world in which they live. The films contain no dialogue. Part 2 is intended for children aged 9-12. The films are Jonas and Lisa\" (dirs: Zabelle Cote, Daniel Schorr); \"The Tournament (dir: Francine Desbiens); \"Overdose\" (dir: Claude Cloutier); \"An artist\" (Dir: Michele Cournoyer); \"Baroque'n roll\" (dir: Pierre M. Trudeau); \"Ex-child\" (dir: Jacques Drouin); \"Why?\" (dir: Bretislav Pojar). A resource guide for educators is included."
