        "A film trilogy presenting impressions of Sweden by two Canadians and one Swede: Mort Ransen and Martin Duckworth of the National Film Board, and Swedish director Eric M. Nilsson. The film is composed of three films: \"A Place for everything\" - Eric Nilsson takes up the contrasts in the well-ordered Swedish society - order versus spontaneity; individual desires set against collective needs; subordinares vis-a-vis superiors. The young Swedes interviewed make a plea for independence, imagination and the discussion of existing conditions. \"Falling from ladders\" - Simply by putting about 20 Swedish men, women and young people in front of his camera and having them read aloud from the Statistical Year Book, filmmaker Mort Ransen has recorded a wide range of impressions of Sweden's economic and social existence. Quotations vary from the whole gamut of exports and imports, marriages formed or dissolved, to the number of people who fall from ladders annually. (Award: Philadelphia) \"Passing through Sweden\" - A film critic of one of Sweden's daily newspapers says of this film by Martin Duckworth, \"Never before have I seen a film that so intensely interpreted the experience of Swedish surroundings...an 'atmospheric film' in which all the expression is in the pictures.\""
