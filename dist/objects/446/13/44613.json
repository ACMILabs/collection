        "Christina Ricci stars as 16 year old Dedee Truitt, a teenage Lolita with a caustic tongue and scrupulous libido. 'The Opposite of Sex' opens with Dedee running away from her white trash mother to go and stay with her well to do gay half brother Bill (Martin Donovan), and his hunky not too bright boyfriend, Randy (William Lee Scott). Soon enough the malicious vamp has turned everyones life upside down, taking off with her brothers boyfriend and his dead ex-lovers ashes. Writer and director Don Roos has fashioned a sharp witty film which inventively uses Dedee's voice over narration to plead her case to the audience and to confound our expectations of what she might possibly be thinking next. Ricci is wonderfully droll and jaded in the title role but not to be undone is Lisa Kudrow as the bitter and suspicious sister of Bill's dead lover. Cast also includes Lyle Lovett, Ivan Sergei, Johnny Galecki"
