        "Two points of view concerning what the infusion of industrial capital meant to two dying coal towns in southeastern British Columbia. The film shows what happened when an American corporation came to the twin towns of Natal and Michel with a contract for millions of tons of coking coal for the steel mills of Japan. From what is seen and said in this film, industrial growth has its price, especially with regard to the ecology of the region."
