        "Some forty farmers of the Three Rivers valley in Alberta are opposed to the construction of a dam that will flood their land to provide irrigation for some eight thousand farmers further downstream. They say that a straight cost-benefit argument will cause great injustice, and that building a dam at the proposed site may not, in fact, solve the problem. The farmers maintain that water wastage through badly maintained canals, mismanagement of the watershed and other faults should be dealt with before envisaging construction of a whole new irrigation system."
