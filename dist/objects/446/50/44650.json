        "This is an intimate and moving exploration of growing up in a Chinese-Australian family. Lisa Wang's maternal family has been prominent in Victorian Chinese affairs for a century. Her father built the David Wang retail empire and became one of Melbourne's best loved civic identities, after arriving in Australia as a Chinese Army officer who spoke no English, The film uses a mass of fascinating archival footage which stretches from early attempts by family members to learn to use a 16mm Bell & Howell projector given in payment of a debt, through professional images of store openings, to home video of Lisa's journey to Taiwan and China."
