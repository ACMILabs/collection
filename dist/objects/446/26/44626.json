        "In the past, soil erosion has been a contributing factor in the decline of former civilizations. With this in mind, the film stresses the seriousness of the soil erosion problem in Australia. Wind and water have taken a heavy toll of the soil. The measures being taken to control erosion are illustrated and it is stressed that both the man on the land and also the city dweller must learn to work with nature in preserving the heritage of the living soil."
