        "Following her success in \"Funny girl\", Barbra Streisand participated in this Emmy award winning debut television special. The program has the Streisand trademark on it, with an entertaining collection of songs, storytelling, and satire. Song renditions include \"People\" (from \"Funny girl\"), \"My man\", \"How does the wine taste\", \"Lover come back\" and \"We could make believe\". Dynamic performances in a schoolgirl skit, the energetic \"Second hand rose\" and the classic finale of \"Happy days are here again\" are well received by her captive audience, and no doubt by viewers watching at home."
