        "An example of student filmmaking revolving around the subject of racism and intolerance. Follows the story of Luigi, an Italian Australian teenager who is racially attacked by a gang of schoolboys. Luigi's Australian girlfriend flees the scene of the attack, only to encounter the gang alone some time later. Although the film has no spoken dialogue, this compelling short student film captures the mood of xenophobic Australia in the 60's."
