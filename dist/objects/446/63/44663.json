        "In 1929, 62 year old Andy Bahr completed a 2,400 kilometre journey across the hostile and unmapped terrain of Alaska. What was remarkable about the journey that he completed with a team of Inuit and Sami herders, was that they herded 3,000 reindeer along the way. The Canadian government, in a well intentioned move to provide a livelihood for the Mackenzie Delta Inuit, had purchased the herd, which now required transportation. The drive was expected to take 18 months; it lasted 6 years. Filmed on location from the Bering Strait in Alaska to the Beaufort Sea in the Northwest Territories, this stunning odyssey combines historical documentation, epic myth and irreverent humour to follow Bahr's quest to the edge of the world."
