        "One of the 'Free Cinema' films produced with the assistance of the British Film Institute Experimental Production Fund, established to encourage the production of films of an experimental or original nature. It was photographed on nine Saturday evenings at Art and Viv Sanders' 'Wood Green Jazz Club' in 'The Fishmonger's Arms'. It was shot with the co-operation of the club's members and was made cheaply on 16mm film with single-track sound transferred from tape recordings. Unhampered by sponsors, the makers of this film have been free to capture and admire the freedom, exuberance and vitality of the Jazz Club. These suburban clubs were run for and by enthusiasts; their atmosphere was not whipped up by promoters but created by the London teenagers who evolved their own free styles of dancing and created their own world of relaxation and enjoyment. Appearing in this film are members of 'The Chris Barber Band', Chris Barber, Pat Halcox, Lonnie Donegan, Monty Sunshine, Ron Bowden, Jim Bray and Ottilie Patterson."
