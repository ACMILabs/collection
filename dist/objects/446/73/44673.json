        "Sidney Lumet's \"Network\" is a dead-on indictment of the TV news media which seems to be growing more relevant with each passing year. Howard Beale is the long-time news anchor for the UBS-TV News. When ratings go down, Beale is fired and suffers an on-air breakdown, announcing that he is going to commit suicide on his final programme. Ironically, his angry rantings boost his ratings - much to the surprise and delight of UBS executives. Subsequently, Beale is re-hired and re-invented as the \"mad prophet of the airwaves\" and soon becomes a pawn of ruthless programming executives who milk his madness for every share point it's worth. When the \"prophet\" ceases to be popular and profitable however, something must be done about Beale, preferably on camera, before a live audience. Cast includes: Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, Robert Duvall, Wesley Addy, Beatrice Straight and Ned Beatty."
