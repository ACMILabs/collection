        "Meryl Street is Gail, a former rafting instructor, returning to her old river with her husband and son for her son's birthday, and to try and salvage what is left of her marriage. On the river they meet Wade (Kevin Bacon) and Terry, two fellow rafters on their way to Bridle Creek. Halfway down the river Gail discovers Wade and Terry abandoned by their guide and offers to lead them the rest of the way. This harmless act puts all their lives in danger as Wade and Terry reveal their true, evil selves. To save her family, Gail must face her own fears and run the Gauntlet - the most dangerous of all the rapids on the river."
