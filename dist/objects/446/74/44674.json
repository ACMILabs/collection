        "Farley Mowat has sold more books than any other Canadian writer - ten million copies in fifty countries and in twenty-two languages. In this film Mowat recalls some of his experiences that have found their way into the pages of his books. Selected readings from such stories as The Dog Who Wouldn't Be and People of the North bring his eloquent, subjective non-fiction to life. (An abridged version of In Search of Farley Mowat)."
