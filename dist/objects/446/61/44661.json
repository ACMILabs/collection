        "New England farmers, like farmers in all the north-eastern states of the US, have found that the need for soil conservation and soil-building practices is an urgent necessity if their land is to continue to yield good returns in years to come. This film presents the program for improvement of pastures, introducing with considerable insight the farmers themselves, and the dry humour with which they face their most serious problems. Narrated by Frank Craven."
