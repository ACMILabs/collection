        "A new teacher begins work at an elementary school in a small Czechoslovakian town closely following the second World War. This situation provides an historical backdrop for the exploration of a dark period in Czechoslovakian history. Sverak's debut feature, written by his father (Zdenek Sverak) was the last film to represent the united Czechoslovakia, in the Foreign Language Film category of the 1991 Oscars (it lost to Italy's entry \"Mediterraneo\"). Cast includes Jan Triska and Libuse Safrankova. In Czech with English subtitles."
