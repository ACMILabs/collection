        "Alice is quite unlike other girls her age. Instead of playing with friends, she loses herself in a distorted secret world, populated by satanic rituals and occult masks. Alice is fiercely jealous of the favouritism her parents show towards her younger sister, Karen, a sibling jealousy that verges on demonic. When Alice's sister and aunt are mysteriously murdered, Alice's parents question the depths of their daughter's evil intent. As the family self destructs, a priest and the police believe there are stronger forces involved and are intent on uncovering the unholy truth embodied in a seemingly normal Alice. Brooke Shields makes a brief, 10 minute appearance. Cast includes Linda Miller, Mildred Clinton, Paula Shepherd and Niles McMaster."
