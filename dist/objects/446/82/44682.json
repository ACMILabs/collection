        "Originally filmed as 'Lisa and the Devil', Mario Bava's creepy and atmospheric chiller was re-cut for the American market, with a demonic possession sub-plot (directed by Mickey Lion), added to capitalise on the success of 'The Exorcist'. As it stands now this rather disjointed film stars Elke Sommers as Lisa, a woman holidaying in an unspecified European city. Along her travels she begins to notice a strange man (Telly Savalas, sporting his trademark chuppa-chup) following her, who carries around with him a creepy life like mannequin who may or may not be Satan. Lisa suddenly begins to convulse and is rushed off to hospital. Her condition is soon diagnosed as demonic possession (vomiting, profanity, etc.) and a priest (Robert Alda) is brought in to help. These scenes are intercut with strange dream-like sequences of Lisa in an unspecified gothic mansion, where a mentally disturbed man (Alessio Orano) lives with his blind mother and their butler (Savalas again), who may or may not be Satan. Also known as: 'La casa dell'esorcismo', 'Lisa and the Devil', 'The devil in the house of exorcism', and 'The devil and the dead'. Cast also includes Alida Valli and Sylva Koscina."
