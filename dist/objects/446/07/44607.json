        "These seven short animated films from the National Film Board of Canada are united by their inspiration from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Included on the tape are: DUEL; A child who has been brainwashed with censored information to make him a model citizen rebels against all forms of censorship of the mind when he becomes an adult. NARCO BLUES; An ordinary teenager is unwillingly pulled into the harsh world of drugs. However an incident has a salutory effect on him. THE CORA PLAYER; Two young Africans from different social backgrounds defy tradition by falling in love. LOCKED; A boy is seized by an enormous hand that pushes him towards a hazardous lock factory- symobolizing innocence murdered by forced child labour. TRADE; A young Indian girl is sold by her parents to a pimp who takes her to work in a brothel. MASKS; Throughout childhood and adulthood a young man refuses to wear the \"masks\" imposed on him by social convention. DEATHTRAP; A young man closes all the doors to his heart, but seeing that suicide is a trap, decides to live. In English and French language."
