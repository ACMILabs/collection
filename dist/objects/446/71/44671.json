        "Abel Ferrara's ('Bad Lieutenant', 'King of New York', 'Driller Killer') foray into the revenge fantasy genre is an often unnerving film which owes a lot to Roman Polanski's disturbing tale of sexual terror, 'Repulsion'. Set in the rough garment district of New York, 'Angel of Vengeance' follows the gradual descent into madness of Thana (Zoe Tamerlis), a mute seamstress who snaps after she is raped twice in one day. Her reaction to it plays like a strange form of liberation, as the once timid seamstress proceeds to off some of the more sleazier male citizens of New York city. Ferrara sprinkles this unusual and stylish low budget film with dark comic moments, eccentric characters (like Thana's weird landlady played by Editta Sherman), and its slow motion climax is a beautiful and surreal piece of filmmaking. Cast includes Albert Sinkys, Darlene Stuto, Helen McGara, Nike Zachmanoglou."
