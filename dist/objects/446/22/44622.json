        "Episode number 8 of Series \"The American Scene\". A study of progressive education in three schools in New York, where the emphasis of teaching is placed on the fact that learning is a normal and vital part of every child's day-to-day development; what the child is taught in school should therefore bear a discernible relation to the world around the child, and be a challlenge to their increasing skills and expanding understanding of how to manipulate the things whcih surround them."
