        "A young couple escape into the badlands of the Mid-West after the boy has dispassionately killed the girl's unsympathetic father. The screenplay is based on fact, namely the exploits of Chris Starkweather and Caril Filgate in 1958. The film's originality however arises from the counterpoint between the doomed romanticism courted by Kit and the detached narration by Holly. The story is a provocative study of people numbingly alienated from everyday life. Cast includes Martin Sheen, Sissy Spacek, Raymond Biere and Warren Oates."
