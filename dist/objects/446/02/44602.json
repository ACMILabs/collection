        "Benoit is an astonishingly accomplished eleven year old Quebecois from Joliette. He persues such diverse activities as weight lifting and playing the violin. Member of the Orchestre symphonique des jeunes de Joliette, he still finds time to indulge in a busy life with peers and elders alike. This film moves at Benoit's pace, which is mostly a fast one. (Awards: Yorkton; Lausanne)."
