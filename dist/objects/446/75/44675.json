        "A happy-go-lucky film that should appeal to anyone interested in eating and stocking an inexpensive source of food. The information is built into a comic story about two experienced mushroom pickers and one novice, and their respective perambulations through the woods. Close-ups are supplemented by descriptions of the mushrooms, and a warning is issued not to pick what you can't clearly identify, given the similarity between the poisonous and non-poisonous varieties."
