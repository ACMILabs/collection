        "Mothering is an issue that demands attention, but is often only brought in the public arena on the rather commercialised Mother's Day. Mothering is a significant part of life that is not often considered as a separate issue for women. This program addresses mothering in Australian society and raises the level of debate about issues relating to mothering. Mothering is looked at over generations as well as its changing identity in contemporary society today. Mothering across cultures, the status of mothering, sexuality and mothering, as well as stereotypes are explored within this program, giving voice to a number of women who share their experiences of mothering. Produced by the Monash University Centre for Women's Studies."
