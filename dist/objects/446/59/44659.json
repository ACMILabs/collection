    "description": [
        "Just a-minute was a training program organised by Studio D of the National Film Board of Canada in collaboration with the Women's Program, Department of the Secretary of State. This program gave Canadian women an opportunity to express themselves through the medium of a one minute film clip. Through humour, caricature, or animation, the clips highlight some of the problems or attitudes encountered by women at home and at work. Entertaining to watch, the films do not disguise the pertinence of their contents."
