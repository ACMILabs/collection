        "Recommends methods of removing bracken from the rich dairy country in the New South Wales coastal belt. Explains that broken bracken is the first stage in the removal of the pest. Illustrates the use of specially designed three-bladed rollers on hilly country. On level pastures the simple square log roller with steel flanges, the mower, the rotary hoe, or other mechanical equipment are suggested."
