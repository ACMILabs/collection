        "George Henderson (John Lithgow) is on the way home from a camping trip with his wife Nancy and children Sarah and Ernie, when he accidentally hits and kills what seems to be a wild animal. A closer inspection reveals what they all believe to be the mythical 'Big Foot'. Visions of richness are revealed to George, and against his family's wishes, takes the dead creature home with him. Later that night, strange noises wake the entire family, who go downstairs to find Harry, the Big Foot they killed, is actually alive. Their lives are turned upside down by Harry, who destroys their house, but gains their love. The Hendersons decide the best thing for Harry would be to return him to the wild, but before they can, he escapes. Hot on his trail are amateur hunters and professional 'Big Foot' hunter, Jaques Lefleur (David Suchet). The family, with the help of environmentalist, Dr Wallace Wrightwood (Don Ameche) race against time to return Harry to his home - before he ends up in a zoo."
