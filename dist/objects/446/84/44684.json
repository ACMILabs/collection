        "Home alone is one of the most successful comedies of the eighties and stars pint-sized hero Macaulay Culkin. In a chaotic frenzy to get to the airport on time, the McCallister family forget one thing - eight year old Kevin. When two bungling burglars attempt to break into the McCallister household, Kevin is left home alone to defend himself and his house. He outwits the burglars by waging war the only way he knows how, with outlandish, yet effective boyhood pranks. Cast includes Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard and John Candy. In the sequel to \"Home alone\" it's Kevin who manages to isolate himself from the rest of the family when he boards the wrong plane at Christmastime and finds himself in New York city. He's not alone for long however, as he quickly befriends a pigeon-lady and, once again crosses paths with two well known dim witted criminals. Cast includes Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern and Brenda Fricker."
