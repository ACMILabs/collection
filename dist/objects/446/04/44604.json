        "Episode of Series \"Fun to Be Fit Series\". Animation and the singing of light-hearted lyrics contrasts the lack of physical activity since machinery has become such a large part of modern life, against the amount of physical activity that was necessary before the advent of such machinery. \"We have a different style. But we don't get enough exercise\" are part of the lyrics which introduce this program. However, the video ends on a positive and hopeful note, as mankind is re-educated in the improvements possible to ensure health, happiness, and quality of life by increasing daily physical activities."
