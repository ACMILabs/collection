        "This entertaining espionage thriller with a strong supporting cast was one of several made at the time to warn the American public against an isolationist stance towards the events in Europe. It is constructed as a series of climactic set pieces, linked by a play upon the deceptiveness of appearances and the cyclic journey of a couple searching for Nazi spies in London and Holland following the disappearance of a diplomat - a journey which establishes the reporter-hero's identity. It bears a close relationship to other picaresque thrillers directed by Hitchcock: \"The 39 Steps\", \"Saboteur\" and \"North By Northwest\". Cast includes Joel McCrea, Laraine Day, Herbert Marshall and George Sanders."
