        "On June 27 & 28, 1968 at NBC-TV Studios, Burbank, California, Elvis Presley made his first appearance before a live audience since March 1961. It was intended to revitalise and reorientate his extraordinary career. It became a celebration of Elvis' rock 'n' roll roots, a means whereby he could shake off the image of formula movies, sink his teeth into some raw raunch and prove that he was indeed the king of rock."
