        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". This production of Shakespeare's great play features Michael Hordern as King Lear, Michael Kitchen as Edmund, and Frank Middlenass as the Fool. \"King Lear\" is a tragedy that repeatedly portrays the restless intolerance of the young towards the old, the powerlessness of virtue in the face of deceit, and the fragility of the bonds which hold families and communities together. The production features an excellent Shakespearian cast."
