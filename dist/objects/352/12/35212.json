        "The 30 minute Intermediate program has a more rigorous pace, and the exercises used are more demanding with fewer repetitions. The tape requires a good basic level of fitness, and assumes a level of flexibility and co-ordination such as would be developed through a consistent use of the Beginners Program. For many exercisers, and for elderly exercisers in particular, the intermediate program may be as far as they wish to go. Rated: G"
