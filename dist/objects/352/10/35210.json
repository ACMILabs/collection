        "The physical fitness of a company's employees can make an important contribution to the fiscal health of the whole organisation. It is now well recognised that healthy employees are more productive, are absent less frequently, and suffer fewer of the illnesses which plague modern life. Health and fitness programs at work are extremely successful in encouraging new health habits with important benefits for both employees and employers."
