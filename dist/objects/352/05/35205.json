        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". Antonio, a merchant of Venice, borrows money from the Jewish moneylender, Shylock, on behalf of his friend Bassanio, so that he may travel to Belmont to woo the wealthy Portia. A stipulation of this loan is that it must be repaid in full within three months, or Shylock will have a pound of the merchant's flesh in lieu. About to wed Portia, Bassanio learns that the ships from which Antonio would have obtained the money to repay Shylock have been lost and that the usurer is demanding his pound of flesh. Bassanio returns to Venice to help his friend. Portia, without her husband knowing of her intentions, seeks legal advice, and appears at the trial disguised as a lawyer. Featuring Warren Mitchell as Shylock, Gemma Jones as Portia."
