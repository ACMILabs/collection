        "The navigator is remarkable because of its absorbing story that links medieval fears and fortunes to our times, while confirming director Vincent Ward as an original talent. It is Cumbria 1348, the year of the Black Death. A young visionary tells his fellow miners that their community may survive the plague if they place a spire on a distant cathedral before dawn. So, from their grim, snowbound Lake District, they dig down an old mine-shaft to the other side of the world, emerging in an Eastman-coloured present day Auckland, New Zealand. Cast includes Bruce Lyons, Chris Haywood and Hamish McFarlane."
