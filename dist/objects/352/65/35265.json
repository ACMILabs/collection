        "Marco and Guiseppe Palmien are two Venetian gondoliers, one of whom is also the rightful King of Barataria. Since no one knows which of them was abducted from the kingdom as a child, they have a chance to put their republican principles into practice by sharing the throne ... until it is revealed that in fact neither of them is truly king. Performers include: Keith Michell, Eric Shilling, Francis Edgerton, Tom Mc Donnell, Nan Christie, Anne Collins, Sandra Dugdale. The London Symphony Orchestra (London) conducted by Alexander Faris. John McCarthy (Chorus Master), Ambrosian Opera Chorus. Staged by Peter Wood. Introduced by Douglas Fairbanks Jnr."
