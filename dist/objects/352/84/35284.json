        "The \"Rockumentary\" relives the legend of the Beatles, from the wild exuberance of the early Cavern Club days through eight incredible years to the grim finality of \"Let It Be\". John, Paul, George and Ringo are seen in performance, on tour, in films, recording with George Martin and in rare footage never before seen. Features excerpts from many of their songs. Rated: PG"
