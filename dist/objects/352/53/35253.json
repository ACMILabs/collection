        "This is a unique collection of films that have been devised, written or directed by renowned cartoonist/filmmaker Bruce Petty for Film Australia. Multi-award winning LEISURE (14 mins, 1976) is an animated and lighthearted look at the worlds of work and leisure. It considers our changing patterns of work since life began and the effects the Industrial Revolution has had on our leisure time. (OSCAR for Best Animated Short Subject, 49th Academy Awards, Los Angeles, 1977). MEGALOMEDIA (28 mins, 1981) is a humorous, yet at the same time searching sweep through the development of media and its audiences. Max Gillies guides the audience through a rapid succession of thoughts and perceptions in three parts Media Machine, Media Market and Media Mind. Important issues are raised in an entertaining manner. In THE MOVERS (49 mins, 1987) the development of technology is examined; from the primitive age through to the nuclear age. It examines technology's relationship with human beings and the human cost of the gap that is created between countries that are technologically advanced and those that are not."
