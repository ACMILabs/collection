        "Acclaimed as Gilbert and Sullivan's master work, \"The Mikado\", after 100 years, is still their most popular opera. This is a beautiful production, directed by Christopher Renshaw, with hundreds of painted fans, huge porcelain urns, and its visual send-ups of Victorian England's views of the then mysterious Japan. Features singers Robert Eddie (The Mikado), Heather Begg (Katisha), Peter Cousens (Nanki-Poo), Anne-Maree McDonald, Caroline Clack, Jennifer Bermingham as the Three Little Maids, Graeme Ewer (Ko-Ko), and The Australian Opera Chorus. Also features The Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra conducted by Andrew Greene. Recorded live at the Sydney Opera House on 25 February 1987 and produced for television in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation."
