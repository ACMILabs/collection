        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Writers on Writing\". This series is based on a growing archive of video material of conversations between contemporary writers discussing their work. The material has been re-edited to form a resource for students and teachers of English, and each of the six twenty-minute videos focuses on different aspects and stages of the writing process. Each video is accompanied by a resource booklet. In this video, writers talk about how they began to write, what their inspiration is and their perception of the writer's role."
