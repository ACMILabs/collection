        "This program targets young, beginning basketballers and their teacher/coach. The basic skills needed to play the game are demonstrated by experts, featuring Phil Smyth and Craig Fitzsimmons together with young players so the beginning player can see a skill performed by someone of his own age and ability. Overviews the rules of the game with segments to show how they are incorporated into the game. This is also an introduction to the game of mini-ball and is a great starter for an Aussie sports basketball program in schools."
