        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". Mark Antony and Cleopatra have been enjoying a life of sensual pleasure. Hearing of his wife's death and of an attack on Italy, Mark Antony returns to Rome where he resolves the differences existing between himself and the other triumvires, Octavius Caesar and Lepidus, by marrying Octavius' sister, Octavia. However, when Mark Antony succumbs to Cleopatra's enticements once again, and returns to Egypt, Octavius seizes upon this insult to his sister as a pretext for attacking his erstwhile ally."
