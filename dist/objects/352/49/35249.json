        "A dramatised documentary starring Judy Morris and Ivor Kants which is designed to motivate the general public to learn life saving skills such as cardio-vascular resuscitation. A beloved father and husband dies of an acute heart attack. His life could have been saved had his friends and neighbours known how to resuscitate him. An extremely moving film which should be viewed at home, by community and welfare groups, hospitals and schools. This film saves lives."
