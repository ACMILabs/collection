        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Writers on Writing\". Writers on Writing is based on a growing archive of video material of contemporary writers discussing their work. The material has been re-edited to form a resource for students and teachers of English, and each of the six twenty-minute videos focuses on different aspects of the writing process. Each video is accompanied by a resource booklet. This video examines how characters are created, and how important are setting and plot."
