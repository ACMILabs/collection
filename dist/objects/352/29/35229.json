        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Writers on Writing\". Writers on Writing is based on a growing archive of video material, of conversations between contemporary writers discussing their work. The material has been re-edited to form a resource for students and teachers of English, and each of the six twenty-minute videos focuses on different aspects and stages of the writing process. Each video is accompanied by a resource booklet. In this final video of the series, the use of language is investigated, followed by a discussion on the importance of \"audience\" for the writer."
