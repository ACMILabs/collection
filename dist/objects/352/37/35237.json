        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". This play deals with the conspiracy against Julius Caesar, his assassination, and the defeat of the conspirators by Marc Antony and Octavius Caesar. The crafty and ambitious Cassius, envious of Caesar's political and military triumphs, forms a conspiracy against him. Despite warnings from the soothsayers are entreaties by his wife. Caesar goes to the Capitol and is brutally stabbed to death. Antony, pretending friendliness towards the conspirators, persuades them to allow him to speak at Caesar's funeral. His oration so inflames the citizens of Rome that the assassins are driven out."
