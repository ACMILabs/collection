        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Writers on Writing\". Writers on Writing is based on a growing archive of video material, of conversations between contemporary writers discussing their work. The material has been re-edited to form a resource for students and teachers of English, and each of the six twenty minute videos focuses on different aspects and stages of the writing process. Each video is accompanied by a resource booklet. In this video, writers talk about how they go about the writing process and the role of drafting and research in their work."
