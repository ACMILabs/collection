        "For people seeking a high level of fitness, the 50 minute advanced tape offers a stimulating challenge. The exercises involved are complex, very demanding and require agility, flexibility, co-ordination and good aerobic fitness. Under no circumstances should this program be attempted before a suitable fitness level has been achieved with a thorough and regular fitness building program. The advanced program will not be attainable by all age groups; older exercisers will find the first two programs more suited to their requirements. Rated: G"
