        "The Visitor is a dramatisation of Ray Bradbury's science fiction short story. \"Blood Rust\" victims are exiled to the barren deserts of a quarantine planet to prevent spread of disease on Earth. When a new arrival at the distant colony displays a mystical ability to recreate memories of Earth in the minds of the outcasts, his gift becomes the target of envy and aggression."
