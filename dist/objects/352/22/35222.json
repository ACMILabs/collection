        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". After deputising Angelo to enforce Vienna's long ignored laws, Duke Vincentio purports to leave the city but actually remains to observe the proceedings, disguised as Friar Lodowick. Angelo revives an old statute against fornication and sentences Claudio to death for seducing Juliet, his betrothed. However, when Claudio's sister Isabella, a religious novice, pleads for his life, her beauty so inflames Angelo's own passions that he is very willing to ignore the law, promising her brother's freedom if she yields to him. Vincentio, advises Isabella to pretend to cede to Angelo's wishes. Once Vincentio reveals his true identity Angelo is severely castigated and ordered to marry Mariana to whom he was formerly betrothed."
