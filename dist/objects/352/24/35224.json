        "'They're a Weird Mob' is about Sydney, Australia in 1965 - a sprawling, growing city of three million people - and what people! Easy going, down-to-earth and hilariously funny - a very weird mob. Into this city arrives innocent Italian migrant, Nino Culotta. The adventures of Nino fitting in with the 'weird mob', learning their ways and outlandish language are shown in this Australian comedy classic. The film was carefully marketed as an 'Australian' production, despite Powell's presence as producer-director, his British director of photography, and a screenplay by his regular collaborator in England, Emeric Pressburger (using the pseudonym Richard Imrie). Based on the book by Nino Culotta (John O'Grady). Cast includes Walter Cohiari, Clare Dunne, Chips Rafferty, Ed Devereaux, John Meillion and Tony Bonner."
