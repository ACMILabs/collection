        "Sir Michael Hordern, in the guise of Homer himself, narrates this animated version (in 6 parts) of Homer's Odyssey! The adaptation is by Oliver Hunkin, one time Eton College classical tutor, who has attempted to present it as the great epic poem it is, and to recapture something of the surge and thunder of the original. Graphic artist, Alan Parry, studied the gods and goddesses, the heroes and monsters portrayed on ancient Greek vases, before beginning work on the series."
