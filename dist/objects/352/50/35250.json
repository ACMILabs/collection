        "Introduced by Mike Willesee - this video provides an in-depth look at two Australian families and their fight against drug addiction. Typical families with day to day problems like everyone else - until a serious drug problem surfaced. Addicts and their families speak frankly about their frustration, confusion and the courage needed to fight back. Essential viewing for all parents."
