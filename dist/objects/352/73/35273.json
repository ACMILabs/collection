        "Hosted by Richard Pryor, this is a fast paced, all star reunion that spotlights performances by the biggest acts ever to come out of Detroit including vintage footage of the groups from the sixties and seventies. It looks behind the scenes into what made Motown tick, the songwriters who helped bring the Motown sound to fame and the man who started it all, the legendary Berry Gordy. Rated: G"
