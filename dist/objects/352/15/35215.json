        "Waterpolo is an exciting and skilful game to play and watch, particularly when players adopt an attacking approach. The basic offensive move in waterloo is to make a \"break\" on your opponent ie. to be a body length or more in front of him/her while swimming towards the goal. Various configurations are shown in this program, from simple one on one break, to complex manoeuvres. Demonstrations by 1984 Australian Waterpolo Squad."
