        "This is an opera in two acts. The libretto for Voss has been distilled by David Malouf from Patrick White's great craggy novel of 1957. The result is a long dramatic poem which captures to perfection the essence of the novel. It has inspired in Richard Meale, music which reaches passionate and elemental power. Features: Geoffrey Chaird, Marilyn Richardson, The Australian Opera Chorus and the State Orchestra of Victoria conducted by Stuart Challender."
