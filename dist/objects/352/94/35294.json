        "This is a look at Australia's history since Federation in 1901 through the eyes of 6 Gallipoli veterans. As a group of children who came through Federation, they describe what is has been like to have lived in a country that has gone from horse-drawn carriages to the space age. They talk about fashion, music, youth, politics and many other things. They also discuss Australia's involvement in wars and how they felt, as veterans of Gallipoli, sending their children to World War 2."
