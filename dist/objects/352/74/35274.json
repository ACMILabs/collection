        "The Godfather of soul music, James Brown, scored his first hit single over 30 years ago, and has continued to reach the charts ever since. His sensational showmanship has excited audiences all over the world, while his athletic energy, together with irresistibly funky music, has made him a hero to three generations. This 100% music video is an historical review of his musical career."
