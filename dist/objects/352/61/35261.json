        "The Great Depression seemed to be the catalyst for the most remarkable chapter in Australian sporting history. During the very depths of the Depression an elite group of our greatest champions reach the pinnacle of their success. Phar Lap and Sir Donald Bradman are the two best known heroes from this period. Sir Henry Opperman was a third member. The fourth, and least known of the fabulous four was Billiards King, Walter Lindrum. The program tells of his humble beginnings and how he overcame hardship and tragedy to completely dominate his chosen sport."
