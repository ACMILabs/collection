        "Of the ten Himalayan expeditions I've been on, climbing Mt Gasherbraum IV was the most challenging and spectacular - it was harder than Everest. These are the words of Tim Macartney-Snape, one of a group of seven climbers who actually made it to the summit and shot the entire experience on film at the same time. A spectacular and inspiring video about human achievement."
