        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". Featuring Anthony Hopkins as Othello, Bob Hoskins as Iago and Penelope Wilton as Desdemona. Jealousy and treachery fill this play as Iago, ensign to Othello, annoyed by Casio's recent promotion as the Moor's lieutenant, decides upon revenge. He sets out to destroy Othello's relationship with Desdemona by telling her father that Othello has raped Desdemona; and the, when this falsehood has been overcome, spreads the myth of Casio and Desdemona's love for each other. Iago's treachery is eventually exposed but only after Othello has murdered Desdemona and then stabbed himself."
