        "In the sandstone country, southwest of Katherine in the Northern Territory, lies a spectacular concentration of Aboriginal rock art. The Lightning Brothers, Yagjadbula and Jabaringa, with wide dark eyes and dramatically striped bodies are ancestral beings who in the Dreamtime helped shape the traditional land of the Wardaman Aboriginal people. This multi-award winning film shows how the Wardaman people see the Lightning Brothers as part of their living culture, and it features the music of \"Gondwanaland\". Narrated by Bob Maza."
