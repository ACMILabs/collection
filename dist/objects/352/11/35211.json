        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". Set in Verona during the Italian Renaissance this is the story of two young people whose families, the Montagues and the Capulets, are involved in a deep and bitter feud. Despite this enmity the youngsters fall in love and secretly marry. During a street brawl Romeo's friend Mercurio is killed by Juliet's cousin, Tybalt. Enraged by his friend's death Romeo kills Tybalt and is banished from Verona. In desperation Juliet takes a sleeping potion, which induces a deathlike sleep. Romeo, hearing that she is dead takes his own life. Juliet upon rousing from her self-induced sleep and finding her lover dead, kills herself. The two houses of Montague and Capulet make a tardy sorrowful peace. Featuring Patrick Ryecart as Romeo, Rebecca Saire as Juliet and Michael Hordern as Capulet."
