        "Founded in 1926 by Marie Rambert, Rambert Dance Company is one of dance's most consistently innovative and imaginative companies. Here are three modern dances by the company featuring music by Bill Withers. The three are: \"Lonely Town, Lonely Street\" a jazz ballet which conveys a picture of lonely people in a large city; \"Intimate Pages\" using Janacek's Second String Quartet; and \"Sergeant Early's Dream\" recalling the folklore of the old world with British, Irish and American folk songs.
