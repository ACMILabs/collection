        "Cool Cats traces the evolution of rock-related style, fashion and affectation; from stovepipe trousers, drape jackets and duck's tail haircuts to bondage straps, androgynous jumpsuits and lethal Mohican scalp spikes. The performances and posturing of the Rolling Stones, Little Richard, Tina Turner, The Beatles, among others, are intertwined with observations from the likes of Pete Townshend, Phil Everly, Malcolm McLaren and Grace Slick.
