        "Episode of Series \"BBC Television Shakespeare Series\". Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, falls into melancholia after the death of his father, the king. Claudius, his father's brother, has assumed the throne and married Hamlet's mother, Gertrude, within two months of the king's death. The king's ghost appears to his son, denounces Claudius for the murderer he is, and demands revenge. Hamlet pretends madness in order to avenge his father's death. Ophelia's rejection of his suit provides a plausible reason for this display of madness. Overcome by doubts about the validity of the king's accusation Hamlet persuades some travelling players to re-enact the death of the king, eventually exposing Claudius as a murderer."
