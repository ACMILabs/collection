        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Writers on Writing\". Writers on Writing is based on a growing archive of video material, of conversations between contemporary writers discussing their work. The material has been re-edited to form a resource for students and teachers of English, and each of the six twenty-minute videos focuses on different aspects and stages of the writing process. Each video is accompanied by a resource booklet. In this video, a discussion about the difference between writing novels, poems and screenplays is followed by a section on genre, which concentrates on crime writing, science fiction, fairy tales and myths."
