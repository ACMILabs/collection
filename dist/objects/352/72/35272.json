        "In June 1967, the Mamas and the Papas hosted a three day Pop Festival in Monterey, California. D.A. Pennebaker's outstanding film is a record of extraordinary musicians and extraordinary insight into an era. This is the 60's in celebration, exploding with new voices and optimistic energy. Performing artists include Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, Simon and Garfunkel, Scott McKenzie, Eric Burdon and the Animals, Canned Heat and The Who."
