        "Loosely based on Lucie Aubrac's account of her time in the French Resistance - 'Outwitting the Gestapo', Claude Berri's film is an attempt at recreating the style of classic war films, in which a love story unfolds against a backdrop of action and danger. Devoted couple Lucie (Carole Bouquet) and Raymond Aubrac (Daniel Auteuil) are both heavily involved in a Resistance network operating in the Lyons area. Summoned to attend a a secret meeting with other Resistance leaders, Raymond is arrested by the Gestapo following treason from an insider to the movement. Taken to the infamous Montluc prison, Raymond is interrogated by Klaus Barbie. Desperate to save her husband, Lucie makes every attempt to establish contact with Raymond and set him free in time to celebrate their anniversary. Her first ploy is to pass for Aubrac's pregnant girlfriend and to plea with Barbie to let her marry the father of her child and save her reputation. Then comes the organisation of Raymond's escape during a prisoner transport. In French with English subtitles."
