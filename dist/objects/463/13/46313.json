        "Easter in the modern world. The meaning of Easter is the manifold sacrifice of God and Man in the person of Jesus, atoning for the sins of mankind. Unfortunately this meaning escapes many younger Australians. Both the passion of Christ and the meaning of Easter contrast the nonchalant reality of the young people, who drift throught the Easter weekend without a thought for its 'sacred' significance and its application to their relatively empty lives. Written by Peter Tammer, camera by Tom Cowan and organ by Harold Fabrikant."
