        "John Hughes spirited teen comedy stars Molly Ringwald as Samantha Baker, an average teenage girl whose awkward trek through adolescence becomes unbearable when her parents forget her sixteenth birthday. To make matters worse the high school geek (Anthony Michael Hall) starts hitting on her while Samantha negotiates her own painful crush for the handsome but taken senior, Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling). Aside from some moments of broad slapstick and crass stereotypes, Hughes makes some pointed observations on the trials, rituals and tribulations of American teenagers and in the process created a teen icon out of his luminous lead Molly Ringwald. \"Sixteen candles\" was the beginning of a very lucrative career in teen movies for Hughes who cornered the market in the 80's with such films as \"The \"Breakfast club\", \"Pretty in pink\" and \"Ferris Buellers day off\". Cast also includes John Cusack, Justin Henry, Paul Dooley, Gedde Watanabe, Jami Gertz and Joan Cusack."
