        "The picturesque St. Lawrence, Canada's river of history, welcomes Queen Elizabeth II to the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Many close-ups of the Queen, Prince Philip and President Eisenhower are shown. The theme of the film is the river's history, from its discovery by French explorers to its opening to the shipping of the world. This is an abridged version."
