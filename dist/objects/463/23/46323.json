        "Mary is an American housewife trying to make the heart-rending decision of whether to go back to her husband and family or remain in Rome with her lover, Giovanni, a university professor she has met during her stay. Most of the story takes place in the Rome railway station, where Mary and Giovanni meet for one last desperate rendezvous. Their search for a secluded spot where they can be together, threatens to expose their illicit affair. However, an understanding railroad commissioner releases the two and Mary is permitted to return to her husband with an unsullied reputation. Cast includes: Jennifer Jones, Montgomery Clift, Gino Cervi and Richard Beymer."
