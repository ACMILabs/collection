        "Comedian Mike Myers (Wayne's World) takes on the dual role of sixties super spy, renowned fashion photographer and insatiable casanova Austin Powers and his arch-enemy Dr Evil in this colourful parody of the James Bond films. Starting off in swinging London of the sixties, the film quickly moves into the present when Austin Powers must travel across time to stop Dr. Evil's world conquering exploits, who has cryogenically frozen himself (and his cat Mr. Bigglesworth) and resurfaced in the nineties. Much of the films fish out of water humour is based on the difficulty Austin has in adjusting to a modern world that has little tolerance for a promiscuous, sexist, British secret agent with bad teeth and Dr Evil's thwarted plans to outsmart a society that is far more advanced in notions of evil. Cast also includes Mimi Rogers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York and Robert Wagner."
