        "Made under the supervision of Prof. W. E. Peterson, internationally recognized dairying expert, this film condenses a vast amount of scientific data into a simple and easily understood account of how the cow functions as a milk factory. The productive life of a cow can be considered in four period: (1) dry cow; (2) calf; (3) growing heifer; (4) milk cow. Through the use of animated diagrams and actual laboratory experiments carried out at the University of Minnesota, USA, the functioning of the cow's digestive and milk-producing organs are demonstrated. The importance of proper diet for the cow, and the correct use of the milking machine (as well as the results of incorrect use) are demonstrated, and the film points out the factors which can be made to contribute to a plentiful, high quality milk yield."
