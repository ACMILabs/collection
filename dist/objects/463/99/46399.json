        "Simple fisherman Fei (Andy Lau) finds himself caught up in an extraordinary situation after assisting fugitive Prince (Kenny Bee) and his bodyguard Hsien (Maggie Cheung) after they have been ambushed in the forest near his home. Unaware of their identities at first, he invites them to take refuge in his village, where he learns of the conflict that has driven the Prince into fleeing his ancestral home. The Prince, appreciative of Fei's skill with a sword, asks him to accompany Hsien on a mission to rescue his betrothed, Princess Yuen (Anita Mui), and her father, the Emperor Lan-Ning Kwan. When they reach the Emperor and his daughter, they are confronted by a calculated surprise attack that leaves almost everyone except dead. A tangled web begins to unravel amidst the chaos, uncovering the devastating truth. An epic, atmospheric tale of rivalry, betrayal and revenge from legendary director Samo Hung, internationally renowned for creating original and aggressively acrobatic fight scenes in Hong Kong action films. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
