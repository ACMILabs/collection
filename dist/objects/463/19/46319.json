        "Every day, streams of people, goods and commodities of all descriptions come into Canada at border crossings along the 6 500 km Canada-U.S. border, and via airports and seaports. Keeping the traffic moving expeditiously, at the same time ensuring that Canadian government regulations concerning immigration, customs and excise, health, and agriculture are observed, is the job of the Customs Officer. This is a colorful, coast-to-coast look at the variety that enters into his day."
