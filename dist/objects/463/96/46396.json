Using still pictures, excerpts and extensive interviews, director Philo Bregstein charts Pasolini's matriculation into one of the most controversial cinematic figures in the world. The film includes interviews with Pasolini's long term collaborator, the actress Laura Betti, author Alberto Moravia, director Bernardo Bertolucci and others."
