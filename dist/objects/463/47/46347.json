        "A study of the rebuilding program of the English Channel town of Dover, which suffered heavy damage from shellfire during WWII. The historic town is to be, very largely, rebuilt on a new site, and extensive use is to be made of recently developed prefabrication techniques. Good use of British humour gives this doco additional interest."
