        "Tim Burton pays homage to a Hollywood visionary in this unusual, fictionalised biography of the world's worst director, Edward D. Wood Jr. The film follows Wood in his quest for film greatness as he writes and directs turkey after turkey, cross-dresses, and surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, outcasts, has-beens and never-weres. The real story however, is his friendship with ageing, morphine-addicted Bela Lugosi, for whom he tries to stage a comeback. Cast includes: Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Bill Murray, Jeffrey Jones and Lisa Marie."
