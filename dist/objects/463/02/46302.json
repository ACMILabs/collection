        "These children are representative of 100 who commenced primary school in Carlton during 1951. Some children had attended the Lady Gowrie Pre-School Centre, some came from other kindergartens and creches and some had not attended any pre-school centre. The children were assembled for two weeks at the end of 1950 to study their vocabulary and this film was made of their unrehearsed and undirected activities. Photography by Rodney Power."
