        "Based on a true story, Tavernier's \"L'Appat\" is a troubling tale of dreamy teenagers aspiring to travel to America and make money, fleeing their family and money troubles in France. The three central characters are linked by Nathalie (Marie Gillain)- salesgirl and aspiring model, who lives with her handsome boyfriend Eric (Olivier Sitruk) who spends most of his day watching videos with their housemate and friend, Bruno (Bruno Putzulu). Eric and Bruno come up with a plan to swindle money from well off suitors contained in Nathalie's little black book. Things do not go to plan however and the three are forced to own up to the consequences of their actions when their botched attempts at robbery become increasingly violent. Their true natures are brought to the harsh light of day when confronted by the police as their friendship changes irrevocably. In French with English subtitles."
