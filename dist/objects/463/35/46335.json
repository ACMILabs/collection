        "Tom Di Cillo's acute comedy on the horrors of low-budget film making originally started life as a short film before it was extended to feature length. The unfolding dream within a dream narrative follows the perils and follies of an overworked film crew trying to get the perfect scene down on the set of a low-budget movie. Technical hiccups and budget restrictions aside, the motley group of crew members have to contend with an egotistical film star (James LeGros), a neurotic actress (Catherine Keener), their stressed out director (Steve Buscemi), his sensitive cinematographer (Dermot Mulroney), and a pissed off midget (Peter Dinklage). Clashing ego's aside, 'Living in oblivion' is ultimately an affectionate tribute to the agony and ecstasy of making films and the resilient spirit of the independent film maker. Cast includes Danielle von Zerneck, Rica Martens, Kevin Corrigan, Hilary Gilford, Mathew Grace, Michael Griffiths. (Awards: 1995 Sundance Film festival, Waldo Salt screenwriting award for Tom Di Cillo, Joseph Tropiano)."
