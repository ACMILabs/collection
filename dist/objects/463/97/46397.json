        "In the years just after the Civil War, young Johnny (Bobby Driscoll) is sent to live at the southern plantation of his grandmother (Lucile Watson) while his parents contemplate divorce. At first disconsolate, the boy is cheered up by African-American handyman Uncle Remus (James Baskett), who tells him many delightful fables concerning the clever trickster Br'er Rabbit, whose adventures are illustrated in cartoon form. Based on the popular 'Uncle Remus' stories of Joel Chandler Harris and blending live action with cell animation, 'Song of the South' is an American classic, both loved for its popular songs and seamless technique, and reviled for its condescending depiction of African-Americans. Also starring Hattie MacDaniel."
