        "A collection of five gay shorts from France which inventively explore a myriad of themes from sexual diversity, notions of family, and the erotic correlation between sex and death. \"Majorettes in space\" (Dir: David Fourier) - using a rapid mixture of word association and seemingly unconnected images, \"Majorettes in space\" thematically links topics as unlikely as the Pope, cheerleaders, safe sex and space exploration (1996); \"A little death\" (Dir: Francois Ozon) - a gay man comes to terms with his own mortality when he learns that his estranged father is dying (1995); \"One moment\" (Dir: Pierre Salvadori) - through clever use of point of view and hand held camera we experience first hand a highly charged one night stand between two men which leads to a careless split second decision (1996); \"Something different\" (Dir: Bruno Rolland) - a low key comedy about the unlikely relationship that develops between a transvestite butcher and a little boy (1994); \"A summer dress\" (Dir: Francois Ozon) - a young gay man on summer holiday with his lover has an unexpected encounter with a woman while sunbathing nude on the beach (1997)."
