        "The discovery and development of television is not the story of the efforts of a single person, but of many people. It is a search through a tangled web of scientific discoveries, inventions, and developments, of ideas tried and rejected and tried again, culminating with the efforts of an enthusiastic team of professionals led by Sir Isaac Shoenberg. Describes the early experiments in television leading to the first regular broadcasts from London beginning on 2nd November 1936. The work of the pioneers is reconstructed using contemporary records and interviews."
