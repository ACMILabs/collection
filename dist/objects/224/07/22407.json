        "If the screw fly entered Australia the cost to the cattle and sheep industries would be high. The screw worm fly is a danger to all warm-blooded animals, including man, and begins its cycle in flesh wounds. Papua New Guinea is the only screw worm-infected country near Australia, and it is pursuing research into control of this pest"
