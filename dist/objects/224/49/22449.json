        "The division of Germany and events leading up to it. Originally an administrative partition it became a physical division when a zone was cleared, a concrete wall and watch towers erected. The drain on man power caused by the flight of one in six East Germans resulted in almost total cessation of movement to the West. As long as the wall existed, political tensions could not be relieved."
