        "A film exploring the identity problems faced by young people built around four soft rock songs, which provide the only commentary. A father, trying to bridge the generation gap, attempts to reach an understanding with his son; a young girl trying to find herself, asks if anyone would care if she resigned from the human race; and the final segment, performed by a mime, illustrates how people build walls around themselves."
