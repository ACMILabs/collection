        "Coal, Gas, oil, electricity and wood are all sources of heat. Coal, oil, and gas are used as furnace fuels. Home heating has developed from the colonial fireplace of the early American settler to the modern steam, gas, or electric radiator. Heat transfer is carried out by conduction, convection, and radiation. All these points are studied in this film."
