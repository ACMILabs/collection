        "Courtesy and civilised personal behaviour as the basis of road safety. How bullying, rudeness and impatience set up a series of dangerous chain reactions; various road situations showing the danger of the driver's sense of power, and the need for courtesy as a complement to modern highway design. The risks to pedestrians, especially the old and very young. An old blind man and a schoolboy provide a story thread."
