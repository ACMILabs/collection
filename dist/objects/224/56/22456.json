        "James Watson and Francis Crick at Cambridge, Maurice Wilkins at King's College, London and Linus Pauling at Caltech describe the events and research leading to the discovery in 1953 of the double helix as a workable structure for DNA. Concentrates upon the role of chemistry and physics in finding the structure of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Gives some background to the rise of molecular biology and the foundation of crystallography and model building."
