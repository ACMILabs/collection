        "Three ways in which colors differ: hue, value and intensity. Hues as parts of the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. Between the basic hues are many in-between hues. The value of any hue may be lightened or darkened by adding white or black. The intensity of any hue can be lowered, or dulled, by adding its complementary hue. Techniques of color mixing: the great variety of color in the world around us."
