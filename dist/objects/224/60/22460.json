        "Briefly describes the organisation and purpose of the National Livestock Loss Prevention Board. Explains how cattle, sheep and hogs may be killed or badly bruised through wrong handling on the way to slaughter-yards. Shows examples of damaged carcasses, thus resulting in lower-grade meat. Also shows right and wrong methods of preparing road and railway trucks for transport of animals, of treating animals prior to transit and in transit, of loading and unloading animals."
