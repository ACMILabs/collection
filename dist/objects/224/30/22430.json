        "An examination of the physiological consequences of the impact of Western civilisation on the peoples of Papua New Guinea. The program reveals the subtle and insidious ways in which the Western way of life has irrevocably disturbed the human ecology of Papua New Guinea, and suggests that, in order to achieve social and economic viability as a competitive nation, Papua New Guinea must achieve a state of biological fitness. Narrated by Robert Bruning."
