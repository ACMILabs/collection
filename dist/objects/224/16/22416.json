        "Traces the history of jazz from its roots in nineteenth century black America. Rhythmic and melodic freedom were added to the harmony and structure of European music, and techniques like note bending, call and response were added. Jazz soon became popular and its form progressed from dixie and blues through such styles as swing, bop, cool jazz, funky and free improvisation."
