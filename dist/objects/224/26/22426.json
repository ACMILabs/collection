        "Episode of Series \"Discovery\". Australian scientists are looking at how the use of marijuana affects the mind and body of the user. Researchers and users are shown here examining what happens to a person who is under the influence of marijuana. They investigate the claims that are often made about this drug - that marijuana leads to the use of hard drugs. Marijuana is now illegal in most countries, but the marijuana explosion of the 60s and 70s has led to a growing campaign supporting legislation."
