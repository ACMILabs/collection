        "Illustrates how plant pests and diseases are spread by the carelessness of travellers carrying fruit, vegetables and plants across State borders. Strict quarantine regulations have been enforced to prevent the spread of disease to the Murray and Barossa Valleys. In South Australia, free of Black Spot and Codlin Moth, the importation of apples from interstate or overseas is prohibited. In recent years, Fruit Fly has been introduced into Victoria and South Australia necessitating costly spraying and destruction of fruit in infected areas, an undertaking which is the result of carelessness of a few individuals in the community."
