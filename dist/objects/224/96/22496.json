Shows volunteer and professional relief workers and army and government officials involved in famine relief. Both the victims and the rehabilitation attempts are shown against a background of physical and political conditions. Other credits: \"made by Ossie Emery, Betti Wood, Don Clay, John Morrow and many others\"."
