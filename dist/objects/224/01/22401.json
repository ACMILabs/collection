        "To better acquaint students with the role of the director in motion picture production, this film takes them behind the scenes both before and during the filming of Eugene Ionesco's play \"The New Tenant\". Scenes from the early stages of planning and preparation are intercut with scenes from the completed film version of the play to enable students to better understand how the director's initial thoughts and ideas are realized."
