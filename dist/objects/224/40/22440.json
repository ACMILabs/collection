        "A study of a typical industrial dispute and the real reason behind it. A personal incident between an operative and a foreman grows, until the whole factory is brought to a stand-still. Concentrates in turn on the operative, the foreman, the shop steward and the factory manager, showing how each of them came to take the attitude he did and how each felt he had no alternative and was unable to withdraw."
