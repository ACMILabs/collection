        "Children with handicaps are often placed at a distinct disadvantage by most intelligence tests. This film advocates adapting tests to fit the needs of a child's handicap so that true abilities can be measured. Psychologist Zola Anderson modifies psychological testing procedures to fit the abilities of a six-year-old child with cerebral palsy and a four-year-old child with mild mental retardation."
