        "An animated film which proves the maxim that one cannot travel two roads at the same time without being diminished. Vascillating from side to side, a man struggles to make a decision. In an effort to make the \"perfect\" choice he divides himself and travels two paths. However when his two halves attempt to reunite one half has shrunk."
