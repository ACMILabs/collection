        "The transporting of a distillation column, 137 feet long, 500 miles by road from Greenwich to Grangemouth in Scotland. The commentary, spoken by the rigger in charge and one of the tractor drivers, expresses the humour and resourcefulness with which these transport workers tackle their job. The camera has captured moments of beauty as well as some amusing episodes in this journey of the longest load to travel by road in England."
