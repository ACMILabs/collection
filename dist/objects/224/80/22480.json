        "Donald Duck participates in a remarkable adventure and learns that music, architecture, art and science are all based on mathematical principles. Tracing the history and development of these principles, we find the Arabs responsible for our present numbers and algebra; Egypt the source of geometric theories, the pyramids remaining as a monument to their knowledge of the triangle; and to the Greeks Pythagoras we owe our musical scale."
