        "Harmony is a pleasing agreement in the things we hear, see, or do. Many things are harmonious in the world of nature. Harmony in art can be achieved in various ways. Firstly by limiting the number of objects, colors and shapes we use; secondly, by repeating objects, colors and shapes; thirdly, by using related objects, colors and shapes."
