        "Written by New York playwright Millard Lampell and starring Hollywood's Ed Begley, this film tells the story of an aging union leader who, after a lifetime of service for the cause, finds that he has outlived his usefulness and esteem among the workers of his factory, that times have changed and a new strategy is needed in bargaining with the company. It is the situation of a man who must retire."
