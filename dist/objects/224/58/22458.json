        "A satire on cartoons, home hobbyists, and box-top specials, in which the viewer is offered an animation kit, complete with noises, cut-out characters and stick-anything adhesive glue, all for fifty guineas and three detergent box tops. Very much in the Monty Python style - made by Keith Learner, Nancy Hanna, Bob Godfrey and Vera Linnecar."
