        "Using 16mm filmed sequences of motion through different urban and natural spaces, this footage will create a sense of vertigo and velocity across different planes of movement; through space as experienced via car or foot; above space as experienced through elevators and mechanical escalation and across space as experienced via train and so forth. Across different passages of time and space \"day, night, city, underground, suburban, rural, alleyway and so forth\" the material will imaginatively explore the way a viewing experience can defy human motion and create a dizzying, disorienting but at all times wondrous and alluring moving image experience."
