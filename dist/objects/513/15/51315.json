        "Part one of a three part series of programs about NASA space flights entitled \"The American Space Odyssey\". \"NASA 1\" traces the history of American space travel championed by United States President John F. Kennedy and contains extensive footage from various space missions including Apollo 7, Apollo 9 and Apollo 13. This documentary comprises archival images of various take-offs, the earth from outer space, the launching of satellites, the effects of zero gravity, astronauts amending equipment whilst hanging in space, and craft re-entry to earth. Astronaut Walter Cunningham describes the events that surrounded the dramatic mission that was Apollo 13's, whilst other astronauts describe the process of launching a rocket, the emotions, the perils and the joys of space flight, narrating their experiences whilst watching videos of their trips. Also features excerpts from an earlier documentary by Lester Novros (who worked on Kubrick's \"2001: A Space odyssey\"), with images of galactic whirlpools, stars, the universe and black holes taken from satellites, both manned and unmanned as well as theories of universal evolution and the wonders of space. Narrated by William Shatner (\"Star Trek\")."
