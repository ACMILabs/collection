        "It's elementary provides parents and educators with information and advice on tackling gay and lesbian issues in schools. The documentary uses classroom footage and interviews with parents and teachers to examine what happens when homosexuality is discussed in the classroom. A wide range of teaching techniques and results are observed in six American schools of varying age levels, geographical locations, socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. Issues such as homophobia, harassment, stereotypes, the law and family are discussed with students via brainstorming, storytelling, writing and guest speakers. The overriding relevancy of discussing homosexuality in schools and the appropriateness of the subject matter for various age groups is questioned and reinforced. The controversies, debates and opinions displayed in \"It's elementary\" make fascinating viewing for a wide audience."
