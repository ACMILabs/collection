        "Join Private Olive Oyl and her friend Alice as they go into training at Fort Dragg in eight adventure-filled animated cartoons. See our hero Corporal Popeye face all manner of challenges to win the heart of his dear Olive while Sergeant Bluto goes out of his way to make life difficult for one and all at the camp. And of course where there's Swee'pea, there's bound to be trouble particularly when Swee'pea takes a fancy to parachuting. Something for everyone to enjoy. Executive producers: William Hanna and Joseph Barbera."
