        "Continuation of the Japanese animated series \"Lain\", Volume 03 \"Deus\", episodes (layers) 8, 9 and 10. Lain is an introverted thirteen year old schoolgirl who is drawn into the world of \"The Wired\" (a euphemism for the Internet), an alternate reality where minds roam freely unencumbered by their mortal body. Episode 8, \"Rumours in the Wired\": Lain reveals her aggressive alter ego whilst trying to ascertain whether there is a God. Meanwhile, Lain in the real world becomes increasingly frightened and attempts to wrestle control of her life. Episode 9, \"Protocol\": in this episode the history of computers that lead to the establishment of the Wired is explained; Lain confronts Taro, suspecting that he is a Knight. Episode 10, \"Love\": Lain comes face-to-face with God in the Wired. Conceptually, \"Lain\" is comparable to the classic definition of cyberpunk - a paranoid moral and psychological parable that centres on the relationships between people and technology."
