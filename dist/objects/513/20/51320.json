        "This stylish and action packed Japanese anime television series is set in a 21st century dystopia - the earth is a wasteland and the solar system is besieged by a proliferation of gangsters. A motley group of bounty hunters, who ride aboard their rickety ship, the 'Bebop', reluctantly band together. The group consists of Spike Siegel, a vicious fighter whose cynicism covers painful memories; Jet Black, a former policeman; Faye Valentine, a femme fatale and compulsive gambler; and Ed, a computer hacker girl. Session 11 \"Toys in the attic\" When Jet is bitten by a mysterious organism, Spike and Ed are forced into the bowels of the Bebop to try to uncover the source and save their workmate. This episode has much in common with \"Aliens\" with a similar brand of black humour. Session 12 \"Jupiter jazz (1)\" Faye absconds with the Bebop loot and Jet wishes to retrieve her but Spike is more interested in tracking down Julia, his long-lost love - a quest which draws him into confrontation with arch-nemesis, Vicious. Session 13 \"Jupiter jazz (2)\" As Jet hunts for Faye and the missing money, Faye tries to uncover the secrets of the elusive Gren, a man/woman seeking vengeance. Session 14 \"Bohemian rhapsody\" After a series of robberies at the high tech toll booths that control interstellar travel, the Bebop crew are enlisted to track down the perpetrators. \"Cowboy Bebop\" is an amusing cross-pollination between anime, the Western, classic Sci-fi flicks, and neo-noir with an anti-hero narrative overlayed with ultra cool aesthetics."
