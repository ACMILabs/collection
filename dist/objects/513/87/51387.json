        "Presented by Walt Disney's nephew Roy E. Disney, \"Fantasia 2000\" is a realisation of Walt's dream to reissue his marriage of music and animation that was \"Fantasia\" (1940). The brief introduction also covers Disney milestones in animation innovation. \"Fantasia\" was a grand experiment in film-making, a concert film and homage to animation. Stylistically speaking, it prescribed the use of Fantasound which included 64 speakers. Disney originally intended the film to be periodically re-released with the inclusion of new scenes; due to poor audience response and various other factors, this wish never eventuated - until now. Shot on Imax by seven directors (Pixote Hunt, Hendel Butoy, Eric Goldberg, James Algar, Francis Glebas, Gaetan and Paul Brizzi, Don Hahn), \"Fantasia 2000\" presents seven new segments and only one carry over scene from the original - Mickey Mouse in \"The Sorcerer's apprentice.\" This new interpretation of music from composers such as Beethoven, Respighi, Gershwin, Shostakovich and Stavinsky received mixed reviews from critics who thought it did not match the continuity of style of the original or the substance. Steve Martin, Bette Midler, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury and Quincy Jones are just a few of the big names who introduce each segment. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra is conducted by James Levine."
