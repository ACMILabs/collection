        "A self-reflexive spy spoof, \"What's up Tiger Lily?\" marked Woody Allen's feature debut. Here Allen takes an original Japanese film entitled \"Kagi no kagi\" and replaces the dialogue with dubbed English to create a comic send-up of a James Bond style crime solving flick. Phil Moskowitz, a loveable rogue is on a deadly mission to prevent a winning recipe for egg-salad from falling into the wrong hands. With the help of some beautiful aides, Moskowitz must foil the plans of the evil Shepherd Wong. The film features a bevy of Japanese beauties and falls into predictable notions of gender and genre. Allen followed up this film with other slapstick comedies such as \"Bananas\" and \"Take the money and run\" at the start of a prolific and successful career as a writer/director/actor."
