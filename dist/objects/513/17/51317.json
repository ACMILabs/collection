    "description": [
        "Part three of a three part series of programs about NASA space flights entitled \"The American Space Odyssey\". \"Skylab: 4 rooms, earth view\": the establishment of the space station Skylab, launched on May 14, 1973, marked a transition within NASA from space exploration to space exploitation. Presented by E.G. Marshall, this documentary looks at the purpose of Skylab as an economic venture and the experiences of the three crew who lived on the station. \"Who's out there?\": presented by Orson Welles and narrated by Peter Thomas, this program speculates on the eternal question \"is there extraterrestrial life?\". Taking the famous radio broadcast of H.G. Wells \"War of the worlds\" as a starting point, the film explores our fears of invasion by unfriendly aliens. A symposium of experts debate the question and Welles offers some philosophical ramblings."
