        "The second of the \"Road\" series sees Chuck (Crosby) and his pal Fearless (Hope) fleeing a South African carnival after their sideshow causes a fire. After several similar escapades, they finally save enough money to return to the States, where Chuck spends it all on a 'lost' diamond mine. But that's only the beginning. Before long, a pair of attractive con-women have tricked our heroes into financing a comic safari, featuring numerous burlesque jungle adventures. Much of the film's humour reportedly derived from on-set improvisations. Cast includes Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour and Una Merkel. Costume design, Edith Head."
