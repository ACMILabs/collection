        "This comic mockumentary about a punk band that embarks on a disastrous final comeback tour, begs comparison to the seminal rock-mockumentary \"This is Spinal Tap\" (1983). Yet while both films mime the cliches of the rock and roll lifestyle with hilarious results, \"Hard Core Logo\" is less of an out-and-out farce than its predecessor. Its tongue-in-cheek exploration of small time rock celebrity and friendship gone sour, is tinged by a darker, ruder, more nihlistic undertone characteristic of punk rock's ethos. After re-uniting for a benefit performance fifteen years after their acrimonious breakup, the members of legendary Vancouver punk rock band Hard Core Logo decide to do one last farewell tour across western Canada, accompanied by a documentary film crew. As soon as they hit the road the hostilities between the egomaniacal lead singer and the charismatic guitarist - the only band member with a future in music - that originally split the band quickly rise to the surface again. Meanwhile having forgotten his medication, the bass player is struggling with his mental stability, while Pipefitter, the redneck stoned drummer, is oblivious to everything. Predictably the tour soon declines into melodrama and ultimately, tragedy. Cast includes Hugh Dillon, Callum Keith Rennie, Bernie Coulson, John Pyper-Ferguson."
