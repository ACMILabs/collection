        "Exposed to a nuclear explosion, Dr Banner is a male scientist who has been infected with powerful gamma rays. When he becomes angry an energy surge transforms him into The Incredible Hulk - a burly green man of limited mental capacity but infinite strength and determination, who fights evil. This tape consists of three episodes, broken down into three segments, from the animated television series, adapted from the Marvel Comic. Set amidst the Cold War period, American army intelligence forces battle the Russians and fight terrorization from outer space creatures. Banner, who works for the mistrusting army, struggles with his alter ego, the monstrous Hulk. In these episodes Banner tries to continue his research but he is continuously fighting off enemy hoards, being captured and, when turning into the Hulk under stress, escaping. Episode one: \"A Titan rides the train\". \"The Horde of the humanoids\", \"On the rampage\" Episode two: \"The Power of Dr Banner\". \"Where strides the behemoth\". \"Back from the dead\". Episode three: \"Micro-monsters\". \"The Lair of the leader\". \"To live again\". In episodes two and three, the tape has occasional tracking problems and minor moments of audio dropout."
