        "Saturday night live debuted on October 11, 1975, introducing to American television an irreverent type of comedy that parodied sitcoms, chat shows, news, entertainment shows and American culture. \"SNL\" frequently used scatological and satirical humour that was frequently accused of being offensive to mainstream audiences. The show served to introduce a slew of comedians to the entertainment arena, many of whom went on to have stellar careers in film and television. This DVD is the 25th anniversary special that was aired in 1999 and featuring, among others, spots from Tom Hanks, Adam Sandler, Lily Tomlin, Alec Baldwin, Chevy Chase, Jon Lovitz, Martin Short, James Van Der Beek, Molly Shannon, Jerry Seinfeld, Drew Barrymore, Kevin Spacey, David Spade, Mike Myers, Steve Martin, Garth Brooks, Michael Douglas, Candice Bergen and Dan Ackroyd. Also contains archival footage of famous skits taken from the history of the show, including performances by Christopher Walken, Chris Farley, Eddie Murphy, Dana Carvey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, John Belushi, Billy Crystal, Martin Short, Chris Rock, Al Franken, Madonna, Andy Kaufman and Bill Murray. The show featured many musical acts over the years and the highlights include: Elvis Costello, Sting, Steve Tyler, The Beastie Boys, Blondie, and David Bowie."
