        "This stylish and action packed Japanese anime television series is set in a 21st century dystopia where the earth is a wasteland and the solar system is besieged by a proliferation of gangsters. A motley group of bounty hunters who occupy a rickety ship, the 'Bebop', reluctantly band together. The group consists of Spike Siegel, a vicious fighter whose cynicism covers painful memories; Jet Black, a former policeman; Faye Valentine, a femme fatale and compulsive gambler; and Ed, a computer hacker girl. Session 15 \"My funny Valentine\" Faye tries to come to terms with the fact that she knows little about her past, prior to being cryogenically frozen. Session 16 \"Black dog serenade\" A riot on a prison ship unites Jet with an old cohort from his police days. When the criminal is the same one responsible for the loss of his arm, Jet seeks retribution. Session 17 \"Mushroom samba\" The Bebop is out of fuel, cash and food - consequently Ed takes on a bounty hunter mission, looking for a crooked magic mushroom dealer. Session 18 \"Speak like a child\" An anonymous package arrives for Faye, which leads to some clues about her mystifying past. \"Cowboy Bebop\" is an amusing cross-pollination between anime, the Western genre, classic Sci-fi flicks, and neo-noir with an anti-hero narrative overlayed with ultra cool aesthetics."
