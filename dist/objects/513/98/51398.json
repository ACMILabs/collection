        "Spider-Man and his alter ego Peter Parker feature in these two animated adventures by John Semper. \"The Hobgoblin\": Peter moves into a new apartment with rich friend Harry Osborn who has a powerful but absent father. Peter and Harry attend the opening of the Fisk School of Criminology and trouble ensues when an attempt is made on Fisk's life by the Hobgoblin. Fisk is also a Kingpin; Harry's father the silent partner. When Harry is kidnapped, Mr Osborn is forced to choose between his son and his invention. Voices provided by: Christopher Daniel Barnes, Edward Asner, Linda Gary, Maxwell Caulfield, Mark Hamill. \"The Menace of Mysterio\": Jewels are stolen from the Metropolitan Museum and the thief is sighted as none other than Spider-Man. Mysterio, a media hungry creature in a costume, sans head, puts Spider-Man on notice and vows to replace him as super hero for the city. Is Mysterio a clever magician or a worthy super villain opponent? Voices provided by: Christopher Daniel Barnes, Edward Asner, Linda Gary, Gregg Berger."
