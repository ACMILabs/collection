        "Compelling and informative, \"Chasing Buddha\" is a biographical documentary about Robina Courtin, a highly energetic, outrageous, radical feminist, lesbian Australian Buddhist nun. Born one of seven children and raised as a Catholic, Robina candidly tells of her journey from childhood through to her teens and adult life and of the uncontained energy that drove her into becoming a political activist and radical feminist during the 70s, and finally the \"accidental\" path which lead her to Buddhism and to her Llama. Loud, enigmatic, charismatic, this amazing woman spends most of her time in the United States where she runs an international magazine, Mandala, teaches and councils students in Buddhism and visits prisoners on life sentences or on death row offering them spiritual guidance and the teachings of Buddha. Totally committed in her beliefs but not afraid to be outspoken or even confrontational, Robina has won the hearts of many and is highly respected wherever she goes. Includes narratives by family and friends, stills, home movies and archival footage. Director Amiel Courtin-Wilson, Robina's nephew, was nominated in the AFI Awards (2000) for Best Direction in a Documentary."
