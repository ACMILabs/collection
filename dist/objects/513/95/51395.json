        "Comedy venture from the team of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, \"The Road to Singapore\" is a sprightly film that consistently amuses and entertains. Crosby plays Josh Mallon, the irresponsible son of a shipping magnate who would rather hang with his carefree sailor buddy Ace Lannigan (Hope) than realise his father's lofty aspirations for him. On the eve of his wedding to long-time fiancee Gloria, Josh hightails it to Singapore with Ace in tow. Once there, the boys' friendship falls under a cloud when they're both attracted to saucy nightclub singer Mima (Dorothy Lamour) who goes on the lam from her possessive boyfriend Caesar (Anthony Quinn). As the boys slug it out for Mima's affections, Gloria turns up in search of her wayward husband to be. The exoticism, spontaneity, lushness and passion of the East is contrasted with the cool, emotionless Western moneyed arena of Gloria's world. Watch for an intriguing scene in which Crosby and Hope go 'native'. This successful film, featuring several musical interludes, spawned six more \"Road to...\" movies starring Hope and Crosby."
