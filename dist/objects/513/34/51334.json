        "Two professional assassins engage in a battle of wits as they vie for the title of Asia's number one hitman. Tok (Andy Lau), is an up-and-coming professional with an extravagant and flamboyant style, given to copying schemes of mass destruction from the movies and possessed of a diabolical wit. His antagonist is the Japanese-speaking O (Takashi Sorimachi), a discrete and efficient hitman who single-mindedly carries out his lethal tasks then fades into obscurity. The two men are preoccupied with the same woman, Chin (Kelly Lin), who, while Chinese, speaks fluent Japanese and runs a video store that rents films from Japan. Through a series of bloody encounters that take place across Asia, the assassins find themselves both allies and enemies, their rivalry culminating in fateful showdown. With 'Fulltime Killer' Johnnie To, a specialist of action cinema whose heterogeneous work oscillates between the grotesque (The Heroic Trio) and the minimalist (The Mission), has co-directed a crazed, exciting homage to the 'bullet ballet' sub-genre, laden with self-reflexive references and illogical narrative leaps. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
