        "An elderly Jewish farming couple living in Nazi-occupied Eastern Hungary, have spent a lifetime attempting to bear healthy offspring, but none of their seven children have survived. It is 1943 and with the Holocaust looming, they are determined not to let their spiritual heritage and worldly possessions disappear with their demise. They adopt a seven-year-old Gentile orphan and though the boy is initially rebellious and distrustful, the love, patience and understanding he receives from his adoptive parents win him over. Just as the three have formed a strong and loving family bond, the Nazi's round-up of Jews begins and the parents must find a way to protect the boy. Full of humour, compassion, and beauty, this tragic story features a superbly natural performance from Gabor Feher as the boy, which lends it a special poignancy. In Hungarian with English subtitles. Cast also includes Ferenc Zenthe and Hedi Temessy."
