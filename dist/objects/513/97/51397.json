        "Wonderfully humorous animated children's film, based around the character Buzz Lightyear from Pixar's enormously successful \"Toy story\". Buzz (a vainglorious and brave space hero) and his partner Agent Z are sent to rescue a swarm of Little Green Men, kidnapped by the evil Zurg, who is trying to discover the secret of their united minds. When Z is lost in battle a disheartened Buzz becomes determined to work alone. When he is ordered to team with Mira Nova, a crack rookie Space Ranger who is also a princess, Buzz faces some serious competition. \"Buzz Lightyear\" uses traditional cell animation, instead of the digital animation utilised to such great effect in \"Toy story\", but the humour of this film easily matches the amusing parodying tone of Pixar's other feature films, which should prove a delight for children. Features the voices of Tim Allen, Wayne Knight, Nicole Sullivan, Stephen Furst, Larry Miller, Adam Carolla, Diedrich Bader and Patrick Warburton."
