        "This is a tale about a seven-year-old boy, from a loving family, happy and healthy, who has decided that when he grows up he wants to be a woman. Ludovic throws his parents life into turmoil as he dresses up in girl's clothing, plays with make-up and plans to marry the boy next door. Ludovic's parents and their peers react with alarm at Ludovic's pronouncements but Ludovic himself is a very together child. Director and screenwriter Alain Berliner presents \"Ma vie en rose\" as a modern fable, replete with scenes of magic realism and flights of fancy. The difficulties faced by Ludovic's sexuality are presented as mostly challenges for the parents rather than the child. The perspective of the film is mostly Ludovic's - which makes for an engaging comedy/drama, as Ludo is such a warm and heartfelt character. A film about family, acceptance, and sexual orientation, this was Alain Berliner's debut feature. Cast includes Michele Laroque, Jean-Philippe Ecoffey, Helene Vincent, Georges Du Fresne. In French with English subtitles."
