        "Part two of a three part series of programs about NASA space flights entitled \"The American Space Odyssey\". \"Gemini project\" is an award winning documentary produced by NASA, introduced by astronaut Charles Duke and narrated by astronaut Bob Marcato, that details the space missions that preceded and laid the groundwork for the Apollo Project. The Gemini project consisted of ten missions carried out in the space of eighteen months and provided data and test results essential to the success of the Apollo missions. \"Apollo 16: nothing so hidden\" introduced by astronaut Charles Duke and narrated by astronaut Stan Wessel, details the mission to the lunar highlands of the moon which cover 80% of its surface. Astronauts Charlie Duke and John Young scaled mountains in their lunar vehicle to collect samples and conduct experiments. This mission is also memorable for the impressive photos of the earth and space taken with a special camera. \"Astro smiles: laughs in space\", introduced by astronaut Wally Schirra takes a look at some of the more light-hearted moments of astronauts experiences in space."
