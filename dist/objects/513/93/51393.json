        "Spanky, Alfalfa, and the other 'little rascals' made famous in the Hal Roach 'Our Gang' shorts of the 1920s and 1930s, test the boundaries of friendship when Alfalfa falls head over heels for Darla. As a member of the \"He-Man Womun Haters Club', Alfalfa has sworn to hate women, and must hide his crush. A task he believes will be simple, as the boys are focused on the upcoming go-cart derby, and their prize-winning go-cart 'The Blur'. Unfortunately Alfalfa's best friend and club president Spanky discovers his friend has breached the number one club rule, and attempts to sabotage the relationship before it begins, starting a chain reaction of comical mistakes and misunderstandings. Features cameos by Whoopi Goldberg, Donald Trump, Mel Brooks, Daryl Hannah and Reba McEntire."
