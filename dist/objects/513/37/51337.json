        "In this, the third in a trilogy of early films that Jackie Chan both directed and starred in, Chan refines his screen persona of the precocious, mischievious kung fu kid. Despite his comic buffoonery, when it comes to the crunch his highly honed martial arts skills save the day. Like the previous films in the trilogy (\"The Fearless Hyena\" (1979), \"The Young Master\" (1980)), 'Dragon Lord' is set in the countryside during the late Quing period. Chan plays the son of a wealthy man. He and his childhood friend spend their time participating in sporting events and competing to woo the village beauty. His carefree life takes a more serious turn when he stumbles upon a sinister villain who is attempting to smuggle priceless antiquities out of the country. The film features thrilling sporting sequences, a suspenseful rooftop encounter with a group of spear-wielding baddies, a playful acrobatic fight in an art gallery, and a show-stopping twenty minute final brawl that is a classic of Hong Kong action cinema. While not considered one of Chan's best films, the over-the-top comic action sequences, featuring crazy stunts and rapid editing he pioneered in 'Dragon Lord' had a major impact on the subsequent development of Hong Kong action cinema. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
