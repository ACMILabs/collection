        "In other words examines the effects of homophobia on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender teens. Using interviews, animation, music, classroom discussion and dictionary definitions, this documentary aims to demystify homophobic language and to alert the viewer to its harmful effects. Although the documentary covers sophisticated territory, for example the difference between sexuality and gender identity, regular reference to the personal experiences of teenagers gives it clarity and relevancy. \"In other words\" is suitable for an audience aged 12-18."
