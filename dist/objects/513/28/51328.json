        "Sticks and stones is an award-winning Canadian documentary aimed at promoting discussion of gay and gender-related issues between children, their teachers and parents. It uses the experiences, ideas and opinions of children themselves, some with gay parents, to examine non-traditional families, gender stereotyping and gender roles. Children are encouraged to find the reasons behind bullying and name-calling, and come up with their own solutions to these problems. Sticks and Stones is suitable for children aged 5 to 12; there is a related title In Other Words for older audiences."
