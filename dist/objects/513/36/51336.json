        "Tackle happy is a hilarious documentary about the comedy show \"Puppetry of the Penis\". The film focuses on the stars of the show, 'master puppetier' Simon Morley and David 'Friendy' Friend and the trials and tribulations of running a production where they manipulate their genitalia for a paying audience. As the show goes on tour we see not only their tricks, but also troubles with the law, backstage tension, and the grind of travelling across Australia. Interspersed with dialogue from comedians Tony Martin and Mick Molloy, the documentary director, \"Tackle happy\" is a revealing look at the life of travelling performers and their controversial show. Anyone offended by male nudity would not find this documentary acceptable."
