        "Join the high-flying adventures of Simon, Theodore and Alvin in their first full length feature movie. The fun begins when Dave leaves the Chipmunks behind when he goes to Europe. Alvin dreams of his own world travel and convinces his brothers to enter a hot air balloon race around the world against the Chipettes. As the two balloons compete for a $100,000 prize, they unwittingly assist a pair of international diamond smugglers. Alvin and the gang get more than their fair share of spills, thrills and excitement backed by a great rock soundtrack sung by the Chipmunks themselves."
