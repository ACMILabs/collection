        "Episode of Series \"The Explorers [Bill Peach]\". Dramatised documentary written and presented by Bill Peach recounting the efforts of three white Europeans to explore the Gippsland and Australian Alps regions. In 1840, Polish geologist and explorer, Paul Strzelecki joined forces with James Macarthur who was interested in exploring the region for grazing land. Strzelecki is considered the first white man to climb Australia's highest mountain and reach the Kosciusko plateau. Another Polish explorer, Dr John Lhotsky, travelled through the region six years earlier collecting botanical specimens for European museum, but his efforts were not supported by the New South Wales government and his discoveries remain uncredited. Scottish settler, Angus McMillan, was exploring the area during the same period as Strzelecki but chose to conceal his discoveries until he could claim the land as his own. After persevering through hunger and hardship, Strzelecki stumbled across the ranges that bear his name before reaching Melbourne. Here he published details about his findings and the first detailed map of the region. McMillan was outraged when he read the news which omitted any reference to his exploration, furthermore, the rivers and lakes that he had discovered had been renamed by Strzelecki. Strzelecki argued that credit should be given to the explorer who shared his findings and benefits with the public. McMillan was eventually given credit for his exploration of the region while Lhotsky's efforts failed."
