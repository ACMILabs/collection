        "Set in 1593, this film is a pictorial documentation of Queen Elizabeth I's reign at the age of 60 after 35 years in the throne. The film canvasses a number of her achievements but focuses on her falling in love with the Earl of Essex in the last ten years of her life. Queen Elizabeth died in 1603 following her execution of the Earl."
