        "Security officers undertake tasks similar to police and often  present themselves in a similar fashion. However they do not have the legal authority of police. This film presents the American perspective on:  security officer operations; differences in the types of crime (as designated by law); arrest procedures; weapons and the use of force; and incident reporting."
