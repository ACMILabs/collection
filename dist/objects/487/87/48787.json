        "A short, comic look at human behaviour through the eyes of an alien race observing team sports - late in the 20th century, a time capsule was launched into space. The Cryptics who found the capsule 500 years later made some arcane observations from their findings. Team mascots become pagan gods; cheerleaders become vestal virgins; and the violence, competitive nature and antics of the players and crowds make for a convincing inference that the human race had destroyed themselves."
