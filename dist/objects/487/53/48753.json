        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Peach's gold\". Bill Peach presents a look at life on the goldfields after the Eureka stockade. It was a colourful but often violent time, where fortunes were made and lost in a heartbeat. Using dramatised re-enactments as well as historical footage, the point is made that not all of those who came to the goldfields were fortunate enough to realise their dream, however they almost always embodied the pioneer spirit. Out of this free-wheeling era emerged the beginnings of a new society."
