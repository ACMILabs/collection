        "Protestantism represents the outcome of centuries of disagreement over doctrine and practice within the Catholic Church. Led by Martin Luther in 16th century western Europe, this spiritual revolution gained momentum and, under the helm of other Protestant leaders, thrived and grew into new factions around the world, especially in Europe and North America. Narrated by Ben Kingsley, this video also investigates the numerous denominations that developed over the centuries, including Calvinists, Baptists, Mennonites, Presbyterians, Puritans, Amish and Quakers."
