        "This insightful and realistic film about teenage sexuality is set in a small Swedish town. Elin (Alexandra Dahlstrom) is beautiful and popular but the limitations of a small town lead her to increasing experimentation with alcohol, sex and drugs. Agnes (Reecca Liljeberg) is finding that after nearly two years in her new high school she is still largely friendless and alone. Elin and Agnes inhabit two very different social worlds but when they do finally meet they discover a disturbing and exciting sexual attraction for each other. Elin deals with this knowledge by throwing herself into a relationship with a shy diffident boy (Mathias Rust) while Agnes increasingly becomes to accept her lesbianism. \"Show Me Love\" is replete with incidents and moments that resonate with the confusions and tensions of adolescence. Refusing easy moralism or neat conclusions, Lukas Moodysson crafts an intelligent examination of contemporary youth culture. This is a gritty love story tenderly and convincingly performed by its young cast. In Swedish with English subtitles."
