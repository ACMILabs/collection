        "Episode of Series \"Physical science in action\". Nothing in the universe is at rest. With the Earth spinning and moving through space, everything is actually in motion. The only way we can tell that things are in motion is to compare them to other things nearby. This is called relative motion. This program presents a clear explanation of Newton's Law of Motion, including the concepts of inertia, acceleration, velocity, equilibrium and momentum. Students are taken on a fun trip to a bowling alley and a golf course for real-life examples to explain these concepts. Also explored is the key idea of net force and how it relates to motion and balance. Suitable for Upper primary/Lower secondary students. Teachers notes included."
