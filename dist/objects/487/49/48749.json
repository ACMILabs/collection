        "A documentary that takes a light-hearted look at the ingenious methods that Aboriginal men living in remote communities employ to keep their automobiles running. Without a trade certificate between them, these men have developed the unique craft of 'bush mechanics', adapting available resources for use as spare parts. The stories they relate provide a unique insight into this practical and philosophical approach to car maintenance and highlight many of the adaptive techniques desert people have developed through necessity over the last seventy years."
