        "The religious traditions of Confucianism and Taoism have influenced the lives of billions of people in China and around the world. Confucianism shapes the spiritual and ethical considerations of its followers, while Taoism stresses a harmony with nature and the life force within one's self. This video, narrated by Ben Kingsley, describes the life of Confucius and how his philosophy and social doctrine have influenced Chinese culture. It also investigates the world of Taoism - its philosophy and its rituals."
