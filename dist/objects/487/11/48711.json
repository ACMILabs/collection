        "Episode of Series \"Religions of the world\". Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan, is one of the world's oldest religious traditions and currently has around sixty-two million followers. It is rooted in mythology and folk rituals that have been passed down through the generations and although it has no congressional worship, founder, or written doctrine, it has at times served to unify Japan as a nation and to mobilise the country politically. Narrated by Ben Kingsley this video describes the social codes and daily life of its followers."
