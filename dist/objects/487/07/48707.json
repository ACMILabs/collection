        "Tommy Fawkes (Oliver Platt), is a struggling stand-up comedian trying to live up to the legacy that his famous father George Fawkes (Jerry Lewis) has created. George is now retired, and Tommy is struggling to get his career started. After yet another painful failure onstage, Tommy decides to travel back to Blackpool, England, where his family's history and comedy originated and during his stay, Tommy discovers some not so funny secrets about his family and his past. During this time he develops a peculiar friendship with the mysterious Jack Parker (Lee Evans), the seemingly dim, comedian-savant. This film, a \"black slapstick comedy\" goes beyond any genre, utilizing brilliant psychological and physical performances right down to the eyebrow raising cameo from Oliver Reed. Written by Peter Chelsom and Peter Flannery."
