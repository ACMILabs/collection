        "Cultures are grown from the heart of a chicken embryo and the behaviour of the original and subcultures is shown. The process of cell division is photographed at a magnification of 250 and in more detail using oil-immersion at a magnification of 900. The inhibition of mitosis by the presence in the culture medium of various substances is studied. The action which inhibits mitosis varies from an adhesion of the chromosomes which are attempting to divide in the presence of trypaflavin to an explosion of the cells attempting division in the presence of adrenalin. Captions in German."
