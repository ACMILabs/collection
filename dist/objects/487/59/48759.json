        "Episode of Series \"The Explorers [Bill Peach]\". Using dramatised re-enactments as well as historical footage and documents, Bill Peach narrates this investigation of the race to cross Australia from South to North. The race was driven by colonial rivalry between New South Wales and Victoria, resulting in John McDougall Stuart eventually emerging through the centre of the North Coast at the Gulf of Carpentaria."
