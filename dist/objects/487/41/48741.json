        "This documentary commemorates the 10 year campaign that won an unprecedented 90.77% Yes vote in the 1967 Referendum about Indigenous citizenship. Until that referendum the people of the oldest civilisation in the world were not counted as citizens in their own land. Told through personal interviews and rare archival footage, this film details the efforts of the people who helped change the Constitution. Narrated by Deborah Mailman."
