        "Episode of Series \"The Explorers [Bill Peach]\". A man of many talents, Major Mitchell is credited with discovering an otherwise unknown area of Western Victoria that he referred to as \"Australia Felix\", or \"Happy Australia\". Over his four costly expeditions, Mitchell was asked to confirm that the Darling River ran into the Murray and to see if there were any undiscovered surrounding areas. Motivated by a passion to disprove Sturt, who had traversed the region before him, Mitchell earned the wrath of Governor Darling and society as a whole thanks to the massacre of blacks at Mt Dispersion. A man of many contrasts, Mitchell was responsible for naming the Grampians, Glenelg River and Discovery Bay. He received a state funeral upon his death."
