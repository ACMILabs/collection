        "Episode of Series \"The Explorers [Bill Peach]\". Bill Peach narrates this informative look at the journeys of the Australian explorers who discovered and conquered the Great Sandy Desert, the Gibson Desert and the Great Victorian Desert - Warburton, Gosse, Forrest and Giles. It has been said that explorers who discover barren places are seen as failures compared to those who discover fertile, productive land. However, from an economic perspective, it is just as important to map the arid areas as the temperate and tropical. Using historical documents and footage as well as dramatised re-enactments, this video traces the trials of the explorers faced with trying to \"open up\" the continent."
