        "Details the importance parents can play in teaching children. Despite attempts to improve the British school system, children's educational development is often retarded by parent apathy. This short dramatisation shows some examples of ways parents can interact meaningfully with their children and make them feel an important part of the family umit and society generally. Cast includes Maurice Denham, Jane Welsh, David Mercer, Marion Strauss."
