        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Peach's gold\". Using dramatised re-enactments as well as historical footage, Bill Peach investigates the economic crash of the 1890s and the exhaustion of the goldfields at Ballarat and Bendigo. He describes how the less well known but far more productive goldfields at Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie rescued Australia from the depths of depression and continued to contribute to the country's economy up to the early 1980s."
