        "The story of the Woolcot family, living in Sydney in the 1890's. An Englishman in the New South Wales Regiment, Captain Woolcot is constantly harassed and embarrassed by the antics of his seven mischievous children: Meg, Pip, Judy, Nell, Bunty, Baby and 'The General'. Episode 4: All for the worst: Bunty is plagued by the lies he tells, Meg makes efforts to be 'grown up' and Judy makes a tortuous trip home. Episode 5: Secrets: Judy arrives home worn out and ill, but makes the other children promise not to let Esther or the Captain know for fear of being sent back to school. Episode 6: Tomorrow do thy worst: Judy is still ill and the children try to take care of her. However, the Captain's suspicions are aroused and he discovers Judy's hiding place."
