        "Produced in 1967, this black and white film is an inmate's view of Daytop, a drug treatment center on Staten Island, New York, where addicts learn to get along without drugs. Uncompromising, often brutal group therapy sessions are designed to shake loose the excuses a victim makes for himself. The people and situations shown are authentic; only one actor was employed. The results obtained at Daytop are regarded by some psychiatrists as a breakthrough. Cast: Don Francks."
