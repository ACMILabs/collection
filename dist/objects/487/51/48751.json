        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Peach's gold\". Using dramatised re-enactments as well as historical footage, Bill Peach investigates the developments on the goldfields that occurred within ten years of the first Australian gold rushes. No longer was it just the lone miner scrabbling away at the rockface - big companies and massive machines replaced the small digger, with more gold found deep underground. The entire population benefitted through the development of transportation methods such as coach lines and railways needed to move the greater volumes of material, and the growth of cities like Melbourne - a boom town built on gold."
