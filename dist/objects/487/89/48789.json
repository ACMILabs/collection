A short instructional film, it aims to assist in making the right selection of wine varieties to match with food,  relying on the knowledge of the restaurant staff. Get the insider knowledge from inside the waiters' pantry: \"it's important you have a sound knowledge of your foods, and more particularly of your wines\"."
