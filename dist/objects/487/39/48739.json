        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". This program discusses the impacts of decisions by the Northern Territory and Western Australian governments to introduce mandatory sentencing for juveniles. The laws have caused a storm of protest from civil rights advocates who view mandatory sentencing as an attack on young Aboriginals, who make up over 70 percent of people charged with offences in the Northern Territory. The fact that trivial and first offenders are punished by jail terms is the main driver of discontent. Acknowledgement is made that mandatory sentencing does not work, that there is a high amount of recidivism and that it can be the cause of deaths in custody. Includes interviews with members of the Aboriginal communities, magistrates, prison officers and Hazel Lallara, the grandmother of a 15 year-old who hanged himself whilst in custody. Reporter: Liz Jackson."
