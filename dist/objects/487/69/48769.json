        "A documentary on precision milling and boring machines. Opens by telling us the story of how a group of people created the \"Societe Genevoise D'Instruments de Physique\", a society formed to create a way to measure using unit measurements. We then travel into the future to see how the dividing machines they originally created are working now."
