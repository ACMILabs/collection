        "Episode of Series \"The Explorers [Bill Peach]\". Using historical documents and footage as well as dramatised re-enactments, Bill Peach describes the epic journey of Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson as they crossed the Blue Mountains and discovered the lush pastures on the other side. This video also explores the reasons why the expedition was carried out and the impact the discovery had on the growth of the young colony of New South Wales."
