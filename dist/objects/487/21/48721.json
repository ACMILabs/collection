        "Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) is a small time con-man working the backstreets of 1930s Chicago. When his partner is killed by mob boss Doyle Lonnegan, he teams up with down-and-out career criminal Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman), to dupe Lonnegan out of more than half a million dollars. The definitive 'caper' movie, \"The Sting\" features legendary ragtime piano by Scott Joplin and a superb supporting cast including Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan and Robert Shaw."
