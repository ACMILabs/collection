        "Stephane is a young Parisian travelling through a remote area of Romania in search of a legendary singer whom he hopes to record. He encounters Izidor, a wizened gypsy who is bemoaning the imprisonment of his son, who takes Stephane under his wing. With a guide and patron to steer him through the chaotic and suspicion-driven world of the gypsies, Stephane soon becomes engrossed in a rambunctious lifelstyle which celebrates life through singing, drinking and cursing. In French and Romanian with English subtitles. Cast includes: Romaine Duris, Rona Hartner, Izidor Serban and Florin Moldovan. (Awards: include Paris Film Festival 1998; Locarno International Film Festival 1997 and Brussels International Film Festival 1998)"
