        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Peach's gold\". Through dramatised re-enactments, as well as historical footage, Bill Peach traces the events which led to the dramatic confrontation at the Eureka stockade, one of the key incidents in Australian political history. He investigates the issues behind the uprising between the miners, the police and the army caused by harsh and expensive licensing systems and describes how long-term effects eventually led to the introduction of safer and fairer working conditions."
