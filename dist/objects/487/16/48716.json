        "Episode of Series \"Physical science in action\". Every element in the periodic table is made up of atoms, and every atom in an element contains the same number of protons. This program examines how elements combine in mixtures, compounds and solutions to make up the world in which we live. Students are taken on a fun journey, using real-life examples to explain the properties of elements, as well as concepts such as chemical bonding and heterogenous/homogenous mixtures. Suitable for Upper primary/lower secondary students. Teachers notes included."
