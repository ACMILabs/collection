        "The story of the Woolcot family, living in Sydney in the 1890's. An Englishman in the New South Wales Regiment, Captain Woolcot is constantly harassed and embarrassed by the antics of his seven mischievous children: Meg, Pip, Judy, Nell, Bunty, Baby and 'The General'. Episode 7: Into the sun: The doctor decides that Judy must recuperate in a warmer climate, but she is unwilling to be parted from the others. An invitation for the family to visit Esther's parents at their country property, Yarrahappini, is accepted as a solution. Episode 8: Yarrahappini: While the Captain spends a lonely time at Misrule, his family enjoy their country holiday. Meg begins to fall in love with the property manager, Dick Gillet, but is disillusioned when she discovers he is an alcoholic. Episode 9: The Picnic: On the last day of their holiday at Yarrahappini, Esther goes to a ball with her father, and the children go off with the drovers for a picnic, which comes to a sad end when Judy is hit by a falling branch. Episode 10: Going home: Meg cares for Judy while Pip runs for the doctor, but it is too late and Judy dies. The family say goodbye to Judy and return home to their lives at Misrule."
