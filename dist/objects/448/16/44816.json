        "When Alex Lawson, minister, came to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, he recognized the need for a family self-help program. In cooperation with his parishioners, he organized the Minto Family Life Education Program. Through group meetings, they are learning new skills to help them restructure their lives and resolve personal problems. Though the people participating in this program live in a small Prairie town, their concerns are universal, like raising children, adolescence, loneliness, marital strife and alcoholism."
