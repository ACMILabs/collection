        "In the not too distant future, earth is on the verge of total collapse and survival lies on colonising outer space. All hope rests on the Robinson family, whose mission is to establish life on Alpha Prime, the only other habitable planet in the galaxy. However when their spacecraft is sabotaged by a traitor, they find themselves lost in space and flying headlong into some out of this world dangers. Cast includes William Hurt, Gary Oldman, Matt LeBlanc, Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham and Lacey Chabert."
