        "The study of genealogy is shown to be a unique method of learning history and social studies. Two teenagers set about to solve the mysterious disappearance of an ancestor from Prince Edward Island. Their detective work takes them through museums, libraries, a rectory and an abandoned house. This valuable teaching aid shows how the interest of younger students might be stimulated. Cast: Donna Anthony, Stephen Connolly, Billie Dunn, Mary Dunn, William Dunn, Bekah Gass, Rod MacIntyre"
