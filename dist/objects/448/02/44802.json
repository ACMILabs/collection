        "'Untold desires' highlights the struggle that people with disabilities face in their quest to be recognised as sexual beings, free to express their sexuality and lead sexually active lives. Sexuality is often a private matter, and in the case of people with disabilities, sensitive too, something which the wider community would prefer not to acknowledge. In this candid documentary featuring people with disabilities, they reveal that their sexual needs are often subverted by the conservative values of those who provide essential care. 'Untold desires' gives voice to the issues that are important to them: choice, privacy, the right to have sexual relationships and the right to have children. They speak frankly about their search for sexually fulfilled lives and the experiences they have gained. Their honesty is both dramatic and moving and contributes to deconstructing the stereotypes that render disabled people non-sexual or perverse in the eyes of the non-disabled world. Produced with the assistance of SBS television and Film Victoria."
