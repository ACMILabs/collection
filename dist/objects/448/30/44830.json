        "Clint Eastwood directed this adaptation of John Berendt's non-fiction best-seller about a Savannah, Georgia, murder case. As the film begins, New York journalist, John Kelso (John Cusack), arrives in Savannah to do a brief article on the annual Christmas party given by sophisticated, urbane antique dealer, Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). After the party, Williams kills his violent lover, Billy, explaining it as self defence. Kelso decides to stay in Savannah to cover the trial, encountering a variety of colourful locals and eccentrics. Cast includes Kevin Spacey, John Cusack, Jack Thompson, Alison Eastwood and Jude Law."
