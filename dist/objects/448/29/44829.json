        "Three sisters are reunited after the death of their mother; their lifestyles a world apart from each other. Eldest sister Cressy (Rachael Maza), has found success as a classical singer and rejected her past life to pursue a career overseas. Middle daughter Mae (Trisha Morton-Thomas) resents Cressy's success and feels bitter at being the one whose had to stay behind to care for their senile mother. Youngest sister Nona (Deborah Mailman), is vibrant, sexually promiscuous, pregnant, and unlike her sisters, loyal to the memory of their mother. In the brief time the sisters spend together, they learn the painful memories and secrets that has distanced them from one another, and as the family's intrigue is revealed the sisters can finally unite together."
