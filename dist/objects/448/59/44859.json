        "When a group of greedy developers decide to demolish the headquarters of the Goonies- a group of adventurous youngsters, it seems that the gang will have to disband. By pure coincidence they they encounter a 17th century pirate map and set out on an adventure to locate the treasure and raise the necessary money to save the property. It quickly becomes apparent that they aren't the only people interested in the treasure, when they cross paths with a group of criminals. The Goonies start to live up to their adventurous mission more than ever when they enter a fabulous subterranean world and are forced into a series of events that could mean the difference between life, death, and the future of their home. Cast includes Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman and Martha Plimpton."
