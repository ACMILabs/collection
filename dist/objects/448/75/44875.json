        "The Page brothers - Stephen, Russell and David - are Aboriginal artists of mixed blood, part Maori, British and Aboriginal, whose talents were channelled into, (as choreographer, performer and composer respectively), the Sydney based Bangarra Dance company. In this informative documentary, made in 1997, before the untimely death of Russell, the brothers discuss their upbringing, experiences of racism, artistic desires, history and aspirations. Additionally, they visit the family home where they examine, with their parents, their ancestry, experiences of growing up in a white man's world, and connection to the past. The brothers identify as nurturers to a culture under siege, and aim to keep the Dreamtime alive in a modern context, recognising the performances of Bangarra Dance Theatre as a modern day corroboree, storytelling in a contemporary form, that bridges urban Aboriginality with traditional beliefs, whilst promoting indigenous culture. Also features excerpts from the successful production of \"Fish\", as well as rehearsals, and archival footage, stills and video, from the boys' childhood. A fascinating portrait of one immensely talented family."
