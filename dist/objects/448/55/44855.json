        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". This second instalment in the Bond genre is considered by many Bond aficionados as possibly the best blend of adventure, action, gadgetry, tongue in cheek nonsense, romance, and the obligatory high tech gadgetry. This time round the evil SPECTRE organisation has hatched a plan to steal a decoder that will access Russian state secrets and irrevocably unbalance the world order. Secret agent 007 is the only man to stand in their way and it's up to James Bond (Sean Connery) to seize the device first. It won't be an east task as he must confront enemies that include Red Grant (Robert Shaw) and the ruthless Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), a former KGB agent with poison tipped shoes. Bond is able to access inside information when he begins romancing a stunning Soviet defector (Daniela Bianchi), but he quickly realises that he is being lured into a trap that will require all his wit, charm, ability, and gadgetry to save the day. With the stunning backdrop of Istanbul and Venice, 'From Russia with love' features an explosive helicopter attack, a gypsy camp gun battle and a brawl aboard the Orient Express. Cast also includes Pedro Armendariz and Bernard Lee."
