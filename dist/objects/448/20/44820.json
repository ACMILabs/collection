        "The building of the P&O Orient liner 'Oriana'. Follows the birth of the ship from the early design stages and the testing of models to the actual building at the Barrow-in-Furness shipyards. Extensive use of prefabricated units is a feature of construction, and attention is paid to interior decoration and fitments. Launching and acceptance trials are also seen. Narrated by Maurice Denham."
