        "Episode of Series \"Lonely planet: the experience\". Justine Shapiro explores India's southern tip, travelling through the state of Tamil Nadu, and then on to tropical Kerala where she tours its famed network of backwaters and canals. Justine ends her journey on the rarely visited Lakshadweep islands in the middle of the Arabian Sea. Other activities covered in the journey include: eating at a vegetarian restaurant where 3,000 customers lunch everyday, riding on a bullock cart to a Hindu temple at Tiravanamali, travelling to an elephant sanctuary and bathing them, and visiting one of India's few female gurus who has hugged over ten million people."
