        "Robert Flaherty's story of life on the sea stormed Isles of Aran, off the West Coast of Ireland. Produced in the early days of sound film, Flaherty tells his story simply and with great eloquence. His camera shows the daily events of life on the Isles - a profound and stirring drama of struggle against the elements. This struggle is caught and fixed again and again in images of women and boys against bleak land, vast threatening rocks or cloud-tossed sky, or of the fishermen's boats lost to sight among heaving mountains of waves. Cinematography by Robert Flaherty."
