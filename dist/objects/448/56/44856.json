        "This is a compilation of the best of Led Zeppelin's concert appearances throughout 1973 at Madison Square Garden. It includes 13 of the band's most incredible, and influential songs, such as \"Stairway to heaven\", \"Dazed and confused\" and \"Whole lotta love\". Interspersed with the concert footage are candid moments with band members Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham. As is the case with the trend setting foursome, there is also a healthy dose of fantasy sequences."
