        "Following their graduation, friends Julie, Helen, Ray and Barry get into Barry's new BMW and head for the beach to celebrate the end of an important chapter in their lives. This sudden decision leads them on a path which will change their lives inexorably when they accidentally hit a pedestrian on deserted road. After the initial shock of what has happened has abated, they decide to toss the evidence, his body- into the ocean and swear secrecy to the event ever taking place. A year passes, the friendships have deteriorated, and strange things begin to happen. An anonymous note saying \"I know what you did last summer\" brings the accident on the road to life again, forcing the four friends to wonder whether someone has broken the promise of secrecy, or whether there was someone else on the road that day. Based on the novel by Lois Duncan. Screenplay by Kevin Williamson. Cast includes Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Freddie Prinze Jr, and Anne Heche."
