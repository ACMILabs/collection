        "This is the name of a Toronto folk group - two young men, a blue-eyed woman, and a guitar. They sing outdoors, indoors, wherever there's a friendly audience. Most of the \"with it\" listeners in this film are the old folks in a home for the aged in St. John's, Newfoundland. To them the group sings old songs of the sea, and a popular tune, Louis Collins, by Mississippi John Hurt."
