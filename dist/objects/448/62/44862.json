        "Episode of Series \"Daria\". The unlikely heroine of this offbeat animated MTV series is a cynical and quick witted teenage outsider named Daria Morgendorffer. Her cutting barbs are of course a way of coping with her vacuous teenage sister, her indifferent parents and the cliquey high school she attends which would be complete hell if it wasn't for her like minded best friend, Jane. In these three episodes (Esteemsters, The Invitation, College Bored), Daria and Jane brave the indignities of high school with their usual dry manner, taking on brainless jocks, self-esteem workshops, Cheerleader parties and college."
