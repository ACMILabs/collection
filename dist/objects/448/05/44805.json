        "In the arid heart of central Australia there is an abundance of wildlife that has uniquely adapted to the harsh conditions. This program looks at shinglebacks, lizards, the gibba bird, marsupial moles, parenti lizard, the thorny devil plus numerous other flora in the region. It also explores the formation of Lake Eyre and what impact the infrequent rain has on the environment when it buckets down. Narrated by Robyn Williams and based on the book written by John Vandenbeld."
