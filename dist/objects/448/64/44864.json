        "Based on the play by Edmond Rostand, this lavish version of the classic French romance comedy combines the breathtaking wit and poetry of the play with the colour and spectacle of a good costume drama. Gerard Depardieu is perfect as the charismatic Cyrano, whose enormous nose makes him feel unworthy to love his cousin Roxanne (Anne Brochet). When Roxanne confesses her love for handsome young cadet Christian de Neuvillette (Vincent Perez), Cyrano becomes a reluctant conduit for his love when he becomes the 'voice' for the inarticulate Christian. Soon Roxanne has fallen in love with Christian's handsome looks, but also with the passionate poetry of his soul, which she doesn't realise is Cyrano. In French with English subtitles. (Awards: Winner of 1991 Academy Award for Best Costume Design and 1991 Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film)"
