        "Episode of Series \"Lonely planet: the experience\". New York is a vast metropolis and its famous skyline makes it one of the world's most spectacular cities. New York is also home to a multitude of ethnic groups who have created a mosaic of diverse cultures and enclaves. Ian Wright visits the famous landmarks found in every promotional brochure but also finds some interesting surprises rarely visited by tourists off the beaten track. Activities covered include: budget hotels, yellow taxis and New York clubland, kosher food on the Lower East Side, visits to the Empire State Building, Central Park and the Statue of Liberty, Harlem, the Bronx and Brooklyn, and a helicopter flight over the city."
