        "Stress is a part of most people's lives and can be traced back to the fight or flight instincts in prehistoric days. Today this problem is confounded by the fact that we are not as reliant on the fight or flight mechanism, and the societal pressures that contribute to stress levels. This program covers areas such as the effects of long term stress, telltale signs that you are suffering from stress, the importance of identifying how you individually react to stress. It also interviews people who have suffered from serious stress and how it has affected their lifestyle, as well as covering the areas of relaxation, disassociation, sleep, exercise, diet, and the dynamic relationship between thought, feeling and reaction. The video is designed to be integrated with the teachers guide and participant workbooks (available as a separate loan item), as part of a 2-4 hour training session on handling stress."
