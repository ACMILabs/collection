        "Episode of Series \"Time watch\". 'Lenin's secret files' is part of an acclaimed investigative history series from the BBC which pursues new evidence and research of familiar historical events and figures. In this program the ethnic background, family, political ruthlessness and illness of Vladimir Illich Lenin, who, in 1917 led the Russian Revolution, are followed. It uses the personal archives of Lenin - which have only been accessible since the collapse of communism, to present a definitive portrait of one of history's key figures."
