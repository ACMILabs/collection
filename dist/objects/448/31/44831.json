        "Presented by Andrea Stretton of SBS's \"The Book Show\", this video features dramatised excerpts from the novel, \"Maestro\", and studio discussions with it's author (Peter Goldsworthy) and an English teacher. Together, they explore the importance of personal response to the novel, how to establish a personal response, and how to give the ensuing personal response."
