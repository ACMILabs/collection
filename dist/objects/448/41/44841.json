        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". When a deadly satellite weapon falls into the wrong hands, only Agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) can save the world from certain disaster. Armed with his license to kill and his smooth talking ways, Bond races to Russia in search of the stolen access codes for \"GoldenEye\", the devastating satellite weapon. James Bond is pitted against an enemy who knows his every movement, a former agent, 006, trained in exactly the same methods and who can anticipate his every move. Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean), agent 006 is motivated by a hatred that goes back years. 006 is not the only person causing Bond grief, he also battles with his former compatriot's stunning ally, Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), who crushes victims between her shapely but deadly thighs."
