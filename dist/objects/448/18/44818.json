        "A Walt Disney animated production tracing the development of aviation and the men responsible. From Leonardo da Vinci's earliest ideas in flight, the film documents the early pioneers' attempts at manned flight such as France's Mont Brothers and the United States' George Cayley and the Wright Brothers. Explains the rapid development of aviation up to the present jet age. Edited by Lloyd Richardson, sound by Robert O'Cook, music by Oliver Wallace."
