        "Based on Cornelius Ryan's compilation of interviews with D Day survivors, the film is broken into three sections- the Allied preparations for invasion, a faithful recreation of the movement of an Armada across the English Channel, and culminating in the attack on Normandy beaches. Intercut with these sequences is the response by German soldiers which are subtitled and directed by Bernhard Wicki. One of the most ambitious war films ever made, 'The Longest day' features 48 international stars, 4 directors, and won 2 Academy Awards for Special Effects and Cinematography, and was nominated for Best Picture."
