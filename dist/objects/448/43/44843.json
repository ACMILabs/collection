        "In the dead letter office sit thousands of fading dreams which didn't reach the recipient because they were insufficiently addressed. One batch of letters are signed by \"your bundle of joy\", a young girl named Alice who writes regular letters to her absent father but keeps having them returned with the dead letter office stamp. Alice, now a young woman, begins a job with the dead letter office to continue searching for her father. Once there she encounters a box labelled \"special cases\", a sealed collection of letters that the dead letter office doesn't hold much hope for locating the recipient. Alice is drawn to these scribes like herself and becomes drawn into the misery of others, although her passion for these cases causes conflict amongst the other workers. The office is an odd assortment of employees, headed by manager Frank (George DelHoyo), a political refugee from Chile. Alice and Frank are drawn to each other and after appreciating one another's dreams and tortured backgrounds, a tentative relationship develops in the most unlikeliest of settings. Cast includes Miranda Otto, George DelHoya, Nicholas Bell, Georgina Naidu, Syd Brisbane and Barry Otto."
