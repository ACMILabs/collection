        "Beginning with a brutal re-enactment of the historic D-Day invasion on Omaha, Steven Spielberg's graphically violent World War two drama follows a group of seven American soldiers who are sent on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find a soldier missing in action. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) heads the group of war weary men chosen to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been tragically killed in combat. Aside from the harrowing battle sequences (brilliantly shot by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) which fully realise the horrors and waste of war, Spielberg's attempt at asking complex questions about human nature, is confused at times and morally simplistic at others. Cast includes Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Jeremy Davies, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Ted Danson and Dennis Farina (Awards: Winner of five 1998 Academy Awards including Best Director, Steven Spielberg, Best Cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, Best Film Editing, Michael Kahn)"
