        "Episode of Series \"Lonely planet: the experience\". Cuba is the largest and least commercialised country in the Caribbean. Political factors too have kept tourists away since Castro's revolution in the fifties. Beginning his journey in the famous Cuban capital of Havana, Ian Wright travels across Cuba, skydiving onto a Havana beach, visiting a Cuban cigar factory, swimming with dolphins, visiting the Che Guevara University and watching a voodoo ceremony in Haiti. His journey ends in Haiti, the oldest black republic in the world."
