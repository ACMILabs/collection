The film features live performances of 16 classical Chisel songs, with excerpts from many more underscoring the behind-the-scenes and archival footage. Interviews are conducted with band members Jimmy Barnes, Ian Moss, Don Walker, Phil Small and Steve Prestwich, as well as other music industry colleagues. Features the following tracks: \"Standing on the outside\", \"Cheap wine\", \"Rising sun\", \"Khe sanh\", \"Janelle\", \"Twentieth century\", \"You got nothing I want\", \"Tomorrow\", \"Star hotel\", \"Choir girl\", \"Bow river\", \"Flame trees\", \"Saturday night\", \"Wild thing\", \"Goodbye (Astrid goodbye)\" and \"Don't let go\"."
