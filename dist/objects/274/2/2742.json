        "The scene is familiar. A scene you know well. A buffet setting of multinational brands adorns a beautifully set table. Products which for years you have been told you want; you need. The camera pans the table. You recognise everything. So what happens when the desirable turns undesirable? Melbourne art collective DAMP wage war on themselves in a gluttonous, misappropriation of food. A food fight of excessive proportions aims to subvert the subliminal desire global advertising has imposed, via mass media, on mainstream Australia."
