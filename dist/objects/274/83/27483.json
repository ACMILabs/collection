        "Early in the reign of Queen Victoria, severe competition from the New World caused British farmers to change from cereal crops to dairying. The early practice of cow-keeping in turn grows to the moder dairy industry. The film shows modern methods of production in this industry, including the manufacture of powdered milk, ice-cream, condensed milk, processed cheese and butter."
