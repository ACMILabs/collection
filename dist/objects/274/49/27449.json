        "A survey of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme. Shows the commencement of work in 1949, surveying the area and design of the first part of the project. Culminates in the official opening by the Prime Minister of the new Munyang Power Station, a few miles downstream from Guthega Dam which supplies it with water. Work continues on this great project, estimated to take twenty-five years to complete. Over an area of 3,000 square miles, men and machines reshape the land to supply Australia with light, and power."
