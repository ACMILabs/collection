        "An explanation of the aims of the Art Gallery of New South Wales followed by a short tour of the gallery. The film covers the history of the gallery from about 1871 to the present day. Shows its present building - the old wings and the new modern gallery section and gives an idea of its major collections, its many activities both public and behind the scenes, and its hopes and plans for the future."
