        "Deals historically with the life and work of the 19th century scientist Michael Faraday, especially in the field of electro-magnetism. It describes in detail the experiments that led up to the discovery of the principle of the induction ring, and illustrates the importance of this discovery for the later development of the dynamo for electric power in the modern world."
