        "A selection of publicity clips mounted together in one film to show techniques of NFB animators. As in 'Hors d'oeuvre', these films were produced originally for Government Agencies, to carry a message to the public about fire, water, traffic safety and mailing early for Christmas. Punctuated with adroit sound effects, each clip drives home its message humorously and succinctly."
