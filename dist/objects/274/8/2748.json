        "The new work for Neighbours (the remix) is obvious in nature. It repeats American logo. In Australia, I find my life pervaded by Amerikanism. My art practice comments on Amerikanisation within Australian and the world culture and mediums, so with all the current world domination attitudes by Amerika, it pops up again. This time like a resounding hammer bashing down hard on the little people who have no power but to listen and bob heads, 'yes...I do'. Fear is translated through our determination to buy McDonalds and waver in American soapies, news and perspectives."
