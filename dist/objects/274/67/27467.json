        "Fourteen students from Prahran College of Technology in Melbourne collaborated on this project demonstrating a practical application of film school workshop production. Numerous aspects of the City of Prahran are blended together to create a film on suburban community using a probing television documentary style. Captures the changing style of business, once quiet, now busy since the influx of migrants; shows the 'Feedwell Foundry', the now defunct Realities gallery and the 'Station Hotel'; traditional and modern architecture is represented in this city with examples of mansions, high rise accommodation and buildings by Roy Grounds. Community centres, a market and an extensive public transport network contribute to the city's popularity which has attracted a large Greek population. Originally established as the Mechanic's Institute in the 1860's, Prahran College of Technology offers courses in business and art & design. The range of places available for work, rest and play all contribute to Prahran's vibrant atmosphere."
