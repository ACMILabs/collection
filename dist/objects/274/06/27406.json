        "An experimental film. Uses close up photography and low key lighting to provide an unusual and perhaps cruel look at a familiar and everyday occurrence; the ritual of a girl applying her makeup. We see a series of rather frightening extreme close-ups, and not until the second last shot do we see the girl's face completely; a shot which is held only long enough to give a tantalising glimpse of her."
