        "The story of Zubin Mehta, a young Indian-born conductor of the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera House Company. Follows the conductor on his daily routine - rehearsals, meetings, performances, and back-stage life - and on his world tour with the orchestra, winding up at his birth place in Bombay. Ends with Ravel's arrangement of Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an exhibition\"."
