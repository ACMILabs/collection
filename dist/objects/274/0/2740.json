        "A half-hour program that references the global success of the soap-opera Neighbours. Consisting of three nine-minute segments by an emerging documentarian, an emerging fiction moving image maker and a visual artist, Neighbours (the remix) will playfully subvert and imaginatively redraw the landscape of Australia suburbia. As part of Neighbours (the remix) there will be interspersed ad-breaks (30 second duration each) by five leading, established Australian art practitioners."
