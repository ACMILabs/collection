        "Episode number 7 of Series \"The Commonwealth of Nations\". The ancient greatness of he East must be preserved, say men like Nehru, \"but the ancient evils must be eliminated.\" This film concerns itself with the latter and shows how helping the Asiatic countries of the Commonwealth to attain higher living standards has become a challenge not only to the more privileged countries within the Commonwealth but to the nations outside. The Colombo Plan is the medium through which economic assistance is extended, and in this film we see some of the many practical forms it takes."
