This colour film provides a well-illustrated summary of how the Atlas was complied ad of the story of facts between the covers. The film takes you on survey expeditions to remote parts of Canada, and to map-making headquarters in Ottawa where a mass of detail was sorted, classified and translated into the special symbol language of the map maker."
