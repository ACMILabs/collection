        "Each year sportsmen from many parts of America visit the flooded marshlands of Arkansas Grand Prairie in the quest for wild duck which abound in this region. Sportsmen are seen in action using artificial duck calls and decoys to assist the hunt. Much of the film is photographed in slow motion using telescopic lenses."
