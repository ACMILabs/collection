        "Episode of Series \"Great Themes of Literature\". This specially edited version of Polanski's \"Macbeth\" focuses on the dramatic chain of events precipitated by Macbeth's killing of Duncan, his king. One of the results of the sinister murder is that Macbeth is crowned King of Scotland in an impressive ceremony at Scone. The other fruits of his action, however, are bitter, for Macbeth has to learn that power illegally gained corrupts no one so much as him who gets it."
