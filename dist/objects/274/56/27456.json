Leonardo da Vinci's studies of bird flight; Sir George Cayley and the first glider; Stringfellow flies a steam-driven model in 1848; the Wright brothers' first powered flight in 1903; rapid progress from 1914 to 1918; the passenger carrying biplane; the airplane comes of age; fighter design and high-octane fuels during the Second World War; the jet engine and super sonic flight."
