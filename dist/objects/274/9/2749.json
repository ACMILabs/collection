        "The 30-second moving image for the Neighbours project is titled Touch ' A Family Portrait. It is a portrayal of a family greeting each other on Christmas Eve. The 30-second edit concentrates on the family's overwhelming display of affection towards each other, their intense 'kissing' and 'touching'. The camera/edits jump from one person to the next, as they kiss from cheek to cheek and affectionately embrace, whilst all speaking at once.  It portrays a multi-racial (Lebanese, Australian, American) family whose affection is displayed and celebrated and whose cultural identity exists beyond the stereotypes of multiculturalism. This piece functions as an antidote or as a somewhat more realistic alternative to the tokenistic portrayal of non-Anglo Australians, in television productions such as 'Neighbours'."
