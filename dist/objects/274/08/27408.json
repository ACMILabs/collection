        "Episode of Series \"Australia today\". The development of the myth of the \"Typical Australian\" of the old days. Myth, legend and romance embody our wishes, attitudes and beliefs. By using old illustrations, songs and ballads, this film traces the character which most Australians foster. The legend emerges from the convict past, the bitter struggles and hardships, the tradition of pioneer and explorer, the stormy gold rush days, the growth of towns and the gradually accepted fact that here were a new distinctive people who later joined together as one nation. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
