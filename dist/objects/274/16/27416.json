        "A journey down the east coast of Sweden by tramp steamer through the Gulf of Bothnia to the Baltic Sea with stops at various ports to unload cargo. It is winter and because the Gulf is not very salty is freezes easily. Lumber products are an important export. The trees are cut chiefly in winter by men who are frequently farmers in summer. Logs are bought to the pulp mills and the process of making wood pulp is shown. Steel and iron products are important exports from a region where iron mines and water power are abundant. Stockholm is the last stop and the home port, and we are shown something of the city, including the home surroundings of the first mate of the ship who goes ashore for a visit to his family."
