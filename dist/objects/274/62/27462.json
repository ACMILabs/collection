        "An entirely new colour production of the Eamses \"Rough sketch for a proposed film\" (1968). Shows a linear view of our universe - first from the human scale to the sea of galaxies, then directly down to the nucleus of a carbon atom. With an image, a narration and a distance register it gives a clue to the relative size of things."
