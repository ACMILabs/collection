        "This documentary tells the story of the 1980 reunion of some of the entertainers who performed at San Francisco's \"Hungry i\" nightclub during the 50s and 60s. The \"Hungry i\" was a place where the beatniks and bohemians of the day used to gather to see and hear a variety of singers, musicians and stand-up comedians perform their talents on stage, including Lenny Bruce, the Kingston Trio, the Limeliters, Stan Wilson, Jonathan Winters, Bill Cosby among others. Entrepeneur and owner of the nightclub, Enrico Banducci, provided many of these performers an opening to becoming internationally recognised and it is at this reunion they are able to pay homage to the nightclub and its owner. Through interviews, personal reminiscings, stills, archival footage and live on-stage performances, the film presents an inside look at a time and place although long gone is certainly not forgotten. Also features Maya Angelou, Don Asher, Phyllis Diller, John Sebastian, the Hungry i Reunion Trio, Bill Dana. Inspired by the novel \"Honeycomb, ballad of a north beach caberet\" by Don Asher."
