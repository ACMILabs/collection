        "This very interesting documentary follows the workings of an independent English language newspaper in Cambodia, the Phnom Penh Post, established in 1991 by its American editor-in-chief, Michael Hayes and published every fortnight to a readership of about 5000. The highly respected Post is run by 20 staff including 8 journalists who work in teams of one Khmer/one westerner chronicling some of Cambodia's most politically turbulent moments with insight and compassion. At the time of making this film, there was political instability, economic chaos, no democratic government in place and the Post was struggling to survive when out of left-field, news was received that oppposition leaders to the military regime, Prince Ranariddh and Sam Raisy were to return. This was good news not only for Cambodia, but for the staff at the Post. Through interviews and following the Post journalists on their daily hunt for a story, we are given a close-up view of the challenges faced by an independent newspaper and the suffering and tragedy that still exists in the lives of the Cambodian people as they strive for peace and reconciliation."
