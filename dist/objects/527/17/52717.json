        "A light romantic musical comedy featuring Cary Grant in the role of Jimmy Hudson, an artist who finds himself involved in a bizarre plot with an Australian opera star by the name of Louise Fuller (played by American born Grace Moore). Louise Fuller is desperate to perform in America but cannot obtain a visa, and the only other way she can enter America is if she is married. On meeting the handsome artist, Louise cons him into a marriage of convenience offering him the sum of $2,000 for his part in the scheme. And so begins a most unlikely liaison, a mis-matched couple who continually battle it out with each other until finally love steps in. The highlight among the many songs featured in the film is \"Minnie the Moocher\", a sultry, sexy song wonderfully performed by Grace Moore, an opera singer in real life. Story based on an idea by Ethel Hill and Cedric Worth with original music by Jerome Kern. Cast also includes Aline MacMachon, Henry Stephenson, Thomas Mitchell, Catharine Doucet."
