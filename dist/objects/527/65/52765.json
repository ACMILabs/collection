        "Adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by American author and playwright, Robert E. Sherwood, this film version captures the essence and fervour of one of America's most memorable periods in its founding history. It takes a biographical slice of time out of Abraham Lincoln's (Raymond Massey) life beginning with his early adult years as a woodsman, to his courtships first with Ann Rutledge (Mary Howard) and then with Mary Todd (Ruth Gordon), his eventual wife, through to years of law practice and finally to his election as President and the Declaration of Independence. Cast also includes Gene Lockhart, Howard da Silva and Alan Baxter."
