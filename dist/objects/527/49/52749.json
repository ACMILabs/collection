        "Leave it to Beaver is a family comedy focusing on the antics of Beaver, (a name given to the young boy by his older brother who couldn't pronounce Theodore). In this episode called \"Younger Brother\" we see \"The Beav\" sign up for basketball following in the footsteps of his big brother but unlike his sporty brother Beaver is not a natural at basketball. Hiding his new sneakers as no wear on them would look suspicious Beaver pretends to be going to Basketball practice. During this episode we see understanding and kindness shown to Beaver when he confesses to his father and all is understood. As it turn out checkers could be Beavers thing. This television series presents life through the eyes of children and although the comedy might be slightly dated the issues are relevant to modern times. Cast includes Jerry Mathers, Barbara Billingsley, Hugh Beaumont, and Tony Dow."
