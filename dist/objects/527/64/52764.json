        "Set in Geneva Switzerland during World War II \"English without tears\" is a gentle and entertaining romantic satire. The multi-plots within the film mainly focus on the small things that matter to people during wartime. An aristocratic family including an eccentric bird fancier (Margaret Rutherford) leaves for Geneva. The faithful butler joins the army and becomes lieutenant. The charming daughters falls for the butler who is successful in his new role. The plot becomes amusing as the story unfolds while the class barriers of peacetime relax and the romantic complications reveal themselves. A charming English studio film. Cast includes Michael Wilding, Margaret Rutherford, Lili Palmer and Penelope Ward."
