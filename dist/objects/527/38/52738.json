        "Angels over Broadway is a stylish looking black and white crime drama which takes place on one rainy night in New York. In a nightclub on Broadway called the Pigeon Club a suicidal embezzler arrives, wet and hopeless. He is mistaken as a rich country hick ripe for hustling. An alcoholic playwright becomes involved and the plot unfolds. This film, written and directed by Ben Hecht who is famous for witty and sharp dialogue, is well acted with an impressive cast. The hustler and would-be gangster, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is teamed with the good-time girl Rita Hayworth. With a fine script of ironic and poetic dialogue this dark drama is compelling. The noir themes of espionage, gambling, suicide and bad guys turning good are present in this shadowy, cynical and articulate film. With an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay this is a fine film located in the world of loners, hustlers and has-beens. Cast includes Thomas Mitchell and John Qualen."
