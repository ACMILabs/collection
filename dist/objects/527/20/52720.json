        "This documentary is a portrait of one of the world's finest gospel singers, a warm and sincere woman with strong religious faith and an unquestioning belief in humanity, the wonderful Miss Mahalia Jackson. Filmed on location in London, Stockholm, Berlin and many other European cities during her inspirational European tour, Mahalia finds time between performances to talk about her background, her lifetime passion for spreading the gospel beyond the church through concert appearances and album recordings, and her commitment to championing the causes of justice, freedom and peace in the world. It was shortly after this triumphant tour that Mahalia Jackson passed away (1972). However her legacy lives on. Songs in this film include \"Didn't it rain\", \"He's got the whole world in his hands\", \"Just a closer walk with thee\", \"We shall overcome\" and many other favourites. Narrated by Brock Peters."
