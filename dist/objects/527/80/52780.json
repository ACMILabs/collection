        "Set in the provincial Chinese city of Datong in 2001, the story follows the lives of two 19 year-old unemployed and disenchanted friends Bin Bin (Zhao Wei Wei) and Xiao Ji (Wu Qiong) who spend their days aimlessly wandering around dreaming of ways of escaping their meaningless and boring existences. China, with its rapidly changing political and economical role in the world, finds itself being drawn into the web of globalisation and the World Trade Organisation and televisions all over China are blasting out the message of change to the Chinese population. However, for the alienated Bin Bin and Xiao Ji, it is the day-to-day survival that counts. Poignant and slow-moving. Cast also includes Zhao Tao, Zhou Qing Feng. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
