        "Hired sun is an episode of The Beverly Hillbillies where the Clampetts have set up shop in the offices of the Drysdale Bank. With the aid of a old employer My Drysdale schemes to have the Clampetts evicted from the premises. The Clampetts are offering such things as teeth pulling, fish cleaning, shoe fixing, false teeth whittling and psychiatry. Granny helps a man regrow a full head of hair. As usual the plans appear to be successful but backfire for Mr Drysdale. Cast include Buddy Epsen, Irene Ryan, Donna Douglas and Max Baer."
