        "This video features two Chaplin favourites: Shoulder arms - Is an unusual mixture of realism and fantasy with Chaplin's characteristic touches of slapstick, satire, irony and pathos. It has been suggested that Chaplin's film provides a truer picture of World War I than most of the more ambitious dramas. The Pilgrim - Escaped convict Chaplin lands himself in all manner of situations when he disguises himself as a preacher. Silent films with English intertitles."
