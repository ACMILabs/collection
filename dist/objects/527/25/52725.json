        "The Frank Sinatra Show screened as a television variety series during the years 1950-1952 and 1957-1958, hosted by Frank Sinatra along with a selection of regular and special guest stars. This particular program features Jack Benny, the well-known American comedian (and host of his own TV show), supported by singer June Hutton, comedian Larry Griswold, and child violinist Charles Castleman. Frank not only sings but also plays a comedy role alongside Jack Benny to present an entertaining mix of comedy sketches and music. Songs include \"I've got my love to keep me warm\", \"My concerto\", \"For you\" and \"What is America to me\". Added bonus (or not) is this program also includes commericals by the sponsor promoted by the stars of the show. Music by Axel Stordahl."
