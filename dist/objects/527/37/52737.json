        "A brilliantly acted comedy drama about a developing relationship between two very different individuals who reside in a nursing home - Weller (Hume Cronyn), a long time resident with a gruff and impatient exterior who has alienated most of the other elderly residents and timid newcomer, a diabetic, Fonsia (Jessica Tandy). Set on the sun porch of the nursing home, the two strike up a somewhat painful relationship over several games of gin rummy where each reminisces about their past, dredging up memories and emotions perhaps best left alone. Funny, sad, confronting, entertaining - it is a pleasure to watch two such great actors performing on stage. Originally produced for the Broadway stage and directed by Mike Nichols, D.L. Coburn's Pulitzer Prize-winning play was a critical success travelling abroad to London and Russia and receiving the Tony and Drama Desk Awards for Jessica Tandy and the L.A. Drama Critics Circle Award for both Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn. This taped version for television was performed before a live audience in London in October 1979."
