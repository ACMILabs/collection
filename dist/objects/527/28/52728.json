    "description": [
        "The Kid - Dumped in a garbage can, in the roughest part of the slums, a vagabond tramp finds an abandoned baby. No-one in the slums can afford another mouth to feed, but with the ever-watchful policeman around the corner, the tramp is unwittingly compelled to \"adopt\" the child. In classic style resembling the later \"Gold Rush\", Chaplin shows his genius in bringing up baby, from inventing his own hysterical methods of changing nappies, to teaching the grown-up nine year old the art of survival, of self-defence, and earning a living- the Kid smashes windows, while Charlie repairs them cheap! A heart-warming story also unfolds, as the true mother stumbles upon her child - Coogan's sensational performance made him the best-loved child star of the Golden Era! Cast also includes Edna Purviance, Chuck Riesner, Carl Miller, Henry Bergman. \"Three men in a tub\" - Alfalfa loses his girl to a smoothie with a yacht, but conspires with his friends to get her back. Featuring the Little Rascals."
