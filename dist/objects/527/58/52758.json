    "description": [
        "This meditative exploration by filmmaker Barry J. Hersey presents life in a visual poetry. Themes of life, birth, death and spirit fill each piece. Form and substance are explored. Reality and art are questioned as we journey through the spiritually observant eyes of the filmmaker. Each piece reveals the different and crucial aspects of the human condition and the place or insignificance of a person on earth. The nature and contours of the landscape are seen through new eyes while the suggestive ocean offers deeper interpretations of the world around us. The filmmaker makes use of the effects that music has on the visual experience with dreamy and relaxing sounds unifying the meditative aspects of this style of filmmaking."
