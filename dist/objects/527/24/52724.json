        "Recorded live at the Melbourne Concert Hall in 1986, this video presents the sensuous and sultry jazz and blues singer Cleo Laine performing with her husband John Dankworth and the Dankworth Quartet. British born Cleo Laine began her musical career in the early 1950s where she met and married renowned musician John Dankworth in 1958. Together they have toured the world (and still currently touring) but Cleo has also tried her hand at acting on the stage in such plays as \"Flesh to a tiger\", \"A Midsummer night's dream\" and the title role in Ibsen's \"Hedda Gabler\" among many other performances. Songs from this Melbourne concert by this great lady include \"Free and easy\", \"I love you just the way you are\", \"Crazy rhythm\", \"Send in the clowns\", \"He was beautiful\"."
