        "This made for television production forms the third part of an \"autobiographical\" trilogy of the renowned American playwright Neil Simon - \"Brighton Beach memoirs\" being the first in the trilogy followed by \"Biloxi blues\". Jonathan Silverman (Brighton Beach memoirs) returns as Eugene Jerome, Neil simon's alter ego, while the role of Eugene's older brother Stanley (played by Corey Parker) is based on Simon's brother and early writing partner, Mel. The scene is set in Brighton Beach, New York in 1948 where three generations of the one family strive to live under the same roof. The Jerome brothers are attempting to fulfil their dreams of fame and fortune as comedy writers, the relationship between their mother Kate (Anne Bancroft) and father Jack (Jerry Orbach) is disintegrating rapidly and their aging grandfather Ben (Hume Cronyn) is faced with his own private dilemmas. The beauty of this film is in the witty and at times ascerbic script which is equally supported by superb performances from the cast as a whole. Screenplay by Neil Simon based on his play."
