    "description": [
        "A classic sitcom premiering in the early 50's \"I Love Lucy\" centres on the married life of the outlandish Lucy and her Cuban born bandleader husband Ricky. This high quality comedy is notable for its madcap humour, absurd situations and the disaster-prone adventures of Lucy. \"Lucy does a TV commercial\" airing in 1952 shows just how far Lucy will go to appear in a commercial on a show that Ricky is presenting. The commercial is for a highly alcoholic health product which Lucy drinks over and over during rehearsal. \"Lucy's Italian Movie\" airing in 1956 has Lucy being spotted by a famous Italian film director while travelling on a train headed for Rome. Taking the role very seriously and without knowing what the role actually is Lucy finds herself crushing grapes with her feet with the locals in a vineyard. Cast includes Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, William Frawley and Vivian Vance."
