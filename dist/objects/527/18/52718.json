        "Based on Noel Coward's operetta, this is the first version of \"Bitter sweet\" (later Hollywood version in 1940 starring Nelson Eddy/Jeanette MacDonald) featuring Anna Neagle, Fernand Graavey and Esme Percy. It tells the romantic tale of a now older Sarah reminiscing about her younger days and her first love Carl, a musician. Charming and melodic, this bitter sweet love story is beautifully filmed by prolific British director and producer, Herbert Wilcox (Nell Gwyn, No No Nanette, The Lady with a Lamp to name a few) assisted by the wonderful dialogue, lyrics and music of Noel Coward. NB: Sound quality is muffled."
