        "This is an amazing collection of 17 rare, high quality, music clips from 1951-52 capturing some of the major artists of the day including Bob Crosby & the Bobcats (March of the Bobcats), Teresa Brewer (Music, music, music), Peggy Lee (What more can a woman do?), Nat King Cole (Little girl), Jack Teagarden & his Allstars (Jack Armstrong blues) and The Weavers (Goodnight Irene). The 3-minute clips were originally produced as television fillers by Snader Telescriptions but have since proven to be an invaluable and historical record of the pre rock'n'roll music scene of the fifties."
