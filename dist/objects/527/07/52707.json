        "A musical version of the very much loved classic fairytale combining live action with animation. Stars Gene Kelly as Jeremy Keen, a peddler who trades his magic beans for Jack's cow, Bobby Riha as Jack, and Ted Cassidy as the voice of the giant. A wonderful blending of live actors with animated cartoon characters. Also stars Marian McKnight as Princess Serena."
