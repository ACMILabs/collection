        "This amusing documentary examines wheelchair basketball, played at Paralympic level in Australia. Filmmaker Fiona Cochrane presents the athletic abilities of the men's and women's teams whilst displaying their incredibly positive attitudes. Numerous interviewees discuss their reaction to being told they had a disability, the ensuing struggles, and the hope and direction that wheelchair basketball has given them. Other interviewees includes family members, and coaches of the teams. Inspiring stories."
