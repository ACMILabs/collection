    "description": [
        "Recorded at a concert given to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the founding in Britain of Amnesty International. Performed in front of a live audience at the magnificent and atmospheric Westminster Abbey, this internationally acclaimed British rock band presents a fusion of rock and classical music ranging from the interpretive strains of electronic keyboards and synthesisers through to the poetic mellow sounds of acoustic guitars. Consisting of five extremely talented musicians (John Williams and Kevin Peek on classical and electric guitar, Herbie Flowers on bass guitar, Steve Gray on keyboards and synthesisers and Tristan Fry on percussion) and featuring breath-taking images of the wonderful gothic architectural environment that is Westminster Abbey, this video is most enjoyable, both visually and musically."
