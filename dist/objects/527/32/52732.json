        "The monstrous St Trinian's schoolgirls with their headmistress, Amber Spottiswood, are on the move again. This time to Hamingwell Grange. But the Great Train Robbers have got there before them - and left two and half million pounds hidden under the stage. Desperate to retrieve their loot the train robbers pose as caterers at the school Parents' Day, but they have not reckoned with the ferocity of the unbeatable girls of St Trinian's! Cast includes Frankie Howerd, Dora Bryan, George Cole, Reg Varney, Raymond Huntley, Richard Wattis. Inspired by the drawings of Ronald Searle."
