        "A Bill of divorcement: Katharine Hepburn's debut in what was to be the first film in a long association with director George Cukor. Hillary Fairfield (John Barrymore), shellshocked during World War One, escapes from the asylum on the day his ex-wife is to remarry. Unable to adjust, he must also confront his now grown-up daughter Sydney (katharine Hepburn). Facing reality, he finally accepts his wife's determination to marry a sane, healthy man, but does not know of the impending sacrifice his daughter is to make. Sydney knows that the streak of madness in her father is inherited, not war-induced and, fearful of passing it on to her children, she cancels her marriage in order to care for her father. Cast also includes Billie Burke and David Manners. Ruby Gentry: Jennifer Jones stars as Ruby, a young southern woman from a poor white-trash family determined to improve her lot in life by marrying into wealth even though she is romantically involved with Boake Tackman (Charlton Heston) who too is from the \"wrong\" side of the tracks. So when successful businessman Jim Gentry (Karl Malden) finds himself totally in love with Ruby and insists on making her his wife, Ruby, of course, cannot resist this fortuitous offer. However, for Gentry it will turn out to be a most unfortunate decision with dire consequences. Cast also includes Tom Tully and James Anderson."
