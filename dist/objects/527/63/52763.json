        "This is a delightful and light romantic comedy starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. A thick fog in London forces those at a fancy dress ball to remain overnight at the hotel where the ball is being held. As there is a room shortage the charming and lovely Leslie Steel (Oberon) is forced to share a room with the irritable and handsome lawyer Evarard Logan (Olivier). The lawyer assumes that the mysterious and yet unnamed character is married. The following day an accusing Lord Mee (Ralph Richardson) talks of his wife spending the night in a man's room. Smitten and bewildered Everard Logan is forced to think of the consequences believing that he might know the clients of a divorce case that he is working on better than he thought! This easy going yet sophisticated comedy is well performed and enjoyable."
