        "An inside studio view of an album being produced by the singing legend Frank Sinatra in collaboration with the talented musician and arranger, Quincy Jones. This fascinating documentary provides interviews and commentary by those involved in helping to create the album \"L.A. is my lady\" including lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman, producer Phil Ramone, and musicians Lionel Hampton, George Benson, Frank Foster and Steve Gadd. Also features a cameo appearance and personal commentary by a youthful Michael Jackson. Describes the tension and electricity that comes with the energetic and demanding Sinatra and the mutual admiration and respect the singer and the musicians have for each other."
