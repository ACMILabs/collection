        "Based on the memoirs of Fania Fenelon in her book The Musicians of Auschwitz and written for television by Arthur Miller, this feature length program stars Vanessa Redgrave in the role of Fenelon, a French-Jewish cabaret singer who was working in Paris at the time of the Nazi invasion and who was eventually shipped off to the Nazi death camp in Auschwitz in 1944. Fenelon, along with several other women musicians, is forced to perform for the condemned inmates facing the gas chamber in exchange for her own survival. As long as the group keep performing so their lives are spared and no more aware of this is their leader Alma Rose (Jane Alexander). Conflict and tension increases between these two women as each explores their soul and conscience in this inhumane and degrading struggle for life. For the viewer it raises many issues of the human condition and what price survival but perhaps more controversial is the fact that Vanessa Redgrave is well-known for her anti-Zionist stance, causing wide opposition by many including the real-life Fenelon, to Redgrave's appearance in the film. However Redgrave puts in a magnificent performance winning her an Emmy Award, along with Emmy Awards for scriptwriter Arthur Miller, supporting actress Jane Alexander, and Oustanding Dramatic Special Award for the film itself. Cast also includes Maud Adams, Shirley Knight, Marisa Berenson, Robin Bartlett, Mady Kaplan. A compelling and poignant story."
