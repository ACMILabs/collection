        "A thought provoking documentary on the contentious issue of uranium mining, and in particular the construction of the new Jabiluka uranium mine by mining company Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) in the Kakadu National Park. The film follows the daily conflicts which face the dedicated protesters who have arrived, on invitation by the Aboriginal traditional owners, from all over Australia to set up a blockade to prevent ERA beginning construction at Jabiluka. Through interviews and personal commentary, the filmmakers present the many and varied viewpoints held by all those involved from all sides of the fence including ERA workers and management, protesters, Aboriginal traditional owners, police officers, tourist operators, and residents of the nearby town of Jabiru. Uranium mining has social, economical and political consequences for Australia and the Australian population particularly in light of the government's intention to allow other mining companies to further develop our uranium industry. A very interesting and insightful program. Narrated by Rachel Griffiths."
