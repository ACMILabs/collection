        "Part of the Jazz Classic series, this video presents the wonderful music of Count Basie, his orchestra and his friends including Jimmy Rushing, The Delta Rhythm Boys (Carl Jones, Kelsey Pharr, Otho Lee Gaines, Traverse W. Crawford), and Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five. Uses archival film footage, excerpts, and a complete short film titled \"Caldonia\" (1945, 18 mins) starring Louis Jordan, Cab Calloway, Doc Cheatham, Milt Hinton, Raymond Kaalund, Ben Webster. There is no historical or biographical commentary or narration throughout the video - music only, including \"Someone's rocking my dream boat\", \"St Louis Blues\", \"Take me back, baby\", \"Honey chile\", \"Just a sittin' and a rockin'\" and many more. One can see and hear the beginnings of jive and the early roots of rock 'n' roll through the beat and rhythms contained in some of this fabulous music. Enjoy the experience. NB: Archival footage has been digitally restored."
