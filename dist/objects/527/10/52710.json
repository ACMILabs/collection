        "An amazing compilation of big band music of the 1940s and legends of American jazz music including Count Basie, Stan Kenton, Duke Ellington, Lena Horne, Artie Shaw, Jimmy Dorsey, Lester Young, Larry Clinton and others. The video is put together using archival film footage which has been restored to original condition but contains no historical or biographical commentary or narration. Tune in to the nostalgic sounds and watch as young couples swing and boogie woogie the night away. NB: Picture and sound quality is variable."
