        "This television series screened between 1965 and 1975. Its production was endorsed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with episodes based on actual FBI case files. Its emotionless portrayal of agents tracking down criminals provides a cool and compelling atmosphere. This episode called \"Southwind\" sees a banker escaping on a plane with two million dollars. Not only has he stolen money he has left gambling debts and a man injured in hospital. With no leads it is left to the methodical actions of the FBI agents to find the missing banker. This is a series where politics and drama meet as each episode was allegedly approved by J. Edgar Hoover himself. Cast includes Efrem Zimblist Jr., Philip Abbot and William Reynolds."
