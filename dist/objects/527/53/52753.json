        "The Honeymooners was a popular television comedy that started as a sketch show and due to its success was produced as a series. The live show was set in a Brooklyn apartment focusing on two lower middle class neighbouring couples trying to make their lives better. The main character Ralph (Jackie Gleason), a bus driver, is constantly at loggerheads with his wife, Alice (Audrey Meadows) who always make up by the end of the show. This video presentation includes one episode, \"TV or not TV\" and a montage tribute of the show presenting highlights and memorable moments. The episode shows what happens when the couples decide to jointly own a television set and the strains it places on their friendship. Interestingly \"The Flintstones\" cartoon was based on the characters from \"The Honeymooners\" placing them in a pre-historic setting."
