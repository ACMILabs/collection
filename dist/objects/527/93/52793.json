        "An historical account of one of Britain's last-standing music hall theatres, the Hackney Empire. Opened in 1901 this wonderful theatre became the home for many famous British music hall artists and entertainers right up into the 1950s when it was finally closed down in 1956. However, against all odds, the music theatre has survived and this film documents the re-opening in 1989 with interviews, personal reminiscings, stills, archival footage and live performances from past and present entertainers including Bernard Bresslaw, Roy Hudd, Chas 'n' Dave, Helen shapiro, Frankie Vaughan, Tommy Trinder, Barbara Windsor, Larry Adler and many more. Also features the Royal Artillery Orchestra. Variety at its best."
