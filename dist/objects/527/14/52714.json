        "Performed live at the Hollywood Bowl, this made for television production features five highly acclaimed and recognised American female jazz and blues singers who present their own unique interpretations of several memorable songs by legendary blues singer, Billie Holiday. Set to a 32-piece orchestra, arranged and conducted by Ray Ellis, these five wonderful women, Maxine Weldon, Morgana King, Carmen McCrae, Nina Simone and Esther Phillips, each give a stunning performance climaxing with all five singing together on stage. The program is interspersed with two pieces of rare archival footage (1935 and 1950) of the \"Lady\" in action along with personal commentary by Maxine Weldon and Morgana King. Great music and of historical value. NB: Picture and sound quality poor but still worth viewing."
