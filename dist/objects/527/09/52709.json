        "Take a trip down memory lane with some of the swinging music that helped the American people get through the dark hours of World War II. This is a music video compilation made up of archival war footage, newsreels, radio and stage performances featuring many of America's hottest and most famous stars of the day, including the Andrews Sisters (Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy), Benny Goodman and Peggy Lee (Why Don't You Do Right), Judy Garland (Over the Rainbow), Bing Crosby (Don't Fence Me In) and much more. Patriotic, nationalistic, very American but extremely entertaining with some great music. Even Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd make a cameo appearance."
