        "Featuring some of Britain's most loved and highly respected entertainers of comedy and rock music, this filmed live performance at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London is an absolute ball - witty, outrageous, political, funny, but most of all, entertaining. It combines the winning elements of comedy sketches including some memorable Monty Python skits, stand-up comedy, and music performances by such stars as Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman, Alexei Sayle, Bob Geldof, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Donovan, Sting, Phil Collins and even Australia's own inimitable Barry Humphries. Also features a special guest appearance by Michael Palin. Presented by Amnesty International with all royalties from the video going to Amnesty International. Stage show directed by Ronald Eyre."
