        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Survey (National Gallery of Victoria)\". John Lethbridge's works, his paintings, drawings and sculptural installations develop out of a personal necessity to try to give an order to the rituals and repeating experiences of life that recur in an apparently unordered and random world. His recent work can be described as \"Post Conceptual Romanticism\""
