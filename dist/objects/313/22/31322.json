        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". This film examines West Germany's actions against increasing terrorism and looks into how the country is managing the delicate balance of protecting democracy against terrorism without at the same time threatening civil liberties and the freedom of its citizens. The West German police now have greater powers, and whilst most Germans applaud these measures as being essential to preserve democracy, some claim that these powers pose their own threat."
