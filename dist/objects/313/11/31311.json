        "A film experienced entirely from the point of view of an elderly patient dying in a large hospital. As modern medicine struggles to keep eighty three year old Catherine Hamilton alive she struggles just as hard to die in peace. Each time she thinks she may be able to slip away, the doctors and nurses bring her back with a wonder drug, or a new machine. But Catherine continues to fight to control her own destiny with humour and dignity"
