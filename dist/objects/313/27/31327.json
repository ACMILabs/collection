        "Presents latest basic life support principles and techniques for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, as recommended by the National Research Council. Live subjects, mannequins, audio visual aids and animation are used to demonstrate A - Airway opened, B - Breathing restored and C - Circulation restored. Physiological background and dramatic CPR re-enactments are provided. The revised version does not contain a demonstration of the precordial thump or a witnessed cardiac arrest. The precordial thump should only be used in conjunction with an ECG monitoring machine."
