        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Survey (National Gallery of Victoria)\". Robert Rooney's art is a personal analysis of his own life, and in examining his own idiosyncratic behaviour he is exploring the routines and obsessions that concern each and every one of us. These routines are perhaps meaningless to some, yet they consume a major part of our everyday life"
