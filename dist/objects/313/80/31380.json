        "Episode of Series \"Mirror of Germany. The German Scene = Deutschland Spiegel\". Magazine items: The \"Thunderflashes\" is the name of a pop band from a village in Germany which has made the national music scene; the Federal Mail Department is the largest services enterprise in Europe; Schloss Ludwigsburg in one of the finest old baroque castles in Germany; Due to violent labour disputes, many places were without newspapers for several days; the harp-maker Maximilian Horngacher is a master craftsman and constructs 14 to 16 harps each year. The Deutsches Museum in a unique depot for some of the masterpieces of science and technology and the soccer match of Brazil against present world holders Germany, showed the poor performance by the Germans and the brilliance of the Brazillians."
