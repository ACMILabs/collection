        "Cinemagazine items: Man-made fibres impregnated with carbon, which conducts electric current so static charge can never build up are already being used in coal mines, where a spark can mean an explosion, and in the future they could be used for low power heating; detecting eye diseases early could save a lot of people a lot of sight; a new system allows patients to be tested for glaucoma quickly, effectively, and cheaply; a new type of fertiliser releases its goodness into the soil gradually - so it isn't washed away in the first rain storm."
