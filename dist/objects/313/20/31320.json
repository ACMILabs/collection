        "Filmed in a workshop situation comprised of fifteen people. David Green demonstrates and explains in an informal discussion with his participants the various techniques used in embroidery and print making. He stresses the importance of experimenting with ideas and that there is a \"marriage between stitch, fabric and dye colour\". The camera gives us a close-up look at many interesting and vibrant designs."
