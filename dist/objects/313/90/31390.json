        "A film about the men who drove big freighter canoes into the wilderness in the days when the fur trade was Canada's biggest business. The film recreates scenes of the early nineteenth century on the 5 000 km river trade route to the Athabasca. With songs by a male chorus, this film presents a tuneful view of history. The commentary is taken from journals of the time."
