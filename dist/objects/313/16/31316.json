        "The C.E.P. (Country Education Project) is an innovative body designed to tackle the industrial needs of rural communities. The projects are either school or community based, depending on individual educational requirements, and have a full-time regional co-ordinator. Outlines the C.E.P. philosophy and takes a close look at programs currently operating in the Ovens and King Valley regions of Victoria."
