        "A group of dogs in the countryside and at home. The camera observes in a sensitive and detailed way: as the dogs explore a stream and drink, we see how their tongues work to toss beads of water upwards; the rhythms and sounds, the ways of relating and communicating that are special to dogs. Includes a brief birth sequence."
