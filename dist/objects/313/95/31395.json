        "Episode of Series \"The Australian eye II\". This film looks at the works of Benjamin Duterrau, and in particular his painting \"The Conciliation\". This was of importance as, based on the meeting of George Augustus Robinson in 1830 with a group of Tasmanian aborigines, it was the first painting of a historical scene created in Australia."
