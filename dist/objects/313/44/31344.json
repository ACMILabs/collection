        "In Australia, where there is one vehicle for every three people, road accidents have reached epidemic proportions with 4,000 people dying each year. The trauma of the accidents themselves is only eclipsed by the trauma of the chain of events that follow. Highly graphic scenes of car accidents in this film make viewing unsuitable for sensitive people, and preview is strongly recommended"
