        "A cheerful observation of chickens and fowls in a farmyard setting. Includes shots of chickens awakening, stretching, eating, exploring, drinking, encountering other farm animals and a predator, and retreating to mother hen's wings. Another hen sits on her eggs, and we see a chicken struggle to hatch. Useful for creative expression, language skills, and sensory awareness. Suitable for primary school level."
