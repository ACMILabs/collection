        "Traditional folklore takes a wry turn in this animated tale about a carved wooden puppet who lacks mobility and human consciousness. Noted for his \"cool head\" and unruffled personality, the inanimate Spinnolio makes a totally passive, though quite successful go at life, until his employer decides to replace him with a computer. A modern-day fairy tale that smacks of the sardonic and has philosophical implications about the nature of consciousness, the work ethic, interpersonal relationships, and the citizen in society."
