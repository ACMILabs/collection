        "Episode of Series \"Middle East\". The growth of Arab nationalism provided a base for President Nasser in his attempt to achieve Arab unity. Having dealt with the uniting of a vast number of peoples through Islam, the film considers the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the Imperial conquests of the European powers and the first Nationalist Movements that appeared within the Arab world. Newsreel footage from the 1920's, 1930's and 1950's is used."
