        "Mr Rossi finds himself in Venice - not the Venice of postcards, but of polluted canals, rotten buildings, and overcrowded steamboats. Eager to impress a pretty tourist, Mr Rossi takes up the fight against the disease that is destroying the city. But it is like tilting a windmill. Mr Rosi is defeated before an enemy too big to conquer - pollution. Animation by Giorgio Valenti."
