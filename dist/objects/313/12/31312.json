        "Shapes and stars, fish and boats swim, fly and sail across the screen to the music of Claude Debussy (\"L'isle Joyeuse\"). Paperdoll people change into birds and back again dancing, piping, running, flying. Based on the collages and line drawings of Henri Matisse, this gayly coloured animated film should please every age group."
