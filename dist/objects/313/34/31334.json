        "This film concerns the gradual reconciliation of the traditional way of life with modern technology and industrial development as it has occurred in the small town of Tyssedal on the Hardangar Fjord in Norway. Once devoted solely to dairy farming, fruit growing and fishing, many of the town's inhabitants are now employed in the huge aluminium smelting plant located at a short distance from the town. A young Tyssedal school boy and his family are among those affected by this transition in the way of life."
