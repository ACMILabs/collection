        "Cinemagazine items: A diving suit which looks more like a space suit allows a diver to breathe air at normal pressure, eat his lunch in comfort and manipulate tools with special flexible arms as well as stay down at considerable depths for a whole day; the resources of a design with the latest equipment are taking the guess work out of the design of boat building; a free flooking submersible which gives the skin diver a whale of a time - he can travel for 80 kilometres underwater at up to seven knots."
