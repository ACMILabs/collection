        "Examines the hidden assumptions of school curricula and the ways in which teachers perpetuate sexist roles in children. A survey of sexism in traditional children's literature is contrasted with a dramatisation of 'St George and the dragon' and observations of children at play are interspersed with comments by teachers with suggestions for a non-sexist and counter sexist curriculum"
