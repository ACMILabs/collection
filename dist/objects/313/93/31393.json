        "Cinemagazine items: Farmers cannot often make hay while the sun shines, and the hayfields themselves can often become junior jungles - new machinery has the answer to this problem; anthracite coal is converted into \"active carbon\" whose particles have a vast porous surface - they literally \"hang on\" to any impurities in water, leaving it as pure as a mountain stream; deflecting an oil-tanker from its course at very low speeds presents a problem. A rotating cylinder, fitted into a tanker's rudder, transforms it from a lumbering vessel into one that is as manoeuvrable as a minnow."
