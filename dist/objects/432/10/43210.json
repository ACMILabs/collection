        "Set during the second World War, this film concerns an American marine pilot (Marvin), who is stalked by a Japanese navy officer (Mifune), while stranded on a remote Pacific island. The American is captured but manages to escape and turn into the captor of the Japanese navy officer. After a while they realise they need not be adversaries and begin an uneasy friendship and dependency on each other for survival."
