        "In the Arctic region wolves are suspected of contributing to the diminishing number of caribou herds. \"The Lupine project\" is established by the government to investigate and observe wolves to provide concrete evidence of their aggressive nature. A young biologist, Tyler (Charles Martin Tyler), is left alone in the unfriendly Arctic wilderness to conduct such a study where he must contend with the forces of nature to discover as much as he can about the canis lupis; the wolf. Based on Farley Mowat's autobiographical novel of the same name, screenplay by Curtis Hanson. Also starring Brian Dennehy."
