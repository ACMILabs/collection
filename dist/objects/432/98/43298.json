        "Richard Bawden introduces a man with a remarkable solution to Australia's unemployment figure. Originally a migrant from Italy but now an Australian citizen, he has a vision for a new Australian society based on people as its natural resource. He believes that Australia's reliance on developing its natural resources has been to the detriment of her people. He has instituted a job creation scheme at Murdoch University in Western Australia based on his vision."
