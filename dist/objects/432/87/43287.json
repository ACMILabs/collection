        "Based on real events, this short film explores the fate of Frank, an elderly man with a bad back, who is pinned beneath the body of his wife, Mavis, after she suddenly dies and collapses on top of him. For seven days in the heat of summer, Frank lies helpless. His back twisted in the fall, he finds his physical agony and despair turning to hatred of Mavis. He begins to hallucinate; past and present merge. Stripped of his physical strength, Frank is forced to search inside himself for the emotional resources which will save him."
