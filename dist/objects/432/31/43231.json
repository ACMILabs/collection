        "Pilots and navigators trained to fly F111 aircraft, spend weeks mastering the process in a flight simulator and learning about the planes before becoming proficient enough to fly the F111 fighter jets. Trainee pilots become skilled in the performance of the F111 whilst the navigator trainees study the radar and navigation systems of the aircraft. This program documents the training process which results in the pilots and navigators first flight in the F111 jets."
