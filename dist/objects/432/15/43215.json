        "King Kongs creators made this excellent tale a year before the famous ape burst onto the scene. A vivid retelling of Richard Connells celebrated oft-filmed story about a megalomaniac named Count Zaroff who hunts humans with a bow and arrow on his private island, and charms everyone he encounters. Joel McRae, Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong are his latest prey."
