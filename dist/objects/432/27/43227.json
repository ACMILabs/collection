        "Ascot Vale housing estate was in a state of decay with poorly maintained buildings, not support services and poor and dangerous living conditions. The tenants formed a tenants group which initiated change, maintenance, improvements in living conditions, provided services such as legal aid, migrant classes, a theatre group, milkbar and a community centre. This video shows the change process through interviews with tenants. The second half of the video is the theatre piece performed by the community theatre group."
