        "This is the story of two men, Lucas and Pignon. Lucas is a hardened criminal, a star bank robber. Pignon is just the opposite, a nice guy with lots of problems he just cant cope with. Lucas, who has just done five years in jail, has decided to go straight. Pignon, who has just gone through three years unemployment has decided to become a crook. These two men have nothing in common. No reason to ever meet. And yet one day in a bank they do, and that is where the misadventures start. Remade in Hollywood as The Three fugitives starring Nick Nolte and Martin Short."
