        "A stunning dramatisation of Hemingway's epic tale of struggle between man and nature. Anthony Quinn stars as Santiago, whose encounter with a giant Marlin becomes a fight for survival as a band of sharks move in for the kill. Filmed on location on the British Virgin Islands, this film combines action-packed excitement with outstanding human drama."
