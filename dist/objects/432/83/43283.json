        "Melbourne filmmaker Brian McKenzie spent 5 years working on this engrossing study of a not-so-typical Brunswick household. McKenzie plays a central part as he documents the lifestyle of Graham (a youth in his 20's), his family and friends. After having spent so long with the family, McKenzie becomes part of the furniture- a situation which enables him to dig deep into the subjects' lives."
