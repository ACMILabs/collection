        "The Highest Court in Australia is an enigma to many. There are sketches of insight which may be attributed to the publicity surrounding cases such as Mabo and Wik, however the mechanisms that have contributed to these decisions are often unknown. This video follows the handing down of two historic judgements; Kruger and Ha, and the appointment of two new Justices. By witnessing these events and processes the viewer is given an informative insight into the High Court and its operation. This documentary is produced by the same individuals who created the title \"Mr Neal is entitled to be an agitator\" (also in the collection)."
