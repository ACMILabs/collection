        "On the 27th of February, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, arrived at Essendon for a five day visit to Victoria. This film follows Her Majesty through many official functions during her visit including the State Reception, the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Flemington, the children's display at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the memorable State Ball at the Melbourne Town Hall. As an introduction to the film, and as a background to this Royal Visit, we see the City of Melbourne - the old city of the past; the exciting new city of the future; its people and their preparations for the Royal Tour."
