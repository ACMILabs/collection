        "In 1914 the Australian Army started a flying school at Point Cook. The trainees took ten hours to learn to fly a Box Kite Plane. This video documents the history of air defence force planes from this humble beginning to their inclusion in World War I through to the sophisticated jet fighters that are the pride of the Royal Australian Air Force today."
