        "This is the scarcely credible beginning of the great adventure going back, back to post-war Liverpool. The Beatles Anthology No.1 traces the lads back to their early musical influences from Elvis to the film \"The Girl Can't Help It\" [304613]; their first instruments; a cross-town search for the B7 chord; Paul, George and John meet up; first recordings; Buddy Holly; Stuart Sutcliffe; Ringo and Roy Storm and the Hurricanes; early tours; Pete Best; Hamburg; the Cavern Club; Brian Epstein; new suits; audition with George Martin; Ringo joins the band; their first number one: \"Please, Please Me\". See how the forties became the fifties became the sixties and discover how becoming the Beatles became."
