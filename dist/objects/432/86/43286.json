        "Joern Utzon, the Danish architect of the Sydney Opera House lives in Hellebaek, Denmark in a modest house he built himself. He is 80 years old and in his distinguished career he has recieved every major archticetural award. But in February 1966, it was a very differet story. In that month his nine years work on the Opera House came to an end. This beautifully photographed films charts the triumphant, exhilarating and then tragic course of the design and construction of the Sydney Opera House. For the first time in 25 years Joern Utzon appears in a lengthy interview speaking in English."
