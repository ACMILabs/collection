        "Carol Lombard is hilariously funny playing the role of Hazel Flagg in this outstanding black comedy. Hazel's bumbling doctor mistakenly diagnoses her as having fatal radium poisoning. Although she's never felt better, Hazel pretends to be dying in order to accept the offer of an all-expenses-paid visit to New York City made by a newspaper reporter. By the time the reporter begins churning out daily reports of the tragedy, half of Manhattan is in tears and Hazel is built up to be a brave 'suffering in silence' charmer and is lionized by the media and public. When Hazel cannot disguise her good health any longer, a group of her financial backers wise up to her ruse and ask her to find a way to die and save them all further embarassment.This was one of the first screwball comedies ever produced, and possibly one of the finest."
