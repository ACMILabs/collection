        "A hard boiled B-girl (Bette Davis), is determined to turn the tables on Mobster Johnny Vanning (Eduardo Ciannelli), who has recently taken over the management of the nightclub where she works and is attempting to turn out the current employees. It proves to be hard task for one individual so she enlists the help of a district attorney (Bogart), and her fellow workers at the nightclub (Rosalind Marquis, Lola Lane, Isabel Jewell and Mayo Methot). This film is based on the trial of New York Gangster Lucky Luciano, sent to prison on the basis of evidence from prostitutes."
