        "Douglas Fairbanks stars as the unassuming Don Diego de la Vega, son of a wealthy Spanish Californian rancher. Don Diego has a secret identity, for when he dons a mask and cape he is transformed into Zorro. Zorro is the only hope citizens have for protection against the evil Captain Juan Ramon (Robert McKim). Of course, as in all swashbuckling tales there is a pretty damsel involved. Lolita (Marguerite de la Motte), is in love with Zorro but thinks little of Don Diego. To complicate matters Juan Ramon is vying for the affections of the lovely Lolita. Noah Beery Senior plays a supporter of Juan's until he joins the good guys and aligns himself with Zorro. This is the first of many film versions of Johnston MacCulley's 1913 adventure story, \"The Curse of Capistrano\"."
