        "This is a short account of the history and industry of Portland, a coastal town southwest Victoria. Portland was settled in the 1830s by the Henty Brothers who utilised its location for fishing, shipping and storage. However, its industry has grown to cover timber, beef and wool which are often exported. Also covers Portland's annual festivities and the attractions it holds for visitors."
