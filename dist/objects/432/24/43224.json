        "The Hearing Process is a function of the Victorian Public Service Board. It is freely available to all present and former officers and employees of the Public Service. This process is designed to protect the rights of all Public Service Officers and employees, and to enable staff to seek review of decisions which adversely affect them, other than decisions where another review or appeal body exists. The Victorian Public Service employes approximately 40,000 full and part time people. This video outlines the processes involved in presenting a case against unfair or inequitable treatment in the workplace."
