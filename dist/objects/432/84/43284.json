        "Irish mother Christina Noble has a special identity to the homeless children of Vietnam, she is known as Mama Tina. Driven by her grim childhood in Dublin, Christina moves through the streets and rubbish dumps in search of lost children. The stories related to and filmed by writer-director Steve Jeffares about Mama Tina are a testament to her love for children and her philosophy that all children are entitled to education, health care and love."
