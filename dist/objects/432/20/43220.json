        "An animated recreation of the historic events that occured to Samson's hair after it was cut by Delilah. This comic film claims that Delilah knitted a cap out of Samson's hair and gave it to her other boyfriend Hercules. Since then, the cap has journeyed through history bestowing strength and courage on new owners. This century, the cap was purchased by a meek and mild character called Willoughby who used the cap's magical powers to fight crime and evil on the street's of his city. We see Willoughby bravely saving a damsel in distress, climaxing with her rescue from the path of oncoming trains."
