        "Sir Hubert Opperman, known to fans as 'Oppy' was a famous Australian cyclist who had been successful in Europe, winning the Paris-Brest-Paris in 1931 which was then the longest race in the world. 'Oppy' was a long distance specialist and in 1933 returned home to ride 377.8 miles (608km) in 25 hours and 37 minutes, breaking the previous record of 27 hours, 23 minutes. The record has since been broken but it was a remarkable achievement given the poor weather conditions he faced.  Courtesy Cinesound Movietone Productions."
