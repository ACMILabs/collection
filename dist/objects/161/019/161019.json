        "Made in 1971, this training film from the Commonwealth Film Unit is particularly interesting due to the lack of helmets and lycra we see everywhere on the road in 2014. The film teaches people how to ride safely and to try and avoid accidents by showing some examples of cycling gone wrong. Source: NFSA Film Australia Collection."
