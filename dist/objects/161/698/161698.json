        "Peter Sculthorpe was interviewed for Film Australia's 'Australian Biography' series in 1998. He describes the way in which Australian history and landscape have influenced him and tells of the emotionally significant events in his life which have found expression in his music. He also explains, with warmth and eloquence, the nature of his endless journey to try to create the perfect work of art, a journey that continues to motivate his work today.
