        "At the heart of DreamWorks Animation is the desire to tell great stories and inspire audiences.  In a series of masterclass sessions, the creative team behind the studio that brought us 'Kung Fu Panda', 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar', gave an exclusive look inside the professional animation industry.  Kendal Cronkhite joined PDI/DreamWorks as an art director in its pioneering days and worked on the studio's first computer animated film 'Antz'.  Prior to joining the company, she served as a freelance editorial illustrator in Canada and New York. Cronkhite was also the assistant art director on Tim Burton's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and the art director on Disney's 'James and the Giant Peach'."
