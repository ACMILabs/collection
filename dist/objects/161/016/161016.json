    "description": [
        "In early 1970's Canberra, a cycling boom pushed the need for planning of better infrastructure for bike riders. The first cycle path was built in 1973 and ran from Dickson to the Australian National University. This however did not satisfy cyclists wanting to commute from their homes to work or school, forcing them to use major roads to do so. On 21 October 1974 issues of safety and the unpleasantness of car emissions led to action by over 50 cyclists. This excerpt was shot by a CTC-TV cameraman from a camera platform atop one of the news cars. Journalist Malcolm Bodley conducts his interviews whilst riding a bike and holding a microphone attached by cable to a CP16 film camera. One of the interviews is with Member for Fraser, Ken Fry."
