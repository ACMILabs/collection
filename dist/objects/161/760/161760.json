    "description": [
        "Drawn from the NFSA's Film Australia and National collections, these works focus on one of Melbourne's, and Australia's, largest migrant communities. As a result of Australia's successful multicultural policies, by 1971 there were over 160,000 Greek-born migrants living in Australia. They worked on assembly lines, farms, in various factories and some started small businesses where they flourished. What remains clear is their desire to maintain strong traditional and cultural connections to their Greek identity. A consistent theme in these works is the challenge of integration and assimilation, and the contrasts in attitudes between Greek migrants, and those of the first and second generation Greeks born in Australia."
