        "Filmed on location in Melbourne's west (Sunshine) and made with the support of a grant from the Australian Film Commission, 'A Face of Greekness' brilliantly emphasises the cultural issues experienced by migrants. Film academics cite Michael Karris as the first Greek-Australian filmmaker to produce a film on a Greek-Australian theme, which was selected for competition in 1980 at two international film festivals, finalist in short film category, Sydney Film Festival and Greek Film Festival of Thessaloniki. \"Family dramas are so relevant to Greek lives - all of us who are Greek - know what a drama our families can be. A deep sense of tragedy infuses 'A Face of Greekness' - this film captures a family's pain at their daughter's rape with depth and compassion.\" (Source: Bill Mousoulis, Senses of Cinema 1999)."
