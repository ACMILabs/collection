    "description": [
        "At the beginning of the 20th Century the automobile was a play-thing only for the wealthy. As the industry developed and grew, the automobile assembly line increased efficiency and introduced new standards in manufacturing. An affordable automobile was mass produced and as there were so many on the road, the government introduced automobile registration. This package provides an historical insight into the early development of car manufacture and includes stories and insights into our relationship, ingenuity and dependence on cars. From the Sunday drive, to the kids doing their thing ... ignition switch on\u2026  depress the clutch and start the engine!"
