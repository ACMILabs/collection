        "At the heart of DreamWorks Animation is the desire to tell great stories and inspire audiences.  In a series of masterclass sessions, the creative team behind the studio that brought us 'Kung Fu Panda', 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar', gave an exclusive look inside the professional animation industry.  Christophe Lautrette served the role of a Production Designer for DreamWorks Animation's pre-historic family comedy, 'The Croods'. During his tenure at DreamWorks Animation, Lautrette has worked as Art Director on various feature films, including 'Prince of Egypt', 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron', 'Kung Fu Panda' and 'Bee Movie'. He is also the main contributor to DreamWorks Animation's first personal art publication 'Moonshine'.  Lautrette is originally from France and he currently resides in Los Angeles, CA."
