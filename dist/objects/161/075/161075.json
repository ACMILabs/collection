        "At the heart of DreamWorks Animation is the desire to tell great stories and inspire audiences.  In a series of masterclass sessions, the creative team behind the studio that brought us 'Kung Fu Panda', 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar', gave an exclusive look inside the professional animation industry.  Doug Cooper (VFX Supervisor) joined DreamWorks in 1998 as a CG Effects Animator and Technical Director on 'The Prince of Egypt' and went on to serve as the Digital Supervisor on 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron'. Previous credits as VFX supervisor include 'Bee Movie' and 'First Flight' (an animated short)."
