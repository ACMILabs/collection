        "This tongue-in-cheek newsreel excerpt features female sports people participating  in sports that were previously only the domain of men, during the Second World War while many Australian men were absent in the theatres of war. Some of the sports included horse riding, cycling and surf life saving. The narration illustrates the cultural attitudes of the time in the way the women are described and their physical attributes dwelt upon. Courtesy Cinesound Movietone Productions."
