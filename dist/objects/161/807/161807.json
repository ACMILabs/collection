    "description": [
        "This documentary directed by Tom Cowan was originally intended for broadcast on Greek television and has English sub-titles. The film sees Sydney in 1968 through the eyes of Helen Rigas, a young Greek migrant (and actor). Throughout the film, Helena recites the poetry of Australian based Greek-born journalist and writer Theodoros Patrikareas, depicting the migrant experience of discovering a new home. Tom Cowan's interest in the experiences of Greek migrants and association with Theodoros Patrikareas lead to Cowan's adaptation of a play written by Patrikareas - 'Throw Away Your Harmonica'. Released in 1975 as an English speaking feature film, 'Promised Woman' was the story of an arranged marriage between a young Greek couple in Australia.  Source: NFSA Film Australia Collection"
