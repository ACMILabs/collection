        "In celebration of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, the Edinburgh International Film Festival partnered with a selection of Commonwealth nations to showcase some of the best animated short films from around the world. Focusing on work from both new and established filmmakers, this program of nine films offers a broad overview of international animation talent. Each partner nation has nominated a film from their country to be included in the program, which premiered at the 2014 Edinburgh International Film Festival in June. This ACMI screening forms part of an international network of events that will take place in each participating country."
