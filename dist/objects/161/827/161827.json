        "To celebrate 'DreamWorks Animation: The Exhibition', ACMI decided it was a wonderful opportunity to invite five internationally-lauded Australian auteur animators to join us in a celebration of their careers, and to talk about the Australian animation industry. Oscar winners and nominees Adam Elliot, Bruce Petty, Shaun Tan, Anthony Lucas and Sejong Park share their experiences, expertise and perspectives on their craft, their career histories and their production processes. The panel was hosted by Melbourne cinematic stalwart Tait Brady."
