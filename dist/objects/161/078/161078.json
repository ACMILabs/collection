        "At the heart of DreamWorks Animation is the desire to tell great stories and inspire audiences.  In a series of masterclass sessions, the creative team behind the studio that brought us 'Kung Fu Panda', 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar', gave an exclusive look inside the professional animation industry.  Jason Schleifer served as Head of Character Animation on DreamWorks Animation's most recent feature, 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman', and has worked on numerous other key titles for the studio including 'Megamind', 'Madagascar', 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa', 'Over the Hedge' and 'Shrek the Third'.  Prior to his career at DreamWorks, Schleifer had extensive involvement at Weta Digital, beginning as a Creature Technical Director and later promoted to an Animation Lead while making the 'Lord of the Rings' Trilogy."
