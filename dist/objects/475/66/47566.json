        "From its source in a narrow valley alongside the Parliament buildings in Ottawa, the Rideau Canal winds through the heart of the city and beyond, to its summit at Upper Rideau Lake. Following the Cataraqui River system, vessels descend at Kingston on the St Lawrence River. Peaceful communities that were established along the Rideau by the first travellers still reflect the lifestyles of the area's original settlers. A hive of boating and camping activity in summer, a brilliant profusion of colour in spring and autumn, a 200km skating rink in winter, the Rideau Canal offers delights to historians, antique collectors, photographers, artists and sightseers."
