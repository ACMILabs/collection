        "Beginning from the initial reactions of doubt and confusion, then moving on to remembrance, this short program follows the experiences of a brother and sister as they deal with the death of their mother who leaves them the document - \"what to do when I'm dead\". The proceedings of the final day are followed as family and friends gather from near and far to share their pain. The video explores issues such as dying and funeral ceremonies at home, grieving with minimal intervention, different reactions to grief and how 'outsiders' affect family dynamics. Cast includes Jennifer Kent, Josh Quong Tart, Shane Porteous and Celia Ireland."
