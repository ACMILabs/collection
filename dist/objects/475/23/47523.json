        "Toby Veck (Trotty) is a poverty stricken ticker seller in the 1840's who comes to life when he is on a job. His constant companion through good times and bad is the chimes that peal their lovely noise, seemingly just for Toby, and speak to him in times of need. One New Years Eve, the night before his daughter, Meg's wedding, Toby is entrusted with a letter from the alderman that puts him in bad spirits and forces him to question his place in such a world. After coming to the aid of another man and his young child, Toby dreams a frightful dream that night, but the faithful chimes clear his mind and his faith in humanity is restored. This claymation film is based on a story by Charles Dickens."
