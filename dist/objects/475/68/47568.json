        "The story of how Torontonian John Bulloch turned a local tax protest movement into an efficient, media-wise, national lobbying organization that defends the interests of the small business community. Bulloch, the aggressive and articulate president and founder of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), understands the value of information and the techniques of power lobbying. This film shows how he and his 150-member CFIB staff acquired enough political savvy and clout to make legislators listen. The documentary also presents the views of those who are lobbied (with an explanation of power lobbying) and an analysis of the CFIB's success."
