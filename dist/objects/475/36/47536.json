        "A humourous romp through various wine styles set in the country in a castle-like structure. Vignettes played out by actors - some in period costume to emulate the character of various wine varieties/styles from Moselle \"for first lovers\" through to claret are you old enough? Featuring Australian actors Steve Bisley and Mel Gibson in their youth."
