        "A film presenting a provocative theory of interest to educators and parents: that a child's performance in school is often closely related to what his teacher expects of him, rather than what an intelligence test might indicate him capable of. Dr. Robert Rosenthal of Harvard University and Dr. Sam Rabinovitch of McGill University and the Montreal Children's Hospital discuss this little-recognized inter-reaction. This theory is demonstrated in teacher-pupil situations where the subject is word-recognition."
