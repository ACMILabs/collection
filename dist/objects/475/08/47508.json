        "Elite sportspeople are becoming increasingly aware that nutrition is an integral component of their training and competition. This program provides an excellent summary of current nutritional practices for athletes. It looks at the requirements for training, competition and recovery, with a focus on three athletes: Liz Tadich (road cyclist), David Terek (soccer) and Lauren Burns (taekwondo). The program could also be used as a stimulus for further investigation into concepts such as: carbohydrate loading; pre-game meals; ergogenic aids - legal; designing diets for endurance and power athletes and Glycaemic index of foods. The video also examines the validity of the 'fads, pills and potions' which seem so common in elite sport today. Video support notes available. Suitable for Lower-Upper Secondary level students."
