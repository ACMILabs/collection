        "The atmosphere, the spirit and the pride of London, seen through the eyes of two young boys from the south side (right bank) of the River Thames. They set off one morning to see, for the first time, the more famous part of London, with its many historic buildings, its parks and shops, which lie on the opposite bank. The story is told through scenes and music only - no commentary. Photographed by Clifford Hornby."
