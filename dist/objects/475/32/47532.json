        "This film observes, in a Montreal public school, the teaching of English to immigrant children. To thousands of children arriving in Canada from Greece, Italy, France, Germany or Japan, English is \"a foreign language.\" Under able coaching they begin to understand and even enjoy the vagaries of the English language."
