        "An insight into the way in which the most successful modern education methods are put into practice. The children who attend the school at Wilson Dam, children from the homes of the Tennessee Valley, learn at school about their environment, about the River and the Valley and the Dam, and how they are controlled: about the things which affect their lives and their means of livelihood when they grow up. The school concentrates attention on the development of co-operativeness, self-reliance and understanding of the world around; parents are encouraged to visit their children at school during class hours. Photography: Russell Bushnell. Narration: John Martin."
