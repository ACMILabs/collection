        "A picture of village life in the farming areas of Norfolk and Suffolk. The camera passes among the villagers, their recreation, seasonal festivities and weddings, and follows at the same time the progress of the wheat crop - the foundation of the whole life of the village. Emphasis in the film is on the traditional life and ways of the countryside and the beauty of the changing seasons."
