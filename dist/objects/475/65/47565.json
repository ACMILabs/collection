        "Point St. Charles is a notoriously bleak neighborhood in Montreal, considered to be one of the toughest in all of Canada. Many of the residents are English-speaking and of Irish origin living in a French speaking community; many of them are also on welfare. It is a district poor in terms of community facilities, high unemployment, lack of educational facilities and opportunities, and juvenile crime. Voice and narration by Budd Knapp."
