        "Each fall, for generations, the families of the Pauingassi band have camped by northern Manitoba lakes, and combed the reedy shores with brooms, paddles and baskets for manomin - wild rice. The trade with the bush pilot begins the process by which an Indian staple and sacred crop becomes a white man's luxury food. A quiet but haunting film."
