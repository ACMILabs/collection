        "This film is concerned with the chemical aspects of water. Pure water mever occurs in nature, since water is the universal solvent. The percentage of water in man, in a fish, in a lettuce, and in a water lily are demonstrated. The formation of stalagtites and stalacmites in caves in limestone hills is compared with the furring of hot-water pipes and kettles, both being gradually formed deposits left behind by water. Some of the chemicals in water are needed by humans, since they are useful in building up body tissues. The film ends with a short summing up of the importance of work done by research scientists and chemists who are constantly studying the constituents of water."
