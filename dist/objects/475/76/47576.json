        "A study of the many ways that living things are adapted for living through the winter. The forest looks cold, bare, and dead, but a closer look reveals buds containing tiny leaves, the cocoon of a moth, a chickadee looking for insect eggs, rabbit tracks in the snow, and seeds that will grow next spring."
