        "Albert Tucker (1914-) is an intellectual artist with great independence of mind and mental courage. He has succeeded in fashioning a distinctive style and is now one of the leading artists in Australia. This film is based on a series of paintings by Tucker which deals with an unnamed explorer who perished in the outback desert. Imaginative paintings in an imaginative film."
