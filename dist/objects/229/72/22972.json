        "This film explores the origin of our planet's outer layer, the why-and-how of its mobility. Through the use of well designed diagrams, the earth's cyclical activity is clearly explained. Some unusual footage on volcanoes give added punch to an already absorbing subject. (Awards: Cleveland; New York). Credits include: Animation by Eva Szasz; sound by Larry Crosley, Karl Duplessis; photography by Bill Mason, Simon LeBlanc; music by David Green."
