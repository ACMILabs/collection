        "An expedition to Mount Nyiragongo, 11,000 feet above sea level - one of a chain of volcanoes in central East Africa. The expedition descends, terrace by terrace, to the lake of lava. Animated diagrams illustrate volcanic activity, then close shots of the lake show the mobility of molten lava, the formation of rocks, the burning of volcanic gases."
