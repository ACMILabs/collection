        "Shakespeare said it first, but here Gavin Millar of the BBC employs the phrase as a tribute to the unique filmmaking career of Norman McLaren. Millar talks with McLaren and another National Film Board film animator, Grant Munro, and shows many examples of the development of the McLaren style. It shows examples of his multiple exposure effects. Demonstrates how he makes moving pictures without cameras and sound tracks without instruments. Includes excerpts from his films, Hen hop, Pas de deux, etc. Photography by Robert Humble. (Awards: New York; Montevideo; Philadelphia.)"
