        "Protons and neutrons are now known to be composed of dozens of other particles whose interactions have yet to be accurately described. Physicists are detecting and analysing particle interactions with the aid of particle accelerators, bubble chambers and other sophisticated devices of high energy physics, thus arriving at a fuller understanding of the atomic nucleus."
