        "A new version of Sir Lawrence Bragg's famous analogue using bubbles on the surface of a liquid to demonstrate such phenomena as elastic and plastic deformation, dislocation and recrystallisation. A number of small bubbles of uniform size, blown on the surface of a soap solution, represents fairly accurately one cross-section of a metal structure. This bubble model is used to demonstrates the formation fo crystals in a metal, the slow production of larger crystals and the development of faults and slip planes."
