        "Explains how a projectionist can put on a professional 16mm sound film screening by observing a check list of hints and safeguards. Emphasises the importance of a pre-showing check of the kind and source of power, light control facilities and ventilation; of the correct set-up of projector, speaker and screen; placement and plugging of cords; adjustment of focus, screen size, tone and volume controls and a final check for clean aperture before threading."
