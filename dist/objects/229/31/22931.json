        "Episode of Series \"Plastering\". This first coat consists of a water repellent cement. Materials and their proportions are stated. The surface is scratched to provide a key for the next coat. This second coat is applied with the help of dots and screeds to ensure a true vertical surface. The formation of a plinth is demonstrated. This is made in two stages, core and finishing coat. The wall itself may be finished in various ways. Three different kinds of finishing coats are shows: Tyrolean finish, pebble dash, and rough cast."
