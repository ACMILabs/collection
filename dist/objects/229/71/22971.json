        "Considers glaciers, frosts, landslides and running water as examples of \"wearing down\" forces eroding the surface of the earth. In contrast are the \"building up\" forces as demonstrated by volcanic lava and buried sea shell fossils found in rock layers. Portrays the Painted Desert, the Petrified Forest, the Grand Canyon, Zion and Bryce Canyons as illustrations of spectacular geologic formations resulting from the unceasing war between the forces of nature."
