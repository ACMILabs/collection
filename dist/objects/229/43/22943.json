        "Episode of Series \"Biology program. Unit 4. Physiology\". Studies the eye, its component structures and their functions. Close-up studies of the parts of the eye and experiments with animals in a visual perception laboratory provide a clear distinction between the physical process and the electro-chemical process of seeing. Considers how light sources are focused on the retina activating light sensitive cells. Examines problems in determining how the brain evaluates and acts on visual stimuli."
