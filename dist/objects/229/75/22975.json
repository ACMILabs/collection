        "The story of four aboriginals grappling with assimilation pressures and facing a changing future. Through the experience of a bark painter, a teaching assistant, a carpenter, and a tribal headman, we see the type of life each one lives, and the conflict of the old and the new which sets up tensions within each one, and in Aboriginal society. (Award: Gold Award, General Category, Australian Film Awards, 1965)."
