        "Episode of Series \"History of the Motion Picture\". Still acknowledged as the biggest `spectacular' of all, this section of the D.W. Griffith production has enormous full-scale sets of old Babylon, fantastic battle scenes, thousands of extras, and amazingly realistic reconstructions of the life, habits and customs of those ancient times. Includes Constance Talmadge, Seena Owen, Elmo Lincoln, Alfred Paget, Elmer Clinton and Wallace Reid."
