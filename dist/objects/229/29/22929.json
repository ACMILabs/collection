        "A meticulous reconstruction of five crucial days in the life of a college for children in their last school year in Berkshire. A drug ring was discovered at the school. This led to mass expulsions, and to a tragic and unforeseen sequel. The film brings the problems of children and drugs to the fore and emphasises the need to take a stand on the issue."
