        "Records the 1962 FA Cup Final played at Wembley Stadium between the Tottenham Hotspurs and Burnley. Use of slow motion camera work helps make this an outstanding record of a thrilling final as it follows Burnley's attempt to stand up to the Spurs team at the peak of their form. The Queen and Prince Phillip were among the thousands of spectators."
