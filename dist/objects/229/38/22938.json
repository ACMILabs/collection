        "Illustrates the idea that people often see what they want to see, what they are prepared to see and not what actually exists. A series of incidents involving an artist who appears to be involved in the murder of a woman are presented. These show how he appears to his mother, to a waiter, a cab driver, his landlord and a cleaning lady. The story, as seen through the eyes of these beholders is quite different from what we see when the entire incident is repeated as it actually happened. The films emphasises the importance of caution in judging people and that no two people see the same thing the same way."
