        "A description of new methods of teaching applied science in schools, with particular reference to engineering and technology. The film visits a number of schools including the Technical Activities Centre at Sevenoaks School and Cray Valley Technical High School where practical interest in such projects as making a steam engine, and a go-kart, encourage theoretical study. The common objective of these courses is to develop the pupils' creative qualities of imaginative thought."
