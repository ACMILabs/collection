        "Inwardly, eyes may be the windows of the soul, but when the gaze is directed outward, they become much more than organs for perceiving the world around - they become also an instrument of involvement in all of life's drama. In this highly imaginative animation film, one disembodied eye (one is all that it takes) embarks on life's adventures, entering into and disengaging from all the many passions, vicissitudes and conflicts that beset one's course. Music by Maurice Blackburn and sound by Michel Descombes."
