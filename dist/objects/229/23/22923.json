        "Three people who handle explosives in the course of their everyday working lives are followed: a farmer, an opal miner and a powder monkey on a road construction crew. An earthly and humorous presentation, which effectively shows the right way to store and handle explosives and detonators with particular emphasis on the fuse...the two metre lifeline. Photographed by Paul Dallwitz."
