        "Episode of Series \"Face Australia\". Outwardly, Japan is an economic and industrial giant, whose growth from the ashes of WWII into a powerful trading nation is a remarkable success story. This film looks at both sides of the Japanese story, contrasting the nation's material wealth and manufacturing efficiency with the divisions created by changed social conditions, the tragic effects of uncontrolled pollution and pessimistic outlooks of concerned citizens."
