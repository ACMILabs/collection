        "Subjects such as music, drama, painting, pottery, sculpture and weaving are now being taught in schools. The study of these subjects is seen to enhance the social, physical, and emotional development of students, and it is argued that students are also inspired to put more effort into the traditional academic subjects. Photography by Edwin Scragg and edited by Wayne Le Clos."
