        "Like all fables, \"A Fable\" presents an idea in concrete form. In this case, the benefits of friendly co-operation that entails inevitable risks are contrasted with the miseries of self-imposed hostile isolation that avoids such risks. Shot on location near a 14th century village north of Rome, its cast includes the famous French pantomimist Marcel Marceau. It tells of a story of a man who, in order to protect his property, builds a wall to block out the world and consequently experiences loneliness and despair. The children eventually return and together with the man, pull down the wall and build a bridge across the stream which separates the man's world and the children's."
