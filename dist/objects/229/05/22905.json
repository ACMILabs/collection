        "Episode of Series \"B.P. Road Safety\". Takes the case of the \"speed demon\" behind the wheel - the man who wants to see what \"she'll\" do. Points out that you need to have experience to handle a car at high speeds. Speed in itself is not dangerous, provided that the road, the traffic, the car and road conditions are right. Above all the driver needs to be careful and experienced and keep in mind at all times that speed can kill."
