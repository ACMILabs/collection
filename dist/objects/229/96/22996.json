        "An examination of the scientific facts of human radiation filmed at the Argonne National Laboratory of the AEC in Lemont, Ill. Dr John E. Rose attempts to find out how much radioactive material the human body possesses naturally, how much we have been exposed to as a result of nuclear bomb tests, and the effects of radiation on health and life. Shows the tests of two groups of human guinea pigs; one group - radium dial painters who literally ate radium 30 years ago, and another group whose everyday drinking water has a higher-than-average percentage of radium."
