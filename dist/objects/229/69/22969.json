        "Walter Cronkite interviews Gerald Clark, an experienced Canadian reporter, against a background of film photographed in China by Rolf Gilhausen in 1958. This film covers life on farms, in cities and factories in a country which was then rapidly becoming a real Marxist state, with communal life and communal ownership. Vast resources of human energy were used on the building of dams and bridges with very few machines. The fundamental changes in family life, the indoctrination program, the question of Soviet assistance and the growth of secondary industry."
