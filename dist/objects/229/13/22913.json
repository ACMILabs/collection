        "Portrays a drama class taught by Veronica Sherborne which explores ways of using movement as an approach to dramatic expression. Illustrates basic movement experiences that can give people a sense of confidence in their body mastery and creativity. Three themes are developed: a relation to and awareness of others; an awareness of the ground; and an awareness of one's own body."
