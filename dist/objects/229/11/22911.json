        "At the beginning of this century earth was still a rural planet. By the year 2000, two out of three of us will be living in cities. This film examines the causes of this massive migration, the terrible poverty that ensues, and what steps are being taken in some cities in the developing world to cope with the great influx of people. It also notes attempts made by some countries to deal with the problem, e.g. sites and services programs in Senegal and Pakistan, self-help construction projects in Colombia, and house upgrading schemes in Zambia. Voice and narration by Bronwyn Drainie."
