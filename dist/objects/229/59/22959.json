        "She is a night club entertainer, in her way a highly successful exponent of her art, but there are moments when the admiration of her Montreal following is not enough. \"Fabienne\" is the portrait of a woman who has achieved enviable fame but is still far from content. (Award: Evian) Credits include: photographer by Guy Borremans; editing by Jacques Godbout, Gilles Groulx; music by Pierre Letourneau and sound by Joseph Champagne."
