    "description": [
        "The displaced eye of an unyielding, handheld camera studies the faces, hands and feet of commuters on the London Underground. The sequence begins as the train is leaving Temple Station, a center for the city's law practises and named for the Order of the Knights Templars, the suppressed Medieval Order from which the Freemasons claim decent. A middle-aged commuter pulls a variety of bored expressions while Asher's camera focuses on the gold signet ring he wears, a symbol of a Freemason. Successive characters show differing reactions, to the presence of the camera which has a pervasive power that admits no concessions to the rhythmic progress of daily routines."
