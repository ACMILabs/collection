        "Two flies hatch out and go off in search of food. They first visit a well-kept home; the dustbin is properly covered, the householders wash their hands frequently, the larder door is kept closed and the food in it is well-covered. Baulked here, they go on to a slovenly household, find lots of food lying about, sample it all. One fly goes back to the first house, is sprayed and killed. The other goes on to another dirty house and spreads disease and death An animated film."
