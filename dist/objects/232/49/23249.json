        "One of a series of films produced as a background for reading and expression. Following a visit to a zoo, one of the young visitors decides to learn more about seals. While he reads such words as \"waves\", \"swimming\", \"dive\" and \"fur\", seals are shown in their natural surroundings swimming, playing and caring for their young. Other activities, such as clay modelling and writing a story about seals, are suggested as a class project."
