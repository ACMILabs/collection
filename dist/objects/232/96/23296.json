        "Although large-scale production accounts for the major part of Britain's industrial output, there is still need for the precision work of the craftsman. This film concentrates on the manufacture of lenses in a world-famous Leicester factory. The delicate machines and instruments needed for the production of lenses of all types must be handled by highly skilled workers. Scenes are included which illustrate the various uses to which lenses are put."
