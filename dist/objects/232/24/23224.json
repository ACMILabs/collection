        "The pottery industry seen though the eyes of a young London girl marrying into a typical potteries family. The film tells of the life of the people in the potteries and of the great industry in which they work. It shows ways in which conditions of work are in process of being modernised. Factory sequences were shot at the Crown Staffordshire Pottery, Fenton and the Wedgwood Pottery."
