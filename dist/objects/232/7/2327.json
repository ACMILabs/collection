    "description": [
        "Essentially an adverisement for the Juniour Farmer's Organisation, focusing on how members and the community benefit from it. Stars 'Hal', a young man who must continue to run his family's farm while his father is ill.  Follows Hal and other junior farmers members as they complete various 'projects' such as raising lambs, preserving fruit and growing crops. Strong social element within the organisation is exemplified by a social dance that is used to bookend Hal's story.  Very earnest piece. Amusing end scene."
