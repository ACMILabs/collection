        "Episode of Series \"B.P. Road Safety\". The \"flying blind\" driver is the person who is inattentive and does not seem to be aware that three seconds of \"flying blind\" can cause accidents. Shows examples of inattentive driving and emphasises that fatigue can cause tragedy. Recommends that a rest stop every two hours or every 100 miles for highway driving is a safety precaution which should not be ignored."
