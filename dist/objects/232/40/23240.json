        "Nothing a man does on his own brings him closer to flight than skiing, a sport for which Canada provides the ultimate facilities. Filmed in 1968 in Banff and Jasper National Parks in the famed Canadian Rockies, where the alpine scenery of winter is no less spectacular than that of summer, this picture reveals the fine blend of exhilaration, risk, physical prowess and, of course, speed, that are all part of this challenging sport. Film without words."
