        "The legends and stories of the aborigines have been kept alive in song and dance. This film shows dancing at the Aurunum Mission Station in the north of Queensland. The dances are: \"ATHA AND PANTJ\" - three men die and change into the crow, dove and gecko lizard; \"MUIPAKA\" - the penalty for adultery is death; \"NINGKUSHUN AND ORPUL\" - Orpul the fairy girl created the freshwater shark; \"PIKUWA AND KENA\" - the freshwater and saltwater crocodile fight; \"PIPAPEPE\" - the courting and mating of the curlews."
