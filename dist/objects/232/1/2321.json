We know the poison from the radioactive dump will go down under the ground and leak into the water.\" The Kupa Piti Kungka Tjuta, a council of elder Aboriginal women from Coober Pedy, have been campaigning against the Federal Government's plans to build a national radioactive waste repository on their traditional lands in the South Australian desert. Four years after this documentary was made they are still fighting. A confronting documentary about Australia's history of Nuclear Testing and its impact on the indigenous inhabitants of so called 'uninhabited' land. For more information visit www.irantiwanti.org"
