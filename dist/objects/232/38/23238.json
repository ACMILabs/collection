        "A film about the sport of gliding, which creates the feeling of what it is like to soar as silently and effortlessly as a gull. This is a captivating journey into nearer space, where all the beauty of earth and heaven seems to meet at the wide-winged engineless craft poised between them. It will appeal to the adventuresome, but every audience will enjoy these unusual views of Canada's Laurentians and Rockies."
