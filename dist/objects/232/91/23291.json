        "This film identifies samples of LSD, peyote, DMT, STP, mescaline, psilocybin, hashish and marijuana. A series of situations in which young people advocate use of psychedelics, mostly LSD, is examined giving an opposing point of view. Some of the arguments cover the issues of potential chromosome damage, the ability to better understand oneself while using LSD, and the ability to love others. Written by Max Miller and narrated by Tommy Roe."
