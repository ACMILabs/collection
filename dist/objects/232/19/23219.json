        "This film is about the 16th century Flemish painter Peter Brueghel. A cultivated townsman, Brueghel rejected the manner and style of his contemporaries and painted landscapes and scenes of country life so truthfully that his pictures reflect every aspect of the day-to-day life of that time. Among Brueghel's work we see \"Hunter in the Snow\", \"Road to Calvary\", \"Taxing at Bethlehem\", \"Blind Leading the Blind\" and \"Wedding Feast\". Narrated by Sir Kenneth Clark."
