        "As young people fly with hang gliders and a pilot soars upwards in a glider plane, the pilot reflects on how despite the earth's many wonders - humans have always envied the birds and longed to fly. Soaring higher and higher, the pilot experiences an exhilarating freedom and a whole new perspective of the earth below. The earth becomes a single, living organism - more beautiful than he ever imagined. He discovers how fragile a hold life has on this planet and dreams of a technology that refines and perfects, rather than destroys and pollutes."
