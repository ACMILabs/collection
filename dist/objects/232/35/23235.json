        "An animated interpretation of the Pacific Ocean ablaze as a result of a collision between two giant supertankers. The film explains that there is no technology available to cope with such a disaster, and in a realistic, animated way it is a reminder of the dangers of tanker traffic in coastal waters. The stunning animation method used in this short film is similar to Japanese 'Manga' style. Although this film deals with serious issues surrounding environmental disasters, it manages to introduce some comic moments that simultaneously educate and entertain. Story by Ian Slater. Animation by Ernie Schmidt."
