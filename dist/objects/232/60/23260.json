        "Yorkville Avenue, Toronto, received newspaper prominence after it became what the papers called a \"hippie haven\". This film records what happened after the young people staged demonstrations to have the street closed to traffic, and civic authorities used corresponding persuasions to keep it open as a necessary traffic artery. The main confrontation takes place at a council meeting in City Hall, to which spokesmen for the young people have come to present their case. Here the film provides opportunity to judge both their attitudes and those of the city administration. Music by The Beatles and Ravi Shankar. Photography by Douglas Kiefer and edited Christopher Cordeaux. (Awards: Chicago; New York)."
