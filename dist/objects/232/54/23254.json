        "Explains the factors which affect the flow of electricity through a simple electrical circuit, introduces the electron theory, and shows the application of a simple circuit in a home situation. The film is centred around the inquiries of two children whose father explains to them what electricity is, how it flows through a closed circuit, what the function of the switch is, and how electricity used in the home travels over an electrical circuit."
