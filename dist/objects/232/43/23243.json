        "Bronzes of the Han and Wei dynasties, T'ang ceramics, Sung water colors and Buddhist frescoes of the Yuan all express in some way the Chinese philosophy of life. These glimpses of the art of China gives us some conception of this age-old civilisation. Dr. Liu Shih Shun, the then Chinese ambassador to Canada, narrates highlights in the history of the country, as a parade of her delicate masterpieces, drawn from the famous collection in the Royal Ontario Museum, passes before the camera."
