        "An account of the part played by the River Nile in the life of Egypt and the Sudan. From the confluence of the Blue and White Niles the film follows the banks of the great river and illustrates the importance of irrigation to the Sudan. The film ends by outlining the reason for Egypt's apprehension regarding foreign control of the headwaters of the river."
