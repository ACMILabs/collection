        "The Chilean Government's decision that life in the isolated fishing villages must be improved brought two visitors - a Chilean Inspector of Fisheries and a UN Fisheries expert to the village of Quintay. The people of this community were anxious for progress, but they could do little to help due to poverty. The UN expert suggested that the fishermen form a co-operative for selling their fish and buying supplies. As a result life in this remote Chilean village has been raised to a new level."
