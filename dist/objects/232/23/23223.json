        "A review of this great painter's life illustrated by his paintings, drawings and etchings. Through art he sought to perceive life. Caring little for society he depicted peasant life boldly. His feeling for detail is shown in the \"Potato Eaters\" and \"At the gate of Eternity\". His self-portraits show him to be a nervous obstinate visionary. He used bright colors to show character. A wonderful understanding of drawing is shown in the picture of the Red boats in the South of France, where the brilliant light inspired him to paint. Narrated by Sir Kenneth Clark."
