        "This film is about Danish inventor Jacob Christian Ellehammer and his experiments in aviation. Trained as a watchmaker and mechanic, Ellehammer produced the first motorcycle, a musical slot machine and a form of moving picture before turning to aviation. Between 1902 and 1909 he worked on several experimental powered aeroplanes and succeeded in making the first air flight in Europe. Later he worked on a helicopter, motor cars, and invented the fire extinguisher and a steam tractor."
