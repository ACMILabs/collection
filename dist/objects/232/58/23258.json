        "Animation and time lapse cinematography show the physiology of flowers, various types of flowers, and their methods of pollination. The part played by insects in the process of cross-fertilisation is illustrated, and the structure and function of the sepals, petals, stamens, pistil, anthers, pollen grains, stle, and ovaries are studied. The film also shows some examples of how cultivation has modified the form of some flowers."
