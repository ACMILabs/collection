        "'Harry She'llberight' is a lazy farmer, stuck in the 'old ways' of chemical spraying. He provides a 'worst case scenario' of chemical spray use. A representative of the Vistorian Department of Agriculture assists Harry in modern spraying techniques, equipment and safety. Along the way we are introduced to different spray epuipment and how it operates away from Harry's farm.  Harry is a comical character and he eventually gets his act together as the film progresses.  Opening contains nice shots of people picking lettuce and scens inside of a vegetable market.  Good cartoon-like illustrations about chemical spraying safety."
