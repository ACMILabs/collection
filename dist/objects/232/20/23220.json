        "This film is about the life and work of Italian painter Caravaggio. In 1600 he caused a sensation in Rome with his altar piece and two canvases for the side walls in the Contrarelli Chapel. Concentrating on religious subjects his leaning was towards the dramatic and the macabre. During the last nine years of his young life (he died at 37 years) he created his greatest work. Caravaggio restricted his palette to the use of one strong color - a warm red. Examples of his work shown are \"Supper at Emmaus\", \"Road to Calvary\", \"Bacchus\" and \"Narcissus\". Narrated by Sir Kenneth Clark."
