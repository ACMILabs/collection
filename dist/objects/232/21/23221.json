        "This film is about the life and paintings of Spanish painter, Goya. His upbringing was humble, but from his early work designing tapestry patterns, he caught the eye of the Spanish court and soon became an official court painter. For most of his life he was a rebel, and this spirit exhibited itself in many of his court and Royal portraits which are uncomplimentary but honest. At 45 a serious illness left Goya completely deaf. In this silent world his active imagination became tormented with strange visions best seen in his Caprichio etchings of owls, monsters, thugs and bats. Narrated by Sir Kenneth Clark."
