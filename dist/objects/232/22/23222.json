        "This film is about 17th Century Dutch painter Rembrandt. The son of a prosperous miller, Rembrandt was influenced by Caravaggio. This film is mainly about his etchings, most of which were done between 1639 and 1661. In particular we see his illustrations inspired by subjects in the Old and New Testaments. Illustrated by copies collected from Paris, Turin, Munich, Berlin and the Hague. Narrated by Sir Kenneth Clark."
