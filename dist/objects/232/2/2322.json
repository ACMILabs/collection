    "description": [
        "Three women - Trish Molloy (artist), Monique La Fontaine (artist), Sharon Wiggan (law student) - tell their stories, each from a personal perspective, of their relationship and connection to the Western Australian north-west coastal town of Broome. Trish and Monique are travellers who have separately found their way to Broome and stayed and Sharon is an Aboriginal Australian who was brought up in Broome, left to study in Perth and who has now returned home to Broome. The documentary explores each woman's emotional and spiritual attachment to the town, to their surrounding environment and their kinship with the people of Broome and with each other. Evocative and beautifully photographed by Veronica Iacono, and sensitively scripted and directed by Lucinda Gamble, \"The Nature of paradise\" is stunningly rich in images and colour, of reds and blues, of the earth, sky and the ocean and is accompanied by an ambient musical soundtrack, \"Free diving\" written and performed by Lorrei Coffin. Interspersed throughout the documentary are images of both Trish and Monique's paintings which reflect their transitional journey to this place called \"paradise\"."
