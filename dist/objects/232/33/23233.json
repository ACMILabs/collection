        "New Zealand's contribution to the International Geophysical Year, 1957-1958, as exemplified in the tracking of sunspots and the consequent interruptions to radio signals. The extent of New Zealand's observations; routine work at stations from Antarctica to the Pacific; the elaborate international communications system for tracing a sunspot and warning radio channels. A picture of scientific cooperation on an international scale."
