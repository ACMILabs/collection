        "Ron Hood, a young 'outdoors' person, takes us on a typical wilderness trip which has helped him become more confident in his own abilities. Starting out on one side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California with a few tools and the clothes on his back, he covers 70 miles, making or finding all his needs, while reaching the other side of the range. Filmed in Sequoia National Forest. Narrated by Lloyd Steele."
