        "Episode of Series \"Is this your career series\". A straightforward account of a sometimes over-glamorised profession. The copy boy carries out menial tasks; the cadet learns how to report crime, general, parliamentary, financial and sporting news. The erratic hours of work are shown to apply to radio and television journalism as well as to newspaper work, and the basic demands of the work are similar."
