        "Jordan Paul's approach to the drug problem is to relate to his students, by any means he can, in order to communicate about drug abuse. His approach is non-directive, he has problems to over come as an authority figure, but he promotes the substitution of people as an alternative to drugs. High school students discuss aspects of drug education."
