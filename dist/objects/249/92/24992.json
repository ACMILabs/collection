        "On 17 May 1960, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen mother, opened the Kariba Dam in Northern Rhodesia. The story of its construction and the difficulties which had to be overcome before the remote Kariba Gorge could become the biggest man-made lake in the world. Building a road into the Gorge; how floods disrupted progress; the power house; pouring the concrete and clearing the rising waters of timber. What the increased water supply and electric power will mean to Central Africa."
