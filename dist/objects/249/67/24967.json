        "Just a trace of some element - cobalt, copper, or molybdenum can give rich pasture and healthy sheep where until recently the desert defied the farmer. The film shows how South Australian areas once fit only for scrub have been transformed into prosperous farms. Many countries, as well as Australia, are now benefiting from the important research work in this field undertaken by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation."
