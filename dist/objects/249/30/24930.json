        "Spring comes to Selborne, where the 18th century naturalist Gilbert White made his record of the wild life in his Hampshire parish; rook and dabchick; frog and slow-worm, hedgehog, mole and vole; pussywillow, catkin, celandine, primrose. Two centuries later, as these and other forms of life respond to the seasonal rhythm, the story of spring is patiently recorded by probing camera and microphone and by the evocative words of Laurie Lee."
