        "Episode of Series \"Judo\". In judo, combination attacks are very important in the application of tactics, and in their turn tactics play a part in competition. Combination attacks have more objectives than simple terminal throwing. One other obvious objective is to tire the opponent. If attach after attack is launched and every time the opponent has to avoid and by doing so moves into another attack, it can becomes very exhausting - both physically and mentally. Here are demonstrated ouchi-gari into uchi-mata, ouchi-gari into tai-otoshi, ouchi-mata into sutemi-waza and ne-waza combination."
