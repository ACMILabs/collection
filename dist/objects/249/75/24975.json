        "Spread by water and wind, by birds and man's carelessness, weeds cost the Canadian farmer over one hundred million dollars each year. Several varieties of common weeds are identified, with a warning against the danger from each. Control measures such as the use of clean seed, special crops, sheep grazing, cutting and spraying are illustrated and, throughout, proper cultivation is shown as the basic remedy."
