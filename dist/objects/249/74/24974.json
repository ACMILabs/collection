        "In Australia, peanuts are grown at Kingaroy, Queensland. The film shows how they reach down from the stalks to grow under the soil, how they are harvested and left to dry in the hot sun. The many uses of peanuts are illustrated, including the surprising number of by-products such as fabrics, coffee substitute, cosmetics and high quality soap."
