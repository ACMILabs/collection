        "Written by Archibald MacLeish, this film dramatizes the life of Keats from his early years in England until his death in Rome at the age of 26. Relating the tragedies in his personal life to his development as a poet, the film portrays Keat's reactions to deaths in his family, financial worries, brutal criticism to his poetry, a troubled love affair, and the failing health that Keats endured, and rose above in his exceeding devotion to his art. Excerpts from his letters and poetry reveal the integrity of the man and the genius of the poet. Narrated by James Mason."
