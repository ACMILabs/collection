        "The story of the 620 million mile journey of Pioneer 10 from Earth to Jupiter. Pioneer 10, launched in 1972, arrived at Jupiter in December 1973. Presents information received from the Pioneer 10 mission, and describes how the information has been used to reprogram Pioneer 11 and redirect it in December 1974 toward a 1979 rendezvous with Saturn. Additionally, a proposal is discussed for another mission, decades in the future, that will land on the satellite to study a solar eclipse of Jupiter."
