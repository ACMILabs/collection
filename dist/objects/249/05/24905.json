        "Episode of Series \"Face to Face\". John Freeman interviews the distinguished American film director John Huston. Originally signed as a writer for Warner Brothers in 1938, his career was interrupted by the war. In 1948 he won the New York Film Critics Award for the Best Direction with \"Treasure of Sierra Madre\" which simultaneously earned his father Walter Huston an Oscar. His other films include \"The Asphalt Jungle\" \"Moulin Rouge\", \"Moby Dick\" and \"The Misfits\". In this probing interview, John Huston responds to questions related to censorship, the responsibility of the director and his reasons for selecting to work in this medium. He also frankly discusses his childhood, his marriages and his hopes."
