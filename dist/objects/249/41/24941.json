        "Joyce, a filmmaker, has her first baby at 34. She and other members of her family discuss the baby and how she is managing to continue her career. She represents any woman at any time who faces the conflict of work versus family. A sensitive and genuine portrait of the need for co-operation inside a family in order to achieve equality without guilt."
