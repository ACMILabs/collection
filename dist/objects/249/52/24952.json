        "A talented English company performs key scenes in this abbreviated version which, however, preserves the sense of tragedy of the full-length drama. Brief narrative bridges connect the scenes, which offers the first-time reader an opportunity to acquire a grasp of the main themes and action, and enrich his understanding and appreciation of the play."
