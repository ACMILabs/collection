        "Episode of Series \"Judo\". Having learnt the many techniques and the various factors which influence the way these techniques are used, the next stop is to learn how they can be linked. There are two main linking techniques - defensive and offensively; defensive linkage is known as countering. Counter take several forms, the value of which will depend largely upon the attitude of the person using them. Specific counters demonstrated are osoto-gaeshi, uchi-mata-gaeshi, an ippon-seoi-counter, waki-gatame and speed counters."
