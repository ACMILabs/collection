        "Forty miles south-west of Brisbane, at Canungra, troops of the 2nd Battalion are being turned into skilled jungle fighters. After an initial toughening course, training is done on a course consisting of obstacles the soldier could normally expect to find in jungle warfare. As the jungle affords many hiding places for the enemy, a course in snap-shooting is given. Training also includes detection of booby traps and trip wires, security precautions, sneaking, ability to gain information from objects left by the enemy indicating his path, position and strength, learning to take advantages of trees, tree climbing and assault training."
