        "An account of a jungle patrol by eight Australian soldiers in the Dumpu to Shaggy Ridge area of New Guinea during WWII. The film unit flew with the Australian patrol to the Ramu Valley and marched with it to the outpost of Shaggy Ridge in the Finisterre Range. The film shows the difficulties and dangers of the campaign - rain, mud swamps, tangled jungles and steep mountains - with the cameraman taking all risks under fire from the enemy. The soldiers were: Pte A.N. McGregor, L/Cpl A.C. Pierson, Pte R.F.C. Northcott, Pte A.B. Graffin, Pte M.J. Driver, Cpl R.A. Box, Pte J.H. Adams, Pte E. Barmby. Photography by J.W. Trerise and William Carty."
