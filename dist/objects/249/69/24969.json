        "This is professional hockey from the inside, an experience of the game that only the aspiring player can know. The film is about Les Nordiques de Quebec, the first truly French-Canadian professional hockey club. Coached at the start by superstar Maurice Richard, it is seen here playing its opening World Hockey Association game at the Quebec Coliseum. Vividly real is the pre-game tension, the on-ice action, where hopes rest on a flying puck, and, for one player at least, a dream realized in the inner office where big contracts are signed."
