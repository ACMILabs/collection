        "The camera zooms slowly in on a zoetrope featuring the stationary figure of a girl with a jump-rope. The zoetrope begins t turn and the jumping figure dissolves into life-enchanting, super-slow motion shots of young people jumping ropes. One unusual sequence views a jumper from below. Sequences employing multiple exposure and special computer techniques are used in demonstrating the healthful benefits of rope jumping."
