        "Shows Kanagwawa prefecture on the rugged sea coast of Japan and the great national park. Trees provide the material for the many traditional and modern handcrafts of the area - objects d'art, lacquer, silk scarves, wood carving and decorative articles and screens made from sea shells. Reclaimed submerged trees are also used. By contrast, we see the great industrial complex of Yokohama city, a bustling harbour from which Japanese exports are shipped to every part of the world."
