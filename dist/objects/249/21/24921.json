        "The well-known concert pianist and films star, Jose Iturbi, explains how the harpsichord functions. To demonstrate his explanation, he plays a composition by Jean Phillipe Rameau; as he plays, close-ups of his hands and feet show clearly the pedal-work and fingering. Iturbi then plays Liszt's Eleventh Hungarian Rhapsody on the piano."
