        "The rising waters of the Kariba Dam, largest man made lake in the world, threatened the wildlife in the area until Northern Rhodesian rescue teams put Operation Noah into practice. A typical day's work is the capture of boatloads of game, such as antelope and zebra and their safe release on dry land."
