        "Episode of Series \"Disappearing world\". The story of how the parents of an eleven-year old Sri Lankan boy consulted an astrologer to help them find their son. The astrologer instructs them to seek help from the god, Kataragama, who correctly forecast the boy would be returned in twenty one days. Shows scenes of worshippers of Kataragama who thank him for favours received by walking through pits of red hot fire. Some hung themselves from butcher's hooks impaled in their backs."
