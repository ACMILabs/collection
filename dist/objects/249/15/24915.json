        "Canada of a hundred years ago seen through the paintings of Cornelius Krieghoff, celebrated Dutch artist and adventurer. The changing seasons, the untamed beauty of the Quebec countryside and the French settlers among whom he lived were an unending source of inspiration to Krieghoff, whose work is a colourful record of French-Canadian life in the mid-19th century. Photography by Lyle Enright and Douglas Roberts. Edited by Colin Low. Music by Louis Applebaum. (Awards: Yorkton; Bilbao; Toronto; Kootenay)"
