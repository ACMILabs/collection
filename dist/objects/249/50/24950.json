The object of the third film in this series is to show how the range can be enlarged still further while keeping to the same pattern of learning as the first two films. Training exercises, a strangle shown from the back of the opponent, more throws - Kouchi and Kosoto-gake, an introduction to sutemi-waza, and some free play are shown. Photographed by Don Kelly."
