        "A detailed presentation of the painted and carved stone frescoes at Voronet monastery in Romania. Showing Byzantine influence, the church was decorated when Moldavian culture was at its height in 1488 during the reign of Stephen the Great. The work is full of life and local colour; its diversity of style reflects the imprint of each artists' personality. Includes paintings in the knave, vault, porch and exterior walls, one of which is like an Eastern carpet with human figures depicted against an azure background amid floral motifs."
