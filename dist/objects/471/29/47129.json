        "Episode of Series \"Buffy the vampire slayer\". Out of mind, out of sight (dir. Reza Badiyi): The painful price of what can happen when students are picked on or ignored is the subject of this episode, as several \"popular\" students become victim to an \"invisible\" girl. A flute can be heard accompanying the attacks and Buffy is able to trace the origins of the ghost back to a quiet student from years ago - someone that even Zander and Willow can't remember. Buffy isn't the only one aware of the invisible girl either, as federal agents are shadowing her every mood. Meanwhile, Angel contacts Giles in secret to warn him that Buffy is in grave danger. \"Prophesy girl\" (dir. Joss Whedon): The school dance is approaching but Buffy is unable to join the fun as she discovers that both Angel and Giles are keeping a secret from her - it is prophesised that she will die at the hands of the master. Devastated at the realisation that she cannot resign as the slayer, and that she will die aged 16, she dresses for the dance and prepares to meet the master. Angel, Zander and Giles closely behind her, determined to help her avoid her destiny."
