        "Footage of Dhurringile, the internment camp and military hospital, Tatura during or possibly just after the second world war. Tatura housed refugees from Europe and South East Asia (classified as enemy aliens) and was also a P.O.W. camp, housing German officers and batmen from the merchant ship Kormoran which sank HMAS Sydney in 1941. This film deals with an unknown parade outside the camp (possibly ANZAC) populated by soldiers from both world wars."
