        "Derek Jarman's last film, made as he was dying from an AIDS related illness, is a devastating exploration of death and dying. Delivered in Jarman's own voice-over, with assistance from Nigel Terry, Tilda Swinton and John Quentin, the film is a testimony to courage; it is also a farewell to love, and to life. By turns sad and exhilarating, the shimmering blue of the screen becomes a canvas across which the audience interacts with the essayist filmmaker. Jarman was one of the English-language world's most daring, transgressive and experimental film artists and it is fitting that his last film continues his maverick's love for exploration and the avant-garde. Right to the end, his wit and intelligence were undiminished. NOTE: VISUALS CONSIST OF BLUE SCREEN"
