        "This uniquely animated musical film tells us that teenagers don't necessarily have to follow the crowd, but can think and act for themselves. Exuberant young people dance, sing and perform athletic stunts on a city playground. Within the dance two peer groups interact, one enticing with drugs, alcohol and cigarettes, the other \"doing what's right for me\". The film is open-ended to provoke wide ranging discussion from the audience."
