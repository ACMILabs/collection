        "Venezuela is investing the wealth obtained from petroleum production to further the development of her country. A large percentage of her foreign earnings come from oil, and the Government has embarked on a policy of using profits derived from oil to finance schemes of soil and water conservation, technical education, housing, road construction, scientific research and the mechanization of agriculture to further improve the standard of living for her people. Music by Edmundo Ros."
