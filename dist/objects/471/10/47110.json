        "Made for Army Driver Training Establishments, Road Sense, made up of four short films, deals, from the driver's seat, with some of the problems and faults encountered on the roads. The films are intended for screening during a course on driving instruction with a view to stressing the importance of care and concentration. The third part deals with bends; children, animals, cyclists and other unpredictable road users."
