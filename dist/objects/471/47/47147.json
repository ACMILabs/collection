        "Following the assassination of a top Japanese Yakuza boss in Hong Kong, the most skilled hitmen assemble at a meeting held by the administrators of the dead man's Revenge Fund, which promises $100 million for the head of the killer. One hopeful yet good-hearted hitman is Fu, a pennyless mainlander who accidentally walks into the meeting and is adopted by Ngok Lo, a con man agent for professional hitmen. Ngok Lo buys Fu new clothes and coaches him in the Hong Kong ways, proposing that Fu help him track down the killer so they can claim the bounty. In Cantonese with English subtitles. Cast includes: Jet Li, Eric Tsang, Simon Yam, Gigi Leung and Keiji Sato."
