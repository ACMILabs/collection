        "Considered one of Canadian director Atom Egoyan's best moments, this film focuses on the lives of individuals as they revolve, in mysterious guises, around The Exotica, an erotic dance club. Taking the idea of the strip tease, and the voyeurism it plays to, Egoyan slowly reveals, in layers, how the lives we are watching on screen are all connected by a singular tragedy from the past. The ultimate truth of this event being saved right up to the very last scene. Cast includes Mia Kirshner and Egoyan regulars Elias Koteas, Arsinee Khanjian, Bruce Greenwood, Don McKellar and Sarah Polley. (Awards: Winner of the International Critics' Prize Cannes Film Festival 1994)"
