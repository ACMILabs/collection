        "Episode of Series \"Repairs in the Home\". A practical demonstration of how to mend an upholstered armchair when the seat is sagging or collapsed. A series of shots show the successive stages of building up the armchair on its wooden frame. Following this, a man is seen examining the seat of an armchair that needs repair. Work is started on the inverted chair, removing canvas and old webbing, refastening the springs, replacing the old webbing and stitching the springs to the new webbing, finally replacing the canvas cover. All stages of the operation are shown and explained."
