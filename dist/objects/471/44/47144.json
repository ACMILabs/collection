        "A training film for WWII servicemen showing basic survival techniques for the desert. When a B24 bomber crashes, the plane's occupants must organise themselves to conserve rations and energy in order to survive. The lack of water, the extreme weather conditions and the strain of coping during a disaster present enormous challenges to the servicemen. By supporting each other and following some basic rules, the groups chance of survival is increased."
