        "Methods in teaching physical education and guiding class activities for kindergarten through elementary grades. Starting with kindergarten and carrying through the elementary grades this film stresses the successful methods used in the teaching of physical education. It urges careful organisation and presents many ideas for the guidance of class activities. Based on the physical education program of Cleveland schools, this film is invaluable to the beginning as well as to the experienced teacher of physical education in any elementary school system."
