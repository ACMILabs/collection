        "This film illustrates the varied physical, human and economic geography of the Rhone lowlands and emphasises the extent to which the people of this region are dependent on the river. The varied character of the relief, climate and agriculture of the enclosed plains south of Lyons, of the Carmargue, Languedoc and the Crau is shown in stages. The importance of the river as a source of irrigation water and power and the use of the valley as a transport route are stressed."
