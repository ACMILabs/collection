        "This film gives an account of the proposed scheme for national parks in Great Britain. In congested areas where there is insufficient open space for recreation, damage is often done because both children and adults need recreation, and take it al the expense of, for instance, some farmer's property. Plans for the proposed beauty spots and parks to be reserved include places in the Lakes District, North Wales, Dartmoor, South Downs, Dovedale, Pembrokeshire Coast and Grassholm"
