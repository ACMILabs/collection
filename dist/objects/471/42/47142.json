        "The central industrial belt of Scotland is traditionally the site of heavy industries - coal, steel, and shipbuilding - which have repeatedly suffered cruelly from alternate booms and slumps. After World War II it was decided to set up a number of light industries in this area, so that the people may have some measure of economic security and continued employment, even when the heavy industries restricted their output."
