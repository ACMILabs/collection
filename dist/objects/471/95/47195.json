        "In 1960, Victoria's wheat growing record was smashed by a bumper harvest. 95% of the wheat was from varieties bred by the Victorian Department of Agriculture including Pinnacle; Insignia; Beacon; and Olympic. Don Rooney, an agronomist in the Wimmera region talks to Victorian farmer Harry Bouchier about his record harvest. We follow the wheat's journey from the farm, to the silos and finally being loaded onto cargo ships at the Port of Geelong headed for international destinations."
