        "A classic film for lovers of jazz music, \"Jazz On A Summer's Day\" documents the Newport Jazz Festival of 1958, which ranged from Anita O'Day's sassy rendition of 'Sweet Georgia Brown' to the powerful spirituality of Mahalia Jackson's great gospel singing. Director Bert Stern chose to not merely show the performers on stage, but to fuse the music with images of the festival as whole, giving a sense and feel of the whole event. Includes music performed by Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson, Anita O'Day, Gerry Mulligan, Dina Washington, George Shearing, Chuck Berry and Thelonius Monk."
