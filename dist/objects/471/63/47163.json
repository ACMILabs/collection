        "French cineagazine items including: 1. Grenoble, Olympic capital - On the eve of the Winter Olympics, Grenoble has had its face lifted. She is ready for this major sports competition. 2. Sports - Rugby: a good start for the French team in the 5 nations tournament. 3. Metal woman - Is metallurgy going into women's fashions? Coats of mail and helmets have become the newest \"material\". 4. Canada and modern art - A new exhibition in Paris, launched by the words of Andre Malraux \"An absolutely specific palette has arisen - that of Canada\". 5. Master copyists - Purposeful or accidental? A Parisian art-collector has asembled an impressive collection of masterpieces with strange analogies. Says Salvador Dali: \"Perrugino painted immortal canvases; Raphael copied them, and suddenly the miracle of Raphael's originality came to the fore\"."
