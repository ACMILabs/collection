        "Continues the story of the childlike vampire, Miyu, guardian of the portal between the human world and that of the Shinma (demon gods). In `Fragile Armour', Miyu pleads with the medium Himiko to help release her mysterious protector-servant Larva from the demon gods who have trapped him between the worlds. Himiko agrees to assist, but only in exchange for information about the elusive vampire's past. `Frozen Time' sees Himiko return to her childhood home in Kamakura in search of a mysterious house she believed was once there. As she delves deeper into her memories, she discovers the startling link between her fate and that of Miyu. A haunting saga of \"beauty, blood and sorrow\" from Toshihiro Hirano."
