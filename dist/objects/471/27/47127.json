        "Episode of Series \"Buffy the vampire slayer\". Angel (dir. Scott Brazil): Buffy is in love with Angel, Angel is in love with Buffy - as is Zander, who is secretly loved by Willow - the path to love never runs smoothly. When Buffy takes an injured Angel home one night after fighting vampires together, they exchange a kiss and Buffy learns of his vampiric origins. She backs away from him, despite their love, and fears the worst when she arrives home to find Angel looking at her mother's bloody neck. Meanwhile, Zander is frustrated by Buffy's infatuation with Angel, and Buffy is being hounded by an ex flame of Angels who is not only desperate to kill her, but also for her ex-beau to reclaim his dark origins. \"I Robot, you Jane\" (dir. Stephen Posey): Willow meets a boy online and Buffy and Zander are suspicious - making Willow even more defensive of her new boyfriend's outrageous claims about her friends. Little do they know that Willow has been communicating with a demon spirit from the Dark Ages who has been channeling through someone at Sunnydale High. Giles is having technical problems of his own as he struggles to reconcile his traditional methods of working with the computer age - as represented by a new teacher at school, who happens to know quite a bit about demons and vampires."
