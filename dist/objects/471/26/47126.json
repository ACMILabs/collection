        "Episode of Series \"Buffy the vampire slayer\". Witch (dir. Stephen Cragg): Buffy tries out for cheerleading but is short listed along with another girl, Amy. When strange things begin happening to girls that made the team, Buffy begins to suspect that Amy's mother - a successful cheerleader in her day - is a witch, and is knocking off rivals so that her daughter can make it in. When a deadly spell is cast on Buffy, Giles takes the drastic step of confronting Amy's mother and discovers that things aren't as they seem. Zander continues in his quest to ask Buffy out for a date, but once again is thwarted because her attention is focused on fighting witches. \"Teacher's pet\" (dir. Bruce Seth Green): Buffy is saddened by the death of the one teacher who believed in her. Zander - along with the rest of the male population of the class - is very happy with his replacement, Ms French. One of the students who stays after class to help her build egg sacs disappears, yet Zander, happy to have female attention, also volunteers to go Ms French's to help with the construction. Buffy encounters a fork wielding vampire cowering in the presence of Ms French and begins to suspect something sinister is afoot. Using the knowledge she gained from her favourite biology teacher, she begins to see similarities between the substitute teacher and the insects that she is instructing them about."
