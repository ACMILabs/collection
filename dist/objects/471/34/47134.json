        "Annie James and Hallie Parker (both roles played by Lindsay Lohan) have nothing in common, or so they think. Sent to the same summer camp, the girls dislike each other from the beginning, despite an amazing resemblance between them. Forced to spend time together as punishment, the girls discover a common bond. They are actually sisters, separated after their parents divorce. Deciding that they each want to meet the parent they have been separated from, the girls switch places, intending to eventually switch back and reunite their parents. Hallie goes to London to be with their mother, Elizabeth (Natasha Richardson), and Annie to California to be with their father Nick (Dennis Quaid). Things don't go to plan with Nick revealing he is planning of remarrying. Can the girls stop the wedding and get their parents back together? A remake of the 1961 film starring Hayley Mills."
