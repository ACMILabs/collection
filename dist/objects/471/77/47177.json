        "From the animated series \"Willie Whopper's Adventures\", the story of Willie Whopper, a little boy with a big imagination. Willie tangles with denizens of the deep, including a vast and menacing Poseidon figure and a drunken pirate (Davy Jones), who swills hooch while slamming his peg-leg stump on the deck of his room. Lots of sea-creature sight gags, too."
