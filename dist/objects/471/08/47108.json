        "Made for Army Driver Training Establishments, Road Sense, made up of four short films, deals, from the driver's seat, with some of the problems and faults encountered on the roads. The films are intended for screening during a course on driving instruction with a view to stressing the importance of care and concentration. The first opens with a leading truck driver attributing good driving to care on the roads, and follows with some shots of typically careless driving ending with a crash. ."
