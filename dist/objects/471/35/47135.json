        "Drive smart is an interactive package designed to assist learner drivers in improving driver education, safety and skills, before taking the all important driver's licence test. Each module will help you become familiar with the necessary responses and actions required when driving, including scanning and hazard perception and making judgements on a number of driving scenarios and quizzes. It is emphasised that this is a training supplement and is not designed to replace supervised driving practice. \"Drive smart\" was developed with the assistance of Monash University Accident Research Centre over a period of three years using state of the art driving simulators. For more information visit www.drivesmart.vic.gov.au."
