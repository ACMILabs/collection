        "Monkey swallows the universe - Tripitaka and Sandy get into a fix. Pigsy is bewitched by a beautiful woman and Monkey finds himself in trouble again as they enter the land ruled by the demonic Golden Horn and his wife, Silver Horn. \"The Power of youth\" - Tripitaka is kidnapped by the King of Youth to attract the attention of Heaven and Earth. With Sandy and Pigsy busy, it is left to Monkey to save his friend. \"Even monsters can be people\" - after killing a girl and her parents, Monkey is sent away by Tripitaka despite swearing they were really demons in disguise. The pilgrims realise that Monkey was telling the truth, but his failure to believe Monkey leaves Tripitaka in danger. All episodes are dubbed in English."
