        "French cinemagazine items including: 1. Lily-of-the-valley May Day - In Paris, on every street-corner, traditional May bouquets of lily-of-the-valley, and the market-porters brought their offering to the President of the Republic. 2. Notre Dame - Monsignor Marty, new Archbishop of Paris, is welcomed before the famous cathedral by the Diocese Community. 3. Knives and forks - In Saint-Denis, where Dagobert's famous goldsmith, Eloi, had his workshop, the ancient art of the silversmiths is perpetuated. 4. Chatillon, an artistic center - Decentralisation of cultural and artistic activities in France has resulted in the creation of art centres in the suburbs around the capital. A good example is Chatillon-sous-Bagneux. 5. Royan, Fifth International Festival of Contemporary Art - Royan, on the Atlantic Coast, entirely rebuilt vollowing World War II, presents the Fifth International of Contemporary Music featuring Olivier Messiaen, Didier Denis and Karlheinz Stockhausen."
