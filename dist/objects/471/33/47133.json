        "Considered one of the greatest westerns of all time, this is also Ford's most consciously poetic western heavily overlaid with the weight of myth: the pitting of dark against light, wilderness against garden, paradise lost and then regained. A revenge plot culminating in the gunfight at the OK Corral is set against the leisurely and romantic portrayal of a period epitomised by the ritual celebration of community in the square dance. Henry Fonda plays Wyatt Earp, the wanderer planning to settle, the mover between worlds. The foil to Earp is the tragic figure of Doc Holliday (Victor Mature). Based on a book by Stuart N. Lake from a story by Sam Hellman. Cast also includes Linda Darnell."
