    "description": [
        "The collaborative cut-out animation humourously puts a spin on an iconographical film noir scene - the chase. In a dark and deserted building a man (also dark) with his violin and limp follows a lone woman through the floors. Tension builds and eventually the mysterious figure is jumped by the woman who grabs his violin. A fight ensues with the turn throwing of a range of instruments at each other; a violin, tuba, piano all with accompanying foley. No credits provided."
