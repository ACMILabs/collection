        "An innovative film on the Borroloola people's struggle for the recognition of Aboriginal law. Aborigines actively collaborated with the filmmakers in determining the form of the film which is in four parts. \"Police times\" is a dramatic re-enactment of white oppression in the 1930's. \"Welfare times\" A re-enactment of life under the welfare system of the 1950's. In \"Struggle for our land\" Aboriginal attachment to the land is described and the first hearing of the Borroloola land claim is also re-enacted. \"Living with two laws\" is concerned with the movement back to traditional land and the setting up of cattle out-stations."
