        "Kevin is an apprentice motor mechanic in the western suburbs of Sydney, who, with his mate Bob, spends all his spare time drinking and cruising around the streets in his canary yellow FJ Holden, looking for girls. Derived from a series of comic poems by Terry Larsen, Thornhill's adaptation replaced the humour with an austere and grim description of a conformist society."
