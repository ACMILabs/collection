        "Episode of Series \"Scales of Justice Series\". The Job is a story of naivety. Probationary Constable Leonard Webber has the makings of a good policeman, but his ideals bring him into conflict with his colleagues. His lack of experience makes him vulnerable and his training has not prepared him for the system, how it works and the rationalisation of the double dealings. Rated: M"
