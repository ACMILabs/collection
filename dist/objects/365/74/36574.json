        "Based on Rudyard Kipling's classic fable in the \"Just So Stories\" series, this beautifully presented story in claymation tells of a young elephant who learns the price and reaps the rewards of curiosity. When the elephant asks the crocodile what he has for dinner, the crocodile clamps the elephant's stubby nose in his teeth. Pulling away, the elephant finds his nose is stretched completely out of shape - but to his surprise he discovers the long trunk is useful in a number of ways."
