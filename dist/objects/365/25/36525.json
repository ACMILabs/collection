        "Portrays the progress made since 1945 in the establishment of ex-servicemen from World War II on Victorian land. The division of large estates, the development of existing pastures, the clearing of scrub country and the construction of irrigation channels are seen on representative farms throughout the state. Fruit growing, the dried fruit industry, wheat cultivation and sheep raising, plus dry and irrigated dairying are shown, in addition to the single-unit farm system."
