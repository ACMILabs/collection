        "In Cornwall, England, a big American company is about to re-open an abandoned tin mine, despite being warned against it. At the turn of the century the mine caved in and many miners were trapped beneath the surface. A ghost is sighted by a local boy - it is the ghost of one of the people trapped during the cave-in and it is trying to warn of disaster."
