        "A beautiful, gothic film about a mother so desperate to keep her daughter at home that she sews her a lead dress which impedes her movement. Shot in black and white without dialogue, the film uses a form of pixillation which, when combined with slow-motion performance, gives the effect of its characters moving in a slow and jerky fashion while cars and people in the background flash past at high speed."
