        "Based on L.P. Hartley's classic Edwardian novel. The screenplay written by Harold Pinter is the story of lost love, youth and innocence. Spending a long hot summer at a Norfolk stately home, a young boy becomes the misunderstood carrier of love letters between an aristocratic lady and a local farmer - a forbidden romance ending in heartbreak and tragedy for all. Cast includes Julie Christie, Dominic Guard, Margaret Leighton, Michael Redgrave, Michael Gough, Edward Fox and Alan Bates."
