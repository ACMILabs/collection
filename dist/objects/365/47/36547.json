        "Based on the Thomas Keneally novel, this is the fictionalised story of Jimmy Governor, who, in 1901 went on a rampage killing numerous white settlers. Deft characterisation and ironic detail combine to paint a bleak portrait of a bitterly racist society emerging as a federated nation. Starring Tommy Lewis in the title role with co-stars Ray Barrett and Jack Thompson."
