        "Dalmas was a key work in independent cinema of its time, and it's still a fascinating cinema experience. Made on a collective basis mainly with members of the communal artistic performing group, The Tribe. Heavily influenced by hallucinations and the philosophy of the time, the film also impresses with its formal innovation."
