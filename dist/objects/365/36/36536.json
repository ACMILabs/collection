        "Bliss is the story of a man who so misunderstood the world that he almost got it right. The man is Harry Joy, he is happy, he has a successful business, a lovely wife and two loving children. When he dies, his life is ruined. He comes back to life and takes a good look at the world around him. His wife is sleeping with his partner, half of everything he eats causes cancer and an elephant sits on his car. No wonder Harry Joy believes that he has gone to hell. This film is based on the novel by Peter Carey. Cast includes Barry Otto, Lynette Curran, Helen Jones, Miles Buchanan and Gia Carides."
