        "An absorbing docu-drama about a young couple who, in trying to buy and build a house, find themselves in a spiralling nightmare world of deceit, incompetence and rising interest rates. The film shows the couple's growing awareness and acceptance of emotional and financial responsibility. Like the companion films Custody and Malpractice this is a cautionary tale in the form of docu-drama, offering no easy answers or simplified dramatic conflict, instead seeking to create a sense of lived experience while dramatising the issues involved. The key characters are played by actors with architects, solicitors and government services officials playing themselves. Cast includes Doris Younane, Brian Vriends, Bruce Venables and Andrew Gilbert."
