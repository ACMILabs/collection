        "A member of the Walmajarri tribe, Jimmy Pike walked out of the Great Sandy Desert in the remote north-west of Western Australia when he was 14 years old. Today, his exciting, brilliantly-coloured prints and paintings can be seen in every State gallery in Australia. Most major department stores carry a wide range of sportswear, bed linen and other items bearing his innovative designs. Overseas, his work has achieved extraordinary popularity."
