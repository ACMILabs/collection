        "Malpractice is an emotional portrayal of a family's efforts to come to terms with the result of medical malpractice; and a mother's need to find out the truth. While most of the characters in this dramatic docu-drama are portrayed by actors, some hospital staff play themselves. The members of the legal profession are all practising solicitors and barristers. The findings of the tribunal are not scripted, but determined by the presentation of the case."
