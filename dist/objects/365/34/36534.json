        "The working relationship and friendship of two Australian artists - Thea Proctor and Margaret Preston. Margaret Preston and Thea Proctor took tea together, worked together and exhibited together. Their alliance was brought to an abrupt end in 1925 when Margaret Preston threw a cream cake at Thea Proctor, at a party celebrating their joint exhibition. This video is an insightful look at two strong Australian women, their relationship and their art."
