        "There's nothing the matter with sexual inexperience. It's perfectly natural as Peter and Patricia eventually discover after some rather embarrassing and sensitive moments. Having met through a lonely hearts club, they embark on a timid, tentative relationship, but problems arise because of Peter's clumsy attempts at love making. What follows is a delightful, sensitive love story, simply told with compassion and humour, full of real characters who surround and complicate our everyday lives. Starring Wendy Hughes and Norman Kaye."
