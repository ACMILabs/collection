        "In 1968 Hazel de Berg interviewed Australia's most loved storyteller, May Gibbs, the creator of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie and all the bush folk. During the video, you will hear May Gibbs (Mrs. Ossoli Kelly) tell of her birth in 1877 in Surrey, England, her trip to Australia in 1881, her family's settlement in Western Australia and her adventures in the art schools of London. She speaks of her love of the Australian bush, her development as an artist and reveals the creation of the Gumnuts and all their friends and foes."
