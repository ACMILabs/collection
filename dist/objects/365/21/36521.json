        "Jessica Simmonds returns home from London and is shocked to find the street she grew up in being torn apart to make way for a high rise development. She sympathises with the plight of the local residents, who are being forced out of their homes by the brutal tactics of the developers. Probing into the background of Angel street development, she unearths a sinister connection between organised crime, the developer, the police and the highest levels of government."
