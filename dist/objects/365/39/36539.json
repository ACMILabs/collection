        "Set in Australia in the 1930's, this film is the poignant but powerful story of a bitter struggle between two sisters to gain possession of a little boy. The boy is PS, who lives with his Aunt Lila and Uncle George who raised him from a baby and cherish him as their own. PS' world crashes around him when his beautiful and rich Aunt Vanessa arrives from England and takes him to live with her in a luxurious Sydney harbourside mansion. Vanessa tries to mould PS to her standards and new way of life. PS must face the sisters' lies, manipulations and mutual hatred. The web of deceit grows, and PS is forced to act as a go-between. It is through his father, a stranger to him, that PS finds the key to his future. Cast includes Wendy Hughes, Nicolas Gledhill, Robyn Nevin, John Hargreaves and Geraldine Turner."
