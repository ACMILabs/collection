        "An innocent passion for a forbidden experience leads Daisy (Rachel Ward) into a three-sided relationship with her forgiving husband (Bryan Brown) and her husband's brother. When small town prejudice threatens to overturn all their lives Daisy's sexual pursuit becomes even more of an obsession as she turns her attention to the newly arrived womanising barman (Sam Neill) - with almost tragic consequences."
