        "This is the classic Grimm's fairytale brought to life by the narration of Vincent Price. This colourful animation tells of Spellbinder the Sorcerer who hires Hans as his apprentice, believing that Hans can neither read nor write. Hans is at first an enthusiastic apprentice, but after learning of Spellbinder's evil ways, plans to use what he has read in the Book of Magic to defeat his master."
