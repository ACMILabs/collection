        "A spoiled princess scorns the love of a worthy prince yet will kiss a swineherd a hundred times for a silly musical toy. An adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen story that uses original illustrations from the book by Bjorn Wiinblad. Interesting animation by Gene Deitch with touches of irony in narration. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
