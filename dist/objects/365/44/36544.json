        "In 1973, Cathy Baikas, a Maltese immigrant, contacted \"The Sun\" newspaper office in Sydney to seek help. Cathy's Greek-born husband, from whom she was separated, had left for Greece, taking with him their baby daughter. The incident becomes a \"cause celebre\" and eventually Cathy is given custody of her daughter, and a passport to travel to Greece. With the help of the Australian Consul in Athens she manages to get her daughter back from her husband's family. Based on \"Sun\" journalist, Dick Wardley's book, \"A Piece of Paper\". Cast includes Michelle Fawdon, Bryan Brown and Frankie J. Holden."
