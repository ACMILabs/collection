        "Episode of Series \"Scales of Justice Series\". The Numbers is a story of ambitious and cunning manipulation. Glen Ferris is an astute young politician. At 41 he is already Attorney General, but his revolutionary reforms have weakened his standing in the Senior Cabinet. He needs the numbers, so he decides to use his controversial bill to take on vice-king Artie Roach, a move which makes him a crusader in the public eye while causing discussion in his own parliamentary wing.
