        "An Oxford undergraduate is killed in a car crash; his tutor looks back over the tangle of personal relationships that contributed to his death. This screenplay by Harold Pinter, based on the novel by Nicholas Mosley, is a fascinating, if uneven, study of a teacher who becomes involved with his student. Cast includes Dirk Bogarde, Stanley Baker, Michael York and Jacqueline Sassard."
