        "The lavish and spectacular television production of Georges Bizet's \"Carmen\", staged at London's Earls Court in June 1989, proved beyond doubt the resounding success of opera on such a grand scale. Playing to sell-out audiences of over twelve thousand at each performance, the production drew rave reviews from all the critics. Starring Maria Ewing, who has now made this part her own, \"Carmen\" was staged in the centre of Earls Court, surrounded on all sides by the audience to create the atmosphere of a Spanish bullring."
