        "Episode of Series \"Scales of Justice Series\". The Game is a story of jealousy and conflict, personal and professional. Detective Sergeant Draffin and Miles are both from the same mould. Both are ruthlessly ambitious, both boast a reputation of being first class operators, and both are very confident of their ability. However, neither is used to sharing the limelight, and when Draffin is transferred to the Drug Squad, Miles' home territory, the scene is set for a major confrontation. Rated: M"
