        "A personal reaction to the ironies implicit in Remembrance Day, 11 November, 1975. \"Exits\" is an experimental feature film, one of the first Australian features to merge documentary and enacted elements. The film looks at the effects of the Whitlam sacking on a handful of people wandering the streets, dumps, pubs and public transport of Melbourne. It uses a mixture of radio voice-overs, poems, telexes, headlines and press conferences to set a documentary background against which the growing anger and frustration (or indifference) of the characters can be measured. Rated: G"
