        "A collage of animation and live action footage with complex symbolic images being offset by a careful balance of pop music and classical chants. It details the exploitation of the female psyche, the castration complex, fertility rites and the repressive nature of the Church. Lee's approach is at times violent and iconoclastic, but what emerges from this savage attack on religious mythology is the awareness of nature's eternal rejuvenation process. Rated: R"
