        "Sir Edmund Hillary and friends journey from the ocean at India's southernmost tip to the snows of Himalayas, a pilgrimage similar to those taken by millions of Hindus each year. Travelling by such unconventional means as canal boat, camel, elephant and bullock cart as well as by foot, bicycle, train and an old river sailboat, they were able to see the real India, through the tropical backwaters of Kerala, the deserts of Rajasthan, along the Ganges and into the Himalayas. They saw snake boat races, a heart-stopping martial arts display with flexible swords, a gathering of 10,000 camels, an ancient fort city in the Thar desert and much, much more. A stunningly photographed record of the remarkable sights and experiences of this remarkable journey - an enthralling family adventure."
