        "Barry Crocker plays Barry McKenzie, a wild colonial who heads off for London with a legacy left to him by an uncle. He makes straight for Earls Court to join up with his mates, and from there rampages through London with his Aunt Edna (Barry Humphries), \"cracking tubes\", \"chundering\", and \"pointing Percy in the snake's room\" all the way. His adventures culminate in an interview, (minus his trousers), with Joan Blakewell and the BBC. Dennis Price, in one of the last films he made before he died, with Spike Milligan and Peter Cook add their comic talents to this 'adventurous' movie."
