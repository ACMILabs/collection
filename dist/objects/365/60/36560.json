        "Edward Lear's nonsense poem tells the love story of the owl and the pussycat who sailed together to the land where the Bong-tree grows; there they married, ate wonderful food and danced by the light of the moon. This fantasy comes to life in Halas' cartoon with the verses sung by Maurice Bevan. Animation: Vic Bevis, Reg Lodge. Suitable for lower primary school level."
