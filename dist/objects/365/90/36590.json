        "Confessions from the funeral trade. There are no cadavers in Bodywork, because the film is about the living. David Caesar introduces us to the workers of the death industry rather than the clients. What they talk about is fascinating; how they say it is riveting. The various stages of mortuary work are explained by people who take pride in their profession. \"Bodywork\" is a thoroughly illuminating and entertaining film. This film won the Best Documentary Award at the 1989 Melbourne Film Festival."
