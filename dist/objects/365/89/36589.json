        "A striking feature of India is the prevalence of cows in all the cities and the tolerance and respect with which they are treated. This film traces the origin of the sacred cow concept showing how it is supported, not only by religion but by the practical value of cattle and their products. The story leads the viewer through scenes of bull wrestling in the South, the colourful rural Vishnoi people of Rajasthan, the giant cattle fair of Brahmin priests and the the Hari Krishna cult, and the elevation of cows to divine status."
