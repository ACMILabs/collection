        "An award-winning dramatic treatment of individual loneliness in a large city. Monica Maughan plays a spinster approaching middle age who lives with a dominating mother. After the death of her mother, unable to make human contact, she slips into a fantasy world in which a small doll becomes her \"daughter\". The film was shot on 16mm for about $30,000."
