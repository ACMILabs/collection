        "Swimming is about the tug of the tide. In an effort to make sense out of the confusion, 12 year old Lee Johnson decides to make a movie of her life using her Dad's home video camera. She confronts the sticky question of her identity and searches for answers in the cobwebbed corners of domesticity. Some things, it seems, are better left alone. She finds herself drawn, inevitably, towards an unwanted ending."
