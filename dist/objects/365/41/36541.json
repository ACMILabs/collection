        "There is an unexpected knock on the door and Jilly (Judy Morris) an anthropologist, opens it to a strange man who says he is the plumber (Ivor Kants). Weir deftly crafts a tense thriller, as the man is not all he seems and Jilly is tormented by the man's presence and mind games over the next five days as he totally disrupts her life. Her husband, a university doctor (Robert Coleby), seems oblivious to her anguish and just wants the shower fixed. Disturbing and unsettling in mood, set in a high-rise apartment block with large balconies that feel lifeless and unconducive to a happy life, Jilly plots to play the plumber at his own game and foils his plans. Written and directed by Peter Weir. Also available on DVD [319169]."
