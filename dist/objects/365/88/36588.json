        "A young son is filled with burning resentment at being forced to live in his brother's shadow. His brother is burdened by their father's desire for glory. Their father is obsessed by the need to redeem his own failure twenty years before. A dramatic story of family conflict which culminates in the spectacular excitement of the greatest beach and surf triaquathon in the world, the Coolangatta Gold. Both brothers enter the race, one to win for his father, one bent to beat his father. To do so, they must also compete against each other. Cast: Joss McWilliam, Nick Tate, Robyn Nevin, Josephine Smulders, Colin Friels."
