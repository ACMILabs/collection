        "Brian Morley, Aboriginal singer/song writer, is searching for his \"Dreamtime\". In 1960, at the age of two, along with his baby sister Jennifer and his older brother Shane, Brian was removed from the care of his natural mother in Dimboola by police and welfare and taken to the Turana Children's Home in Melbourne. This is the story of Brian's experiences growing up with a white adopted family, the long-term effects of being removed from his mother and separated from his brother and sister, and the search in his adulthood to find his family and define his Aboriginality. Brian eloquently relates his story in his own words and through his music, expressing hope for the future of all Australians and Australia. Narrated by Andy Johns. Teacher notes included."
