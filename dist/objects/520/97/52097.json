        "This video is a guide as to how to communicate better in a team environment. The first recommended step is to accept the diversity of the modern workplace and the array of backgrounds of staff members. This means having patience and understanding that those from another cultural background may find it harder to absorb instructions. Tolerance is the key to successful team environments. The second recommended step is to participate in meetings, listen to each other and show interest, stay on track, and do not divert from the meeting's main topic; be open to ideas, don't jump in early and trounce others' ideas. Lastly, ask your manager for feedback. Be specific and probe for precise ways in which to improve your performance."
