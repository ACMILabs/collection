        "First series of the bitingly satirical British television series, \"The Office\". Ricky Gervais plays David Brent, the manager of a paper merchant factory and office in Slough. Gervais is an identifiable type in the workplace - a delusional man who believes himself to be witty, universally adored by his staff, efficient, and an effective boss with impeccable people and business skills. Adhering to a mockumentary structure, a camera crew follow the workers around, documenting office life - boredom, bad jokes, uncomfortable moments, embarrassing faux pas and the emptiness of at work interactions that pass the day. Features fine performances and much hilarious to-camera addresses, whereby characters vent their deepest frustrations. \"The Office\" skilfully captures the monotony of office work and the relieving of ennui with innumerable trivialities. Ep 1: Introduces the main characters including arch petty rivals Tim and Gareth; establishes the budding romance between Dawn and Tim. Ep 2: When a pornographic picture of Brent is circulated, Gareth investigates. Ep 3: Tim's birthday; quiz night at the pub. Ep 4: Staff training day. Ep 5: Tim considers resignation; Gareth takes an unhealthy interest in the new girl. Ep 6: Cutbacks cause staff disgruntlement."
