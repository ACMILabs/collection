        "Presented by Tony Robinson (Blackadder's Baldrick), this World Wildlife Fund compilation of 30 international animated shorts is aimed at increasing awareness of environmental issues. Using claymation, stop start animation and computer animation, the tales cover a variety of issues such as pollution, overdevelopment, water and energy conservation, the dumping of toxic waste, recycling, logging, extinction and the depletion of the ozone layer. Also includes footage from the BBC series \"Going live\" in which a 12 year old viewer won a competition to have her storyboard for a \"Morph\" episode with a \"green\" theme brought to animated life by the Aardman studios. She visits Peter Lord at the studios who explains the animation process."
