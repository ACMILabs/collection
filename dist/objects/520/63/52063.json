        "Tony has just been released from Pentridge after serving six years for robbery. He sets out to settle old scores and search for his girlfriend Anna. In the process he hitches a ride north with the enigmatic Sam and a relationship develops between them. The theme of coming to terms with the past is expressed formally through the non-chronological structure which produces a split narrative - the Melbourne scenes and the journey north - which inform each other as the story unfolds. Underlying the journey to awareness is the city/country antinomy - the country has the power to liberate what the city has entrapped. Features the music of AC/DC, Rose Tattoo, Stiletto, The Angels and Steve Wright. Cast includes Richard Moir, Judy Morris, Chris Haywood, Bill Hunter, Ian Nimmo, Maurie Fields."
