        "This instructional video uncovers the secrets of how to get people motivated to take more initiative, be more responsible, and reach their potential. Four main steps are recommended. One: empower yourself. This step is directed as managers/supervisors/team leaders; if managers behave like victims, externalising all their problems (i.e. blaming everyone and everything else) then staff will follow suit. Two: Demonstrate empowerment. For managers this means to accept responsibility for problems and go about fixing them your self. Three: give management guarantees that you (i.e. the employee) will implement suggestions. Four: take risks; directed at managers, the recommendation is to listen to and pilot staff ideas, not trounce on them, otherwise managers will be stymieing employees' creative thinking and potentially losing out on implementing new and successful ideas."
