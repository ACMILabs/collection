        "This is a three-part program on all aspects of gambling, both legal and illegal and how gambling has transformed in the last 50 years from an activity that society regarded as illegal and immoral into something that is respectable, accessible and very big business. Modern gambling relies on the gambler's willingness to take a chance. Ep. 1. Dangerous games: Excitement, money, greed, living on the edge, addictive, power and control are just some of the words used by the interviewees in this program. Gambling it seems has no limit to a person's behaviour and just how far they are willing to go - some even to the point of death. Mark \"Chopper\" Read talks of his \"rush\" when he plays Russian Roulette, others get their excitement from betting on \"dares\" and playing weird games for money. There are so many ways to gamble - at the casinos, on the horses, playing the pokies and since gambling was legalised in Nevada in 1931, availability and those who are playing at the casinos has increased dramatically. This episode provides a historical background of gambling in America and the UK, focusing on the 1960s, the mafia involvement both in Las Vegas and London, and the change in attitude by society towards the \"gambler\", particularly the \"high rollers\". Features personal narratives and commentary from a wide array of gamblers, ex-gamblers, and those who work or are involved in the industry, including members of the Mob and associates of the Kray brothers. Fascinating up-front viewing, with tales of violence, murder, corruption, manipulation, fixing, winners, losers, and the whole \"sexy\" glam lifestyle associated with gambling. Contains archival footage including some b&w scenes. Presented by John Inverdale. For more information see \"www.bbc.co.uk/highstakes\" WARNING: Contains strong language."
