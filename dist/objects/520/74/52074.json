        "Director Rob Cohen's second outing with action star Vin Diesel (their first collaboration was the very successful The Fast and the furious) is a playful hybrid of the James Bond spy movies and extreme sports action. Diesel stars as adrenaline junky Xander Cage who is coerced by the US government into infiltrating a Russian crime ring based in the Czech republic that is planning, amongst other things, the destruction of the world. XXX makes no secret of its Bond appropriations. Cohen gleefully includes in the mix an evil genius based in an elaborate (and not very conspicuous) mountain lair, a beautiful but dangerous woman (Asia Argento), Russian bad guys (yes they're still bad, irregardless of the Cold War being over), state of the art gizmos and plenty of explosions. It even alludes to the beginnings of a long standing franchise. Cast includes: Samuel L. Jackson, Marton Csokas."
