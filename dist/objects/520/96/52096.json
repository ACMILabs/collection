        "This training video assists in the managing of business meetings. Before a meeting it is important to establish who will be at the meeting, why and what the meeting is for. Although staff often bemoan meetings, they don't have to be a waste of time, by following these guidelines: be convinced that the meeting is necessary; know the objectives of the meeting; start on time and finish on time; stick to the time allocation for each topic; resolve any conflicts that arise; make sure the intended outcomes are achieved; list the actions that each individual must undertake, post-meeting."
