        "Director Fernando Trueba (Belle Epoque) displays his love of Latin jazz in this documentary that showcases the talents of numerous musicians by inviting them to perform in a New York City studio. Preceding each performance is a brief introduction by Trueba addressing the artists' diverse backgrounds. Aside from these moments however, \"Calle 54\" fails to expand upon the potentially interesting stories behind the talent, resulting in what is essentially a performance piece celebrating Latin jazz and all its variations. Highlights include Chano Dominguez displaying his flair for merging flamenco and jazz; Cuban pianist Chucho Valdes (son of Bebe) playing a powerful solo; legendary percussionist Tito Puente and horn player Paquito D'Rivera in full swing; barefoot Brazilian Eliane Elias on piano; and the New York-based Jerry Gonzalez wigging out. Other musicians featured are Gato Barbieri, Cachao, Michel Camilo, Eliane Elias, Chico O'Farrill, Orlando 'Puntilla' Rios and Carlos 'Patato' Valdes. Also features some thrilling flamenco dancing and singing."
