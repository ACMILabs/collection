        "Join Brendan as he spends $200 of his disposable birthday cash on clothes, music and entertainment. He is just one of a large group that is an image marketers dream; young, impressionable, earning money from a low paying service job with money to burn. Whilst working his way in and out of well known brand name shops, he, as well as other teenagers, shop owners and adults, discuss the impact of advertising on them, how it influences their sense of being and consumer purchasing. They also share their thoughts for their future."
