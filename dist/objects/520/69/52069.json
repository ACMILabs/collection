        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Chris Patten's east and west\". First of the three part documentary series \"Chris Patten's East and West\" written and presented by the former British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten. In this episode Patten focuses on China - socially, economically and politically - from its past history to the China of the 90s. He more specifically deals with human rights and economic reform emphasising his strong belief that it is important \"to keep trade and human rights separate\" and that \"economical reform requires political reform\". The program covers President Nixon's visit and his meeting with Mao Tse-tung in 1972; the US/China alliance and lifting of trade restrictions; the rise of Deng Xaioping and the reform movement following Mao's death; the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989; international and trade relations at the expense of human rights recognition; President Clinton's visit in 1998. Also briefly looks at human rights issues in Burma through an interview with the Burmese Opposition Leader, Aung San Suu Kyi who has been politically isolated under house arrest for over 9 years, followed by a comparison to Taiwan, a mainly Chinese capitalist society, democratic and free and a thorn in China's side. Includes interviews with Henry Kissinger (US National Security Adviser 1969-75), Paul Wolfowitz (US Assistant Secretary of State, Asia 1982-86), Winston Lord (US Foreign Policy Adviser 1970-73) and Sir Alan Donald (British Ambassador, Beijing 1988-91) among others. Contains b&w archival footage and stills."
