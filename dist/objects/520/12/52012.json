        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". Dolly the sheep's birth on 23 February 1997 became world news for Dolly was to be the first successful cloning of a sheep. The next step surely would be the cloning of humans! This interesting and informative documentary tells the story behind this most amazing feat in biological research and of the team who were responsible in bringing it about. The program also discusses the bioethics and concerns raised by many in the scientific and academic world about cloning and genetic engineering, particularly in the cloned embryo area. Includes interviews with some of \"Dolly's\" creators, namely Dr Ian Wilmut, Dr Henry Griffin, Dr John Clark and Dr Keith Campbell (all from the Roslin Institute) and uses microphotography and computer animation to illustrate the intricacies involved in the research and techniques of genetic engineering and embryology. Poses the question about the future and the \"brave new world\" of cloning - will it be used in the treatment of diseases such as cystic fibrosis or haemophilia or, as feared by many, in the cloning of super humans? Narrated by Hugh Quarshie."
