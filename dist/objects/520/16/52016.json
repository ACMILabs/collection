        "Based on Maureen McCarthy's popular novel \"Queen Kat, Carmel & St Jude get a life\", this made for television mini-series will strike a chord with anyone who has made the transition from country to city, high school to university, or just struggling to find themselves. There are four episodes in the series - each from the perspective of one of the three housemates - the final episode draws the threads together of the burgeoning friendship. \"Autumn: Chapter one: Carmel.\" Carmel McCaffrey (Alicia Gardiner), gifted singer, pianist and only daughter in a sheep farming family is facing resistance from her mother who is reluctant for her to go to university, citing she is a country girl like her mother and the family cannot afford for her to go: only her brother Vince (Ben Mendelsohn) seems to be on her side. Carmel makes it to Melbourne however and moves in with law student \"Princess\" Kat (Elissa Elliot), and down to earth Jude (Ingrid Ruz). Carmel struggles with her financial situation, has a palpably uncomfortable presentation, and after questioning her choice of career, drops out and returns briefly to Manella. She also meets Anton (Justin Smith). \"Winter: Chapter two: Jude.\" Med student Jude is following in the professional and political path of her deceased father Carlos who died as a political prisoner in Chile, much to the chagrin of her mother. Jude is plagued by memories she cannot suppress of her absent father and seeks solace in the arms of the married Eduardo. Carmel reluctantly makes her first public appearance, no thanks to a surprise visit by her mother. Written by Meaghan Smith."
