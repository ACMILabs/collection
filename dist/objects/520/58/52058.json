        "Travelling down the road to his traditional home at \"the swamp,\" Kermit (Steve Whitmire) reflects on the good old days aged 12 with pals Croaker and Goggles as they mucked about in the swamp attempting to prove their braveness and pondering a life beyond theirs. When they actually make it to the end of the world as they know it and the road that leads to civilisation, the adventure of a lifetime begins as a pet-store owner who supplies frogs for a science class in which amphibians will be dissected, kidnaps Goggles. Kermit and Croaker, along with a shaggy dog who has just saved their lives, head into the city in search of their friend. It's also during this time that Kermit discovers that he wants to be in the movies. Features a range of new Muppet characters that do not appear in \"The Muppet show\". Features live and Muppet action. Cast also includes Bill Barretta, Dave Goelz and Joey Mazzarino."
