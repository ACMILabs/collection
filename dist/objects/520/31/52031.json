        "Harold Lloyd's last silent work and the only one shot entirely on location in New York, tells of Harold 'Speedy' Swift's efforts to save the last horse-drawn streetcar line in New York from the machinations of some traction magnates. He has to surmount all sorts of obstacles to do so including getting 'Babe' Ruth to his baseball on time. The end-of-an-era plot line must have partly reflected Lloyd's feelings towards the introduction of sound to the movies. With an orchestral score performed by The Live Cinema Orchestra. Cast also includes Ann Christy and Burt Woodruffe."
