        "Charlie Brewster is a teenage horror buff who becomes engrossed in the mysterious goings on at the spooky house next door, especially when people are reported as missing, who later turn up decapitated. As well as facing the troubles with his girlfriend, Brewster has difficulty convincing anyone (including the police and his mother) of the wicked deeds being committed. Instead he enlists the help of television horror personality Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), a horror actor who has fallen on hard times. Together Brewster and Vincent must combat the dreadful evil of Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) and Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark), his menacing assistant. Director Tom Holland (Child's play) ably blends comedy with suspense in a vampire thriller that makes good use of 1980s special effects and the exuberance of his cast, especially William Ragsdale as the harried teen."
