        "This pioneering low-budget film made at the very end of the silent era, was an avant-garde blend of feature and documentary. Its lyrical recording of the streetlife of everyday Berlin owes something to the cycle of 'city symphony' films popular in the mid-Twenties. Onto this documentary background is grafted a simple narrative focusing on the interactions between five young Berliners--all played by non-professional actors--who spend a typical Sunday together in and around Berlin. The film launched the careers of all six principal filmmakers involved, and had a huge influence on subsequent film movements including the French New Wave, Italian Neorealist and British Free Cinema movements. This restored version contains important scenes previously missing and features a new score by Elena Kats-Chernin. Written by Billie Wilder, Curt Sidomak and Robert Sidomak. Photography, Eugen Schufftan and Fred Zinnemann. Based on an original story by Curt Siodmak."
