        "This instructional video aims to help employees recognise when their staff have training needs and how to respond so that these training needs are met. Five steps are identified. Step one is to determine the need for coaching. This can be done by observation or be simply asking the employee what their training needs are. The second step is to explain the task or activity that needs doing. The third step is to demonstrate the activity in question. The fourth step is to practice the task. The fifth step is to ask for feedback. With re-enactments the video shows successful and not so successful methods of coaching with suggestions of how to amend each style."
