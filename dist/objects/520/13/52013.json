        "A biographical documentary on Aboriginal poet and civil rights activist Kath Walker (Oodgeroo Noonuccal) who championed the cause for recognition of Aboriginal land rights, the right to vote, the right to an education, and to health care and equality with their white Australian counterparts. It took many years of writing and campaigning before Kath Walker began to see a change in public attitude but it was the setting up of Moongalba, an educational and cultural centre for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children, on North Stradbroke Island (her place of birth) in 1972 which was to be Kath Walker's most ambitious and passionate project. She believed that teaching the young together in the studies of Aboriginal culture would assist in bridging the gap between the two races. In 1988 Kath Walker officially changed her name to Oodgeroo Noonuccal to more closely identify herself with her Aboriginal roots. She lived out her latter years on North Stradbroke Island continuing her teaching role at Moongalba until she finally died of cancer in 1993. Kath Walker's legacy as a poet, activist, educator, humanitarian, writer and artist will long be remembered by both black and white Australia. Her published books include \"We are going: poems\" (1964), \"The Dawn is at hand: poems\" (1966), \"Stradbroke dreamtime\" (1972), \"Australian legends and landscapes\" (1990) and many more. The film contains stills, newsreels and archival footage (some in b&w). Narrated by Beverley Dunn, music by Nunukul Kunjeil. Includes Teacher's Guide. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
