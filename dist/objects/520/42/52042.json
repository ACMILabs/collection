        "Alan Wearne, poet and tutor hosts this documentary about his friend and colleague John Forbes (1950-98), one of Australia's most prominent modern poets with his distinctly gritty writing about urban Melbourne and Sydney. Drawing on extracts from several of Forbes' poems, and discussions with friends and devotees of his writing, the following works are explored in detail: \"Tropical skiing\"; \"On the beach\"; \"Stalin's holidays\"; \"The Stunned mullet\"; \"Damaged glamour\"."
