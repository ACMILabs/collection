        "Originally made as a telemovie but released in cinemas, \"Persuasion\" is an adaptation of Jane Austen's last novel about love lost and regained. Amanda Root gives a sensitive performance as Ann Eliot, while Ciaran Hinds is Captain Frederick Wentworth. Eight years prior to the opening of the story, Ann and Wentworth were in love but Ann is persuaded by her family and friend Lady Russell, to abandon the then penniless Wentworth. Time does not alter the depth of her love for him and she is resigned to solitude. Circumstances reunite the couple and this time it is her family who are impecunious and Wentworth who is rich. Can he put aside the bitterness of her rejection and rekindle the flame of their affection?"
