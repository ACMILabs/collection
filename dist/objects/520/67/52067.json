        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Chris Patten's east and west\". Final part of the three part documentary series \"Chris Patten's East and West\" written and presented by the former British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten. In this episode Patten continues his discussion on the Asian economic miracle questioning the popular belief that the new millenium will belong to the Pacific Rim. He briefly talks about Thailand, from the days of its feudal society to its now modern industrial state which is facing an economic crisis following a crash in the \"building boom\" of the 1990s. More in depth coverage however, is given to Singapore and Japan - historical, economical and political - pointing out the differences in culture and traditions of both nations and the reasons behind their successes and failures in the world of economics. He points out Singapore's reliance on its efficient, well educated and willing workforce who forego their individual rights and freedoms for the common good of the State and Japan's tradition of loyalty to the company and a \"job for life\" being put under pressure as the younger generation demand freedom and choice in their careers and workplace culture. The program contains several interviews with various leaders and company personnel including the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kwan Yew, along with Chris Patten's personal commentary and opinions. The series is well presented, informative and interesting from a socio-economic point of view - Chris Patten provides the human touch. Contains b&w archival footage and stills."
