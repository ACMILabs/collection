        "This documentary on the great Russian film-maker Sergei Eisenstein, combines rare archival material with Eisenstein's own candid memoirs written in the last years of his life. As well as a groundbreaking film director who developed a unique film language, Eisenstein was a prodigious theatre designer, teacher, theorist and draughtsman. Many of his satrical drawings are shown in this film. Also featured are interviews with his famous friends and colleagues, extracts from all of his films, including the very first, 'Gulmov's Diary' and the only film record of Eisenstein speaking in English, in a wartime speech. Narrated by Paul Vaughan."
