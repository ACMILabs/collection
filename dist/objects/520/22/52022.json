        "An English soldier on the Western front in WWI dreams of the Maid of Orleans, Joan of Arc, before he goes into battle. De Mille emphasised the mystical reincarnation theme that appeared in MacPherson's story by superimposing images of a prophetic angel over the main narrative. He also experimented with a new colour process for the recurrent images of fire. It was charismatic opera diva Geraldine Farrar's second film with DeMille, made the year after the success of 'Carmen' and was the director's first foray into costume drama. Cast includes Geraldine Farrar, Wallace Reid, Theodore Roberts, Raymond Hatton, Hobart Bosworth. From the story by Jeanie MacPherson. Original 1916 score performed by Christian Elliot."
