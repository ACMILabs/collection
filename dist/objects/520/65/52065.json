        "This program provides an introduction to some of the central ideas in Walter Benjamin's writing. It explores both the life and work of this German Jewish critic who died escaping the Gestapo in 1940. He is regarded as one of the most influential figures in 20th century thought. Includes a range of commentary from various scholars who situate Benjamin's work within the context of contemporary thought."
