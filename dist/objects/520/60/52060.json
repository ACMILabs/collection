    "description": [
        "Three short silent films by Soviet director Evegnii Bauer that explore themes of class, sexual politics, doomed love, grief and sanity. \"A child of the big city\" Mary, a seamstress with a meagre existence who dreams of a grander life of luxury and wealth, meets Victor, a well-do-do young man, who spurns his pretentious peers. Beguiled by the luxuries that pepper Victor's world, Mary becomes flirtatious and develops a taste for decadent habits. Financially ruined and personally demoralised, Victor despairs at Mary's transformation. This mournful, melancholy melodrama, and morality play, examines the notions of class and corrupting influence of money on character. \"The 1102nd ruse\" An elderly husband believes himself inured to the skilful wiles of women, to the frustration of his scheming wife. But she is determined to hoodwink him by inventing a cunning ruse unfamiliar to him. A slight comedy of manners that comments on the power of sexuality whilst gently mocking the sanctity of marriage. \"Daydreams\" A man, mourning the death of his wife, is soon romancing an actress who shares a likeness with his deceased beloved. As his obsession grows, he fears insanity and is beset by ghostly apparitions. All feature musical score, Russian intertitles and English subtitles."
