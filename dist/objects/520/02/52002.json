        "An insightful documentary into the life and background of performer, diversional therapist, broadcaster, street worker, nightclub impresario, film archivist and champion of the marginalised outsider sub-culture, Jaimie Leonarder. His is an amazing story of compassion, obsession and commitment within a culture of outsiders - drug addicts, psychiatric patients, the homeless. His band, the Mu-Mesons, which comprised of ex-psychiatric patients and eccentrics acted as a therapeutical diversion for its members allowing them to perform totally uninhibited, pushing music to its wild limits. The film also explores the relationship between Jaimie and his wife, Aspasia who shares his passion in film collecting and involvement with the outsider community. Through interviews, film excerpts, live band performances and archival footage, director Brendan Young (Three chords and a wardrobe, Boys on film 3) captures the enthusiasm and vitality of this international cult figure who through all his endeavours in the world of the arts and the marginalised, still manages to remain comparatively unknown in his home town Sydney and wider Australia. Contains some b&w footage."
