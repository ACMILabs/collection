        "Two woodcutters, Gustave and Sven, witness a shooting star one cold evening and go searching for the gold they believe is at the end of it. Instead, the delivery is a little baby whom they take home, call Pero (love), and are convinced will grow up to be a great leader. On maturation he grows into a bully of a child who is unconvinced that the beggar woman who turns up in the village can be the mother of such a beautiful child as him. Thus begins a journey for the source of true beauty and a task that will test his level of compassion. Adapted from a short story by Oscar Wilde and animated by Lindsay Van Blerk, Min Che Lin, Brett Schuman and Ted Berenson. Voices: Keith Grenville, Joe Wishnia, Liz Williams, Linda Delport."
