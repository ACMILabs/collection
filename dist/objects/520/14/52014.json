        "The environment has played an important role in Aboriginal society for thousands of years. The You Yangs (a big mountain in the middle of a plane) are a granite outcrop near Geelong that in the past has provided a food and water supply for the Wathaurong people. Art, music and dance provide an important outlet for the expression of culture, illustrated in this short documentary through the painting \"Hunting and ceremonial grounds in the You Yangs\" by Stan Couzens and in the performance of the Je Be Weng Dancers (Alan Browning, Casey Browning, Gordon Hollander, Christal Raymond). The Dancers perform 3 pieces - The Creation Dance, The Warrior Dance and The Celebration Dance. The significance of their body decoration and the movements depicted are also explained."
