        "This is a three-part program on all aspects of gambling, both legal and illegal and how gambling has transformed in the last 50 years from an activity that society regarded as illegal and immoral into something that is respectable, accessible and very big business. Modern gambling relies on the gambler's willingness to take a chance. Ep. 3. Gambling fever: During the 1990s casinos in Las Vegas became huge entertainment and leisure centres catering not only to gamblers but also to the needs of families. Casinos full of slot machines and video poker began to spread throughout America causing grief and addiction to many families and division within the native Americans as they battled over the establishment of casinos on their reservations. In the UK the restrictive laws in gambling began to ease and that country too began to experience an increase in gambling addiction right across the board, particularly in the sporting area where horse races, soccer matches and even international cricket matches were open to corruption and \"fixing\". Australia is also examined in this episode as an emerging gambling superpower susceptible to corruption and organized crime. The introduction of national lotteries and instant access to internet gambling enabled all socio-economic levels in society to participate in this already saturated industry. In this program, the interviews focus more on the down side of gambling, the desperation of the addicted and the tragic consequences which can result including criminal activities, jail, drugs or even death. Also includes interviews from the anti-gambling bodies who are overwhelmed by the fall-out and lack of support for problem gamblers. This is quite an amazing series containing honest and often confronting interviews with some of those who have experienced gambling in all its forms or who have been involved in the industry, legally or illegally. Uses archival footage and includes some b&w scenes. Presented by John Inverdale. For more informations see \"www.bbc.co.uk/highstakes\""
