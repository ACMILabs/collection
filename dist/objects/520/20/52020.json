    "description": [
        "A compilation of nine films by Jean Painleve, scientist, pioneer scientific filmmaker and founder member of the Surrealist group. Painleve made over 200 scientific films, bridging the gulf that normally separates science from art and documentary from narrative cinema. Pioneering new techniques, he subverted the normally sober field of scientific studies by including outrageous jokes and comparisons in his underwater films and setting them to music ranging from Duke Ellington to Ravel. In French with English subtitles."
