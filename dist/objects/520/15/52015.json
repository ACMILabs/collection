        "An informative and educational documentary on the history of Australian Aborigines and their rock art in the Cape York Peninsula region of Queensland. The program explores not only the historical background of the rock paintings but theorises on the first arrival of Aborigines to this land and the formation of the landscape itself through archeological, geological and palaentological evidence. During the 1950s Australian artist and author Percy Trezise went on a quest to locate the rock art around Laura in the Cape York region and through contact with Aboriginal elders and befriending Aboriginal writer, Dick Roughsey, he was eventually accepted as a \"tribal brother\". In this program, Percy, using images from his own paintings, interprets Aboriginal Dreamtime stories, mythology and initiation ceremonies as represented by the rock paintings. He speaks of his own experiences and respect for the Aboriginal people, their culture and their heritage. Voice over narration by Chris Schenkel. Note: Visual quality average - filmed on video camera."
