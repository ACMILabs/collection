        "After his wife is killed in a freak accident involving a falling refrigerator, British industrial chemist Perry (Linus Roache) travels to Australia to escape and in search of an elusive paint colour after seeing a photo of the Australian outback in a travel brochure. He joins the budget price Whippet tour bus, a motley crew of travellers that includes an aspiring country and western singer, bickering couples, and a woman (Danielle Cormack) fleeing her violent, drug dealing boyfriend whose money she has stolen. Disaster follows Perry everywhere and Australia is no exception: earth tremors, a deceased roadside trader, inclement weather, a dangerous ex-boyfriend and New Year's Eve at a roadhouse in the middle of nowhere after their bus crashes. A humorous coach war between the Whippet driver determined to out drive a competing driver of a swish coach also travelling to Darwin provides a highlight of the film, as is the Australian outback. Cast also includes: Ian Bliss, Roy Billing, Alan Brough, Rebecca Hobbs, Esme Melville."
