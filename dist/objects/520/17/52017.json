        "Based on Maureen McCarthy's popular novel \"Queen Kat, Carmel & St Jude get a life\", this made for television mini-series will strike a chord with anyone who has made the transition from country to city, high school to university, or just struggling to find themselves. There are four episodes in the series - each from the perspective of one of the three housemates - the final episode draws together the threads of the burgeoning friendship. \"Spring: Chapter three: Kat.\" Kat is having problems with boyfriend Dion (Simon Bossell) after she sits for a series of nude photographs. Things escalate when Dion plants drugs on Kat and she is arrested by the police and taken in for questioning. She is faced with the moral dilemma of deciding between co-operating with the police and giving Dion up, or remaining quiet, thus jeopardising her law career. Carmel is still pining over Anton but her emotions are placed on hold when she returns home to her terminally ill mother. Her absence gives Kat and Jude time to bond. Are the housemates becoming friends? \"Winter: Chapter four: Manella.\" Everyone gathers at Mrs McCaffrey's funeral and Carmel has to reach a decision about her future; personal dreams or family loyalty, and whether she loves unfaithful Anton. Her family, along with some help from Kat, struggles to save the farm from being taken over. Results are in and there is a bonfire party to celebrate. Written by Meaghan Smith."
