        "Lloyd's alter ego is developed further in this film about a starstruck movie lover who, through a misunderstanding, lands the promise of a screen test. His adventures in Hollywood are predictably punctuated by a myriad of clever sight-gags involving various obstacles and near disasters. Although one of his late films, this is considered the best of Lloyd's 'talkies' with many of its elements having their root in his earlier silent movies. Cast includes: Harold Lloyd, Constance Cummings, Kenneth Thompson, Spencer Charters, Mary Doran. Photography, Walter Lundin ; editing, Bernard Burton."
