        "British Transport Films (BTF) began in May 1949 boasting one of Britain's leading documentary filmmakers, Edgar Anstey, as its head. Between 1950 and 1980 a huge range of quality films were produced with many gaining top awards at various film festivals. This is a compilation of a selection of four films, digitally remastered by the British Film Institute, demonstrating the diversity and high calibre of BTF as a production company. Elizabethan express: From King's Cross Station, London, to Waverley Station, Edinburgh, is 393 miles. The Elizabethan - a summertime express - does this journey in six and a half hours non-stop - the longest daily non-stop run in the world to be timed at over 60 mph in 1954. This film is about one of those runs and the people behind the service. (See also Title Code 003232 16mm) Snowdrift at Bleath Gill: A freight train becomes snowbound in the West-Morland hills in Northern England. The Motive Power, Operating and Engineering Departments of British Transport go to work with snow-ploughs to reach the trapped train. Working through the night the team dig clear, and thaw out moving parts, and finally two engines help to clear the line. (See also Title Code 009948 16mm) Train time: An account of the operation of British Railways. The integration of goods and passenger services calls for a constant review of time-tables to meet the varying local needs. (See also Title Code 011098 16mm) Forward to first principles: Tells the history of freight railways and the laying of iron lines, of the impact on the geography and landscape of Great Britain and of the age of computer technology and remote control replacing manual labour."
