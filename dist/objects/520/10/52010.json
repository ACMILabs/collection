        "Aimed at illustrating the influence of television on impressionable young minds aged six to eleven, this video and activity guide is about four humans and one anthropomorphised television - \"TV man\" - on a mission to locate three missing classroom turtles that have disappeared from Jamie's yard. As they close in on the missing pets, the four children must rationalise between the suggested solutions of TV man based on fictitious screen life and their natural instincts. Human know-how wins in the end."
