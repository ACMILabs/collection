        "Written and presented by world-renowned British photographer and painter David Hockney, this documentary takes the viewer on a most unusual guided tour of a 72 foot (27 inches top to bottom) ancient late 17th century Chinese scroll created by artist Wang Hui and his seven assistants. The scroll depicts in great depth and detail the Kangxi Emperor's journey along the Grand Canal in his southern domains providing an intimate and close-up view of Chinese life in the city and back streets. Using a painting by Italian artist Canaletto, and a later Chinese scroll depicting the same journey in a more European style Hockney compares the pieces of work by exploring issues of space, perspective, boundaries and depth. Overall, however, it is Hockney's analytical appraisal of Wang Hui's scroll as he interprets the journey section by section theorising on the complexities and relationships between aesthetics, history and spirituality, his awe and admiration of the artist's skill and precision, and the excellent close-up visuals of the work which provides the viewer with a unique insight into ancient Chinese art and life. Works of art: The Kangxi Emperor's Southern Inspection Tour (Scroll seven) about 1698 - Wang Hui (1632-1717) and assistants; The Qianlong Emperor's Southern Inspection Tour (Scroll four) dated 1770 - Xu Yang (active 1750-1776); Capriccio: Plaza San Marco looking South and West 1763 - Giovanni Antonio Canale called Canaletto, Italy 1697-1768"
