        "This feature length filmed Broadway production (made for television) of Pam Gem's play \"Piaf\" captures the very essence of the extraordinary and much-loved French singer, Edith Piaf. Jane Lapotaire won a Tony Award for Best Dramatic Actress in her role as Piaf and her portrayal of Piaf's chaotic and emotion-charged life is inspirational. Lapotaire is ably supported by Zoe Wanamaker as Toine, David Leary as the Emcee/Manager, Judith Ivey as Madeleine and Peter Friedman as \"Papa\" Leplee. Cast also includes Nicholas Woodeson, Stephen Davies, Lewis Arlt and Robert Christian. Produced on Broadway by Elizabeth I. McCann, Nelle Nugent, the Schubert Organization, Ray Larsen in association with Warner Theatre Productions and directed for the stage by Howard Davies."
