        "Informative and fun documentary about the origins and meanings of Blaxploitation cinema. A genre that originated with Melvin Van Peebles groundbreaking underground hit \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss song\", blaxploitation refers to the slew of films that followed in its wake, revolving around, and often celebrating African American culture. In this work numerous actors, directors, and other players discuss their participation in Blaxploitation and what the genre meant to them personally, and culturally. Contemporary filmmakers, such as Quentin Tarantino, are interviewed about the influence of the genre upon their work. Interviewees include: Quentin Tarantino, Larry Cohen, Fred Williamson, Pam Grier, Melvin Van Peebles and Samuel L. Jackson."
