        "Fictional chronicle depicting the last years of jazz musician's Charlie 'Bird' Parker's life. Capturing the trials and tribulations of a black musician in white America, this film takes an in-depth look at the multi-faceted world of the jazz life -- music, drink, drugs, racism, women, and indifference. Features Dick Gregory in the key role as Richie 'Eagle' Stokes, with Don Murray playing a down-and-out professor. Adapted from the John A. Williams' novel \"Night song\"."
