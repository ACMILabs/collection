        "Based on L. Frank Baum's two follow-up books to The Wizard of Oz, \"Return to Oz\" is not quite the frolicking musical fantasy of the original family film and it may prove a bit too scary for the younger viewer. Dorothy (Fairuza Balk), since returning home from the Land of Oz, cannot clear her head of the wonderful adventures and amazing characters she had come to know and love. Auntie Em, determined to rid Dorothy of all this Oz nonsense, sends her off for psychiatric treatment at a sanitarium. However, Dorothy is rescued by a mysterious girl and just as mysteriously ends up back in the Land of Oz where all is not as it was and the magical fantasy begins to turn into a nightmare adventure. Cast includes Nicol Williamson, Jean Marsh, Piper Laurie, Matt Clark. Parental guidance recommended."
