        "This video contains three individual films - the first two being about one of the world's greatest violinists, Russian born Jascha Heifetz, and the third piece being about Heifetz's colleague and close friend, the cello virtuoso, Gregor Piatigorsky (also Russian born). The first film is a biographical documentary containing archival footage, excerpts from concert performances and interviews with Heifetz and the second film features an impromptu recital for the students of Claremont College (USA). In the third film, Gregor Piatigorsky features as a special guest on the \"Behind the music\" television show. He performs several pieces of works, including Bach, Chopin, Schubert, Prokofiev and many others."
