        "Based on the life and music of American composer Jerome Kern, this light-hearted musical film has a star-studded cast including June Allyson, Judy Garland, Kathryn Grayson, Van Heflin, Lena Horne, Van Johnson, Dinah Shore, Frank Sinatra, Cyd Charisse, Angela Lansbury, and Robert Walker as Jerome Kern. Kern's most memorable stage production \"Show Boat\" opened on 27 December 1927 and is still considered amongst one of the world's greatest musicals. \"Show Boat\" features throughout the film which draws to an end with a medley of Jerome Kern compositions and a grand finale performance of \"Ol' Man River\" sung by a very young Frank Sinatra."
