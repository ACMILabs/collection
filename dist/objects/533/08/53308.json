        "Set in a seedy bar called \"Cloud Nine\", this hostage drama features some fine rock and roll by The Platters and The Blockbusters. When a pair of gunmen decide to hold the patrons and musicians hostage, Shorty, (a vertically challenged hot-headed regular) takes exception. Abby Dalton (who would go on to star in several other Corman movies) plays a fledging singer who is auditioning for a regular spot at the bar. Originally released on a double bill with \"Dragstrip girl\", this is a classic Roger Corman cheapie (reputedly shot in just five days) with Mel Welles a high point as the hip-talking Beatnik showbiz agent. Also stars Russell Johnson, as one of the thugs, later to be a feature player in \"Gilligan's Island\"."
