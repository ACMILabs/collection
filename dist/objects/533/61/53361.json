        "Biographical documentary about world-renowned classical pianist, Arthur Rubinstein. Born in Poland in 1887, Rubinstein first visited America in 1906, playing in Philadelphia and New York. However he finally settled in Paris until 1914 when he offered his services to the British authorities as an interpreter during the period of the war. At the end of the war he returned to America performing at numerous concerts between 1919 and 1927, but it would take until 1937 before Rubinstein finally gained full recognition. Eventually settling in Hollywood he became one of the most prolific recording and concert artists, collaborating frequently with Jascha Heifetz and Gregor Piatigorsky as part of the \"Million Dollar Trio\". He died in Geneva in 1982 leaving a legacy of a multitude of television and motion picture musical scores composed over a thirty-year period. This film features interviews and performances by Rubinstein, David Oistrakj, and the Million Dollar Trio. NB: Quality of picture and sound is inconsistent."
