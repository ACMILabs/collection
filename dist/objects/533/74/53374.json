        "Episode of Series \"Castles and concerts\". Set in the idyllic historic Longleat House in Wiltshire, England, this program of popular classics is performed by The Academy of St Martin in the Fields conducted by world-renowned Neville Marriner (also artistic director). Neville Marriner introduces the program and provides a commentary on the history of Longleat House and the music of the great composers of the 17th and 18th centuries. Beautiful images of the Longleat Estate, both interior and exterior, accompany the music to provide an atmospheric re-creation of those earlier centuries."
