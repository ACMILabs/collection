        "This film contains sophisticated vocabulary with limited explanations. it shows plant growth covering bulbs, corns, tubers, etc and concentrates on asexual reproduction as required by orchardists and horticulturists. The contents are comprehensive and the time-lapse photography very good. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
