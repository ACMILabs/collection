        "Aimed at a teenage audience, \"Reform school girl\" is a redemptive tale about a mixed-up teenager, Donna Price, who after her involvement in a fatal car crash, is shipped off to reform school. There she is witness to the out-of-kilter lives of wayward girls and she recognises her choice between revealing the truth of the night of the crash, and perishing behind bars. At times this B-movie juvenile-delinquency drama is quite gritty and sordid, dealing with the themes of incest, manipulation and moral corruption."
