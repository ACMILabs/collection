        "Sequel to \"Escape to Witch Mountain\" this family film is full of adventure and fantasy as Tia (Kim Richards) and her brother Tony (Ike Eisenmann), both who have supernatural powers, arrive on Planet Earth for a holiday. Dr Gannon (Christopher Lee) and his offsider Letha (Bette Davis) are trying to develop a mind-control device and when the evil Dr Gannon learns of Tony's special powers, he kidnaps him, leaving it to Tia with her telepathic powers, and a motley gang of youngsters, to rescue Tony."
