Odessa, the place of Oistrakh's birth in 1908, was also to be the city of his official debut in 1926. However it was not until 1933 before he appeared in Moscow and the following year that he was appointed a professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Travelling the world, performing concert after concert David Oistrakh, at the age of 66, died in 1974 in Amsterdam. The film uses stills, archival footage, excerpts from various performances, interviews and includes images of Odessa and Leningrad. In Russian and English with English narration by Erick Friedman."
