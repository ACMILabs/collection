        "Biographical film based on the book 'I, Tina' by Tina Turner and Kurt Loder about the dynamic American R&B/Pop singer, Tina Turner and her violent relationship with her singer/songwriter husband, Ike Turner. The story begins with Tina's early days in Nutbush, and follows through to her move to St Louis where she meets up with local nightclub singer, Ike Turner. Ike asks Tina to join him on stage and as they say, the rest is musical history. Their professional relationship developed into a romantic relationship and eventually marriage. What followed however, is quite disturbing and is realistically presented in this powerful and inspirational story with stunning performances by Angela Bassett as Tina and Laurence Fishburne as Ike. Also stars Jenifer Lewis, Phyllis Stickney and Tina Turner."
