    "description": [
        "This video celebrates the return of Vladimir Horowitz to his home country, the Soviet Union, in 1986 to perform a musical recital at the Moscow Conservatory. It was to be the first important event in a series of cultural exchanges agreed to at the Geneva Summit in 1985. Horowitz calls himself an \"ambassador of peace\" as he talks to the media, his fans and his family. The biographical documentary captures the emotions of both Horowitz and his adoring fans as he performs some of his favourite compositions by such composers as Mozart, Chopin and Rachmaninov, among others. Interspersed throughout this demanding performance are images of Moscow, the people, streets and cityscape along with insightful interviews with Horowitz as he reminisces about his past. An absorbing and thoughtful documentary featuring some wonderful solo music played by one of the world's best and highly regarded pianists."
