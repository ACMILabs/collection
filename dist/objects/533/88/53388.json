        "Based on the ballet Coppelia this film adaptation focuses more on the Doctor and his wonderful mechanical dolls as the central plot to the story rather than on Coppelia, the doll itself. The principal characters of the story are: Dr Coppelius (played by actor Walter Slezak), a practical joker who dabbles in witchcraft and sorcery and loves making life-like mechanical dolls, Franz (Caj Selling) the young lover who does not realise that the beautiful Coppelia is one of the Doctor's mechanical dolls, Swanhilda (Claudia Corday), Franz's bride-to-be, and Brigitta (Eileen Elliott), the tavern maid secretly in love with Dr Coppelius. The story is based on an original libretto by Charles Nuitter and music by Leo Delibes. Features the members of the Ballet of the Gran Teatro Del Liceo of Barcelone and the International Cine Ballet and the Orchestra of the Gran Teatro Del Liceo of Barcelone under the direction of Adrian Sardo."
