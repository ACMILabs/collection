        "A wealthy but bitterly unhappy married couple take in a tramp who attempts suicide in their pool. Becoming ensconced in their lives, the tramp (played by Nick Nolte) facilitates a re-evaluation of the family's dubious moral codes. A remake of Jean Renoir's 1932 film \"Boudu saved from drowning\" this hilarious comedy with Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler as the warring couple, garnered many accolades and was nominated for two Golden Globes."
