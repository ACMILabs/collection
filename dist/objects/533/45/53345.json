        "Filmed at the Austin Opry House in Texas in 1983, Willie Nelson performs some of his classic greats including \"On the road again\", \"Always on my mind\", \"Stardust\" and \"Georgia\". With his Family, Willie presents music that is country, that is rock, that is jazz, with the wonderful enthusiasm and exuberance this American performer is known and loved for. Features Jackie King as special guest and includes documentary footage of Willie, his family and his band at the beginning of the video. Members of the band include Bobbie Nelson (piano), Bee Spears (bass), Mickey Raphael (harmonica), Grady Martin (guitar), Jody Payne (guitar), Paul English (drums)."
