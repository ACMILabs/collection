        "A compilation from the National Film Board of Canada spanning 20 years with eight short animation works using a variety of animation techniques. \"Special delivery\": Winner of the 1979 Academy Award for Best Animated Short this animation is about Alice and Ralph Phelps and their battle to solve the mystery of the dead mailman - a comic moral tale. \"Getting started\": An animation about procrastination as our hero attempts to practice on the piano but is constantly distracted. \"The Big Snit\": This award winning wacky film looks at two simultaneous conficts, the macrocosm of global nuclear war and the microcosm of a domestic quarrel and how each is resolved. \"Get a job\": Follow the tribulations of a cartoon character, Bob Dog, as he hunts for a job. \"The Cat came back\": Based on a century old folk song, Mr Johnson becomes increasingly manic as he tries and tries again to rid himself of a little yellow cat. \"Juke Bar\": A Juke Box is deliverd to a cafe and the cockroaches that infest the place jump and jive all night inside the 'Juke Bar' only to become trapped and removed in the morning. \"Blackfly\": A folk tune from 1949 about the prevalence of the black fly in northern Ontario brought to life through animation. \"The Lump\": Using a fun technique of recycled objects and photos of people's heads, this is the story of George; who although short and ugly, develops a lump on his head that has handsome human features which he uses for political gain - until corruption catches up with him. Some titles also available on VHS or 16mm [012927], [014401], [017344], [316221], [301087]."
