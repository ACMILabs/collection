        "Country singer icon Johnny Cash made a rare film appearance in this 1960s thriller playing a brutal New Jersey gangster, named Johnny. When his cohort Fred devises a plan to keep the wife of a bank vice-president hostage for ransom, Johnny proceeds to terrorise her with taunts and threats. Unbeknownst to the robbers, the marriage is in a fragile state, with the husband planning to leave that very evening. As well as being an effective crime drama, \"Five minutes to live\" also satirises the banality of suburban life and the middle-class American lifestyle. Also stars Merle Travis."
