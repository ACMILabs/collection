        "Filmed on location at Salzburg during a performance at the Salzburg Festival, Paul Czinner's production of Richard Strauss's \"Der Rosenkavalier\", an opera in three acts, with libretto by Hugo Von Hofmannsthal, is elegant and quite sumptuous with elaborate sets and costumes. Set in 18th century feudal Vienna during the reign of Empress Maria Theresia, the story revolves around Princess von Werdenberg (Elisabeth Schwarzkopf), her husband Baron Ochs von Lerchenau (Otto Edelmann) and her lover Octavian (Sena Jurinac). Cast also includes Annaliese Rothenberger and Erich Kunz. Features the Vienna State Opera Chorus and Ballet and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Herbert Von Karajan. Sung in German with story outline before each act in English text."
