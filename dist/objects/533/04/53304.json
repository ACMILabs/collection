        "When her father goes missing Carol and her teenage boyfriend go searching for him. What they find is a giant spider lurking in a nearby cave. Although initially rescued, the town becomes imperilled when the seemingly deceased spider is revived. B-grade director and special effects creator Bert I. Gordon specialised in cheap horror films, usually featuring teenagers in danger from a marauding beast. He does not disappoint here, and although the special effects are fairly outmoded, the film has enduring cult value. Highlights are the Theremin soundtrack and the use of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, as the spider's lair."
