        "A group of lonely Viking women build a ship and set off across the sea to locate their missing menfolk who have not returned from an earlier voyage. En route their boat is destroyed and they make their way to an island where they discover the horrors of their beloveds' fate. Also known as \"The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent\" this is a wonderfully bad 1950s 'creature feature' by B-movie maestro Roger Corman."
