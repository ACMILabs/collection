        "This witty, sparkling comedy about the trials of numerous aspiring stage actresses, features an array of fine performances from up and coming stars of the 30s. Katherine Hepburn plays Terry Randall, a naive heiress, committed to her craft who anticipates work materialising out of sheer professionalism and perseverance. Boarding at a theatrical residence, where an atmosphere of gay penury prevails, Terry's housemates attempt to demystify her idealism with their realistic take on an actress' life - the casting couch, sugar daddies, endless futile auditions and a dearth of work for the talented and talent-less alike. Sharing a room with Terry is Jean (Ginger Rogers) a sassy tap dancer, accustomed to clashing with her fellow thespians, who forms a truce with the secretly wealthy Terry. With the show business setting and putting-on-a-show structure of many classic Hollywood musicals, \"Stage door\" also contains dramatic turns that relay the dark side and perils of the business. Cast includes: Adolphe Menjou, Lucille Ball, Eve Arden, Ann Miller, Constance Collier. Adapted from the Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman stage hit."
