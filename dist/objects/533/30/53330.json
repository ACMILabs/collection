        "Light-weight comedy about the first manned mission to Mars. Chaos rules when Fred Z. Randall (Harland Williams) is called in as a last minute replacement to join the team of specialists, including the efficient Julie Ford (Jessica Lundy) and the trained chimp Ulysses. The vague and geeky Randall blunders from one disaster to the next as the mission rockets its way to Mars but he wins out in the end when his navigational skills save the day. Filmed on location at Houston and the Johnson Space Center. Cast also includes William Sadler, Jeffrey DeMunn, Beau Bridges."
