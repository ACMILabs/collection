        "In this sequel to \"The Amazing colossal man\" (Bert I. Gordon, 1957), the gigantic beast of the original is feared to have survived his almighty fall, and now quite deranged, to be posing an even greater threat. Incoherent and hideously disfigured, the monster is located in Mexico, but after thwarting the authorities attempts to tame him, goes on the rampage. Director and effects maestro Bert I. Gordon specialised in B-Grade 1950s horror, and does not disappoint here, even adding extra dazzle to the finale which is presented in colour."
