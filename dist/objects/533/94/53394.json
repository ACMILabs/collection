        "A jumbo-sized hit comedy. A seasoned army captain is teamed with a hard-nosed officer to conduct the \"biggest\" military manoeuvre ever - to secretly transport a full-grown elephant to a remote and nearly inaccessible jungle village. By land, sea and air, calamity and chaos prevail upon their hilariously mismatched team of would-be heroes. But with a little luck...and tons of hard work...they learn that no mission is impossible. Cast includes Danny Glover, Ray Liotta, Denis Leary."
