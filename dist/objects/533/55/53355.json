        "Recorded live at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig on 2nd September 1982. This is a most exquisite performance by Yehudi Menuhin, the internationally acclaimed violinist who is recognised worldwide for his outstanding brilliance. The concerto is preceded by a personal introduction by Yehudi Menuhin and two pieces of unaccompanied Bach make up the encores. He is supported by the Gewandhaus Orchestra conducted by Kurt Masur."
