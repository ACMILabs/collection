        "This series from the American Film Institute (AFI) salutes some of the biggest stars that shaped the face of Hollywood. The charming and enchanting Gene Kelly is honoured in this tribute hosted by Shirley Maclaine. Through many film excerpts of his cinematic career, including For Me and My Gal (1942), An American in Paris (1951), Take Me Out to the Ballgame (1949), Cover Girl (1944), Singin' in the Rain (1952) we see the wonderful genius and style of this multi-talented dancer, director, actor, and choreographer. Take a walk down memory lane as a number of Hollywood stars including Fred Astaire, James Stewart, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Cyd Charisse, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Leslie Caron and Olivia Newton-John celebrate Gene Kelly's accomplishments with their own personal stories and reminiscings."
