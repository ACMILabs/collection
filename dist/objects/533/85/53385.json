        "The lives of four young ambitious would-be Broadway performers is portrayed through the eyes of a documentary filmmaker. Fast Eddie (Rex Smith), Carrie Richards (Terri Treas), Valerie Walker (Vivian Reed) and Ralph Morelli (Paul Caratotes) although coming from very different backgrounds, all share the same aspirations and passion to make it on Broadway. In similar tradition to \"Fame\" this film is predominantly a music and dance scenario typical of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and features music and lyrics by awarding-winning composer Joseph Brooks."
