        "Filmed on location at the St Thomas Church, New York, on Sunday February 24th 1985, the world premiere of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Requiem\" was performed to an enthusiastic and receptive audience. The wonderful voices of Placido Domingo (tenor), Sarah Brightman (soprano) and Paul Miles-Kingston (treble) supported by the Winchester Cathedral Choir (directed by Martin Neary), The St Thomas Choir (directed by Gerre Hancock) and the Orchestra of St Luke's conducted by Lorin Maazel give depth and quality to Webber's original composition."
