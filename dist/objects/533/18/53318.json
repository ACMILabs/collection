        "A tale of two hustlers in competition with each other, one a smooth-talking ladies' man, the other a loser surrounded by debt and emotional problems. Set in 1960s Baltimore, BB Bakowsky (Richard Dreyfus) and Ernest Tilley (Danny De Vito) are rival aluminium siding salesmen brought together through an unfortunate car accident. Each blames the other and a full-on feud ensues. Revenge becomes a game and BB succeeds in making life even more complicated when in order to infuriate Tilley, he attempts to sleep with Tilley's wife, Nora (Barbara Hershey) only to end up falling in love with her. Although the dialogue is fast and furious with many hilarious scenes there is sense of a darker sadder story underneath. Cast includes John Mahoney, Seymour Cassel, Jackie Gayle."
