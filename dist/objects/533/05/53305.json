        "B-grade science-fiction from Roger Corman, set in a post-nuclear holocaust world. Just a few survivors are holed up at a ranch (protected from the nuclear fallout by a mountain range) where nerves are frayed and romantic rivalry erupts. These issues are swept aside however when a radioactive mutant creature terrorises the group. Accomplished low budget thriller (reputedly shoot in 9 days) was one of the first to present the horrors of a post-nuclear wasteland -- a lawless place, lurking with unpredictable threats. Cast includes: Richard Denning, Lori Nelson, and Jonathan Haze."
