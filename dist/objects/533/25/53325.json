        "When a vintage B-29 bomber strays from its course over the Pacific, its crew - a high-living pilot, a prim missionary and two stowaway orphans - is forced to beach it on an unmapped tropical island. Stranded, they plot their way back to civilization. Stars Elliott Gould, Genevieve Bujold, Ricky Schroder, and Vincent Gardenia."
