        "A young woman wanders the clubs and streets of New York City in the mid 1980s in search of entertainment or just to seek out the freaks. She sees avant-garde style musicians, spoken word performances, junkies, sadomasochistic shows and comedians of the era. Not a narrative but more a compilation of performances, 'Mondo New York' is a glimpse of a moment in time, when the punk ethos of 'shocking behaviour' and being 'alternative' were celebrated in the arts/under world. Some scenes and language may offend and some animals ARE harmed in the making of this picture. Performers featured include: Lydia Lunch, Joey Arias, Rick Aviles, Charlie Barnett, Joe Coleman, Phoebe Legre and Ann Magnuson."
