        "Early computer animated Disney feature, features the mellifluous tones of Vincent Price as Professor Rattigan, a Sherlock Homes type character who is a master of mystery sleuthing. Set in Victoria London, England Rattigan (a highly intelligent scientific mouse) is joined by various cohorts on the trail of the abducted father of a little mouse. An entertaining effort directed at children, that charms in many ways with its gentle humour and fun characterisations."
