        "This moving, understated work focuses on the mixed fortunes of an Afghanistan refugee, Mobarak Tahiri, who finds work and an adopted family in the small town of Young, New South Wales. Along with many of his fellow refugees, Mobarak works in the local abattoir, receiving praise for their work ethic. Local community members show great support for the refugees - organising English lessons, soccer matches and outings. But despite this goodwill, at times the town seethes with racial hatred and bigotry. Set against the backdrop of Prime Minister John Howard's hard-line stance on asylum seekers, \"Molly & Mobarak\" depicts friendship, kindness, romance and tolerance. Veteran Australian filmmaker Tom Zubrycki's sympathies clearly lie with the asylum seekers, but this does not prevent the work from being intelligent and thought provoking."
