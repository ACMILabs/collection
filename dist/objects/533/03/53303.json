        "A mad scientist, residing deep in the jungle, uses the natives' voodoo for his experiments to create an indestructible monster. It all goes horribly wrong when he creates a hideous-looking female monstrosity who will not yield to his command. Trading on the themes of mercenary greed and manipulative behaviour, Edward L. Cahn presents an intriguing mix of morally dubious characters whose avarice see them meeting suitably sticky ends."
