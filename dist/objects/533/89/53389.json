        "This post-WWII film of the Hardy family reflects the true-life situation of Mickey Rooney as he plays G.I. Andy Hardy returning from his tour of duty at the war. The Hardy family represents the \"typcial\" stereotype American family with Andy a typical American teenager, interested in cars and girls, his stern but understanding father Judge James Hardy (Lewis Stone) and his dear loving mother Mrs Hardy (Fay Holden). When Andy finds himself falling for the lovely college co-ed Kay Wilson (Bonita Granville), little does he realise what disappointments lay ahead. Delightful, light-hearted romantic comedy based on the characters created by Aurania Rouverol. Cast also includes Sara Haden, Lina Romay and Dorothy Ford."
