        "This remake of the 1948 Preston Sturges classic stars Dudley Moore as the symphony conductor who imagines ways to get back at the wife he believes is unfaithful to him. As his jeaslousy escalates, the disastrous after-shocks provide an arrary of farcical situations as Claude lays traps, fantasizes about double murder and sets about stalking his prey. Also stars Armand Assante and Natassja Kinski."
