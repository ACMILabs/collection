        "The lovely assistant of a mysterious and evil hypnotist has no idea that she is the descendent of a horrifying prehistoric sea monster, which she reverts back to when she is mesmerized by her boss. Unbeknownst to the hypnotist however, each time she is in the killer monster's guise she becomes more skilled at controlling it. Immensely enjoyable 1950s 'creature feature' that boasts one of the most impressive monster costumes created in the B-Grade horror era. Cast includes Chester Morris and Marla English."
