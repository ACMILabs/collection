        "Exciting live concert footage of the master of funk and godfather of soul, the inimitable James Brown. Supposedly shot in Monterey, California in 1979, this live concert shows the master in fine form. His powerful voice and trademark dance moves don't disappoint but the transition to DVD format is a little dubious (may have been shot off a television screen). The ten songs featured are: \"Get up offa that thing\", \"Body heat\", \"Try me\", \"Sex machine\", \"Georgia on my mind\", \"Please please please\", \"Hindsight\", \"Can't stand it\", \"Papa's got a brand new bag\" and \"Jam\". Original producers of the live concert footage were Eric Therman, Rod Crowe and Robert Sheridan. The title listed on the cover (as opposed to the actual work) is \"James Brown: Body Heat Live\"."
