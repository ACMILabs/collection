        "Filmed live performance of a special benefit concert for the starving refugees of Bangla Desh in New York's Madison Square Gardens in 1971. A collaborative effort by George Harrison and Ravi Shankar, this amazing concert assembled together some of the greats in the British and American rock music industry including Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Billy Preston, Leon Russell, Ringo Starr, Ali Akbar Khan, Klaus Voorman, Badfinger. The first half of the concert features an Indian music presentation led by Ravi Shankar followed by George Harrison and his guest performers in the second half. The concert raised $US250,000 with further monies raised through record sales. Songs include \"My sweet Lord \", \"It don't come easy\", \"Here comes the sun\", \"Just like a woman\", \"A Hard rain's gonna fall\". Also includes documentary footage of Bangla Desh."
