        "A magical documentary where the story is told through the combination of stunning images, beautiful sounds of orchestral music, and minimal commentary. It is a contrast of seasons and of cultures - winter in London, summer in Australia. This is a musical journey that takes you half-way around the globe with one of the world's greatest orchestras, the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The story begins in a snow-covered wintery London with a performance by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Klaus Tennstedt, at the Royal Festival Hall. Next, the orchestra boards a Qantas flight bound for Perth and their final destination, the magnificent Leeuwin Estate, a vineyard 250 kilometres south of Perth. It is here under the Australian night sky that the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Avi Ostrowski, will perform to an audience of around 4,500 enthusiastic and appreciative music lovers."
