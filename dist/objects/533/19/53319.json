        "The year is 2020 and the first manned mission to Mars, commanded by Luke Graham, lands safely on the red planet. But the Martian landscape harbours a bizarre and shocking secret that leads to a mysterious disaster so catastrophic, it decimates the crew. Haunted by a cryptic last message from Graham, NASA launches the Mars Recovery Mission to investigate and bring back survivors - if there are any. Features: Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle, and Tim Robbins. Music by Ennio Morricone."
