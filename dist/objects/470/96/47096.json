        "Approximately 100 years ago (c1848) the Factory Inspectorate was created in England, and with it came laws and regulations designed to safeguard the factory worker. The duties of a factory inspector include the inspection of safety devices and guards on various machines; checking the aprons and gloves of working men; observing the condition and operation of equipment used in the loading and unloading of ships; interviewing a witness of an industrial accident."
