        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Tales of the four seasons = Contes des quatre saisons\". Felicie's love for Charles is undiminished four years after a romantic idyll during a summer holiday in Brittany but he has not contacted her - the home address she gave him was incorrect. In the meantime she has given birth to his daughter and is unable to choose between two adoring suitors. Rohmer, with more than a passing reference to Shakespeare, locates his customarily precise observation of the everyday complexities of human psychology in a tale of accident and coincidence. For Felice, the emotional aftermath of a lost summer is suspended or frozen until the thaw of a spring of promise. In French with English subtitles. Cast includes Charlotte Very, Frederic Van Den Driessche and Michel Voletti."
