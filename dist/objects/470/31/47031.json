        "Alphonse Tram discovers his penknife planted in the belly of a moribund accountant lying in a subway corridor. He tries to engage in a conversation with the moribund who rebuffs him. Lost and angry, Alphonse goes back home to the modern tower where he lives with his wife. She introduces him to their new neighbour, a police inspector. Later Alphonse's wife is found murdered and her hapless murderer almost immediately confesses to Alphonse, but neither the husband, nor the police inspector seem to be shocked. The three sit down to enjoy a friendly drink when a man arrives and accuses Alphonse of the subway murder. 'Buffet Froid' is a wonderfully absurd black comedy that cunningly reverses the conventions of the crime thriller to comment on the alienating and dehumanizing effects of contemporary urban life. Cast includes Gerard Depardieu, Bernard Blier, Jean Carmet, Genevieve Page, Michel Serrault, Carole Bouquet, Jean Rougerie, Bernard Crombey, Denise Gence, Jean Benguigui and Liliane Rovere. In French with English subtitles."
