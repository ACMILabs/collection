        "Set at the height of Victorian England, 'Mrs Brown' tells of the extraordinary relationship between a Queen and a commoner. Judi Dench gives a stunning performance (which was reflected by her Best Actress nomination), as Queen Victoria who begins a doomed, and ultimately tragic relationship with her servant, John Brown (Billy Connolly). Brown brings comfort and life to the Queen's long period of mourning following the death of her husband, Albert. Where others failed to cheer her up, Brown succeeds, and in doing so secures the Queen's respect and friendship. The Victorian court is suspicious of their leader's new found happiness which forces the Queen and Brown to make some painful choices about their relationship, their own needs, and the monarchy. Cast includes Antony Sher, Geoffrey Palmer, Richard Pasco and David Westhead."
