        "Captures the various bi-centennial celebrations that were organised in Victoria to commemorate the birth of Captain Matthew Flinders. Includes footage of the Shrine; Mornington beach; Arthur's Seat; Port Philip Bay; Station Peaks; Flinder's Street Station; St Paul's Cathedral; Swanston street; and the Matthew Flinders torch relay. Leading Victorian figures appear unveiling commemorative plaques. This is an un-edited film without a soundtrack which documents many of the celebrations."
