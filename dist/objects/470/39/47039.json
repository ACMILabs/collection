        "Four families; all new Canadians. In some ways their problems are as diverse as the different parts of the world they come from. But they share the many upheavals of emigration. A Chilean family, a 24-year-old Sikh, an Antiguan store manager, and a Russian ballet master; they also share the strong conviction that their future in Canada will be bright."
