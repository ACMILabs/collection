        "Severe frosts coming in the late spring can create havoc in the orchard. Various ways of protecting fruit trees against frost damage have been tried. However, the best protection available at present is probably that derived from a knowledge of how cold air behaves; the orchard can then be planned so that the layer of cold air runs away from the orchard, and frost pockets are avoided."
