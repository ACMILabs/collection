        "This darkly humorous, erotic drama centres on Marie, an independent prostitute with a heart of gold. After rescuing a down-and-out homeless man one night, she falls in love with him and invites him to be her pimp. Soon he starts recruiting other women - the inexperience of one of the new recruits landing them all in jail. Discovering her lover's duplicity, Marie decides to reform. In French with English subtitles. Cast includes Anouk Grinberg, Gerard Lanvin, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi and Olivier Martinez. Winner of the Silver Bear Best Actress award at the Berlin Film Festival 1996."
