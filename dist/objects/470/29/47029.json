        "Scorsese's drama detailing the Dalai Lama's life story was in development for seven years, with the Dalai Lama having input into the 14 screenplay drafts. With four actors portraying the Dalai Lama at different ages, the film begins in 1933 with the death of the 13th Dalai Lama. Born in a remote area, the new Dalai Lama (seen at ages two and five in early sequences) is observed by monks who determine that he is the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha of Compassion. In 1944 he uses newsreels and Western magazines to study WWII events, and as the war ends, he is forced to deal with Chinese Communist aggression. Mao's military stranglehold on Tibet eventually forces the Dalai Lama to flee to Dharmsala, India. Commenting on the anti-spiritual...Marxist government of the Chinese Communists, Scorsese remarked, \"What interests me is how a man of non-violence deals with these people -- that's ultimately the story.\" With a $28 million budget, he re-created Tibet's tragedy by filming in south-central Morocco with a cast of nonprofessional Tibetan actors. Second unit work took place at locations in Idaho and British Columbia. Cast includes Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, Gyurme Ththong, Tencho Gyalpo, Tsewang Migyur Khangsar and Sonam Phunstok."
