        "Episode of Series \"Look at Life\". The Shell office in London, 26 floors high is like a small boom town. Shops, restaurant, hair dressing salon and recreation facilities are readily available to all staff. There is an automatic mail dispatch with receiving lines on each floor; audio typists receive letters from all over the building without leaving their desks; the switchboard operates 250 lines with some 4,000 extensions. Narrated by Tim Turner."
