        "In just a few short years, genetically modified plants have become part of our daily diet and are already found in 75% of processed foods. This revolution has occurred without consumer awareness and without the knowledge of potential risks to our health and the environment. In response to consumer demands, many European and Asian countries have instituted mandatory labelling of genetically modified foods. North America and Canada however, have been slow to react. This video takes a sober look at a potentially explosive situation. It investigates the issue that industrial giants are willing to ignore basic safety rules in their relentless fight for profits and asks the question: Can food crops, a vital element of the collective wealth of this planet, remain at the mercy of private interests?"
