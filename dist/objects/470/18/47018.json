        "The Extension Branch of the Girl Guides Association of Victoria was established to provide the thrill of guiding to mentally and physically disabled girls. This documentary presents some of the people and activities associated with this service by following Ethel, a young woman crippled by poliomylitis, as she is admitted to the Othopaedic Section of the Children's Hospital at Mt Eliza and joins a group of Guides that has been established there. Through her involvement in the programs and activities, Ethel improves sufficiently to earn an income. Also shows activities at Janefield."
