    "description": [
        "This film is short drama with a musical soundtrack and no dialogue set around Nimmo Street in Middle Park, Melbourne.  A young man meets a woman arriving on a 'Red Rattler' train and walks her home. On the way, they are accosted by two thugs but manage to avoid conflict. When the young woman reaches her home and doesn't invite the man in, he leaves and takes out his frustration on the thugs when he encounters them again in the street. A simple, beautifully shot, low budget film capturing Melbourne's inner suburban street life."
