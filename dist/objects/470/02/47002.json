        "Based on Oscar Wilde's stage play about a woman who narrowly avoids causing a scandal in London society. The first and most melodramatic of his four social comedies, this silent film version was directed by former actor Fred Paul. It is a typical example of British feature films from this period with the actors giving essentially stage-crafted performances. Although the play was substantially altered for this screen version, it is still shot as if it was theatre with the camera taking up a fixed frontal position. A new specially commissioned musical soundtrack composed and conducted by Nicholas Brown and performed by the Triptych piano trio has been added. Cast includes Milton Rosmer, Netta Westcott and Nigel Playfair."
