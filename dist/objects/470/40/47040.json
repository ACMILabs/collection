        "This film offers audiences a clear illustration of how an atomic reactor produces electricity. Special features of the Canadian CANDU (Canada Deuterium Uranium) system are explained: on-power refuelling; the use of natural uranium; the use of heavy water as moderator. CANDU is recognized internationally as a leader in the search for new sources of energy."
