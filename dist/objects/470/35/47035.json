        "This film shows the construction of the Dounreay Reactor. From redesigning the coastline and big tunnels beneath the ocean to cement monoliths with steel plating. We see every part of Dounreay being built and clearly explained. A product of knowledge and proudness in its day - and sadly to become one day dangerous and obsolete."
