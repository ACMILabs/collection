        "Shows through the experiences of a new recruit to the Snowy Mountains Scheme how this great enterprise was carried out. There are dramatic scenes from inside the thirty-seven mile tunnel which is an essential feature of the work. Other views include the blasting of roads, dam-building, and the life of families in the new frontier towns of the Australian Alps. Uses archival footage."
