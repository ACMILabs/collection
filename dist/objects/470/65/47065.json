        "Serbian born director Emir Kusturica's first English language film is an absurdist comedy that focuses on the quirks of small town U.S. culture. Kusturica grafts his sometimes unwieldy Europe-inflected concerns onto brash American landscapes with mixed results. Johnny Depp stars as Axel, a young drifter caught between the dreams of youth and the responsibilities of adulthood. Enticed back to his Arizona hometown, the oddball residents take more than a passing interest in him. While his uncle Leo tries to convince him to take over the family's cadillac dealership, Axel becomes caught up in a love triangle with a wealthy widow and her stepdaughter. Cast also includes: Jerry Lewis, Faye Dunaway, Lili Taylor and Vincent Gallo."
