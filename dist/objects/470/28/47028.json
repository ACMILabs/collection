        "This taut, tense and incredibly fast paced thriller features Jeanne Moreau and Maurice Ronet as passionate lovers who embark on a plan to murder her husband. However, the plan goes terribly wrong when the murderer finds himself trapped in a faulty lift. While his lover searches frantically through Paris for him, he grows increasingly more desperate, and she finds herself trapped in another's scheming plans. Based on a novel by Noel Calef, Louis Malle directs with an audacious vitality, while Moreau and Ronet are wonderful as the callous lovers. The film's musical score is by jazz legend Miles Davis. The film won the prestigious Prix Delluc, one of French cinema's most important awards. In French with English subtitles."
