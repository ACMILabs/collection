        "Here is the famed Royal Canadian Mounted Police Musical Ride, filmed in a way that gives it all the unison of a chorus line. An extremely sophisticated exercise in patterned movement of horses and riders, the Musical Ride entails pinpoint precision. In this film the camera challenges this virtuosity from every angle, including a position directly above the platoon. The resulting blend of music, color, movement and, of course, fine horsemanship, is exciting to see. (Awards: Locarno)"
