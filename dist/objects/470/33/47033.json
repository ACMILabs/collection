        "A film story about the people who live in the nine fishing villages of Pubnico on the southwest tip of the Nova Scotian peninsula. Like that of their Acadian ancestors, their livelihood is inextricably bound to the sea. Characteristic of their faith in its bounty is the quest of the captain of a fishing schooner who, after a fruitless three-week search for swordfish, borrows money and sets out again. Eight more days of scanning the waves are rewarded by a full catch and money in the pocket for the captain and his crew."
