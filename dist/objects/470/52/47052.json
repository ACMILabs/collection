        "This series allows the student to hear and see native speakers of German conducting a conversation lasting about two minutes. The dialogue is broken down into parts which are repeated four times to allow the student to imitate the pronunciation and intonation of the speaker. Part one presents dialogue on the arrival in Germany of a friend from America, using simple sentences with present tense. In English and German."
