        "There has been greater progress in the science of forestry during the past several decades than in any previous time, and it is the practitioner of the trade, the professional forester, whose day-to-day work is most responsible for making effective the discoveries, experiments and research carried on at forestry stations across Canada. This film shows both the modern technology of the timberlands and the role of the forester in the preservation and regeneration of this great natural resource."
