        "An American broadcaster and a former film director go to a factory to interview the manager about modern managerial methods and find it occupied by the workers who take them hostage. Supporters of the working class and student uprising that took place in France in 1968, they are forced to re-examine their commitment to the struggle and to each other. The film wittily examines the position of three major social forces in French society and the contradictions between them: the bourgeoisie, the working class and intellectuals. The basic concern is the part an intellectual can play in revolutionary movement of the working class. Cast includes Yves Montand and Jane Fonda."
