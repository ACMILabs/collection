        "Long before there was Sarah Michelle Gellar gracing out television screens as Buffy, there was Kristy Swanson in the title role - a role which she tackles admirably. Buffy - cheerleader, girlfriend, air head and popular student finds her life turned upside down when a strange man in a trench coat, Merrick (Donald Sutherland), interrupts cheerleading practice to tell her it's time to acknowledge her birthright. For as long as there has been vampires, there's been the slayer - one girl, hand picked out of the entire world as championing the cause against the creatures of the night. When Buffy finally accepts her fate, she is coached by Merrick to fight lead vampire Rothos (Rutger Hauer), someone who has been visiting her in her dreams. As Buffy discovers fighting capabilities she never knew she had, and realises the responsibility she now wears, she finds herself drifting away from her vacuous friends and is drawn to the elusive, older, Pike (Luke Perry). The film culminates at a dance in the gymnasium. While there are no cross over characters or actors between the movie and the series, fans of either film or television versions will enjoy the tongue in cheek horror that Buffy is synonymous for. Cast also includes Paul Reubens, David Arquette, Natasha Gregson Wagner and Hilary Swank."
