        "The mountains and glens of Scotland's highlands look beautiful to the visitor. Yet there are few people living there. Bracken has wasted the hill-sides, where the land which should be supporting sheep and cattle lies unchecked towards sea-level, taking the topsoil with it, and turning the valleys into bogs. The North of Scotland Hydro-Electricity Board was set up to convert this ruinous water into power, and to promote and develop the highlands. This film was shot in Gen Aric, Strathfarrar, Duckie and Galloway."
