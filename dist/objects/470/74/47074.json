        "A study of the origin and history of the Mexican people; primarily an agricultural nation, the Mexicans living in the rural areas regulate their lives by the seasons, planting and harvesting their corn, marketing it in exchange for the other necessities of life which they cannot grow or make; making their homes and their household utensils and ornaments out of clay and wood. The fiesta or religious ceremonies are part of the routine of village life. In sharp contrast, life in the mining areas of Mexico is very much like life in a mining area anywhere in the world."
