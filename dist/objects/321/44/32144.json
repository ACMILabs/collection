        "Traces the history of the land of the South Slavs, from the time of the Romans and Avars to the rise of Tito. Presents a view of the land and the people of modern day Yugoslavia (1962) including their agriculture, education, arts and industry. Discusses the reactions of the people towards Tito and his regime and their efforts to make Yugoslavia a unified communist nation. Communist but partly outside the Soviet Bloc and supported by the West; swinging back and forth between Russia and the West, this most enigmatic of the Balkan States is crucial in international politics."
