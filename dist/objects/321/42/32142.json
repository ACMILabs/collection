        "Baymen, no matter where they go, remain above all else Newfoundlanders. They were born to the sea, to a place in the life of their cliffside village, but many of the younger generation are now looking to the city for their future. This film shows the feelings of generation after generation of four families who have earned their living by gathering fish for over 400 years. How will the big industries now affect the lives of the Baymen? It follows a Bayman's family to St. John's (Vancouver Island), showing what such a change means to father, daughter and grandfather. Camera: Hector J. Lemieux."
