        "Looks at the Palliative Care Unit for the terminally ill at Montreal's Royal Victoria Hospital, and the hardships and joys experienced by patients, their families and the staff. The palliative care techniques observed by the camera are simple and straight forward, such as listening, sharing, touching and music therapy. An essential film for health-care professionals and volunteers, and for the public at large."
