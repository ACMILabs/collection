        "Alfonzo is a weaver in the Ecuadorian community of Otavalo. The Otavalo weavers are threatened by the competition of mass produced garments made on industrial looms. The film follows Alfonzo to Quito, where he seeks to sell his work and that of his fellows. Finally a man comes to town who claims to know how to put Otavalo's cottage industry back into competition. Narrated by Ben Park."
