        "Norman Laliberte, one of the most creative designers of banners in North America is shown in his workroom piecing, stitching together, from pieces of varicoloured fabric, figures and symbols reminiscent of ancient pomp and pageantry. Music and movement are used in the film to heighten the effect of the arrangement shaping and growing before your eyes."
