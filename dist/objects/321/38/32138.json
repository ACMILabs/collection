        "Omar was a boy when he fled with his parents from the family orange grove near Jaffa and joined 750,000 Palastinian Arab refugees streaming out of the new State of Israel. Ever since then Omar has waited and now lives in Qatar, where he works and bides his time. Like others of 1948, Omar waits for the world community to settle a long overdue account."
