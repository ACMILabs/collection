        "Surveys the activities of Australia's 700,00 city children when their schools close for holidays. For some children, holidays mean a make-believe world of cowboys and six-shooters, hopscotch and football in the back streets. Other children make use of various facilities provided by the community, well equipped playground, swimming pools and junior clubs for yachting, life saving and hiking. The work of such organisations at the Police Boy's Clubs, Sea Cadet Corps and National Fitness Camps is shown, providing for the healthy recreation of children when School's out."
