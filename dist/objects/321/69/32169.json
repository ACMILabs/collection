        "A film pastorale set in the early summer near Elora, Ontario where music students practice out-of-doors. Lush green fields, towering elms and a rippling stream near an old farmhouse provide a rich setting for young musicians playing solo or together on flutes, strings, piano. Music has charm indeed when the mood is of lilac and the sweet pipings of spring."
