        "Portrait of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" a profoundly controversial figure with a reputation swinging between hero worship on the one hand and contempt on the other. Tells the story of his life and death (1935) with the richest and most authentic material available in the hope that a real and credible Lawrence will emerge. Original photographs, drawings of Eric Kennington, and mementos from friends are used. Written and narrated by David Lytton, voice of T.E. Lawrence by Cyril Cusack."
