        "Opening with the poignant story of a herring fisherman whose life's work is endangered by man's careless exploitation of the living resources of the sea, this film looks at the frontiers of technology in fisheries research. Emphasises the use of undersea technology, including scuba diving, underwater sleds, and a new two-man submarine of revolutionary design."
