        "A study of one of the oldest Gothic cathedrals of France, built in 1262 during what was known as the century of cathedrals. This film shows the details of exteriors and interiors - the lofty spire, the lacework of stone, and the luminous flood of light through stained glass windows. Comparisons are made between St. Urbain and other ancient French churches. The city of Troyes is seen as it is today and as it was in medieval times."
