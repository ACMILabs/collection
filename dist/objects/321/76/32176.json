        "It is a sight to gladden the heart of every spectator when the changing of the guard takes place on the broad green lawns of Ottawa's Parliament Buildings and when the band of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police plays their sunset Retreat. Both traditional ceremonies are shown in full colour, as are other points of interest in and around the city including scenic drives and waterways, historic stone buildings and modern edifices."
