        "In an age when most North American boys have their eyes on a car, there are a few who choose the older ideal of fleetness of foot. Such a one is Bruce Kidd, Toronto long-distance runner, winner of national and international honors. Oblivious of the clapping crowds and the flash of cameras, he knows full well that in the long run it is the cold stopwatch that tells the truth. Commentary written by W. H. Auden."
