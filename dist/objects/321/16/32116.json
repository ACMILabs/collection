        "The introduction of Micro-technology has brought about change and crisis, which will alter our value systems and the way we spend our time. Through a bizarre mutation of live action and exciting graphic animation, the film makes us passengers in a world of artificial voices, plastic sound and faceless people. This film was shown at the Melbourne Film Festival, 1981."
