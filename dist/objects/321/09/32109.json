        "This film begins with an introduction to African musical instruments, showing how they are made and how they fit into basic musical families. The integral part music plays in African storytelling sessions comes to life as children respond in song to the story of the great baboon, Mapandangare. As the story unfolds it is possible to see why storytelling has been of such great importance for thousands of years."
