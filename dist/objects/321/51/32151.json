        "Fiji, one time home of warring tribes, is now a peace loving island with a thriving tourist trade. Palm beaches, ocean waters, traditional native ceremonies, and the cosmopolitan capital of Suva are among the many attractions. Outlines Fiji's history from the first missionaries, to British Dependency in 1874, and the present government. Shows the ceremonial opening of the Legislative Council, soldiers in parade dres, and the official raising of the flag."
