        "Photographed by Swedish cameraman and film producer Arne Sucksdorff, this documentary observes the activities of the reindeer-tending Laplanders of northern Scandinavia. We see a family packing up from the mountainous summer fishing camp and crossing the high country moors with pack reindeers. When they reach their home the herd reindeers are gathered and many of the males slaughtered, every part of the body being used for food, shelter, clothing and implements. Three generations of the one family are shown."
