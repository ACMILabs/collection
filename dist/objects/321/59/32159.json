        "Patrick Watson and Laurier Lapierre undertake a survey of the extent of water and air pollution in Canada. What they discover provides abundant evidence of our prodigal abuse of precious natural resources. That action is necessary, everyone in the film agrees, but there is less accord as to whether responsibility rests with industry, government, or municipality."
