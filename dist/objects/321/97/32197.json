        "In this animated film the hero attempts to practise a piece of music on the piano. A series of distractions delays him and, when he finally sits down to play, pandemonium breaks loose. A short film that will appeal to those of us who tend to procrastinate. (Awards include: Toronto, Zagreb)"
