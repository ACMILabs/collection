        "For anyone who has ever wondered what it takes to become an actor, the film provides a close-up of a craft that demands much from body and mind. An energetic and intense film which looks in at students and instructors as they sweat and strain through a typical workday at the National Theatre School - Canada's foremost training ground for performers."
