        "With a population of 570 million people India ranks second only to the Republic of China in population; so the work of Munni, a social worker, and Shrivastava, a community leader, takes on new urgency and meaning. The two women journey to out-of-the-way villages to convince largely illiterate village women to use birth control mehtods."
