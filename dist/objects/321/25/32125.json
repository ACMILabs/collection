        "Outlines a holiday visit by a 12-year-old boy to his grandfather at Broken Hill. The grandfather, a retired miner, shows him the scope and method of underground mining carried out at Broken Hill. The holiday moves to the Western Australian operation of Hamersley Iron and later the northern Queensland operation of Mary Kathleen Uranium. We meet many people from these operations and see how they relax and enjoy themselves."
