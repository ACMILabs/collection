        "Aluminium is one of the most sought after metals in use today. All the stages in the manufacture of aluminium, from the mining of bauxite, the raw material, to the pressing of the metal into its final shape is depicted. As well as its mines in the Darling Ranges, Alcoa also owns refineries at places such as Kwinana and has ready access to ports to speed the finished product on its way, whether it be destined for Japan or the United States."
