        "Musicologist Andrew Tracy and a group of African musicians introduce African rhythms and demonstrate how each of the twelve beats sounds alone, in combination and in crossed rhythms. Tracy tells a group of children a folktale about how a husband and a rabbit enchant a lion with music, changing a dinner-hunting beast into \"the dancing lion\" and thus freeing the wife. He illustrates the role of music in African storytelling by having children clap and chant responses as he relates the tale of a dancing lion."
