        "A visually dramatic film which can be used to promote discussion and interest in the art of dance, dance interpretation, choreography and communication. 'Climbers' presents an allegory in contemporary dance of the international struggle for women's liberation, the theme being drawn from the Japanese Women's ascent of Mount Everest in 1975. An excellent example of contemporary dance in Australia in the 1980's - Margaret Barr was a significant figure (as a choreographer) of this period and earlier. Film direction by Rosalind Gillespie shows original approach."
