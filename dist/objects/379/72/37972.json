        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". We live in a changing world and our experiences help us to learn how to adapt to these changes. This program looks at the way we learn - at classical and operant conditioning. Classical conditioning which was discovered by Pavlov proposes that we learn by association; that one thing leads to another. Edward Thorndyke and B. F. Skinner developed this further to mean that the consequences of our actions shape our behaviour. Operant conditioning proposes that we learn because of potential rewards and this is demonstrated by the education of hyperactive children in a highly structured environment."
