        "An excellent documentary on the evolution of the Australian film and television industry. By interviewing screenwriters such as David Williamson, Eleanor Whitcombe (My Brilliant Career) and Roger Simpson (Sword of Honour) we are given an insight into the struggles in the late 60's and 70's to develop an Australian film culture; on the formation of the Australian Writers Guild to help encourage writing for the screen; and the struggle to see their visions realised on television and the cinema."
