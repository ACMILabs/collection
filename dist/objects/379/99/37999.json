        "Episode number 15 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". The Self, or self concept, is the individual's awareness of his or her continuing identity as a person. It acts as an internal regulator of thoughts, feelings and behaviour which interprets and organises our ongoing experiences. It reflects on how our present actions compare with our standards and expectations - and it affects our performance by providing plans, scripts and incentives. In this program, Philip Zimbardo examines the psychology of Self, including the theories of William James, Freud's categories of id, ego and superego, Carl Rogers humanistic psychology of self and Albert Bandura's theory of self-efficacy."
