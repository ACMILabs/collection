        "Lalai Dreamtime is a reconstruction of the traditional way of Aboriginal life - in particular, the transmission of knowledge and culture from one generation to the next, enacted by the Woolagoodjah family of north-west Australia. An old man takes his son to a sacred place to explain about their ancestors. He outlines the foundation of Aboriginal mythology when humankind was prepared to accommodate to nature rather than change nature for the sake of humankind, and the fundamental and intimate connection between the Aboriginal people and their land. Esben Storm acted as editor on this multi-award winning film. With some Australian Aboriginal language with English subtitles."
