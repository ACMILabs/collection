        "Since the arrival of the camera in Australia in the mid 19th Century, it has recorded the nation's life. This is the story of some of the most enduring images of the Australian experience and the three men who made them - Max Dupain, Wolfgang Sievers and David Moore. Relive the history of Australia, from the 1930s to the present day through the lenses of these renowned photographers."
