        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Rainbow serpent\". Bob Maza and Eric Willmot, author of an unpublished novel on the exploits of Pemulwuy, who led resistance to the British colonisation of Australia, discuss the role that Pemulwuy and other Aboriginal warriors played in the early years of the British colony of Australia. Their guerrilla and confrontational tactics are contrasted with those of Bennelong, who sought some form of reconciliation. The program includes dramatised enactments of some of these events."
