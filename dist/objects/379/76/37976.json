        "Paris is Burning is the result of the five years film-maker Jennie Livingston spent amongst New York City's black and Hispanic transvestite community. Often poor and homeless the young gay men and drag queens form \"houses\" which conduct dances and balls dedicated to vogueing: the celebration of fashion, style and beauty. This is a fascinating documentary which confronts the viewer with a blurring of traditional notions of gender and sexuality and which also celebrates sexual, ethnic and racial diversity and difference. Features a great soundtrack of house and funk music. Winner of Best Documentary at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival."
