        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". Georges Seurat was a painter of the edge, the border, passage and nowhere is this more clearly seen than in his two major paintings set on the island of La Grande Jatte in the Seine, \"La Baignade\" and \"Un dimanche sur la Grande Jatte, 1884\". This program looks closely at the similarities between the two huge paintings, the sketches and drawings that he made beforehand and at his scientific study of colour and light which resulted in his pointillist technique."
