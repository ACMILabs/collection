        "Episode number 22 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". In this program, a patient is shown in consultation with representatives of the three main schools of psychotherapy. The psychodynamic school explores feelings and past history and recognises the existence of the conscious and the unconscious mind. The humanistic school believes in a continual process of growth and development which the therapist attempts to facilitate. The cognitive behaviourist identifies unsuccessful patterns of behaviour and attempts to replace them with new, successful ones. Although each of these approaches is different it is also most likely that any therapist may combine any or all of these techniques in their approach to therapy."
