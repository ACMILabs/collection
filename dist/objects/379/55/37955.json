        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". What is sleep? What are dreams and what use, if any, do they have? The average person spends seven and a half hours asleep and a third of that time dreaming. Freud was the first person to attempt a coherent theory of dreams, although his idea of the dream being a special access to the repressed unconscious which holds the secret of mental disorders, has largely been discredited. Now sleep patterns can be accurately measured but there are still no proven explanations for dreams. This program explores some of the latest research into these two mystifying areas."
