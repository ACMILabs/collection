    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"Visionaries\". Bill Mollison believes that the single most destructive force on the planet is modern agriculture. It is destroying our soils, poisoning our water and producing toxic food. Instead, he has proposed a system of agriculture - permaculture - that uses the principles of Nature itself. He combines hundreds of species, plant and animal, into a fertile, self-regulating ecosystem. These permaculture systems can be applied to the city as well as the country, and can work in any climate."
