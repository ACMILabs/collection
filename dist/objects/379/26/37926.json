        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Do our senses show us what is real or is reality merely a perceptual construction? This is a question which has challenged philosophers and psychologists alike since early times. Modern research shows that the senses filter reality, but that they can build a valid model of reality. Humans are very dependent on the sense of sight and the program looks closely at how vision works. Finally the influence of stress and other emotions on our perception of reality is explored."
