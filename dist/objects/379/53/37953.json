        "Episode of Series \"The Greatest Adventure Stories from the Bible\". Seen through the eyes of the Apostle Mark, this beautifully animated recreation of \"The Easter story\" begins with Jesus' joyful entrance into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. The story continues with the drama of Christ's betrayal, arrest and crucifixion, and his triumphant resurrection and ascent into heaven. Presented in glowing, full-colour animation this production brings to life all the wonder and glory of what many have called \"the greatest story ever told\"."
