        "Episode number 18 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". What does it mean to grow old in our society? Most of us have little understanding of what it is like to grow old. It wasn't until the 1950's that research began into the psychology of aging. Since then, many myths about maturing and aging have been overturned. In this program, Philip Zimbardo examines depression and sexuality in old age, the negative effect of nursing homes on the aged, the life stages articulated by psychologists, Erik Erikson and Daniel Levinson, as well as surveying recent research into memory loss in old age."
