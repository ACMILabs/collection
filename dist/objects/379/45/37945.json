        "Episode of Series \"Famous authors\". Born Eric Blair in India in 1903, Orwell enjoyed a middle class upbringing in England which included education at Eton School. He spent some time in Burma with the Burma Military Police, where his social conscience was aroused. On his return to England he tried journalism and school-teaching, always struggling with poverty and ill health which prevented his participation in the second world war although he had fought in the Spanish Civil War. Success, with Animal Farm and 1984, came too late to save his health and he died in his Scottish island home in 1950."
