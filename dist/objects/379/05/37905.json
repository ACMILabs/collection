        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". What exactly are emotions, and why do they have the power to dictate our lives? The first part of this program discusses the question of whether there are emotional responses common to and recognisable by all cultures, or whether culture plays a significant role in how emotion is expressed. There seem to be three consideration when studying emotion: what your body does, what your mind does and what you have learnt to do, and the latter part of the program looks at anger and anxiety in particular and how these powerful emotions can be used or controlled with these three considerations in mind."
