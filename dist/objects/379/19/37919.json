        "A live-action non-narrated story about a man who brings a plant, that had been struggling up through a crack in the pavement, into his apartment. The plant is lavished with kindness by its new owner, but has a mind of its own and soon grows out of control. It encroaches into all areas of the apartment, eventually damaging it beyond repair. An open-ended film allowing scope for language development."
