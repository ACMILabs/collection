        "Episode number 17 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Adolescence is the period which occurs anywhere between 10 and 20 years of age, and during which we are trying to work out who we are. At this time we mature physically, sexually, socially, intellectually and morally, but not necessarily at the same rate, which is where some of the conflicts and embarrassments of adolescence occur. The peer group becomes of prime importance as it provides feedback on appropriate behaviour. This program takes a generally positive view of this period as an exciting challenge."
