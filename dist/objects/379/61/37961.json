        "Fermin (Tito Haas) is found in the streets of Buenos Aires, with no recollection of his past, 15 years after he had disappeared and was presumed dead. He returns to the village where he had left behind Tota (Mirtha Busnelli) the woman he promised to wed, but since his arrest by the Junta, she has become so absorbed in his memory that she doesn't recognise him. As he attempts to resume his life, the conservative power structures in the town (the church and the military) find his presence threatening as they discover his true identity."
