        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Close relationships help us achieve fulfilment as human beings. What do we expect from them and how do they change as we change? This program looks at the dynamics of close relationships and the ways in which cultural differences such as gender, the society we live in and our individual histories influence our expectations. The program also explores the relationship between a balance of power within a relationship and the long term success or failure of that relationship."
