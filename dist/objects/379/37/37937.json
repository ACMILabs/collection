        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Psychology attempts to explain human behaviour and mental processes. From early times man has been seeking ways of explaining behaviour, through philosophy, religion and science. This program introduces the five main strands of modern psychology: Behaviourism, Psychoanalysis and other clinical psychologies, Cognitive psychology, Socio-cultural psychology and Physiological psychology. It then goes on to show how the following programs will discuss different aspects of human behaviour such as sleep, memory, language, emotion and intellect in the light of these differing psychological approaches."
