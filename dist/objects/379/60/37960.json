        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Amsterdam is one of the world's great cities, renowned for its historic and splendid museums and architecture, and its non-stop and exuberant night- life. The video shows us aspects of both medieval and modern Amsterdam. We are taken on a journey of the city's famed canals. We visit the flower markets, the Van Gogh Museum, the 700 year old Dam Square, the Jewish section which houses the Anne Frank Museum and enjoy a Sunday afternoon in the beautiful gardens of the Vondelpark. Finally, after dark, we take a wander in the infamous \"red-light\" district."
