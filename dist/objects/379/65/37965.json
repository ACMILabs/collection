        "540,000 dogs inhabit the city of Sydney and every one with a story to tell. This whimsical, humorous film tells some of them, and in particular, the story of Fugly, the most impounded dog in Australia, and his impact on the suburb of Mosman. Dog lovers and dog haters alike express their point of view as we watch Fugly roaming the streets. \"Some dogs just want to be dogs. Some people want dogs to be people. But dogs will be dogs ... and people will be people. We all live together.\""
