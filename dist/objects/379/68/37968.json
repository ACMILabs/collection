        "The last flourish of the decadent Cavaliers, the obdurate zeal of the insurgent Puritans, the mighty clashes in Parliament and on the battlefields, the king's death on the headsman's block - a crucial phase of British history is encompassed in \"Cromewell\". This powerful story unfolds majestically against a backdrop of pageant, bloody battle and the agonies of a country torn by civil war. Stars Alec Guinness as Charles I and Richard Harris as Oliver Cromwell with a distinguished supporting cast."
