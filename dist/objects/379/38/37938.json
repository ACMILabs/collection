        "Episode number 20 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Part of the challenge of psychology is defining the line of what is normal and helping people who have stepped over that line. Probably the best way of defining abnormal behaviour is behaviour that prevents a person from being able to function. DSM III R is a manual which attempts to define mental disorders but not everyone can be slotted easily into categories. The program then looks at two case studies, one of severe depression and one of panic attacks and how these can be treated."
