        "Episode of Series \"Travel, Travel\". This travel video begins in the Halkidiki region of northern Greece, site of centuries-old monasteries. From Halkidiki we move to the city of Thessaloniki which is full of the influence of not only Greek and Roman civilisation but also Venetian and Arab. The travels continue south to the coastal regions of the Pelyponnese. In the second part we explore Athens: including the taverns of Plaka, the flea markets in Monasteraki, the original Olympic Stadium and , of-course, the Parthenon and the Acropolis."
