        "A film in three parts. In \"Hero\" a young boy kills his father who is abusing him and then the boy flies out of the window to Heaven. In \"Horror\" a possibly mad scientist finds he is falling victim to a disease created by his experiments in isolating the essence of the human sex drive. And in \"Homo\" a brutal prison love affair takes place in a Borstal prison that keeps changing shape and colour. Filmed in contrasting styles, initially seemingly random, the three episodes of \"Poison\" eventually come together to celebrate cinematic homoeroticism, the history of gay and queer subversion (especially the work of Jean Genet) and to delineate new possibilities for an erotic cinema. Beautifully made, ingeniously constructed and filmed \"Poison\" is part of a new form of cinema, a \"queer cinema\" that celebrates new forms of visual pleasure."
