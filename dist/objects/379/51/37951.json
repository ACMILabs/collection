        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". No matter where you travel - from the ruins of Palenque to the resorts of Cancun - Mexico is a myriad of religions, cultures and languages unlike any other country. \"Mexico: journey to the sun\" covers the Aztec and Mayan ruins of modern Mexico's ancestors, the traditional crafts of pottery and weaving, as well as the painting of leading Mexican muralists, such as Diego Rivera. It is a colourful guide to Mexican towns, museums and festivals, including the Day of the Dead."
