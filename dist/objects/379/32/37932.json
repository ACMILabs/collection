        "Nick Nolte plays a tough ex-con, fresh out of prison, who is trapped in a bank and held hostage by a bungling, first-time holdup man (Martin Short). No one will believe Nolte's innocence and no one can believe Short's guilt, so the unlikely duo become partners in crime - and parenting, when Short's six year old daughter joins the fugitives on a wheel-screeching run for the Canadian border. An American version of the successful French film of the same name."
