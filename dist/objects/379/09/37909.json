        "Episode of Series \"The Kids of Degrassi Street\". A dispute between two children over property boundaries gets out of hand when they cannot come to an agreement over the shared care of a rabbit. Lines are drawn and fences are erected. The position seems untenable until the unfortunate death of the rabbit. Raises issues about the attitudes and values attached to property and ownership."
