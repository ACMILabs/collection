        "Episode of Series \"Reading planet\". Prism, a young alien from the planet Reading, is sent to earth to help five students improve their reading skills. With magical powers he transports them to outer space where he teaches them the importance of concentration and the process of visualisation. With practice the students discover that words can activate the formation of mental pictures. Reading becomes fun when they \"turn on the TV in their minds\"."
