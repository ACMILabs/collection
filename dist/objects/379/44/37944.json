        "A combination of two animated films by John Taylor. \"The Huge adventures of Trevor, a cat\". Trevor has his hunting instincts revived when he accidentally catches a bird. Encouraged by his success Trevor sets his sights even higher with disastrous and hilarious results. \"Trevor Island\" Trevor's family move to a tropical island and decide to set up an airport and car park. A sedate lifestyle, however, is not to Trevor's liking."
