        "Episode of Series \"Reading planet\". Prism, a young alien from the planet Reading, is sent to Earth to help five students improve their reading skills. Queen Zoria wants to assign Prism to another planet. The only way he can stay with his Earth friends is to prove that these students understand implied relationships and can read between and beyond the words. In an intense confrontation with Queen Zoria, the students prove their ability to understand inferences. She is so impressed with their excellent comprehension that Prism is permitted to continue his task of developing good readers."
