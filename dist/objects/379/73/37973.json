        "Episode number 16 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". How smart are you? Can the richness and complexity of intelligence be summed up in a number? and what is the effect of this number on you? In this program Philip Zimbardo looks at the controversial area of psychometrics, of cognitive, intelligence tests and psychological assessment tests. He introduces the different tests established by Binet, Galton, Wexler and others and stresses the extreme care that must be taken in administering and using the tests. He concludes by summarising the nature versus nurture argument which has been provoked by testing."
