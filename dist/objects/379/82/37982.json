        "A killer great white shark is creating havoc at a Long Island Beach. Facing opposition and denial from the town's Council, the Police Chief (Roy Scheider) decides to search for, and destroy, the killer shark himself. Based on Peter Benchley's novel, the film grabs audience attention from its opening scene to the closing credits and the suspense and terror never lets up. Skilfully edited and directed, the film set director Spielberg onto the path of fame and fortune. \"Jaws\" is a consummate cinematic thriller. With Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. The chilling score is by John Williams."
