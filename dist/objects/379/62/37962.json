        "Jessica Lange hosts this tribute to Vivien Leigh which looks at her life both on-stage and off-stage. Uses clips from films such as \"Gone with the wind\", \"A Streetcar named Desire\" and \"The Roman spring of Mrs. Stone\" to illustrate her impressive career as an actress and includes interviews with friends and fellow actors which provide an insight into her private life including her marriage to Laurence Olivier and her struggle with physical and mental illness."
