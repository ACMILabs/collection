        "On remote Cape York Peninsula, the Pormpuraaw Aboriginal Community and scientists from the Anthropology and Geography departments of James Cook University are joining together to map the cultural, ecological and environmental heritage of their country. For many of the custodians it is their first trip home for many years and represents the renewal of an old and intimate relationship with the land. Through this bringing together of ancient understanding and modern methods it is hoped to preserve the past for the protection of the future."
