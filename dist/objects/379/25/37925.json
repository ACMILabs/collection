        "Episode number 16 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". This program looks at the work of Jean Piaget and his theories of child development. Piaget divided cognitive development into four stages: sensory-motor; concrete-operational; pre-operational and formal operational. Each of these stages is illustrated, using some of the experiments that he devised. The program concludes by discussing the impact of environment on development, a concept which Piaget did not explore."
