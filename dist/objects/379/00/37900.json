        "Episode of Series \"The Nature of things\". Examines the question of whether or not there are certain basic biological differences between males and females. The assertion that the socialisation of children totally determines their social behaviour and attitudes is disputed. Environmental factors may not be the sole determinants of sex roles. Suitable for middle and upper secondary and teacher/tertiary levels."
