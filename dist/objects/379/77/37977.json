        "Danny (Ben Mendelsohn) wants two things in his life: a Jaguar car and a relationship with the beautiful Joanna (Claudia Karvan). A shonky car dealer, Farkas, takes Danny for a ride by selling him a Jaguar with a disaster area where the engine should be. But Danny manages to get his revenge on the sleazy Farkas as well as getting his dream date with Joanna. The inconsequential plot is secondary to the affectionate characterisation of the Western suburbs community in which Danny lives. The excellent cast also includes Steve Bisley."
