        "This Roald Dahl story is set in a small English village in 1955. Danny (Samuel Irons) and his widowed father (Jeremy Irons) devise a plot, supported by their close-knit community, to save hundreds of pheasants from being shot on the estate of their wealthy neighbour Hazel (Robbie Coltrane). While carrying out their plan, the community learns of Hazel's intention to redevelop the town. Also stars Michael Hordern, Cyril Cusack and Lionel Jeffries."
