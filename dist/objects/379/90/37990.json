        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". How do we learn to speak? Are we born with some innate ability to speak or do we learn by imitating our parents? This program looks at the stages a young child goes through in learning to speak and the roles that nature and nurture play in the process. We look at how parents unconsciously adapt their normal speech patterns when speaking to very young children, at recent research into biological maturation of the brain and facial muscles, and at the social situations which also contribute to this unique ability of the human species to communicate through speech."
