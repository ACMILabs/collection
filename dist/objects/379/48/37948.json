        "Based on the autobiography of Christy Brown, this is the extraordinary true story of the Irish writer who overcomes the limitations imposed by cerebral palsy to live a life of zest, love and passion. Using his left foot, Christy channelled his words and images into best-selling novels, a true triumph against the odds. Daniel Day Lewis won an Academy Award for his performance as Christy Brown."
