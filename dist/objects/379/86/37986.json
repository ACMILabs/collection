        "Shows how the three families introduced in \"Families: alike and different\" obtain, prepare and eat their food. The Japanese buy in small shops and use chopsticks to eat fish, lotus root and rice. The Mexicans use a market and their own garden and use fingers to eat chicken stew. The Americans use cutlery to eat chicken, corn and salad from a supermarket."
