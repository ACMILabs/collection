        "Episode of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Language is the basis of all human interaction. The ability of human beings to use symbolic communication, particularly through speech and writing, to convey abstract thoughts is one of the most important of characteristics that distinguish us from the animals. This program explores biological, psychological and structuralist theories of language and linguistic development."
