        "Bob Hoskins plays a small-time con, just out of prison, who is delivering porn videos for a living. He gets a job as a minder to call-girl, Simone, (Cathy Tyson) and soon finds he is falling in love with her and assisting her to find her friend, Cathy, a young prostitute who has disappeared. A stylish film-noir set in contemporary London, \"Mona Lisa\" is also a challenging film about honour, responsibility and compassion in a society that is decaying and cruel. Cast also includes Michael Caine and Robbie Coltrane."
