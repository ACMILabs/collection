        "When I grow up I'm going to turn into something else, the caterpillar boasts to her friends. When the polliwog discovers that he, too, will turn into something else, he tells the caterpillar, and off they go to change into butterflies. While the polliwog waits patiently for his friend to emerge from her cocoon, he doesn't notice that he is changing too - but not into a butterfly. From the book by Jack Kent."
