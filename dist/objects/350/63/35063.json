        "Set in the barren wilderness of Northern China, this is the simple story of how an offscreen narrator's grandparents met and fell in love. A young village girl is married off to a rich and elderly leper. He is mysteriously murdered not long after the wedding and she takes on the management of his distillery with the help of the labourers. A relationship develops between herself and the sedan carrier who has saved her life. All appears to be going well until the advent of the Sino-Japanese war and the chilling appearance of the foreign invaders. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
