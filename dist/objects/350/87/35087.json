        "Never too old is about relationships for the over 60s. Through the use of observational documentary we are introduced to several people who have lost their partners and find that sexual and emotional needs do not necessarily diminish with age. Dave and Betty are the centrepiece of this film. Each had been happily married for more than 35 years, and they are now embarking on a new relationship."
