        "Director Sue Ford features in this fascinating project which presents several individual's faces shot in the mid-1970s, and then again in the 1990s. Ford has drawn upon a stable of 19 artists and friends to present their faces to her on film, but as if in a still photo. Her return to them in the 1990s using the same technique reveals striking differences in some of the faces, whilst at the same time reveals an inherent sameness about their poses."
