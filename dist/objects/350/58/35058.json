        "Episode of Series \"The Last dream: a special report by John Pilger\". Part One of a three part series which explores aspects of Australia's history. In this part, John Pilger traces the history of Australian immigration, from a personal perspective, from the horrors of the First Fleet through to the \"White Australia\" policy and the post-war \"Populate or Perish\" program. He challenges Australia's treasured stereotypes and self-image and instead shows the great hardships suffered by certain groups, namely convicts, immigrants, women and Aborigines, in the process of building the nation."
