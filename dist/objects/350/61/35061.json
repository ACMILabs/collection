        "Through the use of macro photography and slow motion filming, Phil Simon takes the viewer into the world of the honey bee. We see, first hand, the life cycle of the drone, the worker and the queen bee and their roles and interaction with each other in the colony. A highlight of the video is the fight to the death of two queen bees. Advice is also given on how to keep and handle bees."
