        "This is a film about sport and top Aboriginal sportsmen. It is predominantly an account of the creative use of sport made by the Noongar people of Western Australia's south-west to advance their status. Through interviews with top sportsmen like the Krakouer brothers in Victorian Football League and Archie Jones, the runner of the 1920s, the film establishes that the motivation to succeed in sport arises from a moral desire to be accepted and recognised."
