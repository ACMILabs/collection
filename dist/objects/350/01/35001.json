        "The Nativity is one in a series of Bible episodes seen through the eyes of three young visitors from the 20th Century. On a sure-footed donkey, Mary and Joseph make the journey from Nazareth, where Mary will give birth to their son. The three Magi ride their camels out of distant lands to worship the new-born king, and from Jerusalem, mad King Herod sends his Roman Legionnaires to find the child he fears."
