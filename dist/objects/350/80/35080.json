        "In the summer of 1961, Ellie and her father travel to the seaside town of Kilkee for their annual holiday. For a time, the two enjoy their past routines - Ellie, a keen naturalist, observing and recording the native wildlife, her father fishing. However, a tourist development plan is proposed to extend and change their summer retreat, and Ellie soon learns that she is alone in her opposition to change. Cast includes John Hargreaves, Heather Mitchell, Tushka Bergen."
