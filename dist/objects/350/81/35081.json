        "Set amid the austere beauty of Tasmania's mountainous landscape, The Tale of Ruby Rose is a portrait of a family alone in the wilderness and one woman's strength to overcome an intense fear of the dark. Driven by her husband's indifference to her fear, Ruby makes the hazardous trip across the mountains to the village of her birth in the lowlands. There, with her grandmother, she comes to terms with her terror of the elements. Cast: Melita Jurisic, Chris Haywood, Rod Zuanic, Martyn Sanderson, Sheila Florance."
