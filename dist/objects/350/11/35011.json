        "This award winning film, based on Alan Marshall's heartwarming book, has transferred the setting from the Australian outback to a huge stud farm in the picturesque countryside of Moravia, a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the turn of the century. Adam, the energetic son of a horse trainer contracts polio and is hospitalised. He is still determined, however, to fulfil his constant dream of riding a horse, and he persuades his friends to help him in secret. Czech language with English sub-titles. Not suitable for children."
