        "This lighthearted comedy features Victor the cat who wanders around a block of flats in a Melbourne dockside suburb. Rose and William are a young couple sharing the upstairs flat. Rose is a jazz singer auditioning for an overseas tour with a famous jazz band. William draws pictures for children's storybooks. Rose wants William to go with her but William wants to stay put. They draw comfort from Victor and use him as a sounding board for their own side of what turns into an argument. However, the other two tenants want Victor to share their problems too."
