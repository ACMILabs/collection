        "A wondrous golden sword embedded in a large stone offers a tempting challenge to the strongest and bravest men in the kingdom - remove the sword and become the next king of England! When one small boy dares to accept the challenge, he unleashes a series of awesome miracles and incredible battles between the wizards in England. With glorious animation and delightful songs, this story is a Walt Disney classic."
