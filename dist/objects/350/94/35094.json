        "Episode of Series \"The Last dream: a special report by John Pilger\". The final episode of a three part series which explores aspects of Australia's history. This part shows how Australians fight mostly against people with whom they have no quarrel and who offer them no threat of invasion. From the Boxer Rebellion in China to the Boer War in Africa, to the disaster in Vietnam, Australians have paid a unique blood sacrifice to appease a great protector."
