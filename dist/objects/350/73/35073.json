        "Reviews the recent history of Mozambique, one of the last black African nations to gain independence. Documents South Africa's systematic attempts to destabilise its independent, socialist neighbour. Since 1980 rebel bandits, trained and financed by South Africa have imposed a reign of terror and destruction on Mozambique, its people and culture, foreign aid workers and the country's developing industries. Mozambique government spokesmen link peace to the end of apartheid in South Africa."
