        "The \"All together show\" is a delightful compilation of well known Play school songs and stories produced by seven well loved Play school presenters - Benita Collings, John Hambelin, Noni Hazelhurst, Jan Kinsbury, Alistair Smart, Don Spencer and John Waters. In \"At the zoo\" Play school visits Sydney's Taronga Zoo. Jan Kinsbury, Elaine Hudson and Don Spencer look at the monkeys, chimpanzees, giraffes, lions and seals, as well as a rabbit, a turtle, a baby kangaroo and the animals at the Zoo's Friendship farm."
