        "Peter Greenaway uses visual imagery to present this warm and humorous look at people and their bathrooms, revealing that the bathroom is used for far more than the daily duties of cleanliness and hygiene. We see people soaking, dozing, eating, reading, chatting and watching television in surroundings that range from plain porcelain to the \"Samuel Beckett Memorial Bathroom\"."
