        "In the Republic of Ireland, the \"Debs\" dance marks the end of school days, a romantic night to remember, which represents the transition from childhood to maturity. The reality, however, is often an expensive evening of heartbreak or alcoholic excess, culminating in the exhausted and dispirited youths trailing through the down streets of Dublin in their bedraggled finery. This look at teenage ritual is explosively portrayed by youngsters from the Dublin Youth Centre."
