        "This daring political comedy caused a huge controversy on release in China and was banned from export for two years. An inoffensive engineer comes under suspicion of industrial espionage when he sends a personal telegram which makes a cryptic mention of a Black Cannon. The Security Bureau finds some \"worrying\" data in his personal file, for example he was raised as a catholic. An investigation is launched and the resulting chaos provides the basis of a tragi-comedy narrative in which the Chinese ruling class is daringly satirised. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
