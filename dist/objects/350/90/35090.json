        "In May 1987, Edward Earl Johnson, a black American convicted of murdering a white town marshal, was executed. This haunting document follows the last day of his life. In the final days and hours of Johnson's life, the filmmakers observed the lawyer's desperate fight to save his client's life, and it becomes obvious how the prison doctors, chaplain, wardens and other inmates feel both about Johnson's guilt and about the death penalty itself."
