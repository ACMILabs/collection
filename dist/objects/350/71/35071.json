        "This film follows three pairs of Scottish teenagers thrown together on a gruelling two-day cross-country race to raise money for \"Sport Aid\". Stamina is not all that is put to the test in this frank, but often funny account of teenage relationships. The youngsters all come from the Key Youth Centre in East Kilbride, the sixth largest town in Scotland."
