        "This is the story of a distinguished American architect, Stanley Kracklite, who goes to Rome's Museum and Mausoleum of Western Art, to put on an exhibition in memory of his hero, the 18th century visionary, French architect, Etienne Louis Boullee. Kracklite becomes more and more preoccupied with his work and obsessed with his health, and in doing so alienates his wife. The visual style of the film aims for a continual background of architecture to indicate that man is persistently lost in its shadow."
