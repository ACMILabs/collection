        "The Olympic Experience sets out every facet of the modern Games, including the aestheticism and athleticism of the gymnasts; the daring and the courage of the equestrians; and the endurance of the cyclists and marathon runners. It captures all the emotions of winning, losing and most importantly, taking part. Narrated by Charlton Heston."
