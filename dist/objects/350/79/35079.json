        "Dorothy Stubbs is married to Queensland's \"Butcher of the Year\", Geoff Stubbs who is campaigning to be Prosperity Party Candidate for suburban Avon Heights. But Dorothy finds something missing in her life, especially when she attends a Sex Aids party and starts to fantasise about the male stripper there- Todd, (also horse-riding instructor, rock singer and petty thief). When Geoff invites the leader of the Prosperity Party to the monthly neighbourhood b-b-q at his house (with the theme \"Come as Your Favourite Fantasy\") and Dorothy secretly invites Todd's band, the dreams of both are destined to collide in an hilarious night of drunkenness and debauchery. Cast: Noni Hazlehurst, Graeme Blundell, John Jarratt, Barry Rugless."
