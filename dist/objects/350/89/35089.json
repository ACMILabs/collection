        "This documentary raised vital questions about a patient's right to choose whether to live or die, and about the role of the medical and legal profession. In 1973 Dax Cowart, a former air force pilot, was the victim of an explosion which left him blind, disfigured and suffering excruciating pain from severe burns. Despite persistent pleas to be allowed to die, Dax was kept alive. Now, leading a full life, he still maintains that he should have been allowed to die."
