        "A political documentary shot in Zimbabwe and South Africa, this commemorates the 10th anniversary of Steve Biko's death. It provides an insight into the complexities of the politics of the last decade, pivoting on the powerfully influential character of Biko. The film defines the aims of the Black Consciousness Movement of which Biko was an active and important leader, and explores its relevance from inception in the late 60s to the present day. It includes interviews with friends and medical and professional colleagues."
