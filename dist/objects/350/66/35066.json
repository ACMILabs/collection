        "Presenters from the Bodymatters Team separate facts from fiction and reveal how much the worldwide experts know about AIDS and its transmission. They explore the challenges ahead and the possibilities of finding a vaccine and a cure. The program dispels some of the myths surrounding the disease and uses giant models of the body to explain the action of the AIDS virus on other healthy cells."
