        "Early experiences within the home and the kindergarten provide the foundation for children to make a successful transition into the more structured learning environment of the school. This video aims to help parents prepare their children for school life. It starts at kindergarten and broadly examines how the pre-school child develops in a group situation and gives a general approach to their learning needs before starting school."
