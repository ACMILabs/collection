        "This witty, charming film follows a group of rich and bourgeois tourists on a journey along the Sepik River in the jungles of Papua New Guinea. The camera watches and assesses as the travellers meet the natives who live in the villages along the route. The two sides tell their own stories, revealing to the viewer the comparisons between them. Above all, \"Cannibal Tours\" affords us a glimpse of the real reasons why \"civilised\" people wish to encounter the \"primitive\". Rated: PG"
