        "An English woman is left alone following the death of her husband. She struggles to maintain the unusual garden he has created when they returned to England after many years of living in India. A brief encounter with an Indian woman from the neighbouring estate leads to the two women working together to bring the garden to its full glory. Even though they are from vastly different cultural and social backgrounds, a friendship gradually forms. Along the way, the film examines the institution of marriage and the problems of bereavement and loneliness. Stars Deborah Kerr and Madhur Jaffrey Rated: G"
