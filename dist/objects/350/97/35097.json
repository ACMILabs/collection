        "Eventing is a test of all round horse riding skills in a partnership that comes alive galloping and jumping across country. This video shows the drama of the relationship of the top riders (Mark Todd, Virginia Leng, and Bruce Davidson), their preparations of their horse, Badminton, the months of training, the danger, the frustration and the World Championships. Magnificent slow motion sequences capture the Championships at Gawler, South Australia."
