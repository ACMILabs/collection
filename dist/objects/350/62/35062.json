        "Cathy was a shy, awkward nine year old with a crush on her school teacher, Mr. Wright. Ten years later, as an attractive nineteen year old, Cathy meets him again at her cousin's birthday party. He develops an interest in her and her memories of him are stirred. Through her romantic childhood eyes, she relives school days. As the night progresses, however, she faces the reality of her teacher and the deceptions wrought by both passion and memory."
