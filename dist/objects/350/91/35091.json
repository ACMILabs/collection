        "This is set in Fremantle, Western Australia during the build-up to the America's Cup Yacht Race and the controversy surrounding the visit of US nuclear warships. It is about human relationships and international issues, the threat of nuclear war and people's attitudes to the future. The film blends scenes of fact and fiction to portray the story of a family in conflict and one woman's growing awareness about the choices she must make."
