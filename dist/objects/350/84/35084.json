        "Miscarriage is an extremely common event but for many women it is an unexpected shock from which they may take many years to recover. The sense of failure and feelings of guilt often experienced after a miscarriage can have devastating and influential roles on lives and marriages. This film, co-written by G.P. Dr. Anne McPherson, and sociologist, Ann Oakley, sets out to de-mystify miscarriage through the experiences of women who have had one."
