        "Episode of Series \"The Last dream: a special report by John Pilger\". Part two of John Pilger's personal view of Australian history and identity. This part is about the past catching up with the present. Behind the Bicentennial ballyhoo, the original Australians are treated as badly as many blacks in South Africa; and, for an increasing number of whites, the old egalitarian ways no longer have a place in a media conscious \"lucky country\" which now produces fine wines, films and thousands of overnight millionaires whilst many of its children are living in poverty."
