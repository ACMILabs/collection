        "Celebrate the career of pioneering avant-garde artists Arthur and Corinne Cantrill."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Arthur and Corinne Cantrill have been making films together for over fifty years. As pioneering avant-garde filmmakers, they have worked with unwavering passion and focus, creating a body of work that remains intriguing, authentic and utterly original.  ACMI's exhibition 'Arthur and Corinne Cantrill: Light Years' celebrated the remarkable career of these singular Australian artists.  The Cantrill's first films were documentaries on the creative play of children, but they rapidly developed their own independent, experimental practice. Their work ranges across styles and subject matter - from the 'Expanded Cinema' performances of the 1970s to landscape studies and experiments in colour printing, which explored their fascination with visual perception and the nature of time in cinema."
