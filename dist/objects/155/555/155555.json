        "The Valcich\u2019s fell in love with Tolmie, in north-eastern Victoria, the moment they saw it \u2013 12 years on, they are still building their dream home on their block of paradise. Little by little they have assembled a unique and sustainable home using timber and stone from their land and a multitude of reclaimed materials. These gentle souls tell us a little bit about what Tolmie means to them and how they have been able to contribute to the community through the CFA and various social groups over the years."
