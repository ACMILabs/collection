        "When Glenn James' fellow soldiers returned from service in Vietnam, they told him they finally understood what it was like to be Indigenous - you get treated like rubbish. Vietnam soldiers were brought home under the cover of night and at best ignored. For James, this was nothing new. As he talks about the plight of others that he has committed his life to helping, James provides some insight into an indomitable spirit, and how he has focused his energy into creating positive change for others."
