        "Disney Animator Glen Keane and Producer Roy Conli presented a special Masterclass sharing their behind-the-scenes insights and love of the animation process. Glen Keane has been with the Walt Disney Studios for over 25 years and is best known for his character animations for feature films such as 'The Little Mermaid', 'Aladdin', 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Tarzan', and 'Tangled'. He reflects on the inspirations for some of his characters and expressing yourself through drawing. Roy Conli is the producer of the Disney feature animated film, 'Tangled', based on the story of Rapunzel. He explains the role of the producer and the line between creating a safe and fertile environment for artists and getting a film made on time and within budget."
