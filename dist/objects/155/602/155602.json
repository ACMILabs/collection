        "Prime Minister Menzies visited a number of Army hospitals during his trip to the Middle East in 1941 and we see nurses contributing to the war effort in the field. The fact that Sir Robert also filmed a camera being cranked reveals his fascination with the medium. He was deeply moved by the opportunity to address the troops and was introduced to the official party by Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander of AIF. Source:  Australian Screen Online"
