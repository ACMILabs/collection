    "description": [
        "The story of Annette Kellerman (1887-1975), the international swimming, vaudeville and silent screen star whose life story inspired the 1952 MGM classic 'Million-Dollar Mermaid' (starring Esther Williams) featuring lavish Busby Berkeley scenes. Kellerman conquered rickets as a child by learning to swim and later became a champion swimmer, and star of vaudeville and silent cinema. Although she never made a feature film in Australia, she became a major Hollywood star in epics such as 'Daughter of the Gods' (1916) - a highly successful extravaganza that helped to make her a legend internationally as \"The Diving Venus\". As a long distance swimmer, diving sensation and underwater ballet performer, she was unrivalled. Her innovative underwater ballet act inspired the sport of synchronised swimming, and had a crucial role in the evolution of women's swimwear. She also wrote a series of books on health, beauty and physical fitness, pioneering a wholesome philosophy that was a precursor to many modern health movements. Along the way, Kellerman helped forge a new identity and sense of possibility for women around the world.   Source:  Ronin Films"
