        "Living on the land requires innovation and imagination these days. Three dynamic operators from the Mansfield Shire, in north-eastern Victoria, talk about the various challenges and rewards of working in the region. From the high-tech, computer controlled Murphy Fresh hydroponic tomato farm, to the glorious grounds of Kinloch Winery and the generations-old Delatite Station: these modern day \u201cfarmers\u201d reflect on their great fortune at being able to run their operations in such a rich and diverse community."
