        "A diverse cross-section of the \u201cJammo\u201d community tell us why they\u2019ve chosen this particular slice of heaven to call home. The post-mistress, the erstwhile town photographer, the caravan park operator and a handful of other locals, explain how they came to live in Jamieson (located in north-eastern Victoria) and how the peace, quiet and stunning natural beauty have convinced them there is really no better place to live. The rustling of the wind in the trees, native bird calls and tinkling waterways contribute a natural soundtrack which helps evoke this unique place."
