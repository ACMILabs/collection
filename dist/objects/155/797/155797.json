        "Jeff Lindsay, author and creator of our favourite serial killer 'Dexter', is joined in conversation with Professor Sue Turnbull, as they explore the renaissance of macabre fairytales in popular culture.  Jeff Lindsay and Sue Turnbull touch on many of the themes covered in the 'Fairytales Re-imagined' symposium, providing a fascinatingly insightful discussion centred around the development of fairy tale motifs in popular culture. In this web excerpt, Lindsay focuses on cannibalism, the theme of his most recent installment 'Dexter is delicious'. He explores it's origins in fairy tales and the proliferation of cannibalism through online forums."
