        "With a vibrant sense of humour, Wes Bailey recounts his various postings as a signaller during World War II. Long hot days of being eaten alive by mozzies as well as the expected pleasures of fruit and vegetables have nothing on the most significant posting of Bailey's career, as husband to fellow signaller Phil Bailey."
