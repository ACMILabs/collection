    "description": [
        "A cinema can be much more than a place to see movies, as this story of the old Mansfield Cinema, and its modern counterpart \u2013 the totally digital Mansfield Armchair Cinema \u2013 explores. When the old Mansfield Cinema closed down, the town lost its cultural centre. Years on, it took the brainwave of a local accountant and a lot of community support, to resurrect cinema in Mansfield, located in north-eastern Victoria. Building from strength to strength, Armchair Cinema is unique in that it was the first totally digital cinema in Victoria and it is almost exclusively run by teenagers from the local high school."
