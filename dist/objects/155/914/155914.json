    "description": [
        "A year after he arrived in Australia in 1952, Giorgio Mangiamele began making an ambitious, hard-hitting feature film based on the experiences of his fellow migrants. The film was 'Il Contratto' (or 'The Contract'). Influenced by Italian neorealist classics like 'Bicycle Thieves' (1948), it was a feature film very different to those made in Australia before. Giorgio made his most impactful films on themes of isolation, loneliness, racism and the claustrophobia felt by many of Australia\u2019s Italian migrants. But after making five films on this subject, in 1963 decided to tackle broader topics to consolidate his reputation as a film artist and to help rebuild a viable Australian feature film industry which at that time was virtually non-existent. Giorgio made his most notable films when the very idea of a film artist working in Australia was in its infancy. Source: Graham Shirley."
