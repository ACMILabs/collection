        "Harold Brown reflects fondly on his time in the army. Joining the artillery division in 1942, he was posted to Bougainville, where disease was more of a threat to the soldiers than the Japanese. Despite longing to be back home with his newborn son, Brown could not have wished to be with a better crew."
