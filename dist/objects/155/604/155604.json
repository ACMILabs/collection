        "Sir Robert Menzies captures the atmosphere of London during The Blitz in 1941. Footage is shown of the West End including bombed buildings and empty street scenes. The way Menzies slowly pans up and down damaged buildings using his silent colour home movie camera shows his instinctive eye to record history. Source: Australian Screen Online"
