        "Born in Ascot Vale, Jack Jones was only fifteen when Menzies declared war so he had to wait till 1942 before he could sign up. Put through extensive training he was posted in New Guinea and, later, Bougainville, where they had to wait for four months after the war ended to be brought home. While some of his colleagues went 'troppo', Jones coped by seeing his time in the war as a job."
