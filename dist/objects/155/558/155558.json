        "The spirit of volunteerism is alive and well in Jamieson, in north-eastern Victoria, where a small group of retirees have painstakingly transformed an overgrown eyesore into a beautiful recreational park the whole town can enjoy. Once an inaccessible, snake-ridden wilderness, this patch of land between the Goulburn and Jamieson rivers (not a true island) has had a storied history. Although subject to a few set backs after recent flooding, this gang of ex-farmers explain how it was with sheer hard work that they were able to turn around the fortunes of the Island and restore it to the local community."
