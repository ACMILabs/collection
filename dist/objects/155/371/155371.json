    "description": [
        "An engaging and respectful insight into Aboriginal people\u2019s culture and their interaction with the filmmaking process, made in 1917 composed of material filmed by William Jackson. 'Chez Les Sauvages Australiens' (In Native Australia or, literally, 'At Home with the Wild Australians') presents a series of short sequences separated by French language intertitles. This demonstration film of Aboriginal cultural practices in north-west Western Australia includes a large group of young men performing a processional dance, a small group demonstrating fire-making, imagery of traditional body scarring and a demonstration of watercraft. In the final scene a tall Aboriginal man gracefully climbs a high cliff to the site of a sea eagle\u2019s nest. He reaches into the nest and holds up two little chicks to the camera."
