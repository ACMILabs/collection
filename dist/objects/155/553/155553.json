        "Mansfield, in north-eastern Victoria, is home to groundbreaking services for Autistic children and their families. With a history dating back to the 1960s, when pioneering Doctor Joan Curtis held the first Family Camps for children with Autism, Mansfield has been uniquely engaged with their Autistic community. Now boasting a world-leading set of services, 'Embracing Difference' explores the variety of ways Mansfield empowers people in the community with Autism to live full, satisfying and independent lives."
