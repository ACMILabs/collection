    ], 
    "description": [
        "'Shaun Gladwell: Stereo Sequences' is the first in the 'New Horizons' series of ACMI commissions. Gladwell uses filmic devices such as slow-motion and long pans to capture both tightly choreographed and improvised performances by breakdancers, skateboarders and BMX bike riders in a combination of rural and city settings. The resulting works, which he describes as \"performative landscapes\" are both rhythmic and poetic - distorting speed, gravity, space and time; exploring visual and spatial paradoxes. He discusses his art practice and his collaboration with other performers and artists for this exhibition. Other interviews include; Sarah Tutton (ACMI curator), Josh Raymond (Gladwell producer) Vivienne Wong (Australian Ballet) and Lamaroc (street dancer)."
