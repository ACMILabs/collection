        "Rolf Harris is a charismatic Australian musician, singer, composer, recording artist, painter and TV personality, best known for popular and amusing songs such as 'Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport' and 'Jake the Peg'. Rolf has been been credited with the invention of a unique musical instrument called the wobble board, a rhythmic percussion instrument which features in many of his songs. He has had a long career in the UK hosting quiz shows and numerous children's programs. He also featured in the BBC-created TV show 'Animal Hospital' from 1994 until 2004, which focused on animal welfare stories from RSPCA hospitals. Rolf has also presented various art programs and at the age of 80 still continues to delight and amuse his audiences \u2013 his performance at the 2010 Glastonbury Festival in the UK is an example of his enduring popularity."
