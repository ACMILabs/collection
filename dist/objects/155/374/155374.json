    "description": [
        "For the first time in 200 years of white domination, Aboriginal people confronted the government at a national level \u2013 and in the words of poet, author and campaigner for Indigenous land rights Roberta \"Bobbi\" Sykes, achieved \"a political victory\". Framed within an international human rights context, 'Ningla A-Na' (Hungry for Land) uses television news coverage of the clash between  protesters and police at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in 1972 to great effect, showing how the event was portrayed both nationally and internationally. Interviews with Dr Fred Hollows, Shirley Smith (Mum Shirl), Bob Maza, Carol Johnson and Paul Coe contextualise the issues advocated by the Black movement. This film gives voice to the most talented and effective Indigenous activists in the country at the time. Source:  Australian Screen"
