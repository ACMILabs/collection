    "description": [
        "George Derham was called up to serve for Australia on the 4/4/44. He joined the Australian Navy and recalls his time there, of fitting in and standing out. Collecting Australian prisoners of war in Japan, two images affected Derham greatly - that of Tokyo after the extensive firebombing by the US, and the emaciated state of the prisoners of war. Despite this, Derham sees military life as a valuable part of his development and works hard to assist returned soldiers and their families."
