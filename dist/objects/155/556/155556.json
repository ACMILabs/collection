        "The Tolmie Sports is a celebration of community and High Country Heritage. A yearly event, it draws people from far and wide to the tiny town of Tolmie in north-eastern Victoria, to revel in events such as the Wood Chop, Equestrian Sports, and the epic and highly elaborate Three Man Race. \"Old-Timers\" Mick, Don and Sheila reflect on the history of the event, and some of its more colourful days. 2011 marked the 125th anniversary of the sports, and Tolmie Sports Committee Vice President explains some of the planning that goes into an event of its kind."
