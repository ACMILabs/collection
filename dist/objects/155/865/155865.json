        "The theme of 2011 MA|A (National Architecture Week) is \u201chome\u201d, in terms of architecture and the city what could this mean? Helen Gibson wrote, almost 10 years ago, that she thought the problem with urban planning and design in Australia was that it did not engage with the people who are indented to live in these, proposed, spaces.  In what ways does the form of the city shape our experience of home? What is home _ are we referring to the central city of Melbourne or the house where we live? Perhaps both - the two being intertwined and interconnected, what shapes and forms will Melbourne take? -  will we continue to sprawl or densify? -  how else could we live?  How do you live? What do you want your home, at an architectural and urban scale, to be like?  The following films tell different ways of how we have lived and do live in Melbourne and other places - perhaps we can take all our experiences and ideas to suggest how we might live. What shapes and forms do we want Melbourne [home] to be? And how do we want to live in theses spaces?"
