        "Filmed by Sir Robert Menzies during a trip through Europe in 1948, this footage shows the destruction that followed the Second World War in Berlin. In that year the Berlin Blockade occurred which was one of the first crises of the Cold War when the Soviet Union blocked rail and street access to West Berlin. This eventually led to the creation of separate republics, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Berlin). Source: Australian Screen Online"
