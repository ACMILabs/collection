        "Elli the Elephant is desperate, dateless and bored watching Backfire, a feature drama where a hunky fire fighting elephant saves a damsel in distress from a towering inferno and takes her off for a sunset romance. After noticing a box of matches and full waste paper bin, she has an idea. What follow is a comedy of errors when the hunky fire fighting elephants end up proving to be bungling fools and she ends up having to save the day."
