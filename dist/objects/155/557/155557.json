        "The town of Jamieson, in north-eastern Victoria, is fiercely proud and protective of its historical primary school. With a school population hanging on for dear life, they understand only too well how much a primary school is the beating heart of a small community. It is also a place where life-long friendships are forged, and the school community (past and present) come together here to reflect on the ties that bind them to Jamieson. Principal Genevieve Bolwell also discusses the exciting school programs, which will take the next generation into the future."
