        "Emit is a clock brought to life by the Voyager space probe's final plummet to the surface of a post-apocalyptic, rubbish covered planet not disimilar to our own. Emit stopped at 11:55, as did the rest of the planet. Now he is ticking again, he sets out to find life and discover what makes it tick. But not everything is what it seems."
