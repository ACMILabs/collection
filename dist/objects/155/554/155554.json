        "Tolmie is a small town in north-eastern Victoria with a surprisingly rich and varied social life. A town with no shops, cafes or main drag to speak of, Tolmie boasts over a dozen clubs, groups and community groups, all of whom came together one night tell us what makes Tolmie tick. Centering around the Pub and the community-restored Mechanic\u2019s Hall, everyone from the 'Secret Bikers Stuff' group, to the 'Unfinished Craft Object' (UFO for short) club, gather to share the secrets of their resourcefulness, irreverent sense of humour and collaborative spirit."
