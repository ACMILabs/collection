        "'Simon Townsend's Wonder World' was a multi-award winning Australian children's television show hosted by journalist Simon Townsend between 1979 -1986 and screened on the Ten Network."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Each episode of 'Simon Townsend's Wonder World' featured an introduction by Townsend, who was always accompanied by his bloodhound Woodrow. Four individual magazine style stories would then be presented by various reporters, one of whom was Jonathan Coleman. This is a short compilation of stories that were hand picked as the best by Coleman (now a radio and sometimes TV presenter). The stories covered many subjects and were not scripted, relying upon the ingenuity of the reporter and a two-man crew. Every show also contained a viewer segment and a music segment - often produced by the program itself. For instance, 'Simon Townsend's Wonder World' made the first ever music video to feature Australian band INXS. Simon Townsend would always end every show with his signature farewell  \"And remember, the world really is wonderful!\""
