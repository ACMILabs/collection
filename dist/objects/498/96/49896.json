        "Alison MacLean's highly acclaimed first film, shot in stark black-and-white, is a wordless experimental horror/romance short about a women who gets much more than she bargains for when she dislodges a rope of hair from the bowels of her kitchen sink. A darkly humorous, tender and disturbing love story about abject female desire that evokes elements of the Frankenstein story. The film competed at Cannes in 1989 and won eight international awards."
