        "Basketball star and 'C' student Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) surprises everyone except himself when his amazing writing abilities and basketball prowess attract the attention of a Manhattan private school. Outside his old school in the Bronx lives a reclusive old man (Sean Connery) who Jamal meets when, on a dare from his friends, enters the building and is frightened when he encounters the man the students call, \"The Window\". In his haste to escape he leaves behind his backpack, only to have it returned the following day with comments written in his personal writing notebooks. Jamal returns to the apartment and slowly wins the trust of the old man who convinces him to attend the new school and learn all he can about himself. Inspired by his new mentor, he agrees, and it is at this school that he discovers that the short-tempered old man who has been helping him improve his writing is actually Pulitzer prize winning author William Forrester, a man famous for only ever writing one book. Cast also includes F. Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin, Busta Rhymes and a special cameo appearance by Matt Damon."
