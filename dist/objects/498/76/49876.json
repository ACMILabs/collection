        "This movie serial sees for the first time on screen Dick Tracy (Ralph Byrd) and his G-men battling against urban evil. This time it's the club-footed mastermind know as The Lame One who plots a war on the G-men. Using his stratospheric aircraft he terrorises the city with his high-frequency sound wave weapon. At the same time, The Spider Gang kidnap Tracy's brother, Gordon. Part two contains episodes eight to thirteen."
