        "Watkin's portrayal of the life and work of the pioneer Norwegian expressionist painter and graphic artist Edvard Munch (1863-1908), combines quasi-documentary and period drama, incorporating meticulous detail to place the artist in a social and historical context. The use of non-professional actors, often communicating directly with the audience by glances into the camera, adds to the immediacy of the dialogue which was written in collaboration with the cast. The resulting film takes the viewer to the heart of the artistic temperament and to the very core of the creative process. In Norwegian and German dialogue with English narration and subtitles. Cast includes Geir Westby and Gro Fraas."
