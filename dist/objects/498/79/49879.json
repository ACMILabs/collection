        "Volume one contains chapters 1 to 6. Based on the successful radio serial of the same name, Britt Reid (Gordon Jones) as the Green Hornet and his crime fighting partner, Kato (Keye Luke) battle against organised crime's king-pins. The Green Hornet is the direct descendant of the famous masked crime fighter, The Lone Ranger. He's the Lone Ranger's grand nephew. This movie serial used the same principal characters that featured in the radio play, as well as the famous Hornet musical signature (Flight of the Bumble Bee) and gadgetry such as a gas gun to incapacitate criminals. Also used is the voice of Al Hodge, the radio Green Hornet, which was heard when crusading publisher Britt Reid spoke from behind the Hornet mask. Also stars Anne Nagel as Lenore Case."
