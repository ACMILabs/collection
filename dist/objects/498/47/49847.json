        "A horror film featuring Catherine Deneuve in the role of a sexually repressed Belgian manicurist, living in 60's London who becomes increasingly withdrawn when her sister Helen (Yvonne Furneaux) travels to Italy for a holiday. Avoiding contact with the outside world, Carol confines herself to the apartment, where her days and nights are dominated by sexual fantasies and nightmares. As her delusions escalate, she gradually descends into a world of sexual hallucinations that provoke a series of macabre acts. Original screenplay by Roman Polanski and Gerard Brach. Cinematography, Gilbert Taylor. Editing, Alastair McIntyre. Music, Chico Hamilton. (Awards: Silver Bear 1965 Berlin Film Festival)"
