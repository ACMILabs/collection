        "Based on a true story, \"Welcome To Sarajevo\" is a rare example of the war genre, one prepared to indict the western world for its refusal to aid the victims of a modern warzone like the former Yugoslavia. British journalist Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane) begins a series of reports on a Muslim orphanage where dozens of children are trapped without food or medical support. His reports become pleas for help and finally scathing editorials before he takes matters into his own hands. Director Michael Winterbottom is careful not to paint Henderson as a hero, but rather the most ordinary of people forced to react against a heartless international community. With a cast that also includes Kerry Fox, Woody Harrelson and Marisa Tomei, \"Welcome To Sarajevo\" is a different approach to the war genre - one in which no one involved is morally black or white."
