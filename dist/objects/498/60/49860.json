        "The brilliance and legacy left by Renaissance man, Leonardo Da Vinci, as thinker, sculptor, painter, engineer and inventor, lives on today. One of the most important figures in modern history, Da Vinci not only achieved legendary status within his own lifetime with his work, but was also to influence the future of both science and art. Freed from the constraints of Medieval culture, Da Vinci had free reign to explore and develop his ideas. He had very intense interests with solutions that challenged the scientific notions of the day in anatomy, engineering and architecture. Whilst reviving the nature of 'true scientific discovery', he opened up 'observation' as a method of scientific and medical discovery. A cross-disciplinary figure of epic proportions, whose legacy has seeped into the public consciousness and includes such inventions as: the clock (with arms for minutes and hours), camera obscura, the system of gears, cogs and weights to name only a few. Aided by 3-D graphics, this documentary explores the complexities and insights that shaped Da Vinci's work."
