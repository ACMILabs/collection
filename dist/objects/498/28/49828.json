        "When Professor Victor Kuppelweiser wishes to test his cryogenic experiments for the first time on human beings he has two willing volunteers. Both scientists, a mis-matched pair Albert Starski and Maximilian Paradys (Jerzy Stuhr, Olgierd Lukaszewicz), are hoping for historical recognition and fame. But the experiment goes wrong and our heroes find themselves awoken (53 years later) by a post-nuclear society containing only women - who hate men. This slapstick comedy rather than implying any feminist critique pokes fun at totalitarianism, ironic in that the first-time director, Juliusz Machulski, made this film using state money in a communist country under martial law. A hilarious film that pokes fun at the values of the day by talking about tomorrow and borrows much of its stylings from films such as \"Barbarella\", \"The Sleeper\" and thematically from films like \"1984\" and \"Fahrenheit 451.\""
