        "Frances Gifford stars in the title role as Nyoka, a young woman living in the African jungle with her physician father. When the doctor's evil twin murders him and assumes his identity in order to search for a fortune in diamonds hidden nearby, Nyoka and two pilots must escape the plans of the sinister sibling and his henchmen. Cast includes Tom Neal and Trevor Bardette. Originally screened in cinemas as 20 minute serials, volume one contains the first seven episodes. The story is loosely based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' story, \"The Land of hidden men\" published in 1929.
