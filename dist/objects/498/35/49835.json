        "The popularity of teenage slasher films in the 1980's and 1990's including 'I Know What You Did Last Summer ', 'Halloween' and the 'Scream' trilogy lead to this parody film directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. Ray, Brenda, Buffy, Shorty, Ray, Greg, Bobby and Cindy are on the run from a serial killer, seeking his revenge after the kids run him over following their school prom. Also causing problems for the ditzy teens are a nosy reporter Gail Hailstorm, assistant police officer Doofy and high school principal, Squiggly. Incidentally, 'Scary Movie' was the working title for the original 'Scream' film. Cast includes Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Shannon Elizabeth, Regina Hall, Lochlyn Munro, Anna Faris and Jon Abrahams."
