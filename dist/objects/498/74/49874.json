Aided by adventurer Ted Arnold, hunter Nat Coleman, his assistant Omar and Arabian princess Rhoda, Captain Africa battles wild animals, the usurper's army and a pair of white adventurers. For some reason this movie serial was banned in Finland. Cast includes John Hart, Rick Vallin, Ben Welden, June Howard, Bud Osborne, Paul Marion, Lee Roberts."
