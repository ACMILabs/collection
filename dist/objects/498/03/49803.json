        "After the death of his father, Luo returns home to his village to help his mother with funeral arrangements. On his arrival he learns of his mother's wish for a traditional burial for his father - something that has not been performed in the village for hundred of years. It is a costly and exhausting ceremony and Luo does not understand why they can't have a simple funeral. Told in flashbacks, \"The Road home\" recounts Luo's parents romance and how they captivated the village with their undying love for one other. Directed by Zhang Yimou (\"Raise the Red Lantern\", \"Not One Less\") and starring Zhang Ziyi (\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\"), this is a beautiful tale of love and undeniable passion."
