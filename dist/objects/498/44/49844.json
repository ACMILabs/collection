        "The California music scene is evocatively captured in Alison Anders second collaboration with Kurt Voss (they worked together on a film about punk music in LA), using real life musicians Martin Kemp, John Taylor and John Doe. Gwen (Jade Gordon) is a PA to Liz (Ally Sheedy), the slightly neurotic production designer. Gwen is a calculating career woman and aspiring singer, recently fired from Liz's actress friend, Eva (Patricia Arquette), who caught Gwen stealing her contraception in an effort to get \"closer\" to her husband, Clive (John Taylor), an ex rocker. Clive is part of a group of three ageing Brit rockers - Nick, Clive and Jonesy, disgruntled to find they cannot cut another record deal unless Nick (Michael Des Barres), agrees to sleep with potential investor Jane (Beverly D'Angelo). Add to this mix an illegitimate son, infidelity, a pregnancy and coveting your brothers wife, yet somehow the elements hang together through the characters varying relationship to rock music. Written by Allison Anders and Kurt Voss."
