        "Guillermo Del Toro's feature debut takes classic vampire mythology into unusual and unexpected terrain. The Cronos of the film's title is an ornate and intricate beetle shaped device which houses an ancient slug like insect, which once attached to its host, has similar side effects to vampirism. Designed by a 16th century alchemist, the thought to be lost contraption resurfaces in contemporary Mexico and falls into the hands of antique dealer, Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi). The old man, fascinated by its ornate and mysterious beauty, decides to hold on to it, oblivious to its destructive power. However, he is not the only one aware of the Cronos' existence and soon finds himself being pursued by a dying millionaire (Claudio Brook) and his violent henchman (Ron Perlman). Del Toro's screenplay takes a sombre and quirky approach to the themes of death and immortality but at it's heart rests a touching portrait of Jesus's relationship with his mostly silent but protective granddaughter, Aurora (Tamara Shanath). In Spanish and English with English subtitles."
