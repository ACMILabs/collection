        "Filmmaker Greg Grainger journeys for 4,000 km around Western Turkey on a motorcycle. Beginning in Istanbul, home of the more liberal Turkish Muslims, we visit famous tourist venues such as the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and the magnificent Grant Bazaar. Travelling along the coast, we see the increasing numbers of young Australians making their pilgrimage to Gallipoli at Anzac Cove. Remains of Roman civilization and architecture are evident throughout Western Turkey and Greg's group rides in a hot air balloon over the strange cave houses of Cappadocia. Traditional farming and carpet making in rural areas are shown as happily co-existing with the more modern tourist attractions of restaurants, belly dancing and shopping in the cities."
