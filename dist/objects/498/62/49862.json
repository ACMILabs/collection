Episode 2: Home is Where the Landmines Are - Michael hitches to Zimbabwe and is arrested for investigating the lives of street kids before heading to Mozambique where he meets a 5 year old landmine victim and watches her learn to walk again. Episode 3: Slobs in Paradise - Michael travels Lake Malawi and Dar es Salam, investigates the heroin trade in Tanzania and climbs Mount Kilimanjaro. Episode 4: Delinquents, Tribes and Millionaires - Michael searches for the Masai warriors and meets some teenage millionaires in Kenya before sailing up the Nile to Cairo."
