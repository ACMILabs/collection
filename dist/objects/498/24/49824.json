        "A deeply moving film by the renowned Polish director, Andrzej Wajda (Man of marbles, Korczak, Danton) of one man's life seemingly falling apart around him. Jerzy Michalowski (Zbigniew Zapasiewicz), a well-known Polish international journalist unwittingly upsets the Polish authorities with his knowledge and political commentary on world affairs, and Polish affairs, on national television. Upon returning from an assignment abroad, Jerzy suddenly finds his privileges have been cut back, his next course at the university cancelled and his next trip no longer necessary. At the same time as his career appears to be crumbling apart, Jerzy's wife has also decided to leave him for a younger colleague. Fundamentally a sympathetic character, the film follows Jerzy on his downward spiral as his whole world collapses in front of him. A story which subliminally hits out at the Polish system, but primarily a story of human relationships containing an interesting blend of drama, tragedy and humour. In Polish with English subtitles. Cast also includes Ewa Datkowska, Andrzej Seweryn, Krystyna Janda, Roman Wilhelmi. (Awards: Cannes Film Festival 1979; Polish Film Festival 1978)"
