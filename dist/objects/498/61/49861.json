        "Winner of the British Book Awards prestigious Author of the Year award in 1999, J.K. (Joanne Kathleen) Rowling, a single mother with a young daughter, is responsible for creating one of the most popular children's series in modern times. Her tales of young wizard Harry Potter, and his adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have been translated into 25 different languages. This documentary discusses where the idea for Harry came from and where it all began. Also includes interviews with childhood friends of the author, literary critics, bookstore owners and children, asking for their views on the Harry Potter phenomenon."
