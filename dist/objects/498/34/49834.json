        "In February 1947, a B-29 bomber nicknamed Kee Bird, became lost above the Arctic Circle while on a secret Cold War reconnaissance mission. After crash landing in northern Greenland, the crew was rescued, but the Kee Bird was left behind. Although nearly 4,000 B-29's were built in the 1940's, the Kee Bird was one of only a few such planes left in the world. Its historical significance and well-preserved condition attracted the attention of Darryl Greenamyer, an experienced salvage pilot. After surveying the plane and its location, Greenamyer decided to repair the Kee Bird and fly it back to the United States. This video details the harsh conditions, hard work and engineering expertise needed to repair and rescue the plane and was filmed over two summer expeditions capturing the joy and the heartache of a dedicated and determined team of men prepared to give their all to achieve Darryl Greenamyer's dream of resurrecting the B-29.
