        "Charles Darwin has been dubbed by many as the most important figure in the 20th Century. Due to the encouragement from fellow student John Henslow, Darwin joined the HMS Beagle as the ship's naturalist, surveying the voyage and recording data for a period of 5 years as the ship travelled the world including the Galapagos Islands. It is from here that Darwin's \"Origins of the Species\" was developed and written, although published 20 years later. This documentary details Darwin's reclusive lifestyle at his famous home in Kent, 'The Down House', and the partnership he had with wife Emma Wedgewood, also first cousin. The tragedy of his ill children possibly due to in-breeding, but more broadly how the intimate relationship with his family directed the path of his career. Regular visitors to 'The Down House' included Sir Charles Lyle and Sir Joseph Hooker. It was Lyle's work on geology - 'gradual but persistent change' - that proved a catalyst for Darwin's theory of evolution. Broadly discussed is how Darwin's theories were to affect a century of thought and religious debate and remind us in the advent of genetic engineering and cloning, how relevant Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism are in contemporary moral and intellectual debate."
