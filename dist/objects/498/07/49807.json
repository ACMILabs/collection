        "A story focusing on the youth-rebellion movement of 1968, revolving around Jesse (John Robb) a young Montrealer who edits an underground newspaper. He and his female companion are joined by David (Gary Rader) a young draft dodger from the United States. In the choices they make, the two rival philosophies of dissenting youth become evident: militant protest or communal retreat. The film includes some of the bloody rioting in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic Convention. Also seen and heard in the film is anti-war and civil rights spokesman Abbie Hoffman. Other members of the Intellectual Left making brief appearances in Prologue include Allen Ginsberg, Jean Genet, John Kenneth Galbraith, and William S. Burroughs. Cast includes: Elaine Malus, Christopher Cordeaux, Peter Cullen, Frank Edwards, Henry Gamer, Robert Girolami and Victor Knight. Script, Sherwood Forest. Editing, Christopher Cordeaux. Music, Bill Brooks, Michael Malus and The Ventures. (Awards: London, Toronto, Colombo)"
