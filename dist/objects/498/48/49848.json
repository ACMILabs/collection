        "A tragic beauty and the beast love story set in a French village with a schoolmistress, a loner, finding herself drawn to an ex-army butcher she suspects of being a child-murderer. This 'human beast' is viewed with sympathy - he is deeply aware of the destructiveness within him. Helene is unable to give Popaul the love that he requires if the beast is to be cured. The controlled grace and fluency of Chabrol's mise-en-scene concentrates everything on the relationship set in an autumnal provincial atmosphere. Cast includes Stephane Audran, Jean Yanne and Antonio Passalia. In French with English subtitles."
