        "An Australian/Canadian co-production, based on the best selling children and young adult series 'The Saddle Club' and 'Pine Hollow' written by Bonnie Bryant. Studious Lisa (Lara Jean Marshall), tomboy Stevie (Sophie Bennett) and horse-crazy Carole (Keenan Macwilliam) are the Saddle Club, best friends united by their love for horses and their willingness to help each other. Carole is offered the opportunity to be part of a work study program with the local vet, and is thrilled. Not only is being a vet her dream, but she can work with cute animals all day. Things don't turn out as well as she plans and her confidence in her abilities drops. When spoilt rich-girl Veronica di Angelo's negligence results in her horse Cobalt being put down, Carole is devastated and quits riding completely. Lisa and Stevie must work together to change their friends' mind. They've already lost Cobalt, they don't want to lose Carole too. Between riding, school and the dramas of pre-adolescence, the impending birth of a foal makes sure life at Pine Hollow is as chaotic as usual. Also available on DVD [318858]."
