        "This extraordinary documentary charts the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazis, through the chaos of the Weimar republic. Rather than using voice-over narration the film relies on newsreels, home movie footage, and extracts from musicals and documentaries of the period to describe the state of German society during turbulent times. In doing so it reveals the disintegration of the old Germany and the advancement of the new, as represented by young Adolf Hitler and his peers. The film is broken into chapters, each dedicated to a different year during this period. Written by Lutz Becker and Philippe Mora. In German with English subtitles and captions."
