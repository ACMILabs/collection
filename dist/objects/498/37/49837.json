        "Based on the memories of a real-life Pony Express rider, Nicholas Wilson, and adapted from the book \"The White Indian Boy\" by Perry Driggs and Nicholas Wilson, \"Wind river\" is the true story of a young white settler (Blake Heron) who, for six years, is accepted into the Shoshone Indian tribe, living and learning the ways of the Shoshone under the tribal elders. Set in 1855 during the harsh pioneering days of the American West when battles raged between the white settlers and the Native American indians for control of the western plains this film explores the two cultures and provides an insight into the struggle which existed within the various factions of the Indian Nation as they faced the threat of invasion. Chief Washakie (Russell Means) believes in the ways of peace and it is his gentle but firm leadership of his Shoshone tribe that has a permanent influence on Nicholas and his relationship between the two cultures. However, when a gang of settlers finally come looking for the \"yellow-haired\" boy, Nicholas is faced with one of the toughest decisions in his life - to return to his real family, or stay with the Indian family he has grown to love. Cast also includes A Martinez, Karen Allen, Patricia Van Ingen, Tim Griffin, Devon Gummersall, Wes Studi."
