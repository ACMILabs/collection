        "The ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia is an unlikely subject matter for this British black comedy which uses the Balkan war as a catalyst to explore a contemporary London bursting with racial discord. The films interconnected stories are set off by a brawl between a Serbian (Dado Jehan) and a Croatian (Faruk Pruti) on a busy downtown London bus, an apt and humorous metaphor for the worsening situation. Meanwhile a headmaster's football hooligan son, inadvertently lands right in the middle of the war, a Tory MP's daughter (Charlotte Coleman) falls in love with one of her patients and a BBC war correspondent suffering from 'Bosnia syndrome' tries to amputate his leg. Cast also includes Charles Kay, Julian Firth, Edward Jewsebury, Edin Dzandzanovic, Gilbert Martin. (Award: 1999 Winner-Un Certain Regard, Jasmin Disdar)"
