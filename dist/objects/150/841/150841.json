    "description": [
        "One of the earliest works made by Callas using a Fairlight Computer Video Instrument (CVI) processor, a pioneering compositing and special effects system he utilised regularly from the mid 1980s to early 1990s. 'Double Trouble' is the first video made by Callas for a large exterior street screen form (in Tokyo). The image appears as though spliced into vertical halves, an array of imagery and characters appearing in double on either side of the division, and moving with alternating motion upwards and downwards. This two-frame animation technique creates two images from one checkerboard stencil which are then reversed, or asynchronously 'mirrored', producing an apt metaphor for cultural differences in 'body language' between East and West.
