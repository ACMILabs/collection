    "description": [
        "Alfred Cort Haddon was an English anthropologist who led a Cambridge University expedition to the Torres Strait Islands in 1898. His pioneering use of a 35mm camera on this expedition - the first known use of film as an ethnographic record - helped to establish the moving image as a primary tool for anthropological study.  This historic footage is almost certainly the first film ever made that shows indigenous Australian people. The fire-making techniques and dances captured in the footage are fascinating examples of the traditional practices encountered by the expedition."
