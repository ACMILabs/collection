In the 1960s Bear discovered a number of previously unknown metastable zirconium sulfate hydrates. Joy was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 1986 for services to science, particularly in the field of mineral chemistry. She is a fellow of both the Royal Australian Chemical Institute (RACI) and the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and in 1988 became the first woman to receive the Leighton Medal - the RACI's premier award."
