    "description": [
        "The most complex and multi-layered of Callas' CVI works, 'Bilderbuch' focuses on the geographic continent and turbulent political history of Europe. The primary image source of the work is a children's wartime pictorial scrapbook (or 'bilderbuch'). Callas has described 'Bilderbuch fur Ernst Will' as an 'electronic rendering of a form of proto-televisual iconomania', involving the collecting and collating of seemingly random images which, when seen together, reveal underlying narratives and belief systems.  Seen in this context, images from the child's scrapbook come together to create a startling picture of wartime Europe and its legacy.
