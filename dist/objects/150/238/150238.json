    "description": [
        "Made on a spare-time basis over four years with a cast and crew primarily of students and film enthusiasts. The style owes much to the French 'New Wave', and the story (about two photographers in Melbourne who dabble in pornography to eke out a living) has many references to French and American movies. The film was the first major narrative achievement in the upsurge of 16mm film activity outside of the established industry. Source : NLA Film Study Catalogue 1981."
