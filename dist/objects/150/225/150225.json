        "This second feature film from the McDonagh sisters is an emotional romance of an innocent young woman, Cherry Carson, forbidden to continue the relationship with the man she loves, Peter Lawton, because he is a son of her father\u2019s enemy. General notes: Interiors were shot at the McDonagh family home, Drummoyne House, Sydney and in the Burragorang Valley and the Bondi studios of Australasian Films. The surviving footage shows some nitrate damage and some scenes are missing. There are elegant art titles and the film has fine production details. Marie Lorraine\u2019s performance is subdued and sensitive as the young woman yearning for love but loyal to a fallen and criminal father. Costing 2000 pounds, the film was bought by Universal Pictures for British distribution as an Empire quota production."
