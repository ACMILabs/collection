        "Melbourne's film history began in 1896 with the filming of the Melbourne Cup by Maurice Sestier, the Lumiere Brothers' camera operator, and Australian Walter Barnett.  Explore Melbourne's earliest film records, from the Cup in 1896 through the beautifully evocative footage of life in Hawthorn in 1907, amateur footage recorded in the 1930s, up to the more experimental recordings of the late 1950s."
