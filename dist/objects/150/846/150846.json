    "description": [
        "'Neo-Geo' was produced by Callas during an artistic residency at PSI Studio in New York, 1988-89. It exposes the profound contradictions inherent in the twin gods of contemporary American culture \u2013 capitalism and democracy \u2013 by the intense layering of diverse visual cues and associative references drawn from popular culture, the entertainment industry, religion, warfare and technology. The effect is one of visual and aural overload, culminating with the screaming sound of falling bombs, guns and thunder, accompanied by images of war and death. A postmodern Babylon, America is portrayed here at bursting point.  Produced with the assistance of the Australian Film Commission.
