    "description": [
        "'Our Potential Allies' is an intuitive and ironic critique of Eurocentric belief-systems founded upon the dichotomy of self (the West) and the Other. Callas appears on the left monitor in black and white facial paint \u2013 the so-called 'mask of primitivism' \u2013 while compressed news imagery appears upon the right. Facial gestures are enacted by the artist seemingly in response to the voice-over (instructions issued by General Douglas MacArthur to American soldiers fighting in Papua New Guinea during the Second World War) or to imagery on the right monitor. Questions of intent \u2013 a constant theme throughout Callas' career \u2013 are thus raised in relation to the creation of apparently random meaning.
