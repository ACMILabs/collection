        "Family story of Chut the kangaroo and his trials and tribulations in a travelling circus. General notes: Despite the problems of filming the many bush animals appearing, the introductory 12 minute sequence has been described as 'extraordinarily beautiful' and 'one of Cinesound\u2019s best.' Popular in the US and Australia where it was voted best Australian film of 1936. Summary from Australian Film 1900-1977 / Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, 1981, p231."
