    "description": [
        "A hand clutches an oval stone which is drawn back and forth in tight circular motions, grinding pigment. Produced with a black and white half  inch reel-to-reel portapak video recorder (manufactured c1975). 'Singing Stone' demonstrates Callas' early experimentation with colouriser painting techniques. The effect is one of visual distortion in which pictorial surface and depth oscillate, creating a sense of dislocation and hallucination.
