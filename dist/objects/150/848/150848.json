        "'The double movement of displacement and circulation, loss and regeneration, constitutes a means of uncovering the disjunction between history and memory [in Latin America].' - Charles Merewether.  The cartographer's 'invention' of the world and the role of slavery in the process of the colonisation of South America form an 'anti-historical' reconstruction of 'Brazil'.  Produced in association with the Australian Film Commission. Notes reprinted courtesy of d/Lux Media Arts."
