    "description": [
        "'Pisco Sour' represents a shift beyond earlier works in its dense layering of subject-matter and imagery. Initiated in Australia and completed in Japan, the work draws upon the core imagery of a bullock dray, a male figure in silhouette, a Japanese mask and a bottle of Pisco Sour. These appear in varied permutations alongside other seemingly random images to form a series of telescopic views (screens within screens). Verbal narrative and textual statement create a sense of tension whilst suggesting that history and meaning are never fixed. The work presents something of a conundrum, its title a metaphoric recipe for the potential 'souring' of things.  Produced with the assistance of the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council.
