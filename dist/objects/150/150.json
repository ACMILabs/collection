        "A tape recording of a seminar at the Cinemedia Treasury Theatre with Ray Harryhausen sponsored by The Brisbane International Animation Festival. Ray Harryhausen is a much acclaimed cult figure and celebrated artist and has influenced large bodies of work in the film canon as a whole. His contributions to stop-motion animation have been the inspiration for an entire generation of animators and special effects artists. In 1992, Ray Harryhausen was awarded the Gordon E. Sawyer Academy Award for special achievement from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences. As the presenter of the award, Tom Hanks remarked, &quot;some say Citizen Kane is the greatest motion picture of all time, others say it's Casablanca, for me the greatest picture of all time is JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS.&quot; Ray is best known for his work with dinosaurs in ONE MILLION YEARS BC AND THE VALLEY OF GWANGI, the battling skeleton armies in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, and the Sinbad series, THE SEVENTH VOGAGE OF SINBAD, THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD and SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER. The seminar includes a presentation of his early puppet work, highlights from some of his feature films, display of animation models, pre-production drawings, Q &amp; A and autograph sessions."
