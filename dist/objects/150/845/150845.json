    "description": [
        "Created amidst Australia's 1988 Bicentenary celebrations, 'Night's High Noon' proposed a flipside to stereotyped notions of recent Australian history and identity. For Australia's Aboriginal peoples the Bicentenary represented 200 years of dispossession from their land, cultural destruction and racial prejudice. Representations of indigenous cultures allude to the appropriation and objectification of Aboriginal peoples, their artforms and traditions, in white Australian popular culture. Truth and Meaning are similarly problematised.  Produced with the assistance of the Australian Film Commission. Notes by Rachel Kent, reprinted courtesy of the author and d/Lux Media Arts."
