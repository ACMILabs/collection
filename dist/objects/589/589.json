        "Based on the transcript of an ABC radio interview, \"His Mother's Voice\" is a powerful animated work which asks us to bear witness to the emotional force of tragedy. A mother recounts the details of learning about her son's fatal shooting. We first hear her words while the images dramatise the events. We then listen to the words again as the animators focus our attention on her face, her moving lips, the boy's bedroom and the activities of the suburban street on which he lived. The effect is equally mesmerising and devastating."
