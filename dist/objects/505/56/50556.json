        "In a surreal industrial landscape populated by equally bizarre characters, the magical voice of celebrated singer Ivan Frost has the power to make people wish for death. In a remote village elsewhere, Alfonso Pellegrini, a shepherd with an astonishing musical talent, longs to leave his sheep and go in search of the fabulous sounds described in books. Being invited to play beside the remarkable singer, Alfonso is saddened to find himself thrust into the background, his precious violin broken from trying to compete for attention. Ivan's world is similarly turned upside down when he awakens to find his voice gone and a scar across his chest. Without his legendary voice to bewitch the masses and open doors for him, he is forced to confront the nightmarish reality of his situation - alone."
