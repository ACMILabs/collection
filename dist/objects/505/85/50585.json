        "Based on the BBC television miniseries \"The Six wives of Henry VIII\" this feature film version combines what was a very successful television series into an equally entertaining and well-received film. It has a quality of richness and power and yet at the same time offers a human, almost vulnerable, side to Henry as he desperately searches for a wife who can produce a son and heir to the throne of England. His life is continually surrounded by plots and conspiracies from those who have ulterior motives as to who Henry should marry. Donald Pleasence puts in an excellent performance as Thomas Cromwell and Keith Michell is truly magnificent as Henry VIII as he physically changes from a proud young man to a quite obese and gout-ridden lonely old man. The six wives are played equally as well by Frances Cuka (Catharine of Aragon), Charlotte Rampling (Anne Boleyn), Jane Asher (Jane Seymour), Jenny Bos (Anne of Cleves), Lynne Frederick (Catharine Howard) and Barbara Leigh-Hunt (Catharine Parr)."
