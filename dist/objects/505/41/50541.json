        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Australia: beyond the fatal shore [Widescreen]\". Art critic Robert Hughes reflects on his relationship to Australia, 35 years after leaving the country. Contemplative after his near fatal car accident, Hughes reflects fondly on his childhood in Australia with an appreciation that only came from questioning his mortality. Episode one explores the concept of the pleasure seeking Aussie and whether there is more to us than our pursuit of leisure. Sydney's annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras proves a focal point for the program which looks at beach culture, surf culture, the evolution of the wowser and the larrikin, censorship and homoeroticism in sport. Features interviews with Roy and H.G. (John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver), Dare Jennings and Bill Leeke. Includes footage of Norman Lindsay's residence in the Blue Mountains, surf beaches on the East Coast, Old Sydney Town and an X-rated film shoot. Written and presented by Robert Hughes."
