        "The adventures of Long John Silver (played by Robert Newton, reprising the role for a second time) loosely based on Robert Louis Stevenson's original story. Silver, a cantankerous drunk who seeks his fortune as a marauding pirate, offers to rescue the Governor's daughter who has been kidnapped by Captain Mendoza, an old foe of Long John's. Silver also rescues his friend Jim Hawkins, being held aboard Mendoza's ship. Despite his gruff exterior Silver nurses a soft spot for Jim, who joins him on several adventures, including one to Treasure Island in search of a hidden fortune. Lively and exciting children's entertainment, which features some stunning on-location work. Cast also includes Kit Taylor, Rod Taylor, Lloyd Berrell."
