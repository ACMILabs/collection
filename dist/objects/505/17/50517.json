    "description": [
        "This program looks at the important role the ocean and deserts of Western Australia have played in shaping Tim Winton's values and beliefs, and how the natural world continues to nourish his creativity as a writer. He stresses the place of landscape in his writing, and the important role nature plays as a counterbalance to the less attractive elements of modern civilisation. As we watch him fishing, he recounts his fascination with the monastic tradition and with individuals who are able to successfully survive alone and away from civilisation - an interesting comment in light of his 2001 novel, \"Dirt music\". The documentary includes scenes acted from his novel \"Cloudstreet\", and extracts from \"The Riders\", \"Shallows\" and \"Scission\", read both by Tim Winton and Hugo Weaving."
