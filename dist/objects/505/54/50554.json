        "When a bunch of autocratic bears move into the Arctic Circle the lives of its penguin population are instantly and dramatically changed as the region is transformed into a jail-like 'zoo'. All attempts are being made to break loose whilst young love hangs in the balance and the wily Tek (Kim Gyngell) insists they can fly and escape. But it's war for Sergeant Pepper (Rod Quantock) who declares \"I like the smell of snowballs in the morning\" and a battle of wits (or faith) ensues. Voices by: Sigrid Thornton, Eric Bana, Kim Gyngell, Linda Gibson, John Clarke, Rod Quantock, Tim Bain and Adrian Vaughan. Written and directed by Tim Bain."
