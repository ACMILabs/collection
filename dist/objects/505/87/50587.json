        "An extraordinary premise lies at the heart of this fantasy thriller: in nineteenth century London, H.G. Wells (Malcolm McDowell) invents a time machine and inadvertently transports himself as well as the notorious Jack The Ripper (David Warner) to modern day San Francisco. What follows is at turns comic and terrifying as fish-out-of-water Wells seeks out the blood thirsty killer whose brutal rampage continues across the city. Whilst on the surface this picture makes innovative use of the quirks of time travel; underneath, \"Time after time\" investigates the utopian visions of a nineteenth century idealist as compared to the reality of twentieth century America; a society where Jack The Ripper finds himself thoroughly at home. Cast also includes Mary Steenburgen."
