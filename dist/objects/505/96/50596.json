Suddenly their is magic in the air and Ludovic and his new friend find ways to out-smart the bully. The leaves, the trees and even the sand castle help out and soon the bully leaves him alone. But the magic doesn't stop and soon magic is used to help cheer up the mad and sad bully. Co Hoedeman who animated, directed and co-wrote this animation blends love with wonderment to create an affectionate story about friendship for kids of all ages. Website Link: www.nfbkids.ca/ludovic"
