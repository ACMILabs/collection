        "In this sequel to \"The Godfather\", set in 1940s-50s, Michael Corleone has taken over his father's mantle as head of the powerful Mafia family. Director Coppola tells two stories - the roots and rise of a young Don Vito, played by Robert De Niro, and the ascension of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the new Don. Throughout the film, flashback sequences shot in a neorealist style, parallel the two lives of father and son. A complex, epic vision of the corruption of American society, the film is widely considered to be as good as, if not better than the original. It won several Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (DeNiro), Screenplay, Score and Art direction/set decoration and was followed by \"The Godfather. Part III\" sixteen years later. Original music by Carmine Coppola."
