        "This rags-to-riches medieval adventure mixes the anachronistic elements of modern-day music and colloquialism with a 12th century period setting and characters. William Thatcher is a lowly squire who, in a moment of inspired spontaneity, decides to replace his deceased employer as competitor in a jousting competition. Jousting is an activity permitted only to knights of noble birth, but upon winning, William decides to continue his new pursuits. He soon adopts a false identity with the help of his two squire friends, Wat and Roland, and the addicted gambler, Geoffrey Chaucer. William is soon winning one joust after another, working his way to the championships in London. William's victories inspire the affection of Jocelyn, and the ire of competitor, Count Adehmar, but his ruse is constantly threatened by exposure. Cast includes: Heath Ledger, Rufus Sewell, Shannyn Sossamon, Paul Bettany, Laura Fraser, Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk."
