        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Millenium Dilemma: Constitutional Change in Australia\". The second episode in the \"Millennium dilemma\" series explores the notion of an Australian Republic and the potential changes in the Constitution this would require and how they would be determined. At the opening of the program questions are put forward such as, what would the role, functions and powers of the Head of State be? Would the Head of State be elected or selected within government? What impact would an Australian Republic have on the States? This is followed by responsive commentary from a range of contributors on these subjects. These interviewees include politicians, political analysts, media commentators, academics and legal counsel such as Professor Michael Coper, UN member Elizabeth Evatt, Noel Pearson, Professor Leslie Zines and His Excellency the Honourable Richard McGarvie."
