        "Anthony Quinn plays the deformed hunchbacked bell-ringer Quasimodo and Gina Lollobrigida stars as the beautiful gypsy dancing girl Esmeralda in this French/Italian adaptation of Victor Hugo's all-time classic novel about friendship, love and loyalty. Lavish sets, costume and make-up, along with a cast of thousands, are used to create a historical epic in the style of such films as \"The Ten commandments\" and \"Ben Hur\", but unfortunately does not quite succeed in the same way that these films did. The dialogue at times is perhaps overdone and the film comes across more as a theatrical presentation, lacking a sense of realism. However this is not to take away from Anthony Quinn and Gina Lollobrigida's solid performances in their respective roles. Cast also includes Alaine Cuny, Jean Danet, Robert Hirsch, Danielle Dumont, Philippe Clay. NOTE: This film is partially dubbed."
