        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Carry on\". The year is 1789 and it is the French Revolution. When an aristocrat of England, Sir Rodney Ffing (pronounced Effing and played by the irreverent Sidney James), reaches an impasse with his partying, balls and available broads and upon news of the revolution, sets sail for Paris to run amok with chum Lord Darcy (Jim Dale). In disguise he rescues many of the French aristocracy from the chopping block and quickly becomes 'most wanted'. His calling card, a picture of a two finger salute, earns him the name 'The Black Fingernail'. He continues to outwit and embarrass the Citizen Camembert (Kenneth Williams), chief of the Secret Police and assistant Citizen Bidet (Peter Butterworth) with some very funny disguises and affectionate character voices - not commonly seen in James' acting roles. The wild, irreverent acts roll to a triumphant end that ensures that this Ffing not only saves the day but also gets the girl. Cast includes: Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Dany Robin, Peter Gilmore, Marianne Stone, Michael Ward, Leon Greene and Julian Orchard."
