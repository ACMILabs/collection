        "Episode number 2 of Series \"The Celts\". The second in a six part series that discusses the history and legends of the Celtic people of Early Europe through to the year 2000. A study of rock art and archaeological findings of jewellery and various artefacts opens the program with a discussion of their symbolism that has remained relatively unknown for centuries save for their significance to key events and rituals inherent in the Celtic civilisation and their stylistic originality now known as 'Celtic Art'. The program then traces the breakdown of Celtic society in the fifth century BC as a mass movement South of the Celtic population on the continent led to clashes with Rome and Delphi and a distribution of Celtic peoples to unexpected corners of the globe with a discussion of the great many theories that seek to explain this. The Celts in Britain are then examined in detail, with explanation of the ancient history associated with their presence there and the powerful farming, artistic and warrior traditions of their society. In tandem, the growth of the threat of the new Roman Empire to the Celts and the invasion of Celt's new developing urban centres throughout the continent is detailed where despite the emergence of revolutionary leaders the strength of the Celts was no match for the discipline and well informed warfare techniques of the Roman soldiers. As the Roman Empire expanded its outreach Celtic Britain also came under attack but with a view to the next instalment in the series, it is said that they weren't quite as successful in this endeavour as many believe."
