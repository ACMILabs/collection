        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Millenium Dilemma: Constitutional Change in Australia\". The fourth episode in the \"Millennium dilemma\" series explores the rights and guarantees for the population contained in the Australian Constitution and in tandem discusses past and present issues of Aboriginal reconciliation. At the opening of the program questions are put forward about the writing of the rights to be included in an altered Australian Constitution such as, should there be an entrenched Bill of Rights? Should there be a Statutory Bill of Rights? What other rights and guarantees should be written into the Constitution? Particular attention is also paid to the issues of Aboriginal reconciliation and how it should be written into and recognised in the Australian Constitution. This is followed by responsive commentary from a range of contributors on these subjects. These interviewees include politicians, political analysts, media commentators, academics and legal counsel such as Quentin Bryce, Professor John Goldring, Chief Justice Murray Gleeson, Helen Irving, Sue Tongue and Professor George Winterton."
