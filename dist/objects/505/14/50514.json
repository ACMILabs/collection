        "Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony have long enjoyed accolades as one of the most important artistic collaborations of the 20th Century. In this documentary an overview of the collaboration of Walter Burley Griffin and wife and architectural partner Marion Mahony is addressed. The documentary connects the historical time-line of events in their lives to not only inform us about the architecture, but the political environment and the role that their personal dynamics had in contributing to their work. From early beginnings as the world's first registered women architect and long-time designer for Frank Lloyd Wright, Marion Mahony is described as being Griffin's intellectual sparring partner, muse and mentor. Documented is the incredible political corruption that Walter and Marion were confronted with and endured in Australia once being awarded the prize for their design of the new capital. Although they both decided to stay on in Australia after Canberra was completed and together produced almost 300 buildings around the country (including Sydney's Castlecrag), it is evident that both lives suffered as a result of their ongoing battles with bureaucracy over the building of Canberra. What Marion and Walter have left is a legacy of strong vision and philosophical interest. Their dedication to their dream and aesthetic that sensitively addressed the environment and the balance of humans within this remains in their gardens and buildings."
