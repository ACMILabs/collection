        "A feature length animated film starring everyone's favourite rabbit, Bugs Bunny. Living in retirement in his carrot-filled mansion in Beverly Hills, Bugs takes us into his portrait gallery where we are introduced to many famous characters such as Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Pepe le Pew, Wile E. Coyote and Road-runner, and also some of the important people behind the animation scene including Mel Blanc and Tex Avery. The film is interspersed with excerpts from some of the most classic Chuck Jones cartoons including Duck Dodgers, Robin Hood Daffy, Duck Amuck, What's Opera Doc? with Bugs as our host throughout the fun-filled chaotic adventures. The final twenty minutes of the film consists of a compilation of Road-runner cartoons edited down into one long manic cartoon chase, featuring of course, that old die-hard Wile E. Coyote and the ever elusive Road-runner. Character voices by Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan."
