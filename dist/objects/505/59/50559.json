        "While visiting an ear doctor Mr Wasinski discovers that his deafness is linked to a frightening childhood experience. During his consultation the doctor discovers gauze buried deep within his ear canal and upon its removal Mr. Wasinski becomes vulnerable to a barrage of repressed childhood memories. Having lived as a child in Poland during Nazi occupation Mr. Wasinski's deafness marks the loss of his innocence as a child when separated from his parents during a desperate attempt to escape. The vivid memories suppressed with the aid of his deafness prove a challenge to an aging man who seeks distance from his childhood experiences. Stars Bruce Kerr as Mr Wasinski."
