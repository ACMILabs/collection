        "Danny (Noah Taylor), onto his 49th share house and in his mid 30s is probably ready for some privacy and independence but is still attracted to the friends and oddball characters that makes sharing a house so attractively horrible. We travel with Danny as he moves through shared houses in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Danny's life is further complicated by the presence of rental goons despatched by landlords in search of unpaid rent and the police chasing him in relation to a credit card debt thanks to a dodgy housemate. Proving he is not responsible is harder than lying about his identity. Based on the book of the same name by John Birmingham, `He Died With A Felafel In His Hand' is a wonderful satire on shared housing. Cast also includes Romane Bohringer, Emily Hamilton, Sophie Lee, Alex Menglet and Damien Walshe Howling."
