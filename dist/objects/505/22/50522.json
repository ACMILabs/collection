        "Russian police and FBI personnel gun down a key figure of the Mafia in Moscow. The dead man's brother swears revenge on the FBI by hiring an assassin known as The Jackal to kill a major American identity. To counter the plan, the FBI hires an Irish terrorist (being held in a US jail) to track and kill The Jackal. A master of disguise, The Jackal travels under numerous passports and with several personas, making the ability to identify him nigh impossible. The Irish terrorist and his former girlfriend (both of whom have met The Jackal in previous encounters) are drawn into a web of murder and intrigue in the hope of unravelling the key to his identity before he completes his deadly mission. Under the direction of Michael Caton-Jones (Rob Roy, This boy's life, Memphis Belle), this action/thriller is a plethora of explosions, car chases, shootouts and terse exchanges between operatives. The brilliant locales can't hide the fact that a leap of movie faith is needed to believe The Jackal's numerous switches, moves and close shaves. Set across the globe, \"The Jackal\" is only loosely related to the 1973 classic \"The Day of the jackal\"."
