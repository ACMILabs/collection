        "Bobby is a young man, just graduated from High School, who imagines himself in a sexual situation with every attractive woman that he encounters. The reality is that Bobby is single, but his investment in new wheels brings with it the potential for real sexual experience. The van in question is a souped up vehicle complete with waterbed, plush interior and mirrors on the ceiling. Bobby's investment in the van is threatened when a friend in trouble desperately needs his car loan repayment money. Simultaneously Bobby falls for a local girl, who challenges Bobby's desire to sleep with a bevy of women. This film often skips into dream mode, whence the audience witnesses the sexual fantasy of various characters as they gaze upon a particular scene or person. This film is in part a curio from the 1970s that documents a car culture fetish and a male desire to assuage ego with sexual experiences. Features Danny De Vito in a minor role."
