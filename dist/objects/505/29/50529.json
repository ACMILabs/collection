        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Millenium Dilemma: Constitutional Change in Australia\". This first episode in the \"Millennium dilemma\" series introduces the study of the Australian Constitution through discussion of its historical foundations and development. At the opening of the program questions are put forward such as what does the Australian Constitution do? Where does the Australian Constitution come from? Does it reflect reality? Where do Indigenous people fare in the Australian Constitution? This is followed by a responsive commentary from a range of contributors on these subjects. These interviewees include politicians, political analysts, media commentators, academics and legal counsel such as Professor Tony Blackshield, Sir Zelman Cowan QC, Chief Justice of NSW Murray Gleeson, Professor Stuart Macintyre, Senate Clerk Harry Evans, Kristen Walker, Anne Mullins and Hugh Mackay."
