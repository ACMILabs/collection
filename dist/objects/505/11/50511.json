    "description": [
        "Using archival footage and interviews, this documentary tells the story of Lake Pedder, an alpine lake isolated in the heart of the wilderness of south-west Tasmania, which was flooded to make way for a massive hydro-electric scheme in the early 1970's. The campaign to save the lake became the first national environmental battle in Australia's history and subsequently through this fight to save Lake Pedder the world's first green party was also born. By the time the Franklin River was under threat the environmental lobby in Tasmania was highly skilled and organised as a result of the Lake Pedder experience. Subsequently, it was able to campaign successfully, not just in Tasmania, but throughout mainland Australia for the Franklin River to be saved. Includes interviews with Bob Brown, Peter Hay, Hilary Edwards and others. Narrated by Peter O'Brien."
