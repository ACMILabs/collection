        "An interview with Walter Gropius, architect and founder of the Bauhaus School of Design and chairman of the Department of Architecture at the Graduate School of Design, Havard University. Gropius discusses his views and theories on architecture and design. An exponent of teamwork, Gropius founded the Bauhaus School in Dessau on the notion of collaboration between designers and artisans. By combining theory and practice, the school equipped students with the skills to develop a project from the design stage to production. Marcel Breuer and Mies van der Rohe were graduates of the school while Paul Klee was amongst the teaching staff. Gropius also discusses his views on architecture, stressing the need for designers to consider the spiritual and mental wellbeing of humans when developing functional spaces. Photographed by Jesse Sabin and Joe Vadala. Sound by Jerry Gold. Edited by Robert Loweree."
