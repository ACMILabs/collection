        "An uncompromising study of a remote village in northwest Spain isolated from the surrounding world until the construction of a road in 1922. Records the community's poverty, disease and despair over a two month period. Observes the role played by the church and education system in promoting oppression. Bunuel sought to push his audience beyond pity. An academic narration over Brahm's majestic Fourth Symphony is designed to disconcert or anger the viewer. Writen by Luis Bunuel and Pierre Unik. Cinematography by Elie Lotar."
