        "Sunshine is an epic drama that follows the lives of three generations of Hungarian Jews from the late 18th century to the 19th century. Ralph Fiennes plays three different roles in this film which begins with the Grandfather developing a tonic that becomes the family's fortune. The family will experience much pain and heartbreak, mostly due to the invasion of the Nazi's and some family members conversion from Jewish to Catholic - events that could lead to a family's demise. \"Sunshine\" shows how determination and courage can unite a family through struggle and ensure the survival of future generations."
