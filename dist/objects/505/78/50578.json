        "The importance of selecting the right person for the job and the implications to your business if you don't are highlighted in this 30 minute video. The 4 classic mistakes that hirers make - failure to fully read and understand the candidate's CV, poor questioning techniques in the interview, excessive talking by the interviewer, and inadequate verification with previous employers - are clearly explained by presenter Sandy Kaye and illustrated through live footage. Covers issues such as job titles, exaggerated claims, education and training, references and testimonials and the importance of open and behavioural questioning. A complimentary participants guide accompanies the video which allows pausing between each mistake addressed. Whilst aimed at employers/interviewers this video is equally useful for job seekers who want to know how to conduct oneself in an interview. Written by Bruce Storey."
