    "description": [
        "The \"Bush Mechanics\" comprise of a group of five young Warlpiri Aboriginal men from Yuendumu in the Northern Territory who can face any challenge when it comes to fixing cars, no matter what condition the car may be in! They will use the bush as a resource for spare parts and do whatever it takes to keep a car on the road. Their clever inventiveness, wonderfully offbeat humour and crazy antics, provide an insight into both contemporary and traditional Aboriginal culture. In the style of a road movie, this series follows the \"Bush Mechanics\" across the central desert, through their many mechanical mishaps, challenges and exploits, including the race to Willowra to play their first paying gig as a rock band, the travel to Alice Springs to collect Simeon's nephew from jail, the chase for their stolen car and finally covering thousands of kilometers across the west to Broome to search for pearl shells for the rainmaker. The Bush Mechanics are: Simeon Jupurrula Ross, Steven Jupurrula Morton, Errol Jupurrula Nelson, Junior Jupurrula Wilson and Randall Jupurrula Wilson. Also features Jack Jakamurra Ross, and Francis Jupurrula Kelly. In English and Warlpiri with English subtitles."
