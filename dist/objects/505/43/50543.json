        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Australia: beyond the fatal shore [Widescreen]\". Art critic Robert Hughes reflects on his relationship to Australia, 35 years after leaving the country. Contemplative after his near fatal car accident, Hughes reflects fondly on his childhood in Australia with an appreciation that only came from questioning his mortality. Episode two explores Australia's national pride and nostalgia with the outback - despite the fact that only 1% of the population actually live there. Hughes traces the myths borne out of the bush that have dominated our history and folklore - especially in art - covering icons such as the shearer, the swagman, the explorer and the lost child. He also visits a sheep-shearing station, an Aboriginal community in the Kimberleys, Port Arthur historical site, an opal mine in Coober Pedy, forest in Tasmania and Ayers Rock. Native title and the myth of an infinitely rich and exploitable landscape are also discussed."
