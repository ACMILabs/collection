        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Australia: beyond the fatal shore [Widescreen]\". Art critic Robert Hughes reflects on his relationship to Australia, 35 years after leaving the country. Contemplative after his near fatal car accident, Hughes reflects fondly on his childhood in Australia with an appreciation that only came from questioning his mortality. This final episode in the series focuses on the issue whether Australia should become a republic, looking at the countdown to polling day of a campaign led by Malcolm Turnbull and Kerry Jones, and how it relates to Australia's self image. Hughes - a passionate supporter of the Australian Republican Movement, and former Prime Minister Bob Hawke lend their orative skills to the debate. Hughes talks of the town of Elizabeth in South Australia, so named after Queen Elizabeth II. He also touches on Monarchists roots in Adelaide, political persuasions from Menzies to Whitlam, and the popularity of RSL clubs. He speaks to former Prime Minister Paul Keating about the future of the Republican movement, and World War One digger Ted Smout on his thoughts on the issue. Hughes touches briefly on the design of Parliament House, Maralinga, visits Sydney's Hyde Park, and talks of Asian enterprise on the Gold Coast. He concludes the series with what he will miss most about Australia."
