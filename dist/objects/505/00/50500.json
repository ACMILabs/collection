        "Episode of Series \"Carry on\". The hilarity and double entendre's fly fast and thick in this 19th film in the 'Carry On' series. Some well known gags abound, including the silhouetted tent scene that was reprised in the recent Austin Powers film, 'The Spy Who Shagged Me'. Sid Boggle (Sidney James) and Bernie Lugg's (Bernard Bresslaw) plans to trick their girlfriends (Joan Sims and Dilys Laye) into going on a camping trip for nudists (or so they believe), become unstuck. As a cast of characters converge on the campsite, like the ladies from Chayste Place, who are anything but - the fun erupts into a bawdy adventure. Cast also includes: Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Williams, Terry Scott, Barbara Windsor, Hattie Jacques, Julian Holloway, Peter Butterworth and Betty Marsden."
