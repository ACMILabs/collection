    "description": [
        "Selling Australia' is a series of four documentaries exploring Australia's cultural identity in response to the tourism industry. More deeply, the series explores the Australian cultural fabric and the dichotomies that exist within the country both culturally and politically. The Games\" explores the role journalism and advertising had in encapsulating the Australian spirit in preparation for the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the response of the international media. \"The Brand\" looks at identities like Paul Hogan and cultural icons (the koala, Sydney Opera House and Uluru/Ayers Rock) and how they're used to establish the brand \"Australia\". In \"Tourist town\" the cultural and environmental impact of tourism is highlighted. Focusing on Cairns as a destination, we see how the tourist dollar has driven ecological change that sits at odds with the development of local culture and community. \"The Red heart\" focuses on the importance of the 'outback in promoting the country and how Aboriginal culture has been used to sell Australia as a 'spiritual' destination. \"Selling Australia\" raises questions about the distance between the mythologised image and reality of a place and culture. Narrated by Sigrid Thornton."
