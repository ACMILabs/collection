        "Ah Kam (Michelle Yeoh) is a stuntwoman trying to break into the male dominated arena of the martial art movie. A fearless perfectionist, intent on making her mark and earning the respect of her peers, she teams with a director known as 'The Chief' with whom she forms a professional and personal bond. On his latest flick The Chief is working against a tight deadline and places his stunt crew in jeopardy in order to get the job done. Kam displays a loyalty to The Chief that compromises her wellbeing as she performs some terrifying stunts whilst injured. Several subplots involve bar room brawling, the Hong Kong triads, after hours carousing and romance for Kam with a duplicitous playboy. Yeoh is convincing as Kam, a woman with ambition and determination to make it in a tough arena whilst displaying a familial loyalty to her colleagues. The film is an interesting behind the scenes look at the making of martial arts movies and the danger of injury that hangs over career stunt men and women. Yeoh was seriously injured during one stunt, jumping from a bridge, the footage of which is screened under the end credits. Dubbed version in English."
