        "Al Pacino reprises his role as the powerful family patriarch, Michael Corleone. Now in his 60s, Michael is dominated by two passions: freeing his family from their connections with the Mafia and finding a suitable successor. That successor could be his hot-headed, violence-prone nephew, Vincent, played by Andy Garcia, but he may also be the spark that turns Michael's hopes of business legitimacy into an inferno of mob violence. Stars Diane Keaton as Michael's long-suffering wife and Sophia Coppola as his wilful daughter, Mary, who is involved in a fiery affair with Vincent. Eli Wallach is one of the old dons of the Corleone family and Joe Mantegna is Michael's arch-enemy, Joey Zasa. This third film in the epic Corleone trilogy matches it's predecessors in narrative intensity, socio-political analysis, physical beauty and depth of feeling for its characters. Original music by Carmine Coppola."
