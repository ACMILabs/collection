        "Episode of Series \"Carry on\". England, 1906, and all is not cricket. After being tricked and humiliated at a high society club during a cricket match, Bertram West aka Beau (Jim Dale), now disgraced, leaves with batsman Simpson (Peter Butterworth) to join the Foreign Legion to prove his worth. Hot on Beau's tail is the regretful Lady Jane Ponsonby (Angela Douglas) who travels to restore his reputation whilst losing her own. The usual Carry On crew are joined by Phil Silvers who reprises the Sergeant Bilko character in his role as Sergeant Knocker. A strong performance but distracting from the usual Carry On style. A few saucy surprises along the way, like Anita Harris who, usually type-cast as the wholesome girl next door, plays the shock role (for it's time), of the erotic belly dancer. Cast includes: Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims and Bernard Bresslaw."
