        "Facing up explores the ways societal expectations and pressures related to gender can influence the lives and health of young people. It is presented in three parts and includes some animated scenes. Part 1 - Shaping up: focuses on body image; the perfect body, both male and female; keeping fit; dieting; advertising and the exploitation of the female body; personal expectations. Part 2 - Hanging out: deals with personal problems/relationships; stereotype and gender roles; attitudes towards sex and contraception. Part 3 - Moving on: contemplates the future and becoming adults; responsibility, career, marriage, children, independence, choice and what it means to be an adult. Cast includes Adele Daniele, Amanda Jane, Richard Norton, Damien Walshe-Howling, Joanna Cooper, Stuart Atkin and students from Fitzroy Secondary College, Darebin Parklands Secondary College, Ashwood College and Ardoch Windsor College. This kit has been produced as a teaching aid for secondary level and includes a Teacher's Guide and a Student Magazine."
