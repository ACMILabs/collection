        "A second-rate horror film which unfortunately does not match some of those wonderful \"B\" graders of the 1950s. The plot centres around the supernatural, the mystical, the spiritual beliefs of the Totec Indian tribe of Mexico who, as legend goes, live forever when their spirit escapes from their body with their last dying breath and possesses the nearest human. Leslie Chase (Robert Patrick), a ruthless and determined property developer working on a construction project in Santa Del Soz, Mexico, is fed up with the local Totec Indians harassing him and after two of his workers are murdered, Chase has the whole tribe of Indians massacred. Unfortunately for Chase, one of the Indians survives to make a surprise attack on him, biting him on the neck. Chase kills him but not before the Indian has time to expel his last gasp. Six years later in Boone County, Pennsylvania, Chase, still the same arrogant avaricious property developer by day, is cursed by the sacrificial spirit of the tribe in his body by night, filling him with the need to kill, and keep killing. His series of murders eventually lead to suspicion and an investigation by a woman, Nora Weeks (Joanna Pacula), whose husband has gone missing. There is a bit of sex, a bit of blood and guts and really not a lot of horror. Filmed entirely on location in Romania. Cast also includes Vyto Ruginis, Mimi Craven, Alexander Enberg, Nan Martin, Shashawnee Hall."
