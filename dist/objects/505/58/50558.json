        "When her uncommunicative, elderly husband dies suddenly after choking on an Anzac biscuit, Beryl casts off her bereavement to rediscover pleasures she had lost touch with in the latter years of her marriage, such as swimming in the sea, tap dancing, chocolate and foolish games. The catalyst for her reinvigoration so late in life is her little dog, who metamorphosises before her eyes only, into a frisky, carefree older woman. The pair become inseparable playmates much to the consternation of Beryl's uptight daughter who sees only a spoilt dog and fears for her mother's sanity. A film that touches on universal themes such as life after death of a loved one, caring for the aged, discovering your other half and taking control of your own happiness. Cast includes Melissa Jaffer, Tina Bursill, Maggie Blinco and Georgina Naidui."
