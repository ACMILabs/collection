        "A wry comment on the state of heterosexual romance and sex in the 21st century from a female perspective, this short experimental film consists of nine case studies 'as witnessed from life'. Through the use of split-screens Merewether juxtaposes text and images to comment on the all-too-familiar scenarios, conversations and discussions that constitute modern day (mis)understandings about what women do and don't want. Photography by Jackie Farkas."
