        "Tucked away in the middle of the noisy polluted 'city of joy', Calcutta, is Tollygunge Home - a haven of peace and quiet for 35 elderly Christian Anglo-Indian residents. During the British colonial rule, British men were encouraged to marry Indian women in order that their children would help further Britain's imperial interest in India. Children of these marriages became known as Anglo-Indians (or in earlier years, Eurasians) and lived a fairly wealthy lifestyle during the British colonial years of the late 19th century. However as time went on, racism and discrimination began to seep in and Anglo-Indians then found themselves in limbo - neither Indian nor British. After India won independence in 1947, two-thirds of the Anglo-Indian community emigrated to other parts of the British Commonwealth such as Britain, Canada and Australia. Those left behind became dislocated from their families and their living conditions declined quite dramatically. Tollygunge Home is financed by the East India Charitable Fund and managed by a committee of volunteers for these Anglo-Indian residents and this documentary explores their thoughts, memories and lifestyle through interviews. Shows them preparing for Christmas day celebrations in the traditional British way and highlights the personal interactions which take place, not only the anger, jealousies and loneliness but also the friendships, the bonding and love which holds them together as a community. Narrated by Rachel Blake."
