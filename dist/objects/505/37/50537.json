        "Mentally adrift after graduating from college, Benjamin Braddock is pressured by both family and friends to take on the responsibilities of adulthood, namely to marry and find a job. But the exhortation of family friend, Mr. Robinson, to seize every possible opportunity inspires Ben to accept Mrs. Robinson's offers of sex. Shortly after, Ben is pushed into dating the Robinsons' daughter, Elaine, and after falling in love with her he finds himself in the compromising position of maintaining a relationship with both women. Also includes a 45 min. documentary on the making of the film. Cast includes: Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katherine Ross, William Daniels, Elizabeth Wilson and Murray Hamilton."
