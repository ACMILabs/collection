        "Rita, Sue and Bob too is a light-hearted adult comedy set in a working class area of England. The film recalls much of the mood in the 1980s in a working class Britain. Rita (Siobhan Finneran) and Sue (Michelle Holmes), both babysitters for Bob (George Costigan) and Michelle (Leslie Sharp), are coming of age. Bob introduces both Rita and Sue to the adult life and takes them on a journey of sexual orientation whilst in his employ. Made by director Alan Clarke, famous for his portrayal of the working class in films like \"Scum\" and \"Made in Britain\", this film warmly gives life to the details that describe ordinary people and the working class lifestyle."
