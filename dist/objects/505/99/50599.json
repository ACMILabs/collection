        "An experimental film composed of elaborate shifting patterns created by analogue computer accompanied by the sitar music of Ravi Shankar. The shifting kaleidoscope patterns, mandalas and starbursts are organised through the use of geometry and repetitions of detail. To the ancient alchemists Lapis was a kind of 'philosopher's stone' or aid to meditation."
