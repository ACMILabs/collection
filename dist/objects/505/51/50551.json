        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Celts\". The final episode in a six part series that discusses the history and legends of the Celtic people of Early Europe through to the year 2000. The Celts over the centuries have suffered many forms of identity crisis, be it religious, cultural, or lingual and this program explores, in particular, the near death of the Celtic languages during the 18th century through to the early 20th century. It would appear one of the major influencing factors behind the disappearing dialects occurred as each Celtic nation (Ireland, Scotland and Wales) came under English rule in the name of a United Kingdom. However, as history tells, these three nations certainly did not choose English rule voluntarily - it was forced upon them. The program discusses the various uprisings that took place including the Battle of Culloden (Scotland 1745), the Great Potato Famine (Ireland 1846) and the Easter Uprising (Ireland 1916). Also examines about the Industrial Revolution and its effect on the Welsh population where speaking Welsh was banned in schools and a concerted attempt was made by the ruling English to obliterate and decimate everything Welsh, including their culture and language. Today it is a different story as the Celts begin to reassert themselves as independent nations - Ireland in 1922, Scotland in 1998 and Wales heading there. Each nation has its own Celtic language television channel and through the means of mass media, the Celtic language and culture is being revived and perhaps redefined as the current generation explore their identity as a Celt but also as part of a global population. Using re-enactments, archival footage, stills and prints, this very detailed and informative documentary provides a historical insight into the Celts and their culture and is complimented by some stunning landscape cinematography. Narrated by John Morgan."
