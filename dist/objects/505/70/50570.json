        "Sherlock Holmes is enlisted by Dr Mortimer to investigate the case in which one of his patients, Sir Charles, appeared to die from terror. Originating from the Baskerville family, the lineage includes the infamy of Sir Hugo Baskerville who died after having this throat torn out - the woman he was pursuing died from shock after witnessing the incident. Since then, legend has perpetuated of a monstrous dog prowling the moors and of the numerous family members who have lost their lives to the mysterious canine. Inheriting the property on Charles' death Sir Henry, a cautious Mortimer, is not so sure Charles' safety can be ensured given the history at the manor and Holmes places Watson there to keep an eye on proceedings. Dramatised by Hugh Leonard, Peter Cushing stars as Sherlock Holmes in the novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, first published in \"The Strand\" in 1901/1902 and in novel form in 1902. Cast also includes Gary Raymond, Gabriella Licudi, Philip Bond, Gerald Flood."
