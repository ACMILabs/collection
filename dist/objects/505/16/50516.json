        "Suzi Rosedale is an Australian woman living in an outer suburb of Jerusalem, offering guided tours of the city and surrounding areas for visitors on religious pilgrimages. This Australian made documentary follows Suzi on various trips as she takes groups of Mormons, Catholics, Jews and Muslims to the sites of Jesus' life, literally following in his footsteps. The exact location where key events occurred are contested by various guides who offer differing opinions as to \"the\" place where, for example, Jesus was buried. Suzi calmly takes all things in her stride including a client in need of an unavailable can of Sprite with his dinner in a kibbutz. The need for the tourism industry to make money from such endeavours is matched by the emotional effect that the Holy Land has on its visitors. Technology meets ancient religious beliefs as Suzi escorts the tour around in an air-conditioned bus and each client is hooked up with a headset in order to hear Suzi's commentary when on site. The commercial side of religious tours is exposed but not ridiculed in this entertaining documentary. Phillip Adams provides a comprehensive voice-over throughout. Filmed on video."
