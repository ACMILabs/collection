        "An amalgam of rapid images backed by a pulsing techno beat promoting the IT industry, the people in it and the people who use it. \"Create, design, build, change, dream\" is the catch cry as words such as evolution, global, internet, music, fashion, film and TV flash across the screen. Ends with Josh Simmonds (animator) and Sally McManus (sound engineer) presenting a brief profile of what they do and why they do it."
