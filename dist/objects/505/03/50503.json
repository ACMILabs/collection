        "The Garbage pail kids was a novelty item, bubblegum card created in the late 1980s. The characters appearing on each card were designed to appeal to kids and promoted 'gross-out' subjects such as snot and farts. Made hastily to capitalise on the promotion's success, the film is a comic fantasy in which the bubblegum characters of Valerie Vomit, Windy Winston, Foul Phil and Ali Gator come to life. Dodger (MacKenzie Astin) is the young friend of retired magician, antique store owner and man of mystery, Captain Manzini (Anthony Newley). When Dodger is bullied by a bunch of street villains he turns to The Garbage Pail Kids for help after he unwittingly releases them from their garbage pail (jail). Havoc and adventure results with a plethora of gross-out adventures. Although the film was intended for children some of the themes are more suited for teenagers. Film contains adult language, adult situations, mild violence and a \"State home for the ugly\"."
