        "A three part documentary examining industrial democracy in Australia: 1) Job redesign. Demonstrates how employees exercise decision-making, responsibility and initiative in their private lives and contracts with the usual workplace situation where most decisions are made by management. 2) Better managers. Shows a factory owned and operated by the workers providing a working example of successful worker participation and industrial democracy. 3) Is it a con? Examines unsuccessful industrial democracy initiatives where only the semblance of power has been transferred to the workers."
