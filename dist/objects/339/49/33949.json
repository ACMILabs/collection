        "This film has been made to provoke discussion of issues about racial prejudice. It tells the story of Ibrahim, a twelve-year-old Lebanese boy, who comes to Melbourne from war-torn Beirut. He goes straight into a post-primary school knowing no English and haunted by the horrors he has seen. Cast includes Sherif Abada. Based on a story by Jane Watson. Suitable for upper primary and secondary levels."
