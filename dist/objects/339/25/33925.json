        "In this silent film approximately 15 static and moving shots, including those from a cable car, are separated by intertitles. They take on a Lumiere look with the way that they picture Melbourne's main streets and buildings that were prominent at the time. The different fashion and the horse and cart transportation are even more fascinating in this familiar setting."
