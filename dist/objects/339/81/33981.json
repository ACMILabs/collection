        "Reptiles of four different types are shown: snakes, lizards, tortoises and turtles, land crocodiles, which are found in Western Australia. All are cold-blooded, and need the sun to warm them and encourage them to move. Close-up shots reveal the features of each type; the turtle's skeleton attached to its hard back; fascinating lizards with frills, spikes or blue tongues; snakes' markings and their fangs in action; fresh-water, harmless crocodiles and flesh-eaters which live in salt water."
