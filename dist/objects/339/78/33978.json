        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Destination Australia: the migrant experience since 1788\". This film examines the period of Australian history covering 1788-1840. Depicts the struggle for survival of the first fleet; the transformation of the penal colony into a mecca for British free settlers with the advent of the wool industry; encroachment of the pastoral industry on Aboriginal communities with disastrous results and slowing of migration with economic slump of the 1840's. Suitable for middle to upper secondary levels."
