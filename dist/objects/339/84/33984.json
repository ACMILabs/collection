        "Examines New York's \"hiphop\" subculture - the cradle of graffiti, breakdancing and rap music movements which have rocked the international worlds of art and entertainment. Cleverly juxtaposes the viewpoints of the graffiti writers, with those of law enforcement officers and government officials. Mayor Koch advocates five days in jail for repeat \"graffiti\" offenders and it would appear that there doesn't seem to be much attempt by those working for the system to understand this sub-culture."
