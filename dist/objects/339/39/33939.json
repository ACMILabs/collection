        "In the tiny Victorian town of Korumburra in the 1930's two Scottish immigrants, Wattie and Agnes Doig, led the first ever stay-in strike in the nation's history. It was a strike that gave hope and dignity to the life of the coal miner and brought new strengths and inspiration to the working men and women of Australia. This is a reconstruction of that historical event with the dramatisation placed between two excerpts from interviews with Wattie and Agnes Doig. Cast includes Chris Haywood, Carol Burns, Hugh Keays-Byrne."
