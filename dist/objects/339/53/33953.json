        "This film explores the sub-culture of people commonly dismissed as derelicts. It is a portrait of five homeless men and the film challenges conventional views of alcoholism and homelessness by depicting these men as members of a social network with a highly developed sense of mutual concern and camaraderie. A remarkable document, made over a two year period."
