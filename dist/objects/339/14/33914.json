        "Back in 1934, Elzire Dionne delivered five identical girls. This documentary follows Cecile, Emilie, Marie, Yvonne and Annette through twenty one years of strange upbringing. When the girls were just infants, the premier of Ontario issued a court order removing them from their parent's care. Cut off from the world and their family, over-publicised, viewed twice daily in a special viewing compound, they grew up as prize exhibits. Director Donald Brittain uses newsreel footage, home movie sequences and interviews to depict a historic event that became a tragic exploitation of a family."
