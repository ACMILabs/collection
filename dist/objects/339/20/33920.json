        "This reel consists of 7 magazine items, including snapshots of the Fitzroy Gardens, a trip to Seal Rock by boat, Kangaroos at Wilson's Prom, beehives shot in close-up and some prize footage of a motorcycle race on a track around the outside of the Exhibition Buildings. There is also some surprising early experimental filming of Flinders Street, and traffic and crowds on Swanston Street. One amazing shot appears upside-down and then mid-way proceeds to turn upright and show the traffic and people travelling backwards. Footage is then sped up for a cable car ride down a main street. No credits available."
