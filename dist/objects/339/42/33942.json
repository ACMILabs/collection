        "Two teenage girls escape from a youth training centre and head for the city finding work in a food bar. Eventually they end up sharing a derelict warehouse with two unemployed boys they have met, one from an Italian family and the other from the country, and for awhile the openness and warmth of their relationships transcend their depressing economic circumstances. This is a film about survival, interpersonal relationships and the inevitable disintegration of the group. Cast includes Kim Krejus, Sonia Peat, Ian Gilmour, Sergio Frazetto. Cinematography by Tow Cowan; Nigel Buesst as camera assistant."
