        "Episode of Series \"Destination Australia: the migrant experience since 1788\". One of a series of films that examines the history of immigration to Australia. In this film, \"White Australians\" give their opinions on the migrant influx, while Irish, Chinese, English and Turkish migrants relate instances of intolerance in Australia. They refer to situations of race, language or cultural difference and of economic pressure. In this film, social commentator Phillip Adams, academic Dinny O'Hearn and (former) RSL President Bruce Ruxton also make comments on matters relating to national identity."
