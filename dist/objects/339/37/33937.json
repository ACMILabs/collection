        "Eating your heart out is about food, dieting, and obsessional eating, especially as they affect women and girls in Western societies. The film looks at four eating disorders: anorexia nervosa; bulimia; obesity; and a condition known as the fat/thin woman. It also examines the wider societal pressures on women that lead to these eating obsessions."
