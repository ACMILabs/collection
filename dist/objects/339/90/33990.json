        "Aboriginal fringe dwellers of the goldfields of Western Australia tell their own story of what happened to their people when they were invaded by tens of thousands of miners in the great Kalgoorlie rush in the 1890s. The film then shows the living conditions of the survivors living in horrific poverty next to flourishing mining developments. The people speak of the destruction of their land, their failure to be compensated and of the kind of assistance they require for the sake of their children. The film concludes with the people telling the story of Maralinga and of those who died there - victims of the British atomic bomb tests. Includes cartoons by Bruce Petty. Cinematography by Marthat Ansara."
