        "Director Giorgio Mangiamele produced the first examples of multicultural cinema in this country. 'The Spag' was shot in the streets of Carlton and tells the story of a newspaper boy working to support his widowed mother; along the way his life is fraught with racism. The film is Neo-Realist in style and makes interesting use of incidental music and post-sync dubbed dialogue track; a dog's bark is even mimicked by an actor's voice. Stars the young Terry Donovan."
