        "The background to ideas chosen for stamp issues, the source of ideas and how they come to end up on the top righthand corner of most of the three thousand million articles handled each year by Australia Post - that's the story of this film. Whilst a dozen or more stamp series are issued each year, none has been more successful than the series featuring Australian roses. Both the rose grower and artist, Brian Clinton, feature in the film as well as Deanne Head, one of the three child artists whose designs have been selected for the 1983 Christmas issue. In the film, the stamp designs and the scenes that have inspired them make an informative and entertaining collage."
