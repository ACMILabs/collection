        "A trilogy of self-contained plays set in a world of law enforcement, vice, drugs, politics and organised crime. The stories are: THE JOB, about a young probationary constable torn between his moral obligations and loyalty; THE GAME, about two drug squad detectives who allow themselves to be compromised; THE NUMBERS, about a young politician whose actions conflict with the views of his parliamentary wing."
