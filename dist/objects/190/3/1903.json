    "description": [
        "An evocative study of a man just released from prison, Kill the Day is an evocative study of the \"prison\" formed by poverty and social deprivation. As in her other award winning shorts, Lynne Ramsey's focus is not on the melodramatic but on the everyday poetics of working class Glaswegian life. By concentrating on the day to day activities of her main character, and by situating him in a realistically observed personal and social milieu, she shows herself to be not only influenced by filmmakers such as Mike Leigh and Robert Bresson, but as a uniquely inspired filmmaker in her own right."
