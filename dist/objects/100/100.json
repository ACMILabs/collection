        "Dark Cave (previously `That poured its hot breath') is an evocation of memory and identity that takes the form of a poetic video diary. Kalin endows intimate 'home movie' scenes of travel and personal life with mystery and melancholy. A quote from Alfred Chester serves to destabilize the lyrical nostalgia of the rhythmic images."
