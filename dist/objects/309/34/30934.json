        "In India they call it Anushkati - the atomic juggernaut - a modern miracle brought from Canada to light an entire region. This film shows the strange procession made by the calandria, the heart of the nuclear reactor, hauled by huge diesel tractors from the seaport in India to the proposed site of the reactor, along a roadway specially prepared beforehand. Everywhere the juggernaut passed, ancient life stopped for a moment to witness the arrival of this new deity."
