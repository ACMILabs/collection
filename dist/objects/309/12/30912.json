        "An animated film telling the story of how life came into being on this planet. The animator, Michael Mills, describes the process in this film - from the time when a single-celled amoebae romped about the ocean depths until the first amphibious creatures crawled onto land, eventually to become the progenitor of homo sapiens himself. (Winner of eleven awards.)"
