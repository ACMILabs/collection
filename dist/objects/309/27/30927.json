        "The science of film animation and new knowledge of outer space brings to the screen this spectacular, awe-inspiring view of our solar system. Staggering distances are eliminated through the art of film, and there, before our eyes, is displayed the wonder of the universe. The moon, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, Venus, Earth, the most favoured planet, and all the other satellites and lesser matter in space are seen in amazing detail and perspective, in their eternal orbits around the sun."
