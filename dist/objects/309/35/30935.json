        "Cities are growing at a calamitous pace and they will be unliveable unless the idea of accidental growth is abandoned in favour of planning. Dr. Wilfred Owen discusses some of the features essential to the functioning of a city for business by day and recreation by night, and the role of transportation in effecting the growth of cities for the benefit of people"
