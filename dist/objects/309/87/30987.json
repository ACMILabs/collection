        "Illustrates the quality of the young child's engagement with art activities. Designed to capture the excitement art activities offer to the kindergarten child rather than suggest a method of teaching. Presents situations and moments in which the child works with a variety of art material and techniques. Original music composed by Richard Wernick and integrated with children singing and a rhythm band."
