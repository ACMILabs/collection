        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". By presenting case studies and scientific research from different parts of the world, this program explores how people become male or female. It looks at the role testosterone plays in determining sex during the embryonic stage and illustrates the cause of people developing physical characteristics of the opposite sex or both sexes. Included is a case from a Caribbean Island where a number of girls changed into boys during puberty. An attempt is also made to find a link between male homosexuality and testosterone showing some questionable research and experiments aimed at \"correcting\" homosexuality. Narrated by Paul Vaughan."
