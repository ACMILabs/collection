        "Enormous book shortages plague nearly every emerging nation. The creative potential of teachers is being tapped in India, Thailand and Uganda, where they are writing, illustrating and even hand-producing books for their own class rooms. From them, children are also learning to make this most basic teaching tool. Narrated by Edward Kemp."
