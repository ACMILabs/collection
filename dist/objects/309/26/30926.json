        "An analysis of a wealth exchange cycle in the Papua New Guinea Highlands. Shows part of the Sa cycle of the Wola people of Halalinja, Southern Highlands Province. Cassowaries and pigs, which are highly prized, are raised by the women. At a ceremony lasting two days the birds and pigs are slaughtered by the men and the meat is distributed to relatives and friends. This ceremony is just one in an elaborate cycle of gift exchanges. English commentary, Papua New Guinea dialogue with English subtitles. Narrated by Robyn Williams."
