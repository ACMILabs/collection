        "A dramatisation based on a Henry Lawson story \"The Australian Cinematograph\", made to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death. This film was shot using the directions written by Lawson in 1896 in the days when cinema was no more than a curiosity. The story is about the fate of a drover who has driven a mob of cattle hundreds of miles across the vast dry plains of north-west Australia to their destination. Luck is against him and he doesn't make it through the drought stricken countryside. His remains are found by a search party one of whom is chosen to take the sad news home to the drover's wife and family."
