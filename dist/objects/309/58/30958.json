        "Episode of Series \"Big country\". The launching of the Landsat satellite in 1972 began the extensive and detailed monitoring of remote landscapes. Using satellite data the South Australian Government is currently conducting a full-scale ecological survey of the Lake Everard area. It is hoped to extend the program to cover the whole country within 25 years."
