        "C'Noe shows us the many moods of one of Australia's most spectacular rivers, which is located in Australia's capital, Canberra, the Murrumbidgee. Dynamic rapids contrast sharply with dawn's calm and misty waters. Canoeing and kayaking are shown. We see the \"spirit of the river\" in human form as he silently observes the friendly intruders. When his river is again alone he joins it in his own traditional style."
