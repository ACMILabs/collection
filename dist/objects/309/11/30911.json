        "Probes the infinite magnitude of space, and its reverse, the ultimate minuteness of matter. Animation art and animation camera achieve this journey to the farthest conceivable point of the universe and then into the tiniest particle of existence - an atom of a living cell - with freshness and clarity that would seem impossible with other means of exposition. (Awards: Bilbao, Buenos Aires, Philadelphia, Berlin)"
