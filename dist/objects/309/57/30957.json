        "London in the 1950's saw the beginnings of a ferment from which \"the London Pop Scene\" emerged in the sixties. Said to have begun with the Independent Group at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, one of its members at the time, Reyner Benham, reconstructs some of the events, attitudes and influences of the time and discusses with the survivors how it was then and how it looks now."
