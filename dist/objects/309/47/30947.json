        "As a coastal dwelling nation, Australia has a lot to lose from any large oil spills. So far the nation has not suffered major sea pollution problems comparable with some maritime nations. As a form of protection of Australian waters against oil pollution, a co-ordinated National Plan has been devised by government agencies to be actioned immediately a threat of pollution arises. This film, sponsored by the Commonwealth Department of Transport describes the extent of that plan to protect Australian coastal ecosystems and economics. Suitable for secondary years 7-12."
