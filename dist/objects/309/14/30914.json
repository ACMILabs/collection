        "This film traces man's carelessness with fire, from its discovery to present day. Early man is warned that he must keep fire under control, but he gradually ignores this waring. Over-loaded sockets, smouldering cigarettes and other fire hazards result in the destruction of life and property. Story by Don Arioli. (Awards include: Melbourne, Toronto, New York, Atlanta, Zagreb, Chicago, Oberhausen.) Also available on DVD [319319]."
