        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Edge of the Cold\". First in a series of four films on the history and wildlife of Macquarie Island, 1,700 km South of Australia. The film shows man's massive slaughter of the island's seals and penguins for oil; the return after elimination 150 years ago of the New Zealand fur seal; stills and historical footage of the rape of the island's resources, and a look at how the wildlife there is now being studied by the Antarctic division of the Australian Department of Science. Narrated by Sir Edmund Hillary. WARNING: CONTAINS SOME DISTURBING SCENES"
