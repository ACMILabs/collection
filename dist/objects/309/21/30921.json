        "This film tells of the plight of some young boys whose desire to purchase a boat leads them to commit misdemeanours in order to collect sufficient funds. The story explores the conflicts of loyalty and honesty that arise in the various situations experienced by individuals in the group in their attempts to find cash in a hurry. The story deliberately has no ending so that audiences can make up their own choices and decisions for an appropriate ending."
