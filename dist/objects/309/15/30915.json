        "Computer animated satire of self-indulgence in a hungry world. Rapidly dissolving, reshaping images, made with the aid of a computer, create a stark contrast between abundance and want. A man eats, at first sparingly, but his appetite grows to gluttony, greed, and gratification of every desire. The nightmare that finally haunts him is the one that hangs over our disparate world. A film without words. Animation, Nestor Burtnyk, Marceli Wein and Peter Foldes. Music, Pierre F. Brault. Editing, Pierre Lemelin."
