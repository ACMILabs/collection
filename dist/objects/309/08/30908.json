        "An artist's observation of the way people walk. Ryan Larkin (Syrinx, Cityscape) employs a variety of techniques - line drawing, colour wash, etc. - to catch and reproduce the motion of people afoot. the springing gait of youth, the mincing step of the high-heeled woman, the amble of the elderly - all are registered with humour and complete individuality, to the accompaniment of special sound. (Awards: five awards, including Salerno and an Oscar nomination)"
