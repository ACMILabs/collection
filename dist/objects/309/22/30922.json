        "Cartoon animation of a story by E.B. White, first published in the New Yorker magazine in 1937. This is a tall Yankee tale about a family of seven fisherfolk who are living quite happily as the sole inhabitants of a small island in Barnetuck Bay until word somehow gets to the mainland that they are in distress. What happens when rescue attempts are launched makes an amusing story, illustrated with wit and verve by the film animation. Narrated by E.B. White. Also available on DVD [319319]."
