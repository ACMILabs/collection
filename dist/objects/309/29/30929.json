        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". A new theory on why people get fat. Research has shown that babies have special fat cells called brown fat, which decline as the human grows up. It is suggested that brown fat may continue to play an important role in determining the weight of adults. Written by Martin Freeth and narrated by Phillip James."
