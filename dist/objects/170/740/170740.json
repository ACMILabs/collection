        "Kenneth Carruthers Rankine (1890 - 1968) was a keen amateur cinematographer and filmmaker. This collection of his 'home movies' has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth's granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful 'slice of life' in Australia; with contents including scenes of family life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.  Reel 1 of the collection contains footage of the Rankine/Wootton children, filmed primarily at play in a garden. We see the children grow slightly as the film tracks their growth. Kenneth uses his trademark shots of flowers, trees and leaves throughout.  Detailed Description of Reel 1:  00:00:10:00 title card \"Now I am 3 &\" followed by \"Look at Elizabeth 9 months\". The title cards are separated by one of Kenneth's signature shots of leaves blowing in the breeze.  00:00:49:00 infant Elizabeth, wearing a singular style of baby hat, is shown in a classic, large pram typical of the day.  00:01:27:00 footage of a family picnic, complete with picnic rug, wicker baskets, thermos flasks and folding chairs.  00:02:14:00 footage of the children in the garden shows us excellent examples of hand made and hand knitted children's clothes. The images of Elizabeth at play show what fun small children can have with just a cardboard box.  00:03:52:00 close-up of a butterfly on foliage.  00:04:47:00 the children have grown and the eldest child is off to school as shown by his schoolbag. The Reel ends with a close-up of dad and the kids."
