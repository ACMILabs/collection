        "\u2018Flash Back\u2019, an archival mashup of films and footage from the 1940s through to the '80s celebrating the changing face of Australian youth identity and culture.  From rebel youth of the '50s, to the '70s counter culture revolution and the punk attitudes of the '80s, \u2018Flash Back\u2019 explores the changing decades through diverse subcultures and the music, fashions and cultural preoccupations that shaped them.
