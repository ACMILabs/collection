        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". Perception is our way of using our sensory apparatus to make contact with our environment. How does our brain recognise objects? In this program, Philip Zimbardo examines how we sense and perceive our environment, to process information and transform raw sensory data into meaningful impressions. He also discusses the way personal experience can influence our perceptions."
