        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". The average human brain can store approximately 100 trillion bits of information as memory. Memory is essential for human survival. It is a complex psychological process influenced by many factors. In this program, Philip Zimbardo examines how memory works, where in the brain memory is located, the difference between long and short term memory and the effect on memory when brain cells are damaged."
