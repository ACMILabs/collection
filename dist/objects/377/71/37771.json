        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Rainbow serpent\". Professor Eric Willmot describes the ancient trade routes set up by the Aborigines all over the continent, the evidence for their existence and the effect they had on the structure of Aboriginal society. 100,000 years ago the first people came to Australia. A thriving trade in stone age technology, and in red ochre began. The law of ancient Australia, of beholdenness, and all its implications, still followed by tribal Aborigines today, was derived from this trade. But the trade routes also carried destruction in the form of disease and white settlers. Yet many are still used, albeit using different methods of transport and trading new commodities."
