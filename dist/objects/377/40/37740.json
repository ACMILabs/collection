        "Tomas is a master of seduction. To him women are for pleasure and Sabina is the ultimate, a free spirit like himself. Life is blissfully simple until Tomas meets the young and innocent Tereza who awakens in him a tenderness he never knew possible. But it is 1968 and as the Russian tanks roll into Prague Tomas is forced to make choices; between love of his country and his yearning for freedom, between desire for Sabina and devotion to the ever-faithful Tereza. Adapted from the novel by Milan Kundera, the film stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin."
