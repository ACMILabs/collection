        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Rainbow serpent\". David Gulpilil has become a success in the white man's world, through his acting ability and leadership of a dance troupe. Yet he prefers to live in a traditional manner with his people in Arnhem Land, making brief forays into western society in order to publicise their plight and demonstrate the richness of their culture. Charmaine Green is a linguist student at the Australian National University. When she visits her family in Mullewa, W.A. and observes the hopeless life they lead on the fringes of western society, she feels that she cannot return there permanently, although she is determined not to deny her Aboriginality in spite of her light skin."
