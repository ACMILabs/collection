        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". Why have people always been able to link different elements and ideas into coherent relationships? It is our thoughts, our cognitive processes, that give meaning to everything. In this program, Philip Zimbardo examines the work of cognitive psychologists who study how people take in information, store it, transmit it and manipulate it, that is, exploring how we think and solve problems."
