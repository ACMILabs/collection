        "Most tourists who visit Rottnest Island are unaware of its history. Established as a prison for Aboriginal men around 1840, it was intended as a place for \"rehabilitation\". However, accounts of floggings, chainings and hangings flourished on the mainland despite official enquiries and commissions suggesting everything was in order. In this documentary, Robert Bropho takes us to the island and traces the hardship and the suffering of his ancestors that has been omitted from white man's history."
