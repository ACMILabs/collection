        "Pal Joey, starring Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Rita Hayworth, is strong, funny entertainment based on a novel by John O'Hara. It features 14 songs from Rodgers and Hart including \"The Lady is a Tramp\", \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\" and \"My Funny Valentine\". Sinatra is an out of heel nightclub singer, Joey Evans, who plays the field with women. He is ideal as the irreverent, glib Joey."
