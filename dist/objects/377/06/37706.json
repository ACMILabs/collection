        "Episode of Series \"Folktales from around the world\". An animated story about a Chinese potter who makes a beautiful porcelain teapot for the Emperor who regards its worth as priceless. It is then seen to be desirable and is inevitably stolen from the Emperor's palace. In a series of transactions that follow in various parts of the world, it is exchanged for items from other cultures that are equally regarded as priceless. Provides a simple introduction to the notion of trade, as well as the economic and aesthetic considerations involved in the determination of the worth of a product. Suitable for middle and upper primary level."
