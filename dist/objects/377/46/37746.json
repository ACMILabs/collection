        "Rose Thaiday was among the thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who were forcibly removed from their homelands and families and relocated to government missions that disregarded the cultural differences that existed between these groups of indigenous peoples. This documentary reveals the hardship she endured on the mission in Woorabinda, Central Queensland, 35 years ago and her subsequent search for a lost heritage. She also discusses the difficult periods of her marriage to Bill and the support she provides to Aboriginal students in her community who are studying away from their home and family."
