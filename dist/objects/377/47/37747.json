        "Episode number 17 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". A person's sex - male or female, is determined at birth, but gender - masculine or feminine, is largely a learned behaviour, determined by social and cultural expectations. This program examines the debate on how much of human behaviour is innate and determined biologically according to sex, and how much is the result of the individual's cultural context."
