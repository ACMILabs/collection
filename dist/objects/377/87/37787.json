        "This humorous film is designed to show the need for and the importance of trees and plants in one's own environment. Two men, friends from boyhood, grow up and each buy a house. However, one sits back and plants nothing, while the other diligently and patiently creates a garden paradise. Ten years later, the lazier of the two sees the folly of his idleness."
