        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". In this program, Philip Zimbardo examines consciousness, daydreaming and sleep. He follows the history of the study of consciousness, asking what it is that allows us to receive relevant information from our environment and ignore irrelevant information. Other psychologists explain the importance of daydreaming and sleep, especially REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep where dreaming occurs. Freud's theories on dream analysis where dreams are seen to hold significant meaning are contrasted with more recent dream theory which denies the meaning of dreams."
