        "Episode of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Humans are quick thinking, quick acting animals. This ability to react is controlled by the nervous system, which in turn is controlled by a complex system of neurotransmitters in the brain. This program examines the operation of these neurotransmitters, their effect on individual personality and what happens when these networks break down due to neurotransmitter diseases, in particular, Parkinson's Disease."
