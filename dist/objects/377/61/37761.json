        "Four and a half centuries ago, a group of Swiss Christians formed a community dedicated to applying the teachings of Jesus to every aspect of their daily life. In 1693, this group split into a conservative group (the Amish) and a more liberal group (the Mennonites). The Amish were persecuted as dangerous Utopian heretics in their homeland, and many fled to America. Over 75,000 Amish still live in farming communities in America, practising the same lifestyle of Amish in centuries past, living a life devoted to humility, duty, kindliness and order. This documentary discusses various aspects of the Amish community, including history, their world view, and the simplicity of their lifestyle. Shows various family activities."
