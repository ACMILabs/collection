        "Episode of Series \"Faerie tale theatre\". Sometimes getting your every wish is not everything you hoped for. It certainly is not in the tale of Aladdin (Bobby Carradine) who is left trapped in a cave with an oil lamp by a wicked magician (Leonard Nimoy). However, rubbing the lamp produces a genie (James Earl Jones) who grants his every desire - including marrying the beautiful Princess Sabrina (Valerie Bertenelli). But trouble reappears in the guise of the evil magician who steals the lamp and Aladdin's fortune."
