        "Episode number 21 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". It is estimated 1 in 5 Americans suffer from some form of mental disorder. What is mental illness? What causes it? In this video, Philip Zimbardo of Stanford University examines psychopathology, the study of mental disorders. Clinical psychologists discuss the various factors that can lead to mental and behavioural disorders, including schizophrenia, depression and phobias and then explain the need to classify mental illness to ensure appropriate treatment."
