        "Radio, racism and foreign policy examines America's attempt at isolationism after the horrors of the first world war. Strict immigrant quotas are imposed, ushering in an ugly period of racism and ethnic discrimination. The advent of radio helps to project the image of the 'good American', but also lets in news of foreign relations. \"The great depression and foreign affairs\" describes how the Depression shatters America's confidence in the American Dream leading to further isolationism which results in America ignoring the rise of totalitarianism elsewhere and Japan's invasion of China."
