        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". The elders of the Tiwi people on Melville and Bathurst Islands have been concerned that their traditional way of life will die out with this generation and so they have instigated bilingual, bicultural education in the local schools, so that the children now learn the Tiwi language and cultural tradition as well as English."
