        "Young Aboriginal people are no longer removed from their families by the authorities \"for their own good\", but young Aborigines are still subject to forcible removal from their families and friends through imprisonment in juvenile prisons for petty crimes. This program focuses on the experiences of young Aborigines in New South Wales who tell of a high degree of police harassment, simply because they are black. Their views are in stark contrast to those held by the white law enforcers interviewed, who see themselves to be free of racism despite the fact that there is a massive over-representation of Aborigines in Australian prisons."
