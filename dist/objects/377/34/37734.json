        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". Motivation is the general term for all the physical and psychological processes that start behaviour, maintain it and stop it. What motivates people to do good ... or evil? Psychology professor, Philip Zimbardo, of Stanford University, discusses why we act and feel as we do, exploring the biological and sociological aspects of motivation and its relation to our emotions, as well as the constant tension existing between desire and restraint, particularly in relation to sexual attraction."
