        "Adapted from Chapter 7 of the book \"More about Paddington\" by Michael Bond. For Paddington's first Christmas with the Brown's, he receives a chemistry set, a scrapbook and a xylophone. By 6 o'clock Christmas morning he is proudly banging out the National Anthem for everyone to hear. Paddington has never eaten a meal like Mrs Brown's Christmas dinner, but what an eventful dinner it turns out to be. Animated by Ivor Wood and told by Michael Hordern. Suitable for lower and middle primary levels."
