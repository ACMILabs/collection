        "Outlines the major features of the theory of plate tectonics and notes how the theory can be used to explain the distribution of the world's major earthquake zones and areas of volcanic activity. Provides ample evidence to support the validity of the theory of plate tectonics and explores some possible explanations as to how the plates actually move. Suitable for upper secondary level."
