        "Maurice Pym is a travelling cinema operator in the 1920's who, with his son Larry and his dapper pianist Freddie, covers the back roads of northern New South Wales. The film follows their adventures and their rivalry with a brash American rival who intrudes into their territory and threatens to steal their livelihood. Based on the memoirs of Lyle Penn, the film nostalgically depicts a past age, and the effect of new technologies on the cinema industry. Cast includes Rod Taylor, John Meillon and Jeanie Drynan."
