        "Peppimenarti is an Aborigine owned cattle station in the Northern Territory near the Daly River. Beginning by rounding up descendants of cattle who had strayed from other stations the Aborigines have built up the station to a successful business enterprise with $1m turnover p.a. Aboriginal law takes precedence over European law, and all able-bodied men on the station must work, with none allowed to go on the dole. Peppimenarti stands as a shining example of the Aboriginal Outstation Movement, which has successfully combined western business sense with Aboriginal tribal custom."
