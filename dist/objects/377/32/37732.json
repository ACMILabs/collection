        "The ANZAC performance at Gallipoli is examined as are the towns that are there today and the graves that remain. Likens the ANZACS to the Greek heroes of ancient times. This is an edited version of a commemorative film made in 1965, 50 years after the landing of Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli on April 25th, 1915. Highlights include memorial services in Australia, New Zealand and Britain, a re-enactment at Anzac Cove and scenes of Gallipoli and Troy today."
