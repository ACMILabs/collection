        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Civil War\". The Union giant appears helpless. McClellan abandons his attempt to capture Richmond. The talk in Washington is that the North may lose the war, but Lincoln grimly pursues his course. What started as a struggle to preserve the Union is now becoming a crusade against slavery, but Lincoln needs a victory and at a small creek called Antietam he achieves it, at the cost of 23,000 lives, the bloodiest day of the war. General Robert E. Lee retreats and Lincoln issues his Emancipation Proclamation."
