        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Civil War\". The war is in its third year and enthusiasm for the fighting has fled. In their awful camps men are dying of disease at the rate of two for every one slain in combat. Yet the struggle goes on. Robert E. Lee devastates the Union at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville but at great cost. At Vicksburg Ulysses S. Grant lays siege to the rebel stronghold, slowly throttling the South's lifeline. Meanwhile General Lee prepares to invade Maryland and Pennsylvania, thereby setting the stage for the war's greatest battle."
