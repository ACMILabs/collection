        "Episode of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Scientific experiments have consistently revealed how difficult it is for the individual to dissent or disobey within Western society. This video examines the psychological and social phenomena of conformity, obedience and dissent, using interviews with prominent US psychologists and referring to landmark experiments on obedience such as that conducted by Stanley Milgram. In this experiment, two-thirds of subjects applied increasingly powerful electric shocks as punishment simply because an authority figure told them to do so."
