        "Episode number 23 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". In this program, Philip Zimbardo investigates the power the mind has on the functioning of our bodies, in particular, the effect of stress on our health. Increasingly, scientists have had to acknowledge this connection in treating human illness. Zimbardo reveals how a holistic approach to healing, which aims to keep mind and body in harmony, can reduce the impact of stress- related illness such as hypertension and improve the functioning of the human immune system."
