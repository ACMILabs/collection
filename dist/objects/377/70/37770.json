        "Trapped in a dreary marriage, Cecilia escapes to the cinema and in particular to the romantic adventure \"The purple rose of Cairo\". Then one night as she watches the film the hero, Tom Baxter, steps out of the screen and into her life. But where does that leave the other characters - indeed the whole film? The real-life actor who played Tom is in danger of his career being finished, the producers see only lawsuits coming their way. Pandemonium sets in as real life clashes with fantasy. A bitter-sweet comedy starring Mia Farrow, Jeff Daniels and Danny Aiello. Best film 1985 British Academy Awards."
