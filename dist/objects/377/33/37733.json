        "Episode of Series \"Piaget's Developmental Theory\". Based on the work of Jean Piaget. Shows how a child's ability to classify in a number of different situations can be used as an index of more general intellectual growth. Demonstrates the \"clinical interview\" situation used in presenting children with cognitive tasks and gives examples of pre-operational and concrete operational subjects, typical behavioural responses and reasoning."
