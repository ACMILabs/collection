Chris becomes angry when his father buries the dog without consulting him. His anger turns to respect when his father takes him to the grave and together they select a special boulder as a grave marker. In the end Chris learns how to cope with tragedy and how accidents can be prevented. The sequel to this story is \"The Foundling\"."
