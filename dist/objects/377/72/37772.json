        "Episode of Series \"Faerie tale theatre\". Two wily conmen (Alan Arkin and Art Carney) arrive at the scene of an emperor's fashion show and turn non existent clothes into fame and fortune. This story illustrates the foolishness of vanity and the dangers of praise in a hilarious way. Adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's famous story."
