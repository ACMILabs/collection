        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". How much do we know when we come into the world? Rousseau believed we came into the world with all the skills needed for survival, and were then warped by our contact with society. John Locke, however, saw young babies as a blank screen to be developed by life's experience. This began the \"nature versus nurture\" debate in human psychology. Philip Zimbardo, in this program, investigates current evidence to decide whether heredity or environment is the major factor in a child's development."
