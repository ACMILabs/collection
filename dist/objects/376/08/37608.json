        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". A group of Australians are taken back to the quarantine station which was their first experience of their new country when they arrived as migrants. A labyrinth of cold, tiny cubicles enclosed by imposing stone walls the quarantine station was, for over 50 years, the first Australian home for thousands of immigrants. Through interviews with women and men who passed the station we gain an understanding of the hardships undergone by migrants in their initial years in a new land."
