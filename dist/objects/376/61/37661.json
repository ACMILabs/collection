        "A fascinating reworking of the film noir genre, with Teresa Russell performing the femme fatale Reni, who seduces then murders a string of unsuspecting men, and Debra Winger taking on the role of the unsatisfied FBI agent Alex. Alex's investigation is complicated by her increasing obsession with Reni and the sexual tension between the two, which threatens to bring about the downfall of both. A gripping and intricate film that raises interesting questions about love, desire and death."
