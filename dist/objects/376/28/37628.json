        "On the 26th January 1988, Australia celebrated its bicentenary in a variety of different ways. This program looks at some of them, from the re-enactment of the arrival of the first fleet in Sydney Harbour, seen through the eyes of wealthy socialites on their motor launch, and more ordinary Australians at their barbecue to scenes of the official speeches and the progress of the Aboriginal \"March for Freedom, Justice and Hope\" In between we see European immigrants and their celebrations, a street party and the outback cattle ranchers to whom it is just another working day."
