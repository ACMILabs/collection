        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". A detailed look at Vermeer's painting \"The Astronomer\" and its companion piece \"The Geographer\" in the context of the entire body of Vermeer's work, which is not large. These extraordinarily detailed portraits, all apparently set in the same interior, show a photographic vision, aided perhaps by the use of the camera obscura, and an acute awareness of the properties of light. Explores Vermeer's technique and the possible symbolism of the paintings' props."
