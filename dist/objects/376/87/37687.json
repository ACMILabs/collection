        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". Jan van Eyck's \"Madonna with Chancellor Rolin\" painted around 1435, is one of the first known oil paintings. Filled with microscopic detail and demonstrating early experiments with perspective, this painting features the figure of Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of Burgundy and influential in the arts from Autin to Burgundy. As well as demonstrating the techniques and symbolism of the painting, this program also describes the historical context of The Hundred Years War."
