        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Erwin, a refugee from Hungary and his wife Samran, whom he met on a trip to Thailand live near Darwin. They describe their separate experiences as immigrants to Australia, their life together and the small tropical fruit farm that they own. Erwin is a loner, who likes nothing better than to go off hunting crocodiles, or fishing, but his wife Samran enjoys the human contact and busyness of the market where she sells her fruit. A tantalising glimpse into a marriage between two quite different people."
