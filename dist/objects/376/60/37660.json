        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". The staging of the Americas Cup in Fremantle had a huge impact on the redevelopment of Perth's old seaport. Heritage buildings were restored, some lovingly, some superficially and new tourist and shopping precincts were created. This program explores the short and long-term effects of the development on the people of Fremantle, both rich and poor, businessmen and tenants and should give valuable lessons to others planning major redevelopment around a once-off major event such as the Americas Cup."
