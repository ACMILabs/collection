        "Desert tracks documents the experience of a diverse range of urban whites on tour in Central Australia. The tour began as an initiative of the Pitjantjatjara people to raise funds to assist in the movement back to the their homelands and maintain their communities, but also to break down racial and cultural barriers. Essential to the tour is the involvement of the whites in the Pitjantjatjara culture, sharing knowledge and learning to survive in the Central Desert."
