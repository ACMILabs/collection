        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Many Australian men go to the Philippines in search of a wife as marriage to an Australian is considered an escape from a poverty-stricken future by many Filipinas. This program interviews some of these women and their husbands who live in and around Darwin about their expectations and their lives since. Those interviewed have enjoyed successful marriages, but there are are others who have not been so lucky."
