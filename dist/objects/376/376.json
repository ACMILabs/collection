        "Observing the rituals, gestures and trance-like states of his crew, a naval Commander ponders his life. How did he get here? What went wrong? And right? Will he ever know light again? Probing the dark, unspecified seas, the ship becomes contemporary Russia: dazzling midnight snowstorms; plain human actions shaped by centuries of weariness and wanting; persistence; inquiry."
