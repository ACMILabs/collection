        "Episode of Series \"Changing Australia\". Tourism is Australia's largest employer and continues to grow in importance. This program looks at the importance of understanding the cultures our visitors come from and also at the importance of developing foreign language skills for those involved in the tourist industry. We see examples of how Australia can capitalise on the language and cultural skills which already exist within the migrant communities. The program also considers alternative types of tourism, some of which are beginning to involve Aborigines on a more active basis."
