        "With the aid of highly magnified internal live photography, medical filmmakers, Lennart Nilsson, Bo Erikson and Carl Lofman, are able to bring to the screen the first filmed sequence of the human ovum undergoing the process of fertilisation - the exact moment when life begins. \"The Miracle of Life\" then follows the exciting development of the foetus as it prepares to enter the world outside."
