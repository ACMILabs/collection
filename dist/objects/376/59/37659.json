        "A fascinating exploration of the \"art terrorist\" activities of the New York Guerrilla Girls, a group of feminist artists who use street theatre and innovative graphics and design to draw attention to the under-representation of women and people of colour in New York art society. Interviews with art collectors, art-house curators and artists reveal the extent to which the tactics of the Guerrilla Girls (who wear gorilla masks to conceal their identity) have forced the established art community in New York to examine their sexist and/or racist assumptions about art. By combining wit, humour and style with politics the Guerrilla Girls are part of a radical street culture, who, along with such artists as Act-Up's Gran Fury, are altering the graphic landscape of contemporary New York City."
