        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". A group of teenagers from a South Australian high school take part in the \"Sharing our future\" celebrations, a week of activities organised by the Office of Multicultural Affairs to celebrate the diversity of culture in Australia. By organising dance and drama performances together, and getting involved in discussions to do with what it means to be Australian, the young people come to appreciate the richness that cultural diversity has brought to their country. \"No turning back\" features songs by Gondwanaland and Midnight Oil and a special appearance by Jimmy Barnes."
