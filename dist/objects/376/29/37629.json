        "Act of necessity, set in rural New South Wales, explores the conflicts faced by a community whose health is threatened by the use of chemical sprays. One woman's concerns are brought to a climax when her daughter becomes fatally ill and her search for answers is frustrated by a wall of bureaucracy. Beautifully photographed, it provides a compelling argument about the dangers of chemicals to the environment and the collusion of silence from people in power."
