        "Greenpeace is one of the largest and most successful of international environmental organisations. By using large-scale direct action operations and an effective manipulation of the media, Greenpeace acts as a constant thorn in the side of multinational companies who pollute the planet. This video concentrates on the organisational structure of Greenpeace Australia, examining how specific campaigns are organised and how recruitment to the organisation occurs. We follow a successful campaign to alert public attention to the polluting of Sydney's waterways by Caltex Petroleum Company and we follow media and business reactions to the campaign."
