        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". Rembrandt created almost one hundred self-portraits from the age of twenty to the age of sixty-three. This program looks at a selection of these in detail, discussing his technique, how it differed from others' painting at the same time, at some of the possible symbolism of the costumes and props he used and at outside influences on his art. An American version of a French production."
