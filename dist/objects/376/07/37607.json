        "The Famine within is a Canadian feature length documentary film about the contemporary obsession with body size and shape. Under the coercive powers of consumerism and the mass media, women have come to view their bodies as marketable objects and to judge them according to the unrealistic standards of the body ideal. Combining the direct testimony of many women who have suffered from body obsession, this film explores the kind of hunger that cannot be satisfied by food. Best Feature Documentary 1991 Genie Awards (Canada)."
