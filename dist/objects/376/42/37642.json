        "Winner of the Best Picture Oscar, \"Around the world in eighty days\" is super-showman Mike Todd's spectacular global pageant based on Jules Verne's classic novel. Suave Phileas Fogg, accompanied by his manservant Passepartout, sets out at the turn of the century to circle the globe in eighty days in order to win a wager. David Niven, Cantinflas, Shirley MacLaine and Robert Newton in the major roles are supported by a dazzling array of 44 international stars in cameo roles."
