        "In a remote Central Australian community, a young Warlpiri couple are in conflict. Jean Napanangka wants to stay with her people, but her husband, Alan Jungarrayi, wants to move to the town to find work. Jean fears if they leave, their children will lose their language, and, because theirs is an orally-transmitted culture, their traditional identity as well. When the white man arrived in Australia, there were at least 200 Aboriginal languages. Only 40 survive today. This video is a timely examination of the dilemma faced by Aboriginal people wanting to control the fate of their heritage."
