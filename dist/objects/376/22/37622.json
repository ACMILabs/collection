        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Changing Australia\". The 1980's were a time of great change in the Aboriginal struggle for land rights. This film documents the passing of legislation in the N.S.W. Parliament which took control from the Aboriginal Lands Commission and passed it to local Aboriginal Land Councils. The Act was opposed by many Aboriginal activists, including Paul Coe and The Munros, father and son, but supported by others, such as Pat O'Shane. Focusing on the town of Moree where the Munros live, the program depicts the history of the Aborigines' dispossession and their struggle to regain their lands or be compensated for their loss."
