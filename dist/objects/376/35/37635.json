        "Dinosaurs (meaning \"terrible lizards\") appeared 210 million years ago, ruled the world for 150 million years and then disappeared 65 million years ago. Their world has only become known to us in the past hundred years. This video has the first two episodes from the fascinating Granada Television series on the history of the scientific \"Dinosaur Detectives\" who gradually pieced together this long forgotten world. Part 1: \"The Tale of a tooth\" tells of the first discoveries of dinosaur fossils, beginning with a gigantic tooth discovered in England by British scholar, William Buckland in 1817. Part 2: \"The Tale of the bones\" shows the techniques used by modern palaeontologists and modelmakers to recreate accurately the original appearance of over 1000 species of dinosaurs."
