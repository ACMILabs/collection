        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". At Giverny near Paris, Claude Monet created a garden, which included a large pond, which he filled with waterlilies and over which he built a Japanese bridge. This pond and the bridge featured in many series of paintings throughout his life there, and this program looks at them in detail. Monet pioneered the 'series' painting but it is \"the dance of the brush and the vibration of light\" for which he will be remembered."
