        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Top end\". Czech born George Chaloupka became fascinated by Aboriginal Art soon after his arrival in Australia in the 1950s. Since 1958 he has lived and worked in the far north of the continent cataloguing and researching Aboriginal Rock Art, some of which goes back twenty thousand years. A trained anthropologist, Chaloupka sees the art of indigenous Australians as an important historic record for both indigenous and white Australians as well as being examples of great aesthetic beauty."
