        "The Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions was established in 1984 to provide an independent prosecutorial service under Federal law to the Australian Community. The office prosecutes crimes like drug smuggling and fraud and recovers the proceeds of crime from convicted criminals. This video provides an insight into the Commonwealth prosecution system in Australia by re-enacting two crimes, a heroin smuggling operation and a social security fraud, highlighting the interaction between the DPP and investigating agencies."
