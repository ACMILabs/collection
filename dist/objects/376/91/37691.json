        "When an old sea dog Billy Bones dies at the \"Admiral Benbow Inn\", Jim Hawkins and Dr. Liversey come into possession of a map revealing the where- abouts of treasure hidden by the infamous Captain Kidd. They set out on the sailing ship \"Hispaniola\" to find the hoard and make their fortunes. In the great tradition of swashbuckling adventure stories Robert Louis Stevenson's tale has taken its place among the best known and most widely read by children of all ages. Ross Higgins stars as the voice of Long John Silver and brings this animated video to life."
