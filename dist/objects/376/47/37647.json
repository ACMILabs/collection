        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". In northern Australia the Aboriginal Land Council works with Aboriginal communities to reclaim traditional land and sacred sites, as well as to develop self-sufficient communities run by indigenous people. This video examines a number of Aboriginal communities along the Daly River in North-western Australia which have proven to be successful examples of Aboriginal self-determination. Examples include the Peppimenarti station which is a large station that offers both employment and accommodation to a growing number of land workers."
