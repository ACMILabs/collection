        "The first SALT talks unfolds the story of the beginning of the arms race between the United States, Great Britain and Japan after the first world war, diplomatic attempts to curb it and the development of the aeroplane as a military weapon. \"America in the Pacific\", subtitled \"a clash of two cultures\" details the increasing suspicion and mistrust between America and Japan and Japan's rapid rise as an imperialistic military power, culminating in the Russo-Japanese war and the Sino-Japanese conflict. Uses archival footage and interviews with historians. Narrated by Eric Sevareid."
