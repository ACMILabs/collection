        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Race to save the planet\". This program examines tales of garbage barges, toxic dumping, overflowing landfills and sewage polluting coastal waters. But it also tells of some imaginative and economically viable ways of not only disposing of waste materials, but also of making use of them for the benefit of the local communities who produce them. Narrated by Karina Kelly."
