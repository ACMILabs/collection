        "A compelling thriller based on the privacy of the Catholic confessional. A young priest, played by Montgomery Clift, hears the confession of a murderer. Later, the priest himself is accused of the murder, owing to his friendship with a woman who was being blackmailed by the victim. Anne Baxter plays the woman, Karl Malden the police inspector and Brian Aherne the Police Prosecutor. Adapted from the play by Paul Anthelme."
