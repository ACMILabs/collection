        "Four episodes of the delightful puppet animation featuring Postman Pat and his black and white cat in their bright red mail van. 1. \"Pat's difficult day\" On a day when nothing goes right, Pat ends up doing his rounds in Sam Waldron's mobile van. 2. \"Pat goes sledging\" Winter snows in Greendale mean that Pat has to swap his mail van for Alf Thompson's sled. 3. \"Letters on ice\" Pat is out of practice on ice skates, but that doesn't stop him from skating over the frozen pond to deliver Charlie Pringle's mail. 4. \"Postman Pat takes a message\" Pat has to resort to roller skates to get a message to Reverend Timms."
