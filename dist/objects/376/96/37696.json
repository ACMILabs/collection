        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Take an Aboriginal musician and an Australian composer ... put them in the middle of Europe and what have you got? If the composer is George Dreyfus, the musician is Richard Walley, poet and exponent of the didgeridoo, and the European country is Germany, you get a fascinating look at two individuals whose people have been persecuted but whose vastly different cultures can come together in a totally satisfying work. Made with the assistance of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs."
