        "A witty, futuristic comedy with Allen brought back to life after 200 years in the year 2173 to find himself a wanted man in a totally regulated society. Allen is hunted as a dangerous alien, and in the course of avoiding capture, he first becomes a robot-servant to dippy artist, Diane Keaton, and, after revealing his true identity to her, embarks with her on an hilarious series of improbable escapades."
