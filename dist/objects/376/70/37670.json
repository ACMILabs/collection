        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". An old Polish man looks back at his arrival in Australia. He describes his evacuation from a refugee camp in Germany; his work as a labourer on arrival in Australia; his marriage to a Polish woman and their eventual divorce. Simultaneously we watch a contemporary second-generation Polish-Australian couple getting married: Polish ritual and ceremony amidst an Australian landscape. The old man despairs over his ruined love, his hard life and hopes that the next generation can avoid his heartbreak. The narration is from Tadeurz Kempas' autobiography \"Metamorphoses\". The video was filmed amongst Hobart's Polish community."
