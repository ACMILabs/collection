        "Two further parts of the series tracing the history of the scientific hunt for evidence to increase our knowledge of the giant dinosaurs who disappeared from the world 65 million years ago. Part 3: \"The Tale of an egg\" begins with the discovery of the first dinosaur egg in China in the 1920's. It then concentrates on the clues discovered by the \"Dinosaur Detectives\" to piece together the habits and social life of dinosaurs. Part 4: \"The Tale of a feather\" firstly concentrates on the fossilised feather found in southern Germany which led to the discovery of a \"missing link\" creature, half bird and half reptile. It then goes on to investigate the causes of the extinction of all dinosaurs."
