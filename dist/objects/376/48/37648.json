        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". The first in a two-part series, this program looks at the stigma associated with mental illness, particularly in relation to migrants who have different value systems. A number of psychologists and psychiatrists from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds talk about the problems as they see it. The patient's point of view is also presented by a small group who talk about how they overcame their resistance to seeking psychiatric help."
