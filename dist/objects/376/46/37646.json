        "Hailed as one of the best comedies ever made! Army surgeons during the Korean War develop a lunatic lifestyle in order to cope with the everyday horrors encountered in a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. The film mixes slapstick with tragedy and pokes merciless fun at military pomposity, empty religion and incompetence. It sticks its tongue out at hypocrisy - the same attitudes which have mad the television series so successful. Based on a novel by Richard Hooker, the film stars Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould and Tom Skerritt."
