        "A group of nuns, past and present, talk about life in a Sisters of Mercy convent in Singleton, N.S.W. from the 1940's to the present day. This is a courageous and clever film that investigates the subtle complexities of change within a society that has been surrounded by mystery for hundreds of years. The film delves deeply into the beliefs of those women who have chosen to live a very different life to that of most women, but it also gives voice, with integrity, wit and sensitivity to those who have chosen to leave the cloister. Cinematography by Mandy Walker."
