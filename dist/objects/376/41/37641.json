        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". Delacroix's picture \"Liberty leading the people\" was painted in 1830 and depicts the uprising in Paris which resulted in the installation of Louis Philipe as king. This program looks in detail at the painting itself, the techniques that Delacroix used, outside influences on his art, the symbolism he uses and the reception his painting received, as well as looking briefly at the events which inspired the work."
