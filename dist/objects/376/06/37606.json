        "Pageantry, romance and adventure abound in this definitive version of the legend of Robin Hood. Never before has good triumphed over evil with such spectacular colour and panache. Starring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains the film boasts one of the best screen sword fights in the climactic fight between Robin and Sir Guy of Gisborne. Made for the then enormous budget of nearly $2m., the film's lush art direction, crisp film editing and lavish music score all won Academy Awards."
