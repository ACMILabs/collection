        "The Kirinara Hostel in N.S.W. offers an educational program specifically designed for young Aboriginal and Islander people. The video focuses on students at the hostel and includes interviews with ex-students who have pursued careers in a diverse range of fields including law, teaching, football and dance. The graduates stress the importance of individuals setting realistic goals for themselves as well as the need for Aboriginal education support schemes to assist young Aboriginal people to achieve their full educational potential."
