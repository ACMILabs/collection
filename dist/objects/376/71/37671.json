        "Bush Christmas is a superb film which won critical acclaim around the world upon its release in 1947 and is today regarded as an Australian classic. In this 1971 re-edited version, a family of Australian children, realising their father's horses have been stolen, set out to track the horse thieves and return the horses to their father as a Christmas present. A storm destroys their tracks and the children become lost, while search parties, and the horse thieves, desperately hunt for them. Starring Chips Rafferty."
