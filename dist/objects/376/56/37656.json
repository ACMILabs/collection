        "In these first two programs we follow President Woodrow Wilson's struggles to involve the United States in the League of Nations. His passionate idealism made him unable to compromise, leading to the harsh conditions imposed upon Germany in the Treaty of Versailles, and his defeat in the United States Senate by those who did not wish to involve America in foreign affairs. Narrated by Eric Sevareid."
