        "Join a curious kitten named Milo and his inseparable buddy, a pug-nosed pup named Otis, as they fall, frolic, glide and tumble through one exciting escapade after another. Raised together on a friendly, sunny farm, Milo and Otis love to explore the countryside and tease the barnyard animals. But one day mischievous little Milo lets curiosity get the better of him and he's suddenly swept down a rushing river in a wooden box. Taking off to rescue his best friend, Otis also leaves the safety of the farm behind him forever. What starts as an amusing and funny game soon turns into the most breathtaking, heartwrenching adventure of their lives ... where love and friendship are the most wonderful gifts of all. Based on an original story by Masanori Hata. Narrated by Dudley Moore."
