        "Nobody will hire the rash Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) because he has antagonised every producer in New York. When his girlfriend fails an audition for a soap opera; Michael dresses up as \"Dorothy Michaels\" and lands the part. Michael's sole conspirators are his agent George and his room mate Geoff. All goes well until \"Dorothy\" falls in love with beautiful co-star Julie (Jessica Lange) - and Julie's father falls for \"Dorothy.\" Co-starring Bill Murray, Teri Garr, Charles Durning and Sydney Pollack."
