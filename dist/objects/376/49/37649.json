        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". A group of psychiatrists and counsellors who offer alternative kinds of psychiatric help talk about their methods. They all stress that the need for change has to come from the patients themselves and that any change is likely to be small and not likely to happen quickly. Some of their patients also talk about their treatment and we are shown brief glimpses of sessions between therapist and patient."
