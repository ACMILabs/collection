        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Race to save the planet\". This program examines the role that governments can play in protecting the environment. In Zimbabwe, President Mugabe talks about the importance of education and of balancing people's needs against those of the environment. In Thailand, as in Zimbabwe, population growth has been a major problem, and government birth control programs have played an important role in reducing this growth. Popular protest also plays a role in influencing governments, as in Sweden which now has a nuclear ban forced by the people, but care should also be taken that the political decisions made have taken every possible outcome into consideration. Narrated by Karina Kelly. A teacher's book accompanies the video."
