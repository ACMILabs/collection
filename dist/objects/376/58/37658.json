        "Scripted by Nell Dunn from her novel, \"Poor Cow\" is a gritty piece of social realist film-making. A young woman is left pregnant and living in poverty when her husband is taken to jail. She begins a relationship with his best friend but though she attempts to negotiate the radical sexual mores of late-sixties London her lack of material resources, and the two men's lack of consideration for her own feelings, eventually lead to her unhappiness. Powerfully directed by Ken Loach, \"Poor Cow\" is often a stinging critique of \"swinging London\" as seen through the eyes of working class people. With Carol White and Terence Stamp."
