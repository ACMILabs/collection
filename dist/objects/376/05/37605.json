        "Seven short dance pieces which are designed to create the mood of the colour each segment represents. As well as the colour, each dance uses another motif, such as a geometric shape or a concept such as Yin and Yang to complement or emphasise the colour mood. The music was composed by Guy Gross for the choreographers and dancers, Victoria Taylor and Stephen Page."
