        "This program looks at the two important links that Australia has established with the Middle East, settlers and trade. Afghan camel drivers, who opened up the outback and built the first mosques, were among the first Muslims who arrived in Australia last century. The eighties witnessed a new wave of Muslim settlers from Arab and Asian countries who established Islamic schools to ensure that their children maintained their Islamic values and traditions. This program also looks at the meat trade that Australia has developed with the Middle East exporting meat that has been slaughtered according to the religious requirements of Islam. NB: DEPICTS THE SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS AT AN ABATTOIR."
