        "Based on Anne Tyler's best-selling novel, this multi-award winning film tells the story of Macon Leary and his eccentric family who insulate themselves from the real, messy world of relationships by constructing an elaborate series of routines and protective behaviours. Until, that is, Macon meets Muriel and his sister Rose meets Macon's publisher. By turns funny and heartbreakingly sad, this film will linger in your memory. Cast includes William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, Geena Davis and Bill Pullman."
