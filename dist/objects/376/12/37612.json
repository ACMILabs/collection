        "Bette Davis is at her celebrated best in this Somerset Maugham melodrama about a Malaysian planter's wife (Bette Davis) accused of shooting a man who was a friend of both her and her husband (Herbert Marshall). She claims, and is believed, that it was self defence as he attacked and tried to rape her. Then a letter appears proving she had invited the man and that they were lovers. The attempt by her lawyer (James Stephenson) to suppress the letter leads to tragic consequences."
