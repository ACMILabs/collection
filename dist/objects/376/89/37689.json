        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Race to save the planet\". The concluding episode of this series focuses on individuals and organisations who are fighting for the survival of the planet. It emphasises that whilst international treaties and organisations play a major role, individuals can also make a significant difference. The need for cooperation between all nations, rich and poor, has never been more urgent as \"we need to make peace with each other in order to make peace with nature\". Narrated by Karina Kelly. A teacher's guide accompanies the video."
