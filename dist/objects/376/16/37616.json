        "A movie rendition of the Rudolf Friml/Herbert Stothart operetta, 'Rose Marie\", stars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. MacDonald is an opera singer whose brother, played by James Stewart, is an escaped convict wanted for murder. She follows him into the Rockies where she is romanced and serenaded by a handsome Canadian Mountie (Nelson Eddy). Actually filmed on location in the Rockies. The film includes many immortal melodies from the operetta as well as other songs and items from the operas Romeo and Juliet and Tosca. David Niven also appears briefly in the film which was refilmed in 1954."
