        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Around the world in 80 days\". Homeward bound covers days 28 to 79 of Michael Palin's (ex- Monty Python) 20th Century attempt to replicate the round-the-world trip of the fictional Phineas Fogg. The video takes us with Michael from Madras to Singapore via a Yugoslav freighter on which Palin works as a deckhand; from Singapore to Hong Kong and Shanghai, where Palin samples snake; from Shanghai to California via the eerie uninhabited world of a giant container ship and then by train, dog sled, balloon and ship on the last leg back to London."
