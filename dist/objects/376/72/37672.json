        "Episode of Series \"Writers of today\". A re-release of a '50s interview with American novelist, playwright and poet, Robert Penn Warren (\"All the King's Men\"). It was originally recorded for the Educational Television and Radio Center as part of a series, hosted by Walter Kerr, New York Herald Tribune drama critic, on the role of the writer as thinker and creative artist. Penn Warren discusses the value of teaching creative writing, the \"germ\" of an idea that \"fires up\" the writer, the sense of place and recurrent themes in his writing."
