        "A marvellous film version of the Jerry Bock/Sheldon Harnick Broadway musical. It tells the story of an impoverished Russian-Jewish family headed by Tevye (played by Topol), the village milkman, and his wife, Golda. Their three eldest daughters seek husbands of their own choosing rather than those chosen by the village matchmaker. Then a cruel anti-Jewish pogrom forces the family to flee to America and start a new life. The musical was itself adapted from Shalom Aleichem's story, \"Tevye and his Daughters\"."
