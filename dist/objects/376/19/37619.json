        "Tung is Vietnamese - a refugee and a teenager. He lives in the western suburbs of Sydney. The rest of his family, apart from his grandmother, are still in Vietnam. He drifts along in an alien Western environment, hanging out with a gang of young men from a similar background until his grandmother, herself disadvantaged and displaced in Australia, spurs him on to change his life. An eye-opening and realistic drama of cultural isolation in contemporary Australia."
