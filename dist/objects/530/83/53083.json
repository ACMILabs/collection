        "A film dramatically uncovering the process of creating art, in particular nude portrait painting. Set in rural France, Nicholas and girlfriend Marianne (Emmanuelle Beart) are affected by a visit to a local artist's stone mansion. The artist is a former famous painter Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli) who lives with his wife (Jane Birkin). Frenhofer wants Marianne to model for him and Nicholas, also an artist, pushes her to do it. A long film in two parts, director Jacques Rivette shows the development and challenges to the artist and his muse. Tension and soul searching evolves as an outcome of the creative process and painting technique is shown for each work (based on paintings by Bernard Dufour). Based on a book by Honore De Balzac. Winner of the Grand Prix at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival."
