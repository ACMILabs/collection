        "The heat is up in this award-winning documentary made by maverick dissident Michael Moore (\"Bowling for Columbine\") with his sharp wit and biting commentary on the United States' Government and contemporary America. President George W. Bush bares the brunt of this filmmaker's wrath as Moore, with his sense of humour intact, sets about to make clear to the world American foreign policy and its consequences. This is the sort of filmmaking that gets people thinking, talking and hopefully, taking action. Not only did \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" win awards but its popularity with the cinema-going public created a record at the box office for a documentary film and paved the way for other works in the genre to be more prominent in the cinema exhibition market. Winner of Best Picture at Cannes 2004."
