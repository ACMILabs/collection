It's a mammoth undertaking involving political lobbying and complex negotiations with immigration departments in Australia, the United States, Europe, Japan and the Philippines. This film sees Hoi battle the Australian Immigration Department bureaucracy as he tries to resettle 50 refugee familles in Australia. A moving and poignant documentary, this work provides an insight into the immigration debate through one man's struggle."
