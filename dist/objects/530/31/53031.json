        "Hailed as a masterpiece and a breakthrough in digital cinema, this single-take, feature length film is set in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. Throughout the piece, Sukurov uses a narrator to guide the viewer through the Hermitage past innumerable grand works, whilst also presenting history through a series of characters that appear to drift across the camera space, almost incidentally rather than deliberately. Elaborate costumes, sumptuous works of art and the ambitious scale make this a unique non-linear cinematic experience. In Russian with English subtitles. Also available on VHS [318954]."
