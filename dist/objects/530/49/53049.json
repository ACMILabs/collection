        "A comprehensive four disc set of the complete television series written and presented by Sir David Attenborough on the life of mammals. A moving orchestral score and majestic slow-motion wildlife cinematography is combined to great effect with the dulcet tones of Sir David making this another winning combination from the BBC/Discovery Channel co-production team. All ten episodes that make up the series run for approximately 50 minutes each. Music by Dan Jones and Ben Salisbury. Follow up website at www.bbc.co.uk/nature. Episode producers are: Mike Salisbury, Mark Lindfield, Vanessa Berlowitz, Neil Lucas and Huw Cordey. The episodes are: Ep.1 \"A Winning design\". Evolutionary finesse has gone someway to making the mammal an effective survivor. Ep.2 \"Insect hunters\" looks at the way some animals need to consume insects. Ep.3 \"Plant predators\" shows the call for for some mammals to vigorously consume plants. Ep. 4 \"Chisellers\" looks at mammals with sharp front teeth - rodents from around the world. Ep. 5 \"Meat eaters\" shows the carnivorous nature of some mammals - not as a choice but a case of survival. Ep. 6 \"Opportunists\" is about the adaptable omnivore's successful food choices. Ep. 7 \"Return to water\" shows the small number of mammals that through evolutionary necessity have returned to the water. Ep. 8 \"Life in the trees\" looks at tree dwelling mammals and their adaptation to that particular environment. Ep. 9 \"Social climbers\" looks at the community and group nature of some types of mammals. Ep. 10 \"Food for thought\" is a contemplation on the human as the most successful mammal of them all."
