        "Poor little rich-girl ends up being the governess to a widower and his three children aboard an old houseboat. Sophia Loren and Cary Grant steam up the screen in this classic romantic comedy, complete with luscious colour and 'VistaVision' widescreen presentation from 1950s cinema. Resplendent in divine gowns designed by Edith Head, Sophia Loren learns about life and love with a few song and dance routines along the way. The three lead children are also delightful in this witty and entertaining film. Cast includes Martha Hyer and Harry Guardino. Winner of two Academy Awards for Best Song and Best Screenplay, written by Melville Shavelson and Jack Rose."
