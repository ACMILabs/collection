        "Punctured with light-hearted comedic situations this thriller is part road movie, part gangster film. Adrian (Clayton Watson) who has severe amnesia and Trevor (Steady Eddy) who has cerebral palsy, are at a home for people with disabilities. When Brandon (Nathan Phillips), a local surf champion, turns up to do some Community Service as a result of a recent fracas, the three realise a road trip to the beach would break the monotony of daily life and provide some fun. Along the road they pick up the beautiful but mysterious hitchhiker Jo (Chloe Maxwell). The happy-go-lucky trip however takes a nasty turn as they stumble into a gang war and unwittingly find themselves in mortal danger. Cast includes Marg Downey."
