        "Urbane theatre is the setting for Jacques Rivette's romantic comedy, revolving around the love affairs (past and present) of six individuals. When Camille returns to Paris to star in a new play she is reunited with a soon-to-be-married old flame; meanwhile her director/lover becomes intrigued by an ingenue who is assisting him locate a long-lost Italian play, whose brother is swindling a vulnerable woman. In this droll work, Rivette contentedly draws on the \"life is art\" theme, whilst the leisurely pace allows his protagonists to explore their entanglements with an appealing mix of contemplation and whimsy."
