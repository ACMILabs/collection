        "Another Paul Morrissey film presented by Andy Warhol. Here is the Dracula story with the usual search for virgin blood. This very corny and at times funny film is quite gory and blood thirsty. The virgins, that Dracula seeks so hungrily and travels so far to find, unfortunately can not be found as the family of young aristocratic women are no longer virgins. Dracula becomes ill after drinking their blood. There is the usual killing of Dracula scene where the ever hissing vampire is having arms and legs removed by an axe. The blood flows rapidly and still the vampire hisses. A mixture of the erotic and the satirical. Featuring performances by Roman Polanski and Vittorio De Sica."
