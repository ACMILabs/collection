        "Set in a dull Michigan motel room, based on a one-act play, comes Richard Linklater's \"Tape\" shot digitally and edited using Final Cut software. Two high school friends Vince (Ethan Hawke) and John (Robert Sean-Leonard) re-unite as twenty-something adults to reminisce. Memory and real events are questioned with the arrival of Amy (Uma Thurman) who claims she was date-raped by both of them. Tense and gripping with wonderful performances from the three leads. Based on the stage play by Stephen Belber."
