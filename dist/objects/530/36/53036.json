        "After being ditched by his girlfriend, misanthropic stand-up comedian Roy Hollsdotter lapses into a downward spiral of self-loathing, hitting the self destruct button at every turn. Despite the appeals of best friend Simmo to get over it, Roy continues on his antagonistic journey swiping mercilessly at all who have the misfortune to cross his path. Filmed in The Esplanade's Gershwin Room, this black comedy is a searing portrait of a man at war with himself. Stars real-life stand up comedian Darren Casey in the title role. This disc also contains amusing early shorts by Matthew Saville."
