        "A woman at a nightclub is rejected by her gay, male lover, becomes suicidal and goes to the toilets to cut her wrists. She is prevented from further harm by the kindness of another gay man (played by Italian porn star Rocco Stiffredi) who follows her. Their conversation leads the woman to set up a challenge or deal, that she will pay this man and he is to listen and learn about how men see women's bodies. Over the next four nights the two engage in the most intimate acts and conversations in trying to work out the male/female sexual dynamic. From the controversial director of 1999's \"Romance\" Catherine Breillat wants to shock with close-ups of genitals and discussions of menstruation that are sure to affect some viewers. Almost banned from release in Australia. WARNING: SOME SCENES MAY DISTURB."
