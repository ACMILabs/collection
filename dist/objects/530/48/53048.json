        "Roman Polanski is a true auteur. Themes of ambiguity, sexual tension, insanity, and everyday tragedy make his surrealistic work inspirational and at the same time controversial. This three disc set presents three of his 1960's features. \"Knife in the water\" is Polanski's first feature. A married couple pick up a hitch hiker. Feelings of claustrophobia and sexual tension result as they are confined on a holiday in a small yacht. A jealous husband turns hostile. In Polish with English subtitles. \"Repulsion\" a psychological thriller focuses on the illusions and fantasies of a sexually repressed young woman (Catherine Deneuve). Being both repulsed and attracted by sex she has nightmares and horrific visions when alone for several days in her apartment. \"Cul-de-sac\" a black comedy where a strangely matched couple have their home invaded by two criminals. Life is disrupted by the eccentric and interesting gangsters. Tense and surreal. Cast include Donald Pleasance and Lionel Standing. Titles available on VHS. Title numbers 304192; 315657; 302532."
