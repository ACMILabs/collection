    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"Love is in the air\". Episode three of \"Love is in the air\" looks at the imprecise science of success in the pop music business. A large focus is on Kylie Mingoue, a phenomenally successful pop artist who has reinvented herself numerous times through her stellar career. Other artists such as Todd Hunter (from \"Dragon\") talk about the self-destructive streak within the band that sabotaged potential worldwide success; a sentiment echoed by James Freud from \"The Models\". Another artist examined in John Farnham, whose early success meant he was poison to radio stations for a time, but whose music won out through the persistence of his manager Glenn Wheatly. Also examines the succes of bands \"Air supply\", \"Crowded house\" and \"Savage garden\". Interviewees include Michael Gudinski, Glenn Wheatly, Nick Seymour, Darren Hayes and Kylie. Episode 4 (final) celebrates some of the greatest Australian songs and their writers, the stories behind which illustrate the ephemeral nature of pop songwriting. Interviewees include: James Reyne, Mark Seymour, Neil Finn, Richard Clapton and John Paul Young. An interesting and illuminating series."
