        "The Haunting directed by Robert Wise is a horror film. With impressive black and white cinematography and without the use of big special effects this is a fine example of a haunted house horror film. As an experiment on haunted houses an academic selects 'receptive' participants to take part in a study in supernatural phenomenon. Two being female and one who happens to be the inheritor on the house in question. There is an underlying lesbian tension between the female couple who are terrified and drawn together by the extremely frightening and inexplicable movements of the house. The film is a gripping and very well made horror film without high tech special effects. Cast includes Julie Harris, Claire Blood, Richard Johnson and Russ Tamblyn."
