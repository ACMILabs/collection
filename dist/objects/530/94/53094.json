        "Can world problems be solved by mathematical equations alone? This contemplative work ponders the marvels of the Universe and other scientific questions by engaging the viewer as if the curiosity and wonder of a child are re-lived through adult eyes. A woman investigates the writings of Albert Einstein and interviews contemporary physicists in a bid to answer some of her musings on his enlightened words. Einstein's written words are given voice by way of a gentle narration as our protagonist pours over old photos of him and uses white gloves to hold his original papers. Declares Einstein: \"..imagination is more important than knowledge..\" and this imaginative docu-drama really could ignite the enthusiasm of a young person (or one young at heart) to contemplate the scientific realm. Features Dr Trinh Xuan Thuan and Dr Francoise Balibar with actress Pascale Montpetit as the woman."
