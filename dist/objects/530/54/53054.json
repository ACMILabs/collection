        "Little Britain as seen on ABC television is a surreal comedy featuring lunatics, misfits, teenage delinquents and bad transvestites. The BAFTA award winning series was written and performed by Matt Lucas and David Williams who's range of the grotesque and, at the same time, everyday characters are set to surprise. Funny and perverse. Narrated by Tom Baker."
