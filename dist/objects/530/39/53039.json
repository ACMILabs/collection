        "Lars Von Trier's films are distinctive and this film is no exception having been shot not unlike televised theatre of the 1970s with a stark stage-like set. Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives in the township of Dogville as a fugitive running from a team of gangsters and seeking a safe haven. After some convincing from self-appointed town leader/philosopher Tom (Paul Bettany) the town agrees to hide her but at what price? Do they stay loyal to Grace or is the townsfolk's reckoning worse for Grace than the band of gangsters? Official selection for Cannes 2003. Cast includes Jean-Marc Barr, Lauren Bacall, Harriet Andersson and James Caan."
