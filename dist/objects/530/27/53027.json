        "Writer/director Mark Worth has created a fascinating documentary about the oft forgotten western region of the island of Papua (also known as Netherlands New Guinea, West Papua, Irian Jaya and Papua). This film provides insight into the history of \"West Papua\" and its flag \"The Morning Star\". Currently ruled by Indonesia, the film details political activist's struggle for independence and their forced exile from a climate of fervent Indonesian nationalism. The film reveals a turbulent history in which Australia, the US and the UN have played a part. Narrated by Rachel Griffiths, music composed by David Bridie. A National Interest Program from Film Australia produced with assistance from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation."
