        "Classic silent German cinema from the talented F.W.Murnau, 1926. \"The portals of darkness are open and the shadows of the dead hunt over the earth..\" opens the film with the prevailing theme of good versus evil as the devil Mephisto does a deal with alchemist Faust for his soul and potentially for dominion over the Earth - promising he will stop the plague that is rife throughout Faust's village. Faust reneges on the arrangement choosing love - much to the delight of Archangel St. Michael. Based on the original story by Goethe. Great cinematography and effects give the film a dark foreboding and general creepiness that add to the dramatic impact of the work. This edition features orchestral soundtrack by the Olympia Chamber Orchestra."
