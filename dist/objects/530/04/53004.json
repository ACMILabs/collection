        "After the death of her boyfriend a young aimless English woman living in the West of Scotland, assumes the authorship of his unpublished novel and absconds to Spain on a spiritual journey of self-discovery. Silently grieving and struggling to come to terms with his suicide, Morvern is an ambiguous character whose extreme actions belie her gentle, unassuming air. There is something wonderfully maladroit about Samantha Morton's performance, expertly conveying Morvern's despair, as she reconciles the calamitous events that subsequently turn to good fortune. The depressing milieu of the Scottish scenes contrast with Morvern's liberation in sun drenched Spain as she begins to revel in her freedom."
