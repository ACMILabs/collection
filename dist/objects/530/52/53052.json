        "Rusty is a lovable, trusty beagle that lives at an animal shelter full of a great variety of animals. The human couple who run the shelter are grandparents to two recently orphaned kids. All seems fine until two crooks steal some puppies in order to take the trust fund from the kids. Rusty and his animal friends set out on an adventurous rescue to put things straight. Talking animals and colourful country setting make this a film for the family to enjoy. Directed by Shuki Levy. Cast includes Hal Holbrook, Rue McClanahan, Laraine Newman. Voices provided by Suzanne Somers, Rodney Dangerfield and Bobcat Goldthwait."
