        "What is happiness? Through the journey of the everyday, five individuals' lives link in a way that alters their fate or outlook. Karma, hope and fate are explored in this tale set in amongst busy city dwellers all with the need to answer life's eternal questions of 'what is life?', 'what's in it for me?' and even 'how do I relate to others?' Co-written and directed by Jill Sprecher. Stellar ensemble cast includes John Turturro, Matthew McConaughey, Clea DuVall, Amy Irving, Tia Texada, Barbara Sukowa, Alan Arkin."
