        "Having spent her whole life in the 'accepted' role of wife and mother, elderly May appears distant and unaffectionate. Not very loved by either of her two adult children, May and husband Toots travel to London for a visit with the family. On the sudden death of her husband, May has an affair with a man half her age, who is also her daughter's boyfriend. The film explores contemporary life in London and the way families live with the dynamic of demands of work and relationships. It also proves age is no reason for loss of sexual desire but what about moral ethics?"
