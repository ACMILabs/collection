        "Following in the wake of the phenomenally successful horror film \"Ring\", this sequel (also directed by Hideo Nakata) picks up where the original ended. Mourning the death of her boyfriend and intrigued by the mystery of the evil spirit, Sadako, a journalist searches for Reiko and her son, who are missing. Whilst not containing the chilling scares of \"Ring\", this thriller manages to entertainingly and engagingly continue Sadako's story and the mysterious powers of the videotape that sentences those who watch it, to death. Cast includes: Miki Nakatani, Hitomi Sato, Kyoko Fukada, Nanako Matsushima and Hiroyuki Sanada."
