        "Episode of Series \"Love is in the air\". Episode 1 \"The Last Gig on Earth\": In the late 1950s and early 1960s big name international performing artists came from overseas to Australian shores and made lots of money for themselves and their Australian promoters. These talented performers not only shocked conservative Australian society with some of their personal antics but also served to inspire Australian artists to write and perform themselves. The start of the Australian popular music industry was born of copycat performances until we found our own voice. Some of the featured artists and people are: Little Richard, Mick Jagger, Joe Cocker, Johnny Ray, Franck Sinatra and Harry M. Miller. This episode written and produced by Richard Stomps. Episode 2 \"She's leaving home\": Helen Reddy was one of the talented and influential women who paved the way for other Australian women to make it big in the international pop scene. Hugely successful with over 14 songs in the American top 40 alone, Reddy was able to weather the tall poppy critics in Australia to pursue her career. Women have been Australia's most consistently successful musical export as evidenced by this fascinating documentary. Some of the featured artists are: Helen Reddy, Lana Cantrall, Marcia Hines, Patsy Anne Noble, Renee Geyer, Olivia Newton-John, Pat Carroll, Debra Byrne. This episode written by Claire Hedger and produced by Tony Wyzenbeek. Series narrated by Toni Collette."
