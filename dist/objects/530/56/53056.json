        "The daughter of a concubine falls into a forbidden romance with a fearsome warrior of lowly descent. With her beloved feared dead, Sullie agrees to marry an evil Chinese warlord, under pressure from her corrupted father. Director Kim Young-Jun combines sweeping grandeur with exciting martial arts, and wire-work special effects (conjuring \"Crouching tiger, hidden dragon\"), to create a historical action picture. Based on the manga by Korean writer Kim Hye-rin. Cast includes: Shin Hyun-Joon and Kim Hee-Seon."
