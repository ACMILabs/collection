        "Four mates go on the road with a mission - to scatter the ashes of a friend on the grave of Bon Scott, original frontman for rock band AC/DC. Struggling in their own way with adulthood, the lads get the band back together to live out their promise made to each other 12 years ago - that should any of them die they would be buried out West next to Scott. Living out this pact is harder than they think with a lot of obstacles getting in the way on their life-changing journey. Written and directed by Darren Ashton (co-writer Shaun Angus Hall). Cast includes Damon Gameau, Stephen Curry, Ryan Johnson, Callan Mulvey, Sam Worthington."
