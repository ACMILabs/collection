        "Political satire set in East Berlin circa 1990 \"Goodbye Lenin\" is a surprisingly light-hearted examination of life under Communist rule seen through the prism of one family. Just prior to the fall of the Berlin wall single mother Christiane falls into a coma, oblivious to the revolution of her beloved homeland. Fearing the shock of the uprising may hamper his mother's recovery, twenty-something Alex sets up an elaborate ruse in which he convinces her that the East has triumphed over the West. Working from this absurd premise director Wolfgang Becker deftly crafts a poignant and bittersweet work that at heart is a coming of age journey for Alex. Cast includes: Daniel Bruhl."
