        "Three works spotlighting the sex industry in America, by notorious documentary filmmaker, Nick Broomfield. \"Heidi Fleiss\" is about the infamous prostitute whose clientele included many top Hollywood players. Includes interviews with Fleiss, her colleagues and friends about the proceedings that led to her court case. \"Chicken Ranch\" is the name of the best-known legalised brothel in America; this piece observes the day-to-day lives of the women who work there. \"Fetishes\" explores the functions of the S&M parlor 'Pandoras Box' and various aspects of S&M, corporal punishment, whipping/slapping, wrestling fetish, rubber fetish, infantilism, slaves, humiliation, mistresses etc. Includes vivid footage of the parlor in operation. Broomfield's tendency to centre himself within the subject under investigaion is borne out in these works that, depsite this irritation, address compelling aspects of prostitutiuon."
