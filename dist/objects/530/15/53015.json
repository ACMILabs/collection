        "Impressive adaptation of two Frank Herbert novels, \"Dune Messiah\" and \"Children of Dune\" this made for television mini-series continues the epic science-fiction saga that is \"Dune\". On the desert planet of Dune, the ancient prophecy has been fulfilled - the rule of the legendary Maud'dib has triggered a miraculous transformation of the arid wastelands, and where there was once only desert, water now flows. But as always the great Houses of the Empire are awash with political intrigue and betrayal, ambition, desire and destiny. Enhanced by extensive use of CGI, this series ably captures the eerie otherworldliness of Herbert's desert setting whilst also establishing the requisite mordant tone. Cast includes Alec Newman, Julie Cox, Steven Berkoff and Susan Sarandon."
