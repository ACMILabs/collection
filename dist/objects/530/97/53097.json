        "Soldier girls closely follows a group of American women recruits through a gruelling six weeks of basic training, during which time, some manage and some fail to come to terms with some of the realities that recruiting brochures never mentioned. \"The Leader, his driver and the driver's wife\" Award-winning documentary shows what happens when the apparently shambolic Broomfield tries to make a film about the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance movement and its leader Eugene Terre Blanche. The result is both frightening and hilarious, as Broomfield lulls his subjects into portraying themselves in their true light and deflates the pompous rhetoric by refusing to take it seriously. \"Tracking down Maggie\" Humorous and revealing look into the political and private worlds of former British Prime Minister, Lady Margaret Thatcher, whose lack of compliance with Broomfield aids the production."
