        "Made for the Discovery Channel in America, \"Inside the kill Box: Fighting the Gulf War\" is an examination, strictly from an American and coalition perspective, of the strategies and weaponry that allowed a victory in Kuwait against Saddam Hussein. The Gulf war (1990-91) was considered to be the first war to be played live on television, and the graphics on display here, with tanks exploding and targets being decimated, makes one think of a video game. Features an array of interviews with various pilots, strategists, and soldiers, as well as with major players such as Dick Cheney, George Bush Snr, Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell. Two interviews of particular interest are with two pilots who were tortured under captivity. Whilst the technical analysis of the war tools is interesting, there remains a pro-America sentiment that disallows any semblance of a balanced perspective."
