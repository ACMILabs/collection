        "A documentary about the failed production of a feature film directed by Terry Gilliam that was to be called \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\". The documentary takes us through the pre-production process from storyboards and script development to costume and set design. Leading up to the start of production all that is missing are the actors! The all-star cast would have included Johnny Depp, Jean Rochefort and Vanessa Paradis. Only six days into production the film strikes a series of events of bad luck, which include Acts of God, cast illness, insurance complications and staff quitting. After developing the film for ten years, director Terry Gilliam looses ownership of his script and the whole project is abandoned. A very useful tool to those teaching/studying filmmaking, this documentary explains the process of feature filmmaking and its inherent risks. Includes interviews with key members of the production, including Australian 1st AD Phil Patterson. Narrated by Jeff Bridges. Two-disc set with over four hours of special features."
