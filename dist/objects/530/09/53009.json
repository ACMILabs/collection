        "Episode of Series \"The World at war\". Part 8: \"Desert: The war in North Africa\" The Germans are driven from North Africa but target Italy. Part 9: \"Stalingrad\" The German Army is defeated at Stalingrad. Part 10: \"Wolfpack\" Germany attempts to starve Britain by attacking ships bringing supplies from North America. Part 11: \"Red Star\" The story of Russia's massive lonely war with its 20,000,000 military and civilian casualties. Part 12: \"Whirlwind\" The blitz on Britain brings strident public demand for revenge. Part 13: \"Tough Old Gut\" Winston Churchill describes Italy to Stalin as the \"soft underbelly of the crocodile\". It is his arguments that persuade the Americans to join the Allies. Part 14: \"It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow\" Monsoonal conditions for five months of every year and disease make the lot of the Burma Army \"just another nightmare\". Europeans find jungle conditions alien and the Japanese ability to not only endure but to thrive in the same circumstances helps build a \"superman\" myth among the Allied soldiers. Part 15: \"Homefires\" After the defeat in the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe changes the direction of their bombing raids from London to provincial cities. Also available on VHS [301586], [301623], [301621], [301625], [301628]."
