        "From the world of politics a local hero emerges in the form of a 'man of the people' - Wally, Wally Norman (Kevin Harrington). Directed by Ted Emery (Kath & Kim) comes this comedy about the machinations of political life when a country town crucial for a win at the next federal election, finds itself with a dilemma. The local meat works is closed down and sleazy Ken Oath (Shaun Micallef) corrupt politician wants to win at any cost. Local man Wally Norman, unable to give speeches due to extreme fear, finally overcomes his inertia to lead the town he feels passionate about - Givens Head - and they elect their new leader. Set to the strains of Jimmy Barnes \"Working Class Man\", this film pokes fun at politicians and is a cheer for the underdog. Opening night film for the Sydney Film Festival 2003. Cast includes Greig Pickhaver and Alan Cassell and was written by Andrew Jones and Rick Kalowski."
