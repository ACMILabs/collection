        "How close Australia came during the 1950s and '60s to creating our own weapons of mass destruction is revealed in this edifying documentary. During the secrecy of the Cold War era, Australia's Atomic Energy Commission, run by Sir Phillip Baxter, was set up to push an atomic weaponry solution to fortify Australian defences. Now uncovered \"Top Secret\" documents from the era demonstrate the machinations of government and our tentative relations with the Allies when it came to the nuclear question. Research reactors, guided missile test sites and \"The Bomb\" at Woomera are all discussed, as is \"Operation Blowdown\", a secret event where 50 Tons of TNT was exploded in Far North Queensland to illustrate the possible effect of a nuclear strike in jungle terrain and its implications for foot soldiers. Narrated by Robyn Williams. Part of Film Australia's National Interest Program series, produced with assistance from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation."
