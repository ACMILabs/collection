        "This DVD features the work of director Spike Jonze (\"Being John Malkovich\",\"Adaptation\") from video clips to short films. Before his current success directing feature films, Jonze specialised in directing humorous, inventive and slightly bizarre video clips, spanning a decade. Bands featured include: Wax, Beastie Boys, The Pharcyde, The Breeders, Daft punk, Fatlip, Weezer, Fatboy slim, Dinosaur Jr, and The Chemical Brothers. Some of the clips are quite inventive, playing to Jonzes sense of absurdity and irony. Jonzes short films are just delightful, especially Amarillo by morning; as are the rarities which include footage detailing the Oasis video that never happened and Rockafella Skunks audition tape for Fatboy Slim."
