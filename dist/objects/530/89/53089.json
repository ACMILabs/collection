        "A masochistic East German is washed up on a beach, and goes about searching for Jane Fonda (then in her aerobics queen era) in order to recruit her to the cause of communism. He hooks up with a group of outsiders, selling junk at a local flea market, whilst others prostitute themselves. Failing in his quest to recruit Jane, the young man embraces the American lifestyle auditioning for Madam Wang - owner of a venue that gives punk bands a start. With this social satire, director and Warhol cohort, Paul Morrissey targets the consumerist American lifestyle, whilst finding pathos amid the characters fringe dwelling. Please note: the quality of the transfer is of average quality."
