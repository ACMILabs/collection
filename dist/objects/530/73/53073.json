        "Written, produced and directed by Samuel Fuller \"The Naked Kiss\" is a low-budget, tabloid melodrama. Its main character, a prostitute, wants to change her ways and ends up working in a hospital helping the handicapped. This moralistic and exploitative film is a unique look at outcasts showing the harsh realities that exist behind a seemingly civilized society. Outrageous in its time \"The Naked Kiss\" is a strange mixture of the moralistic and the perverse existing in suburbia. Cinematography by Stanley Cortez. Cast include Constance Towers, Anthony Eisley, Michael Dante and Virginia Grey."
