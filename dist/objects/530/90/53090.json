        "The desolation of the characters of \"Trash\" is clear from the outset as a go-go dancer attempts to fellate the impotent Joe (Joe Dallesandro) whose interest in sex appears to have diminished under the weight of heroin addiction. The narrative sees a succession of men and women try to seduce Joe, who remains indifferent to them all. Joe's girlfriend, played by transvestite Holly Woodlawn, despairs of their lifestyle, but nevertheless has a preoccupation with trawling through trash for discarded treasure. Part of a Paul Morrissey/Joe Dallesandro/Andy Warhol, trilogy \"Trash\" examines the seedy underbelly of New York life - the junkies, hustlers, hookers and marginalised artists, some of whom were a part of Warhol's \"Factory\". Long considered an underground classic, \"Trash\" is a non-linear examination of culture and the inequities evident to those hanging at the lower echelons of society. Features full frontal nudity, sexual scenes and graphic drug use. Please note: scenes may disturb some viewers."
