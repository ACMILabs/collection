        "A fine example of low budget filmmaking executed with a realistic fervour. Set in Sydney's Cabramatta, three homeless youth struggle with the boredom, danger and many frustrations of life on the streets. Tommy (Jason McGoldrick) tries to overcome his drug addiction that started at a very young age. Van (Joe Le) sleeps in a car park but finds an unlikely camaraderie with a girl named Carla. Des (Rodney Anderson) gets involved with crims to try and etch out a living for himself and his pregnant girlfriend. Portrayed with a realism brought about by a young cast performing for film for the first time and based on a script written by those living a hard life, \"The Finished People\" provides a powerful insight into the world of homeless youth in suburban Australia. Although sometimes grim, moments of true human connection demonstrate that these young adults are not 'Finished People' at all."
