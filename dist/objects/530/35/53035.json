        "Remarkable work, that is part road-movie, about an Australian family who befriend an Afghanistan refugee (via letters), held in Port Hedland, their relationship with him and their attempts to free him. Clara Law (Goddess of 1967) accompanies the family on a 12,000 kilometre round trip taken to visit Ali, exploring the dynamics of the family and laying bare the cruel bureaucracy of the Australian government that holds refugees in detention centres for limitless periods, under dire conditions. A ponderous and significant work that contains moments of beauty whilst conveying the pain and anguish of all involved. Also available on VHS [318951]."
