        "Eating nothing but McDonald's for one month, Morgan Spurlock discovers the effects of fast-food first-hand. Under medical supervision, he proves by his experiment that junk food does make you sick - and while it is a bit extreme to eat \"Maccas\" three meals a day, the film shows how American society is making itself unwell by eating fast food in great amounts and that obesity is one of the largest causes of illness and death in the country. The \"Super Size\" refers to the larger sizes on offer and Morgan makes the rule that when offered a Super Size he must eat it! Winner of Best Director 2004 Sundance Film Festival."
