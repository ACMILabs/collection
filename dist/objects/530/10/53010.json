        "Episode of Series \"The World at war\". Part 16: \"Inside the Third Reich\" In the summer of 1940 the German forces are the conquerors of Western Europe, and the sense in Germany is that the war is over. Part 17: \"Morning\" In the early morning of 5 June 1944, the largest amphibian invasion force ever gathered reaches the beaches of Normandy. Part 18: \"Occupation\" The Netherlands, a neutral country, is attacked without warning in 1940 and capitulates. Part 19: \"Pincers\" With the liberation of Paris on August 25, 1944, the war seems to be as good as over. The American plans advance on a broad front. Part 20: \"Genocide\" Addresses the essentials of Nazism in regards to philosophy, politics and race. Part 21: \"Nemesis\" Thousands die as the RAF and USAF attack by night and day. Allied prisoners-of-war are released by their advancing comrades, while German soldiers are captured by the thousands. Part 22: \"Japan 1941-1945\" Japan continues to defend the homeland, unaware of the terrible weapon to be used against them. Part 23: \"Pacific\" The Allied Pacific offensive comes under the command of two rivals: General MacArthur, sweeping upwards from the Solomons and New Guinea to the Philippines, and Admiral Nimitz, in the Gilberts at Tarawa. Also available on VHS [301628], [301629], [301630], [301631]."
