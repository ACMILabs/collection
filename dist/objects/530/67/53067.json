        "This Academy Award nominated documentary focuses on eight children competing in a championship spelling bee. We see behind the scenes meeting the finalists and their families. The tension of the competition is gripping as is looking into the varying backgrounds of the contestants. The high pressure world of the spelling bee and the pressure placed on the contestants can cause a sweat in not only the contestant and their parents but also the viewer. Gruelling competition and high drama are found in this compelling documentary. Having the background knowledge on the competitors adds to the overall enjoyment. Notable is the fact that the winners in most cases are from ethnic backgrounds who are willing to work hard and succeed. There is certainly a great deal of face pulling and mental strain in this moving and exciting film."
