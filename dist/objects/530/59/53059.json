        "Based on the novel \"Rain\" by Kirsty Gunn from New Zealand filmmaker Christine Jeffs comes the story of an adolescent girl's life-changing summer holiday. The girl's parent's marriage is not strong and her mother has an affair with another holiday-maker, fuelled along by alcohol. Confusion and jealousy occur in the young girl's mind as she tries to come to terms with her own sexual awakening while trying to decipher adult relationships. Moody and atmospheric, the pace of the film is as leisurely as the holiday with gentle seaside in the day and partying parents at night. A mix of carefree playfulness (as the girl and her young brother frolic in this idyll) with a darker foreboding and uneasiness just under the surface. Original soundtrack by Neil Finn. Cast includes Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki, Sarah Peirse, Marton Csokas, Alistair Browning, Aaron Murphy."
