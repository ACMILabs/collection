        "Comprehensive and well-researched documentary about the history of terrorism tracing it from to the 1940s, to the present day. Using archival footage, and a slew of enlightening interviews the filmmakers address the methodologies, ideologies and outcomes of terrorism, tackling an array of worldwide historical events. \"In the name of liberation\" This segment covers the wars fought, over the decades, in the name of liberating homelands. Topics covered include the conflict in Palestine, the war in Algiers against the French, the Malay versus the British, the South African conflict and the ANC, and the bombings in Ireland. \"In the name of the revolution\" Examines guerrilla warfare of the 20th century and clashes in Cuba, Peru, Italy and Germany in the name of revolution. Key players in these conflicts are interviewed, explaining their motivations at the time, with many reflecting upon what those outcomes mean to them now. \"In the name of God\" Examines acts of terrorism committed in the name of religion. Conflicts covered include the 1970 hijacking of several airplanes, in order to draw attention to Palestine - regarded as the world's first media terrorist event. Topics covered include: September 11, suicide bombers, Osama Bin Laden, the 1997 terrorism attack in Egypt, Islam, Al Qaeda, Jihad, Zionism, issues in the Middle East and Palestine, conflicts in the Arab world, battles between Jews and Muslims, and militant groups that dominate terrorism. \"In the name of the state\" Examines the issues of state sponsored terror. What happens when governments commit acts of terrorism and torture against their own people? Looks at the situation in Argentina in the 1970s, when state sanctioned terror saw the disappearance and torture of innumerable citizens, many of whom were never seen again. One interviewee, a survivor of torture describes how pregnant women were made to give birth under captivity only for the babies to be given to military families. Also looks at Iranian state sponsored terrorism."
