        "Episode of Series \"Love is in the air\". Love is in the air is an entertaining series about the history of Australian music on television. This episode largely celebrates the great ABC pop show from the 1970s \"Countdown\". Coming out of left field \"Countdown\" was a deliberate attempt by national broadcaster ABC to court teenagers, and they responded with gusto. The show became so enormously popular that it gained iconic status; whilst at the same time gave many acts their big break. Such acts, featured on this episode include: Sherbet, Skyhooks, John Paul Young, Marcia Hines, and Split Enz. \"Countdown\" also attracted high-calibre international guests like Elton John, Rod Steward and Madonna. Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum the show's irreverent presenter and talent scout became an international personality. Australian variety television shows of the 1950s, and 1960s, celebrating yodelling, slap-stick and vaudevillian artists, paved the way for \"Countdown\", which certainly shared with its predecessors an anarchic spirit, and passion for showcasing distinctly Australian culture. Made up of an array of interviews from past alumni, this episode features a heap of excerpts from the \"Countdown\", including memorable clips, songs and interviews."
