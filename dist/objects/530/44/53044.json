        "An illegal immigrant in urban London, Okwe, is working as a cab driver and doing the nightshift as a hotel receptionist (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is sharing a flat with one of the hotel's maids, Senay, (Audrey Tautou's first English speaking role) who is also an illegal but dreams of escaping to live in America. Initially the film is more a character study of the pair always living in fear of deportation and struggling with poverty but soon develops into a thriller as one night, a gruesome discovery in room 510's blocked toilet, leads to blackmail and involvement with London's sordid underworld. Cast includes Sergi Lopez, Benedict Wong and Sophie Okonedo."
