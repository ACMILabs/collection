        "A would-be farmer, Jason Young, and his partner take on an abandoned farm property, with the view to running a small hobby-farm, and horse-riding school. Whilst Julia attends to the horse-business Jason decides to experiment with raising an array of animals with a view to eating them, in order to bring himself closer to the processes of animal husbandry that so many have become immune to. Thus begins Jason's year of discovery as he buys, bonds, feeds, tends and lovingly breeds the animals. At certain points when Jason is called upon to slaughter the animals he confronts the issues around meat eating, and is moved by the bonds he has formed with the various breeds. Although at times simplistic, this documentary nevertheless teases out the issues of the meat consumer industry, human-animal relationships and the ethical treatment of animals. Contains scenes of animal slaughter. Please note: some scenes may disturb."
