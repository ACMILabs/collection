        "The first intertitle declares \"This song of the Man and his Wife is of no place and every place; you might hear it anywhere and at anytime\". This is true of the film as it is a timeless tale of love and redemption. Tempted by a femme fatale, the Man, a poor farmer, is seduced by the idea of murdering his wife to run off to the city with the object of his adulterous love. Academy Award winning, classic silent cinema from German director F.W. Murnau, his first American production. Screenplay by Carl Mayer. Digitally restored and remastered with the original and an alternative new soundtrack, as well as other special features on two discs. Cast includes George O'Brien, Janet Gaynor, Margaret Livingston."
