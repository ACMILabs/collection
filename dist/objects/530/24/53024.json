        "This documentary examines the experiences of four women fighting for social justice. Each is from a different culture but they are united by a refusal to remain silent and by their pursuit of human rights justice. Explosive devices tells the story of Doris Nuval, a former terrorist who is utilizing the power of television to bring justice to the Philippines. The Price of freedom outlays Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrins struggle against womens oppression and the forces of fundamentalism. Breaking the caste investigates Fathima Burnards aim to empower the Dalait women of India, thus changing a 3000 year old caste system. Heart on the sleeve Hien Tran is the voice for thousands of Australian outworkers who work for a pittance, under exploitative circumstances."
