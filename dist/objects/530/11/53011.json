        "Episode of Series \"The World at war\". Part 24: \"The Bomb\" The world's first atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Four days later a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Part 25: \"Reckoning\" The end of the war in Central Europe is a time without pity. The intervention of outsiders from Russia and America means that no European nation can win. Part 26: \"Remember\" In the Second World War twenty million Russians died - in action, in captivity, fighting men and women, and ordinary civilians killed in bombing raids. Germany lost nearly five million dead, and two and a half million Japanese died. America lost nearly three hundred thousand men. Also available on VHS [301619]."
