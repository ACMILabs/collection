        "What strange and sometimes nasty things go on behind closed doors in suburbia is what this feature, written and directed by Rolf de Heer, is all about. An emotionally spent housewife Alexandra (Helen Buday) organises a birthday surprise for her husband and father of her two children. After enduring years of financial and emotional shutdown at the hands of her husband (Gary Sweet), Alexandra seeks revenge and sets about to undo her husband to the level at which she feels she has been wronged. Set for the most part within the four walls of the family home \"Alexandra's Project\" is a tense, sexual and unsettling drama. Nominated for five Australian Film Institute Awards and three IF Awards. Contains sex scenes."
