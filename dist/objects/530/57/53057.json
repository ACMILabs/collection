        "Four suburban families and four seemingly separate stories about the struggles of daily life. Life that's messy around the edges - how we deal with our problems and each other when living the suburban life are explored in this film. Consumer society, shopping and personal objects - how important are they when compared with love and family? Written and directed by Rose Troche, based on a book of stories by A.M.Homes. Cast includes Glenn Close, Dermot Mulroney, Jessica Campbell, Patricia Clarkson, Joshua Jackson, Moira Kelly."
