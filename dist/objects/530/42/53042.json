        "Follow the journey of music composer Tommy Matisse (Dan Speilman) as he studies music in England - a world away from lover Alysse (Abie Cornish) back in Australia. His creative process is to listen to the sounds around him, make music that moves him and affects others. The bond of music might or might not be strong enough to reunite the two when through family tragedy Tommy returns to Australia. Original music by David Hobson. Debut feature film by director Paul Currie. Cast includes Kerrie Armstrong, Leeanna Walsman, Andrew Howard, Nathan Phillips."
