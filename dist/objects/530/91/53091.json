        "Peter Morrissey and Andy Warhol collaborate in this mordant satire about the women's movement and its impact. Three transvestites - Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling - play the three lead roles, and in a series of melodramas, rage about their lot and how to overcome it. In an attempt at liberation the women launch a revolutionary feminist group called PIGS (Politically Involved Girls). With three extravagant, outrageous performances, this is more stream-of-consciousness theatre than linear cinema, providing a brilliant lampooning of society and 1970s feminism."
