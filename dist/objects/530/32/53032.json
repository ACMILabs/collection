        "A ruminative work of great beauty, contemplation and poignancy, \"Yi-yi\" is a film about three generations of a Taiwanese family, grappling with the notions of regret and acceptance of life's turbulence. Director Edward Yang (highly regarded for his sprawling masterpiece \"Brighter, sunny day\") shows great understanding of the human condition giving his protagonists space for introspection as they reflect over their fate. Winner of Best Director at Cannes 2000, this is an intelligent, detailed piece, which accumulates to create a complex tapestry -- about alienation in modern life, dysfunctional families and the desire for happiness. Cast includes: Wu Nien-Jen, Kelly Lee, Elaine Jin, Chen Xisheng, and Jonathan Chang."
