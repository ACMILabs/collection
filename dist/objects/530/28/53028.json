        "Another first for Australian medical science is revealed in this fascinating documentary about Dr John Cade. Cade was a POW in Changi during World War II and during his time there he made the link between mental illness and body chemistry. At the time there were no other treatments for the mentally ill other than shock treatment, lobotomy and institutionalisation. With his wife and two young sons (who grew up in the grounds of a hospital), Cade's research done whilst a doctor in residence, paved the way for the current treatment of bi-polar disorder and for chemical treatment of the mentally ill. The naturally occurring salt 'lithium' he worked with meant that the pharmaceutical companies were initially resistant to embrace his findings but those who followed up on his initial research and doctors who pursued the use of the salts, have resulted the de-institutionalisation of many people the world over and a revolution in the treatment of the mentally ill. A mixture of re-creations of the era, original historical footage and of contemporary interviews, this film serves as an interesting historical account as well as an educational resource. A Film Australia National Interest Program, developed with the assistance of Film Victoria and produced in association with SBS Independent."
