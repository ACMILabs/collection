        "Set in the time of the Mexican revolution, Juan (Rod Steiger), a leader of a gang of bandits, meets an IRA explosives expert, Sean Mallory (James Coburn) who is on the run in Mexico to avoid detention by the British. Juan wants Sean to use his explosives skills to help rob a bank but Sean is taken by the cause of the revolutionaries and gets involved with them. A fine example of the spaghetti western: a Ennio Morricone soundtrack, direction by Sergio Leone and great use of widescreen vistas all topped off with action and gritty characters. Cast includes Romolo Valli."
