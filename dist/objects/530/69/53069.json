        "Feature film debut for video filmmaker Michel Gondry and follow-up for writer Charlie Kaufman of \"Being John Malkovich\" fame. A quirky love triangle about dysfunctional people all wanting acceptance, or is it just sex they are after? Lila (Patricia Arquette) is covered in body hair and loves the solitary life of the wild-outdoors but her sexual needs take her to the city. After some intensive hair removal by an electrolysis expert (Rosie Perez), Lila finds love with scientist Nathan (Tim Robbins) who experiments on mice, teaching them table manners. Together they find a wild man (Rhys Ifans) who was raised by apes, whom Nathan and his lusty French assistant (Miranda Otto) name \"Puff\". After Nathan's taming and re-training of Puff, Lila wants to free Puff from the laboratory allowing him return to his true nature."
