        "This austere work from Gus Van Sant, based on the Columbine High School tragedy, presents two days in the life of the young killers and their victims. Following on from the style set in \"Gerry\" (2002) Van Sant allows long takes and unobtrusive camera work to watch the students in their milieu. Van Sant displays ordinary teenagers beset by loneliness, pettiness, insecurities and rivalry. Cast includes: Alex Frost, Eric Deulen, John Robinson, Elias McConnell and Jordan Taylor. Also available on VHS [319040]."
