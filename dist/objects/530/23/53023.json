        "In 1974 after 460 years of Portuguese rule, Fretilin, the revolutionary front for an independent East Timor, declared independence in the small nation. Ten days later Indonesia invaded. Fretilin and the resistance army fought the Indonesian military over the next 24 years, with over 250,000 people dying as a result of the occupation. In 1999, the East Timorese people voted overwhelmingly for independence, but as the Indonesian army and local militia withdrew, chaos ensued, razing the country to the ground. This two-part documentary recounts incredible stories from East Timor after the country is reborn as an independent nation. Episode one: Rosas story is about a young widow and mother of six, living in abject poverty with her children scattered in various orphanages. She saves for the fare to reunite her family for the first time expressing her hope for their future. Episode two: Lu Olos story is about a man who survived twenty years in the armed resistance. Having accepted an elevated rank, Lu Olo faces the difficulties in transitioning from guerilla fighter to politician."
