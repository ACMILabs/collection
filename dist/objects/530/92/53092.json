        "Fascinating documentary about the life and work of one of the twentieth century's most influential artists - Andy Warhol. Originally born Andrew Warhola to immigrant Slovakian parents, this tale starts with a history of his family life in Pittsburgh and travails his life's work up to his death in 1987. Not unlike his films, the vision lingers on the exteriors of buildings, the beauty of the everyday through signs and architecture set against a moving sky. The facts are rendered easily to memory as the images are beautiful to watch and the narration by Julian Rhind-Tutt engaging. The only American artist to have a museum dedicated to him, Warhol's obsessive behaviour in documenting his life (over 600 time capsules were created by the artist) fills the museum. His audio-tapes, art, magazine publishing, band and other enterprises are discussed through interviews with friends, family and fans and demonstrated by an elegant assemblage of photos and ephemera."
