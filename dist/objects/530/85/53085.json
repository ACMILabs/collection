        "Largely interpreted as a send-up of \"Sunset Boulevard\", this is the story of Joe (Joe Dallesandro) a handsome, ambitious would-be actor who, whilst staying in a shoddy LA Motel, sleeps with an array of staff and customers, anyone in fact who he believes will further his career. Joe displays all the hallmarks of a jaded hustler - a man beyond enjoyment of sex, but one for whom sex is the main currency. The final instalment of the \"Flesh/Trash/Heat\" trilogy, between Paul Morrissey, Joe Dallesandro and Andy Warhol, this is the most linear of their work and the least experimental. It contains some wonderfully satirical humour whilst remaining focused (as \"Heat\" and \"Trash\" did also) on Dallesandro's physical beauty. Cast also includes Sylvia Miles, Ray Vestal, Andrea Feldman and Pat Ast."
