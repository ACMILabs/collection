    "description": [
        "Episode of Series \"The Sopranos\". Season four of this award-winning television series created by David Chase. The dark exploration of masculinity, abuse and violence which is central to this series exemplifies what is unique to The Sopranos: terrific writing, outstanding performances and a daring audacity to fully explore the brutality of contemporary culture in the US. The mores and ethics of organised crime seem an apt metaphor for the capitalist system. Ep 1 \"For all debts public and private\" Tony tries to raise cash for investments, whilst Carmela pushes for traditional insurance. Uncle Junior frets about his impending trial. Ep 2 \"No show\" With Paulie behind bars, Christopher is assigned his turf. Meadow considers taking a year off college. Ep 3 \"Christopher\" The first Soprano trial in 16 years commences; Italian pride causes an array of troubles. Ep 4 \"The Weight\" Johnny Sack embarks on a bloody vendetta; Carmela develops a close relationship with Furio, encountering Tony problems. Ep 5 \"Pie o my\" Carmela and Tony continue to disagree over the finances; Uncle Junior faces problems in court. Ep 6 \"Everybody hurts\" Tony gives greater responsibility to Christopher; Meadow joins the right side of the law. Ep 7 \"Watching too much television\" Tony and the gang throw a release-party for Paulie. Furio finds himself attracted to Carmela. Ep 8 \"Mergers & acquisitions\" Tony meets an attractive art dealer; Paulie tries to integrate his mother into her nursing home; Carmela discovers a new source of income. Ep 9 \"Whoever did this\" Uncle Junior develops a new defence strategy; Tony brings Svetlana back into their lives; tragedy strikes Ralph's son. Ep 10 \"The Strong, silent type\" Tony tracks down Ralph; Furio struggles with his feelings for Carmela; Christopher's heroin addiction turns catastrophic. Ep 11 \"Calling all cars\" Dreams persue Tony through the night; Tony contemplates business decisions; Dr Melfi works on the undercurrents of Tony's dreams but he wants out. Ep 12 \"Eloise\" Tony haggles over profits; Paulie's loyalty is called into question. Ep 13 \"Whitecaps\" Tony battles to keep the family together."
