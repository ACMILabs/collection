        "Based on the book \"The Kid stays in the picture\" by Robert Evans comes this documentary about the life of Robert Evans. Good looking actor turned producer and at quite a young age, the head of production at Paramount Studios. This self-made maverick decided that he wanted the power that came with being a producer, witnessed when he, as a young actor, was going to be sacked from a film because he was an unknown. He stayed \"in the picture\" and as head of the Studio in the late 1960s and early 1970s was responsible for some of the era's best films such as \"The Godfather\", \"Rosemary's Baby\", \"Love Story\", \"The Odd Couple\", \"Harold and Maude\" and \"Chinatown\". Original interviews and footage from the era combine with a voiceover narration by Robert Evans to give this documentary a lively pace - suited to a man who was once married to Ali MacGraw, had money and power, an unfortunate drug habit and his name muddied by a murder trial. A revealing look into some of the machinations of the Hollywood studio system and the luxurious Hollywood lifestyle."
