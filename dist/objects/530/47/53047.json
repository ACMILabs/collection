    "description": [
        "Since the early 1960s Christo and Jean-Claude's large-scale temporary works of art have worked to change our perceptions of the relationship between art and society - so writes famed documentary filmmaker Albert Maysles, a close friend of the Christos' who has, over the decades, studied their numerous struggles to see their art realised. In these five documentaries Christo and his wife's work habits are laid bare including their ambitions and conflicts with bureaucrats which constitute a significant portion of their work. Works include: \"Christos Valley Curtain\" Academy Award nominated film that celebrates the hanging of a huge orange curtain between two Colorado mountains. \"Running Fence\" An engrossing document of the efforts to build a 24 and 1/2 mile long, 18 foot high fence of white fabric across the hills of Northern California. \"Islands\" Christo and Jean-Claude fight to surround eleven islands in Miami's Biscayne Bay with 6.5 million square feet of bright pink fabric. \"Christo in Paris\" The wrapping of the Pont Neuf in Paris and a portrait of the artists lasting love affair. \"Umbrellas\" Thousands of umbrellas are simultaneously opened in rice-farming valley in Japan and across a cluster of cattle ranches in southern California. This is great collection about an iconic artist at work that is accompanied by fascinating commentaries, a glossy booklet and an extensive interview with the artists."
