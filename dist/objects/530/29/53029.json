        "Exciting thriller, and huge box-office hit in Hong Kong, \"Infernal affairs\" is about two undercover agents, on opposing sides of the law, who are each charged with ferreting the other out. Tony Leung and Andy Lau star as the two double agents conflicted by loyalty, duty and honour to the men they are entrusted to bring down. With Christopher Doyle (regular DOP to Wong Kar-Wai) serving as visual consultant the film has real flair showing a glorious steely city life, all glinting exteriors and reflected surfaces, providing an apt metaphor for the protagonists' dilemmas."
