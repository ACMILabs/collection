        "Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine's (Kate Winslet) relationship isn't going too well so she engages a psychiatrist to employ a process whereby Joel and the relationship is erased from her memory. On finding out about the procedure Joel thinks he'll do the same but the couple actually re-discover more about the start of their relationship and what brought them together in the first place. In a quirky look at relationships, break-ups and a kind of love-conquers-all mystique this romantic/black comedy stems from the same key team that put together \"Human Nature\" - director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman. Cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson."
