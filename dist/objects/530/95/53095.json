        "In World War II thousands of German prisoners-of-war were sent to camps in Canada where they saw out the war, many for several years. This documentary examines the experiences of a few of those men, as well as presenting the perspectives of the Canadian guards. Filmmaker Eva Colmers (a German-born resident of Canada) focuses on the story of her father - a POW who has fond memories of his time in captivity. If this seems disingenuous, it is through a series of interviews that he reveals that he was well fed, well treated and educated during his confinement. Of interest here is also the workings of a POW camp -- how the men strictly adhered to their rank and values as soldiers, even remaining loyal to Hitler. What is clear is that they were treated with respect that fostered loyalty, to the point where the prisoners were released to work on farms, and as lumberjacks, and were even allowed at times, to wander beyond the barbwire. Overall this is a fascinating tale that mixes interviews with archival footage, thus presenting a very humanistic slant on what was a cruel and murderous time in history."
