        "Ring O: Birthday, a prequel to the phenomenally successful \"Ring\" and \"Ring 2\" films by Hideo Nakata, provides the back-story of Sadako - the murdering, vengeful spirit that haunts the living via video-tape. Set in the 1960s, Sadako is a shy student, who earns the wrath of her colleagues when she attracts the attention of the drama club director. Suspicions about Sadako rise when mysterious deaths start to occur. With less thrills and shocks of the originals, \"Ring 0\" still impresses with its tension and dramatic staging of Sadako's tragic past. Cast includes Yukie Nakama, Seiichi Tanabe and Yoshiko Tanaka."
