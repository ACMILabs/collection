        "This mockumentary is set during Manchester's rise in the music world from the late 70's post punk era through to the 80's rave scene. Inspired by the Sex Pistols Tony Wilson (Steve Coogan) a Cambridge graduate television presenter, starts a record label signing up the band \"Joy Division\" and then on to running the \"Hacienda\" nightclub. From depressive post punk morbidness comes \"New Order\" and then \"Happy Mondays\" are found. This hedonistic and exciting film shot on digital video shows well the life of drugs, excess and seedy dealing that go hand in hand with the music industry. \"24 Hour Party People\" is very funny. Those who were around during this important era will enjoy the soundtrack and reminisce to the sounds of \"Joy Division\", \"New Order\", \"Buzzcocks\", \"The Clash\" and the \"Happy Mondays\". Tough Northern humour, outrageous self abuse and self mocking throughout this is a fine portrayal of the Manchester music scene."
