        "A police detective (Al Pacino) wanted for questioning by Internal Affairs flies to Alaska to assist in a murder enquiry. In pursuit of the suspect in deep fog, his partner is shot and the accident leads the murderer (Robin Williams) to blackmail the detective. Due to the Midnight Sun and the stress of the situation he finds himself in, the detective suffers from insomnia which impacts on his judgement in dealing with his partner's death. An earnest young police detective (Hilary Swank) is thorough in her investigative techniques and discovers the truth. Based on the film \"Insomnia\" directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg, this all-star version is just as compelling. Cast includes Martin Donovan, Paul Dooley."
