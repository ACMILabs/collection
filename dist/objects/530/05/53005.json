    "description": [
        "Set at the turn of the century, this is a story based on E. Nesbit's novel, \"The Railway Children\". It is much more than a happy-ever-after dream, evoking a nostalgia for a perfect world that exists only in our imaginations. Swallows and amazons: Arthur Ransome's immortal story is the bright, breezy and colourful tale of six children on holiday in the Lake District during the glorious summer of 1929. As they happily mess around in boats, their friendly rivalry is filled with imaginary dangers and piracy. Based on one of the best loved books of all time, their exciting exploits are a handbook to adventure for children of all ages."
