        "Four features starring Sir Alec Guinness produced by the revered Ealing studio. In \"The Ladykillers\" Guinness guides a gang of misfits through a daring robbery only to be foiled by their seemingly harmless, elderly landlady. Set in Edwardian England, \"Kind hearts and coronets\" sees Guinness play eight parts - all victims of a serial killer, determined to claim his birthright. A satire on industry and commerce \"The Man in the white suit\" features Guinness as a would-be chemist who develops an indestructible fabric. Guinness plays a timid bank clerk who has the perfect scheme for stealing gold bullion from the Bank of England in \"The Lavender Hill mob\". These four comedies highlight Guinness' unerring talent for satire and farce. Also available on VHS \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" [302796], \"Kind Hearts and coronets\" [302542], \"The Ladykillers\" [304307], \"The Man in the white suit\" [507924]."
