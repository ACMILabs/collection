        "Episode of series \"This modern age\" Explains that thoroughbred horses are descended from family lines originally developed in England, during the 18th century. A large breeding industry, maintained to meet overseas demand for British thoroughbreds is kept at a high standard by careful selective breeding. There are glimpses of British horses, or their immediate descendants, at studs and in races in many parts of the world."
