        "A brief sketch of China's long struggle for freedom, throughout which the Chinese people have shown an ability to survive what would seem overwhelming calamities. The primitive life of the peasantry is shown, but it is pointed out that newer methods of agriculture, and a fairer distribution of land, is gradually superseding the old way of life, even in the most remote areas. It is said that the China of tomorrow will combine the culture of the east with industrial developments of the west."
