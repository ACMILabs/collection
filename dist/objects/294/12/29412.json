        "An Italian cartoon based on an original fairy tale, inspired by Rossini's lively overture, La Gazza Ladra (The Thieving Magpie), and by the personality of a pet magpie that had lived in the Gianini home for many years. The cartoon depicts a pageant of medieval knights whose grand procession is reduced to havoc by one insolent bird who would rather steal crowns than dodge arrows. No commentary, music only."
