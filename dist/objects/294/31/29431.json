        "An animated film based on episodes from Dante's Inferno. The film is the work of the young artist Peter King, who was formerly associated with Lotte Reininger, famous for her silhouette films. A similar technique is used in this film in which the animated figures have a sculptural form. They display a highly individual visual imagination complemented by compelling sound."
