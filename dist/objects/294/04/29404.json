        "Roy and Julie, two young working people, plan to marry, but TB interrupts their plans. Roy has advanced tuberculosis, and Julie is an early case. The film shows their town's health facilities going into action to help these two young people; case-finding, diagnosis, and hospitalisation are demonstrated. Both Roy and Julie are admitted to a sanatorium, and after treatment, both are able to return to work, and to complete their plans for a home of their own."
