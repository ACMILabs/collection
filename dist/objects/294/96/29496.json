        "This film brings to life on the screen three of the immortal tales of Aesop. The fox is seen in his encounters with a crow and a piece of cheese; with a stork; and with the proverbial bunch of grapes. The photography of these animals is the result of more than a year's patient work by Lynwood Chase, well-known American naturalist and photographer."
