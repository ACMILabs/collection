        "One of the principles introduced into education in Great Britain as a result of the New Education Act of 1944 is that of stressing the three A's rather than the traditional three R's; the three A's are - age, ability, and aptitude, of each individual pupil. By considering these three A's, teachers and parents are better able to provide for each child the type of education most suited to their needs. The aim of education becomes the co-ordination of classroom and practical experience, so that children learn to apply their knowledge and skills to the demands of everyday life."
