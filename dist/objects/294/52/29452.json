        "Twenty-four hours of an imaginary but perfectly possible day in the life of the world's largest broadcasting organisation. Gives an impression of the vast activity behind the radio and television programs. There is a cast of 1200, some famous, most unknown, and locations vary from the complications of a television studio during a spectacular variety show to a lonely coast where a BBC news correspondent is reporting of the search for a missing aircraft. There is no commentary or background music, simply the ordinary announcements, program music and conversation of people on the job. Contains a solor segment at end of film - \"TV colour tests\". (Awards: British Film Academy Award - \"Best Specialised Film of 1959\")"
