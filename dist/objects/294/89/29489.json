        "An examination of three methods of psychotherapy. Dr. Carl Roger's method of \"prising\" or trying to come in contact with the patient. Dr. Frederick Perl's method of Gestalt therapy or maturation in the human personality during the interview, and Dr. Albert Ellis' method of reason and emotion psychotherapy, which aims at eradicating the self-defeatist attitudes of the patient. Each doctor explains his method, demonstrates it in an interview with the patient Gloria and sums up at the end. Finally Gloria gives her impressions of the three methods."
