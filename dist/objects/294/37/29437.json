        "Made up of hundreds of cut-out colour ads projected in fragmented, rapid succession, this animated film without words takes a critical look at the conditioning process that underlies consumerism in our world of materialism. Seductive advertising is seen as the main motivating force in shaping the desires, the needs and, to a large degree, the lives of modern men and women."
