        "Episode of Series \"Challenge for Change/Societe Nouvelle\" Under cover of a love-letter, this is an impressionistic history of the women of Quebec down through the ages; the Indian, the \"fille du Roy\", the nun, the settler's wife, the soldiers wife, and finally today's woman who examines her traditional role as mother and wife, and contrasts it with her new place in the labour force. The couple, and the difficulties involved in being a couple, are touched upon with great tenderness."
