        "A series of humorous sketches and semi-abstract drawings are used to interpret three American ballads - \"Acres of Clams\", \"Old Dan Tucker\" and \"John Henry\". The artist, Alfred Kousel, has provided innumerable still sketches which combine colour, a feeling of strength and a variety of emotional effects in harmony with the moods and rhythms of the ballads. The ballads are sung by Cisco Houston."
