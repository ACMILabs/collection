        "Episode of Series \"Marriage and Family Living\". The film focuses on the false ideals of romantic love on which too many marriages are built. It follows the courtship of two young people who refuse to evaluate each other's qualities and shortcomings in a realistic adult way. They are unwilling or unable to alter their romanticised ideas of each other to agree with actual facts. Because they are in love with love and not each other their marriage is doomed."
