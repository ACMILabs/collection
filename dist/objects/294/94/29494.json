        "Three areas in New Guinea are visited and their Members of the House of Assembly discuss their local conditions and states of development. In the Western Highlands the limited arable land is mostly under subsistence agriculture with various cash crops being introduced. In the Gazelle Peninsula, New Britain, a more active economy is based on copra and cocoa. On the Sepik River fishing villages export artefacts and some local products and maintain some elements of traditional culture."
