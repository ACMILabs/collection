        "This film is a look at a family in trouble, seen from the inside. There is the trouble with the police, the begging for stale bread at the convent, the birth of another child, and the father who explains his family's predicament. Although filmed in Montreal, this is the anatomy of poverty as it occurs in North America, seen by a camera that became part of the family's life for several weeks."
