        "Episode of Series \"This is the United Nations\". Cinemagazine items: 1. The International Court of Justice - This Court, the highest of all tribunals, is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. It holds its sessions in the Peace Palace at the Hague, Holland and consists of fifteen independent judges, elected regardless of nationality. 2. The Republic of Indonesia - When the Japanese were driven out of the Dutch colony of Indonesia at the end of World War II the national leaders declared the country a republic. However negotiations with the Dutch resulted in violence. When peace was finally established by United Nations action, it was agreed that Indonesia become a sovereign state linked to the Netherlands in a union based on free will with equal rights."
