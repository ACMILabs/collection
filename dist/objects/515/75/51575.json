        "This is a snapshot presentation of the Czech Republic as it is today to encourage tourism to this rather unique and historical part of Europe. It briefly covers Prague, Central, Western and Eastern Bohemia, Sumava (Bohemian forest), Krknose Giant Mountains, Vysocina (Bohemian-Moravian Highlands), Southern and Central Moravia, Northern Moravia and Silesia with a basic overview of each area's tourist attractions and historical background. Beautifully photographed, the video includes images of Prague Castle where kings, emperors, and presidents have resided, historical buildings alongside modern buildings, many examples of Baroque architecture, fairy-tale castles and chateaux, rivers, dams and man-made lakes, forests and mountains and a range of activities including swimming, boating, cycling, hiking, skiing, snow-boarding, and cross-country skiing. Steeped in history, the Czech Republic manages to blend the romantic old with the exciting new - a most intriguing region to visit."
