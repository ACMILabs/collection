        "Ten short animated stories about Maisy - a charming young female mouse and her friends, including Charley the crocodile, Eddie the elephant, and Cyril the squirrel. Each story has voiceover narration and a gently comic tone that endorses the virtues of friendship and sharing. \"Birthday\" - Maisy invites her friends over for a birthday celebration. \"Party\" - Maisy is attending a fancy dress party and struggles to find an original outfit. \"Playhouse\" - Maisy hosts a tea party for her toys and Charley comes over to join in. \"Treasure\" - Charlie visits Maisy, who is dressed as a pirate, and the two of them proceed to dig for buried treasure, finding join coins with which to buy ice-cream. \"Lemonade\" - on a hot day Maisy decides to make fresh lemonade for herself and Eddie. \"Parade\" - with musical instruments in tow, Maisy and her friends stage a parade. \"Balloons\" - Maisy and Cyril buy balloons at the park, then have to figure out how to prevent them flying away whilst they play. \"Fair\" - the fair comes to town and Maisy and her friends go on many exciting rides. \"Playground\" - Maisy and her friends go to the park and play on the slide, seesaw and swing. \"Tummy ache\" - After playing with Maisy, Charlie eats too many cupcakes then proceeds to feel quite ill. Maisy works at making him feel better. Created by Lucy Cousins."
