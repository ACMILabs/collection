        "10 stories featuring characters created by Walter Lantz. \"The Contender\": There's $5,000 prize for beating the defending wrestling champion, The Granulator. Believing TV wrestling is a sham, Woody lays down the challenge in a variety of disguises. \"Snow way out\": Knothead and Splinter become victims to shyster ski instructors on the slopes. \"Hospital hijinx\": Woody places himself in hospital in an effort to get some TLC. His plan backfires when he's allocated Head Nurse Meany. \"Over the top\": Wally and Woody have a dispute on which sport is better: snowboarding or skiing. They settle the score in a down hill race. \"Chilly and the fur-bearing trout\": Chilly Willy attempts to capture himself the elusive fur-bearing trout so that he can get himself a nice, warm, coat. \"Painfaker\": Mr Walrus is charged with nursing Woody back to health after he injures him in the park. A camera man accompanies them to ensure the court ruling is adhered to. \"Pinheads\": Woody's experiencing car trouble in the middle of nowhere. He spots a new car but has to beat Buzz Buzzard in 10 Pin Bowling to raise the necessary funds. \"The Chilly show\": Chilly becomes the star attraction in a wildlife show. \"Silent treatment\": Woody's neighbour Wally is having a bbq and Woody is determined to get an invite. Wally is determined he can ignore him."
