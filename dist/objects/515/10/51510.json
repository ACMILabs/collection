        "Larry Labrat: Fear and loathing on the garbage pail (Prod Co: Ear, Nose and Throat/Ratatouille Productions; Prods: Gideon Warhaft, Nigel Christensen; Dir: Josh Reed, Sam Reed, Nigel Christensen) Animated short: Having had his brain removed by experimental scientists, Larry Labrat becomes a political puppet and candidate to lead a community of rats living amidst a garbage pile. Comedic short utilising puppet animation. \"Whatever happened to the Sex Dwarves?\" (Prod Co: Spontaneous Films/Ear, Nose and Throat; Prods/Dirs: Greg Appel, Josh Reed): Mockumentary short film that spoofs the burgeoning children's entertainment market. Aping a 60-Minutes style segment, the 'documentary' investigates the rise of the popular children's group \"The Sex Dwarves\" which consisted of several toddlers; for a time the group were phenomenally successful due to their live performances and merchandising. Several sets of parents are depicted as mercilessly exploiting their children for profit. Guest appearances by Kylie Minogue, Peter Andre and Tex Perkins. \"King Street, Newtown\" (Dir: Stephen Brown): Documentary filmed in 1995 in Newtown, just prior to the gentrification of the inner city Sydney suburb. The film examines the minutiae of counter-culture, interviewing various residents and exploring reasons why people live there and what they derive from the thriving sub-culture. Individuals discuss sexuality, relationships, homophobia, gender roles, monogamy and personal choices. The filmmaker visits various businesses in the area including a book shop, sex shop, dry cleaning store and a Hare Krishna restaurant."
