        "When twelve-year-old Ort Flack's father Sam is plunged into a coma after a truck accident, his family is fractured. As Ort's mother bravely tries to hold her family together, a mysterious stranger appears and changes their lives - giving Ort courage, comfort and faith. This acclaimed adaptation of the novel by Tim Winton is about the healing power of love, about fantasy and faith, about a boy's visions of the world beyond and about the blurry distinctions between the natural and the supernatural. Nominated for 9 AFI Awards and starring Peter Coyote, Lisa Harrow and Jamie Croft. Co-starring Amanda Douge, Mark Fairall and Alethea McGrath. Directed by John Ruane (Death in Brunswick), with music by David Bridie."
