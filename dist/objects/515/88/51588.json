        "Ten short animated stories about Maisy - a charming young female mouse and her friends, including Charley the crocodile, Eddie the elephant, and Cyril the squirrel. Each story has voiceover narration and a gently comic tone that teaches children about colours and counting. \"Shed\": Eddie helps Maisy paint the shed green, blue, yellow and red. \"Hide and seek\": Maisy, Tallulah and Charlie have fun playing hide and seek. \"Spots\": Maisy runs into a leopard while she is outside and together they look at all the spotted things outside. \"Circus\": Maisy's circus is in town and everyone's performing. \"Eggs\": Maisy and friends have an Easter egg hunt. Maisy and Charlie have just as much fun hiding them as the others do finding and eating them. \"Bus\": Maisy's driving the school bus and follows the numbered stops to pick up her friends. \"Train\": Driving the train, Maisy picks up animal passengers, number by number, from 1 to 10. \"Harvest\": Maisy goes vegetable picking. \"Stick\": Maisy finds lots of uses for her walking stick. Tallulah has some ideas too. \"Clouds\": Maisy enjoys a picnic in a hot air balloon. Vocal and sounds by the Umbilical Brothers. Narrated by Neil Morrisey. Created by Lucy Cousins."
