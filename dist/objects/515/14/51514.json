        "Everyone needs to know who they are and where they come from and Muppets are no exception. Living with the rest of the Muppet gang, Gonzo is upset by the fact there are no other hooked nosed creatures such as himself. One morning his prayers are answered when he receives a message in his breakfast cereal - he knows he is no longer alone. Further investigation leads to the theory that Gonzo is in fact an alien, at least that's what he concludes anyway. Gonzo's familial message is intercepted by a secret government agency (embodied in Jeffrey Tambor) attempting to prove the existence of alien life forms. They kidnap him in the hope he will take them to his leader; Miss Piggy senses a scoop. Eager to reclaim one of their own, Kermit and the rest of the Muppets board the Electric Mayhem Bus to save Gonzo. At the heart of this 6th Muppet film lies the themes of acceptance and belonging. Interestingly, it places Gonzo as the central character (most of the other Muppets do not make much of an appearance), and whilst the word \"space\" does appear in the title, its not a \"space film\" as such. The star studded cast features cameos from F. Murray Abraham, Andie Macdowall, Ray Liotta, Kathy Griffin, David Arquette, Joshua Jackson, Katie Holmes and Rob Schneider. Music by Rupert Gregson-Williams, Lionel Richie and George Clinton."
