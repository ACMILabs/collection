        "Directed by Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Sex, lies and videotape, Traffic) \"Out of sight\" is adapted from the novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard. When Jack Foley robs a bank, his car breaks down and he is sent to a Florida prison. Federal Marshall Karen Sisco witnesses his escape attempt and is consequently kidnapped by Foley's partner. Despite being on opposite sides of the law, Foley and Sisco discover their attraction to each other and Sisco is faced with a moral dilemma as she questions whether or not to turn Foley in. This comedy is a stylish romantic caper film, which provides tantalising repartee between the two leads as well as intriguing flashbacks, flashforwards and dream sequences that are characteristic of Soderbergh's finesse."
