        "Hannon Fuller is a scientist intrigued by time-travel who designs a virtual reality program that allows the player to assume an identity in another era and experience first hand the milieu of the times. Unbeknownst to his co-worker Douglas Hall, Fuller has been using the software, downloading himself into Los Angeles 1937 - the setting of his childhood. When Fuller is brutally knifed to death one night, Hall is suspected of murder. Hall decides to travel back to 1937 to recover a message that Fuller has left for him in the system and hopefully identify the real killer. As the principal characters travel through time, they struggle to maintain their 1930s identities and face the danger of ruining their creation by exposing the game. \"The Thirteenth floor\" is a science fiction thriller that mimics the technical babble and mind-bending logic of \"The Matrix\" and \"eXistenZ\", without ever really managing to achieve the accomplishments of those finer examples of the genre. The film, stylish in its recreation of the 1930s era and the computer saturated sleekness of the 90s, melds noirish aesthetics, romance, murder mystery and sci-fi adventuring."
