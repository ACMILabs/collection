    "description": [
        "This acclaimed SBS series presents the stories behind migration to Australia during the 1950s when many people fled post-War atrocities, the rise of Communism and impoverishment. This tape contains four separate stories. Episode 10: Chris Gatz was indoctrinated into Communism at a young age, embracing the doctrines that destroyed his family. In 1956 he immigrated to Australia to be re-united with his remaining family. Episode 11: Leopoldine Mimovich learnt sculpture in her home city of Salzburg, Austria. Arriving in Australia in 1949, she found living as a female artist a demanding calling. Episode 12: Nicolas Habib, born in Egypt to a Greek mother and Lebanese father, was a foreigner in his own homeland. Upon becoming effectively stateless, he moved to Australia where his lack of English saw his skills denigrated, forcing him to adapt to a life of hard labour. Nicolas recognised the many inequities faced by migrants of certain ethnic backgrounds, and agitated for change. Episode 13: Denis George immigrated to Australia at age 35 whereupon he became a pioneering pearl farmer. Some quite remarkable tales emerge about these interesting times, told with finesse by various raconteurs and are an appealing mix of pathos and humour."
