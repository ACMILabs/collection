    "description": [
        "This acclaimed SBS series presents the stories behind migration to Australia during the 1950s when many people fled post-War atrocities, the rise of Communism and impoverishment. This tape contains three separate stories. Episode 7: Jutta Malnic, born in Berlin to an Australian mother and German father, had a childhood filled with exotic stories about a country which provided refuge after harrowing World War II experiences. A photographer, Jutta relays her remarkable journey from war-torn Europe and her interesting experiences as an emigre. Episode 8: Victor Vadiveloo was taken from his family in Sri Lanka at age 4 and sent to work on the Burmese railway at 14, before escaping. Upon emigrating to Australia Victor continued his studies in order to become a surgeon, and experienced excessive racism which only intensified when he fell in love and married a white woman. Episode 9: Rinaldo Fabbro, an Italian partisan fighter during World War II who was to become an architect of great acclaim, discusses his past, having arrived in Australia in 1949, in search of prosperity. Some quite remarkable tales emerge about these interesting times, told with finesse by various raconteurs and are an appealing mix of pathos and humour."
