        "Ten short animated stories about Maisy - a charming young female mouse and her friends, including Charley the crocodile, Eddie the elephant, and Cyril the squirrel. Each story has voiceover narration and a gently comic tone that endorses the virtues of friendship and sharing. \"Panda\": Daisy takes Panda to the playground where they run into Cyril and his bouncing ball. \"Torch\": Tallulah brings over her new torch and everyone has fun making shadow puppets. \"Library\": Charlie and Maisy take a trip to the library to return some books. \"Wheel\": Pushhorse has lost a wheel and Panda is in for a wobbly ride unless they can locate the missing wheel. \"Puppets\": Cyril makes a visit and Maisy and her friends enjoy the puppet show he puts on. \"Cleaning\": A hungry Charlie is getting in the way of Maisy's cleaning. \"Doctor\": Maisy's playing dress ups and today she's Doctor Maisy. First patient is an unwell Panda. Tallulah plays nurse. \"Wheelbarrow\": Using her wheelbarrow and shovel, Maisy plants a new tree in the garden, Rabbit's proving a hindrance. \"Snail\": Charlie makes friends with a snail he discovers on the watering can. \"Goodnight\": Tallulah sleeps over and she and Maisy make the necessary bedtime preparations. Vocal and sounds by the Umbilical Brothers. Narrated by Neil Morrisey. Created by Lucy Cousins."
