        "Where's it all going and where does it lead us? What is life all about? Michael, a struggling cartoonist living with his part Italian part Jewish parents is searching for artistic inspiration in the seedy environment around him - a violent, sexually perverse and polluted one. Reclusive and introspective, Michael makes an unsuccessful pitch to get his work off the ground and is forced into numerous disastrous encounters with prostitutes by friends in an attempt to prove his manhood. It's barkeep Carole who earns his affections however as well as introducing him to a life of crime. Beginning and ending with live action, Bakshi's film following \"Fritz the cat\" (1972) is mainly animated in its portrayal of a seedy, disturbing, yet artistically rich milieu of New York City circa 1970s. Cast includes: Joseph Kaufmann, Beverly Hope Atkinson, Frank DeKova, Terri Haven."
