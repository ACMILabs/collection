        "An informative documentary about Mahatma Gandhi and the important role he played in India's passage towards independence from British rule. Discusses Gandhi's life, his beliefs and his aspirations for a united India where Hindus and Muslims live in peace and harmony and where his theories of non-violence and non-cooperation will lead to autonomy and independence. Also provides an indepth look at India's history from the turn of the century through to Gandhi's assassination in 1948 discussing the tenets of the Hindu religion; the diversity that exists within India in relation to language, culture and religion; the caste system; the strategies devised by Gandhi to break Britain's control of India; the violence and bloodshed associated with the independence movement and these divisions; the appointment of Jawaharlal Nehru as leader of the Indian Congress Party; the formation of Pakistan; Britain's withdrawal from India; India's independence. Uses archival film footage, stills and newsreels. Narrated by Michel Pascal. Teacher Notes are included. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
