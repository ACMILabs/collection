        "This acclaimed SBS series presents the stories behind migration to Australia during the 1950s when many people fled post-War atrocities, the rise of Communism and impoverishment. This tape contains three separate stories. Episode 4: Henry Sue fled China with his family when it became Communist. Once here, Henry battled racism and discrimination, which made him determined to fight back. Episode 5: Sasha Nekvapil and Frank Prihoda. Sasha defected from the Czech skiing team whilst competing in 1948 in Switzerland. She later emigrated to Australia with her husband and brother in search of new beginnings. Episode 6: Frank Buzolic was a black marketeer during World War II who lived on his wits whilst evading danger. At the conclusion of the war he and his brother sought freedom - they escaped escaping in a stolen dinghy, rowing toward Italy. Some quite remarkable tales emerge about these interesting times, told with finesse by various raconteurs and are an appealing mix of pathos and humour."
