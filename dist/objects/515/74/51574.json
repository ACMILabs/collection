    "description": [
        "These seven short animated films from the National Film Board of Canada are united by their inspiration from the 1990 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Each film addresses a specific right that was agreed upon by the convention. They are designed to encourage children to think about the world in which they live. They are also inspired by a range of posters from Pierre Post. The films contain no dialogue. \"123 Coco\" (dir. Pierre M. Trudeau): A young girl struggles in Maths but finally works it out thanks to visualisation. \"Papa\" (dir. Michele Pauze): The impressions of a young child as they wait for their busy father to play. \"T.V. Tango\" (dir. Martine Chartrand): A visual illustration of the influence of television on impressionable young minds. \"The Orange = L'Orange\" (dir: Diane Chartrand): A hungry boy reminisces about a wonderful orange he once had and a thoughtful teacher gives a valuable lesson in acceptance. \"Door to door = Porte a porte\" (dir: Zabelle Cote): When a class of young children are bullied by the older kids they pool their efforts to get some respect. \"A Family for Maria = Une famille pour Maria\" (dir. Lina Gagnon): A beggar girl finds herself adopted by a loving family but struggles to forget her past. \"To see the world = Voir le monde\" (dir: Francine Desbiens): Sleeping on a train a young boy is exposed to the hardships faced by children across the world."
