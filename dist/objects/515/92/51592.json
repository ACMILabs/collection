    "description": [
        "A German-Australian co-production created by Peter Maffay, Gregor Rottschalk and Rolf Zuckowski, Tabaluga is the last surviving dragon on earth. Using a combination of fire and flight, both peaceful options, Tabaluga fights his nemesis the evil snowman Arktos, intent on ruining Tabaluga's home of Greenland by covering it with snow and ice, thus making it inhospitable. Popular with adults and children alike, \"Tabaluga\" is in its third series and a feature film is in production. \"The Wiser head does not give in\" (story by Gregor Rottschalk): Arktos is firing snowballs at the volcano, covering it in a layer of white, rendering the volcano frozen and threatening to take over the rest of Greenland. Tabaluga is given an ultimatum, himself in exchange for the safety of the other occupants of Greenland. \"Two birds with one stone\" (story by Gregor Gottschalk, Heike Lage): A slumbering Tabaluga is carried by a group of soldier ants back to their Queen. She blames Tabaluga for the destruction of her Blue Army but soon comes to realise they have a common enemy in Arktos. \"Moonstruck\" (story by Gregor Rottschalk): Tabaluga vows to fly to the moon, even though no one else has successfully ever made it there. He seeks the assistance of Arktos and his powerful telescope to see it. Voices provided by Keith Scott, Robyn Moore, Jamie Oxenbould."
