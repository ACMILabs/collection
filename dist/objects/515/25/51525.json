        "Discusses the failure of mandatory detention to deter \"boat people\" or \"asylum seekers\" making their way to Australia via the international people smugglers. Most of the asylum seekers come from repressive regimes such as Iraq (Saddam Hussein) and Afghanistan (The Taliban) but the Liberal-National Party government under Prime Minister John Howard introduced legislation in late 2001 to prevent these people from applying to Australia for asylum. This interesting and informative program covers the infamous Tampa incident which lead to the establishment of off-shore detention centres and the Pacific Solution, ie Nauru, Christmas Island etc. and explains, in detail, the various new laws relating to unauthorised boat arrivals and the consequences including the situation for those currently in detention centres. Provides television news footage and commentary on the \"children overboard\" affair and the Woomera detainees' protests, plus attitudes and opinions of the Australian people on the issue of asylum seekers. Suitable for Years 9-12 Secondary and Tertiary students. Teacher notes included."
