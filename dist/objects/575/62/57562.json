        "A story about liking and accepting what you are. Adapted from the book by Alyse Newman. The story of Claudia, a nine-year-old girl who hated her big ears. One day Claudia found a large hat that covered her ears, eyes, nose and mouth. She couldn't see anything, nor could she play games. Life got pretty lonely under the hat until the day she bumped into Paul."
