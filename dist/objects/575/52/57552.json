        "The two part BBC adaptation of the classic Dickens' novel which stars Scott Funnell as Little Oliver, Ben Rodska as Oliver Twist, David Garlick as the Artful Dodger, and Eric Porter as Fagin. The orphaned Oliver runs away from the workhouse to London, where he takes up with a gang of pickpockets and thieves. Oliver is badly injured in an attempted burglary but is taken in by a kindly family and nursed back to health. But even then Oliver's troubles are far from over."
