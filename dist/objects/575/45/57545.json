Frank, a cynical and drunken professor of literature is appalled and then amused by the quest for knowledge and culture of one of his new students, a hairdresser named Rita. Frank soon finds that Rita has more zest for life and more natural intelligence than most of his \"educated students\". Features Michael Caine and Julie Walters."
