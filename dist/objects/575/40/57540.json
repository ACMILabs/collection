        "This video says all the right things about maths and is entirely consistent with Frameworks. It has a Queensland focus (Teachers are a little passive compared to Victoria and the workshop style of Calvin Irons is certainly different). However, it should be a useful stimulus film for schools conducting their own self-help stimulus programs. The first sessions could be run over 5 weeks, hence its impact could develop as teachers progressively engage the ideas. No other credits available."
