        "Based on a book by Patricia MacLachlan. A warmly moving film that captures the special bond between a blind man and his grandson. Young Johnny's grandpa now old and blind can only imagine the sights that surround him. However, grandpa's blindness often allows him to see in ways incomprehensible to the sighted."
