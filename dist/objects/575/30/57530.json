        "Part 1 (28min): Dr. Jonathan Sher, visiting American educationalist, Dr Don Edgar and Peter Couchman explore and develop issues from \"A Kindness Cup.\" These include whether justice or revenge is sought, what is achieved, the connection between power and justice and between disdvantage and justice. Part 2 (28min) continues the discussion and cites specific examples to illustrate the \"nature of justice\", punishment, miscarriage of justice and social justice."
