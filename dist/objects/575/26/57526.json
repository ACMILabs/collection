        "1. \"Body talking\". Begins the sequence by exploring the power of visual images as a source of information and means of communication. 2.\"A sense of touch\" 3. \"A sense of sound\". These two segments extend the power of visual imagery by showing how it connects with information from other senses to enrich the meaning we gain from our experiences. 4. \"Speaking object-ly\". Provides a transition from the literal interpretation of visual imagery to the more abstract concept that what we see carries implicit subjective messages. 5. \"Sequence and story\". Shows how visual images are connected to one another and how our interpretations can be changed as we explore how our images of them are related to one another. 6. \"Movie movie\". Deals directly with ways in which visual images can be manipulated to influence our thoughts and emotions."
