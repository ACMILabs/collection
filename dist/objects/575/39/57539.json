        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". Discusses the phenomenon known as \"Sick building syndrome\" which effects occupants of mostly new buildings where the air in the air conditioning units is constantly recirculated. Other contributing factors include dust and dirt, chemicals from furnishings and fittings, mould and fungus in air conditioning systems, sealed windows, uncomfortable temperatures, poor building design and the glare from fluorescent tubes and computer terminals. These causes acting together provide occupants with conditions contributing towards a higher degree of abseteeism than otherwise may be expected."
