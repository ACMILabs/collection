        "A record of a visit to Dresden, East Germany, by allied airmen who fire bombed the city during World War II and who are now members of the peace movement. Both the airmen and survivors of the bombing share their opinions against a backdop of archival footage of the raid. Challenges the viewer to wonder why human beings continue to inflict pain and suffering on one another."
