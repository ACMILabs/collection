        "Eight-year old Sparky hates to practise! One day his piano speaks to him and shows him what it is like to play the piano well - the piano will do it for him. Suddenly Sparky is hailed as a musical genius, but he becomes arrogant, rude to his family and the piano, so the piano refuses to play at the most important concert of his career ... Voices include Mel Blanc, Coral Browne, Tony Curtis, Cloris Leachman and Vincent Price."
