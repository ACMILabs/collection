        "Episode number 2 of Series \"War\". For centuries the international system of states has settled questions of power, territory, national pride and sovereignty with military force. At any given time there are about twenty wars being waged in the international neighbourhood, and in all of them, the people have a particular goal they want to achieve, a goal which they believe outweighs the cost of war. Dyer looks at a number of recent examples. He also examines the efforts of citizens' peace movements in Europe, in the USA and in the Soviet Union. He suggests that we must find an alternative to war if the planet is to survive."
