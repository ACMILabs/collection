        "One of Disney's most endearing animated films. Dumbo is the story of a baby circus animal born with oversized ears. Snubbed and ridiculed by all the other circus animals, he is befriended by Timothy, a small but spirited mouse. After Dumbo is involved in several disastrous performances under the big top, Timothy decides to launch Dumbo as a new star - the world's only flying elephant. Also included in this program are three Disney cartoons: \"Father Noah's ark\", \"The Practical pig\", and \"Three orphan kittens\"."
