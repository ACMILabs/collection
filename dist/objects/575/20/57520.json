        "Episode number 2 of Series \"War\". Offers unusually frank insights into techniques that all armies use to motivate recruits. The film takes us to Parris Island Marine Recruit Training Depot in South Carolina, USA, to observe the rituals that will transform a motley group of eighteen year-olds into soldiers of the United States Marine Corps, unquestionably the roughest, toughest branch in the US military. It is a gripping study of what it takes to change ordinary civilians into the staple of wars, soldiers ready to kill, even to die for their country."
