        "Language in the multi-ethnic classroom; parts 2 & 3. Part 2. \"Working together\" in the classroom. The main focus of this program is to develop and enhance the speaking skills of primary school children. Part 3. \"Supporting understanding.\" Suggest that children learn by doing, therefore, teachers need to create situations which will allow children to use and extend the language they learn. In both of these programs we see activities which will help to develop and reinforce language, showing teachers using the activities in actual classroom situations. Companion videotape \"Listen to us; The way we speak.\""
