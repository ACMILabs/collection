        "Peter Principle. Dr. Peter offers his disturbing insight into why people get promoted to their level of competence. Why people struggle up the hierarchy of an organization when it is no good for neither them or the company? \"Jumping Jelly Beans\" Professor Fred Hezberges name is associated with the study of motivation. Here he delivers his theories in a stimulating lecture. \"Up the organization\". Robert Townsend expounds his radical philosophy on the subject of running a business. No department is safe from his challenging and witty criticism."
