        "Hosted by Peter Hoskings, this is a tourist orientated film that never the less provides a wealth of facts and figures about the fairy penguins, and background information about Phillip Island. Excellent cinematography reveals much about the scenary and wild life of the island including koalas, kangaroos and wallabies, wombats, seals, wild flowers and birds."
