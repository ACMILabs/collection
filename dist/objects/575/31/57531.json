        "Peter Couchman and a panel discuss the origin of the nature of justice, the jury system, the connection between the law and justice, injustice and examples of the individual and the law. Particular reference is made to \"Last days of Socrates\", \"A kindness cup\", \"Breaker Morant\", and \"The wife of Martin Guerre\". Part 2 (27min) is a continuation of Part 1. It also looks at the concept of Justice, the place of punishment in justice, the distintion between moral, legal and social justice."
