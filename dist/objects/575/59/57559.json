        "Examines the problems involved in keeping people warm. Humans generate their own body heat and try to keep warm by trapping heat next to the body with layers of clothing. Houses too need proper insulation if they are to retain the warmth from heating sources. This program looks at a computer- controlled house where getting up, having a bath and watching television happen to order; saving energy and money."
