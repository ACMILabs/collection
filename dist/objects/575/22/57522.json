        "Episode number 4 of Series \"War\". All through history, wars have been linked to feelings of nationalism. There is hardly any country in the world that did not establish iself by means of wars. In this film Gwynne Dyer explors some of the reasons why pople, and governments acting on their behalf, feel the need to keep armies and fight wars. It focuses on Israel's struggle for a secure place amongst the Arab nations of the Middle East, and on the so far unsuccessful attempts of the Palestinians to create a nation of their own."
