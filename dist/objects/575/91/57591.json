        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Art of silence: pantomimes with Marcel Marceau and his partner Pierre Verry\". A compilation tape featuring Marcel Marceau, introducing the art of mime through the characater of Bip. \"Bip as a soldier\" shows the soldier as a tragic and heroic figure. \"The Hands\" is an allegory of the struggle between good and evil. The serious tone is lightened by the interpretation of \"The Painter\"."
