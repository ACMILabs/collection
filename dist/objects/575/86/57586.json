        "A few cameras were on hand to record the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour on December 7th 1941, film director John Ford's unit was given the task of recreating many of the major scenes on Hollywood sound stages. Generations of Americans have witnessed the scenes, not realising the attack is actually Ford's skilful illusion. Historically, the film is accurate in every detail. Winner of the Academy Award for Documentary Production in 1943."
