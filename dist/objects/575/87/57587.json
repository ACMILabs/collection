        "A documentary of life on a lonely airbase on Adak Island in the Aleutians during World War II. For the men of the base, the enemy was the snow, mud, grey skies and boredom punctuated by an occasional bombing raid. John Huston spent six months on the Island and was nearly killed while filming the climactic raid."
