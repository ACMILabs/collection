        "A documentary film portrait of two survivors of the atomic bomb droped on Hiroshima. They are among the minority of survivors who have decided to risk their careers and marriage prospects by identifying themselves with \"Hobusyka\". The film follows them as they travel to New York to represent the Japanese peace movement at the second United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in June 1982. Excellent for senior students."
