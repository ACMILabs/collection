        "Episode number 1 of Series \"War\". From Napoleon to Nagasaki, Gwynne Dyer charts how the major social, economic and technical developments of the last two hundred years have changed the methods and impact of modern warfare to lead us to the brink of total destruction. He guides the viewer through two centuries of world military history, recounting anecdotes and describing in vivid detail significant and sometimes little known events from past wars."
