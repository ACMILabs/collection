        "Episode of Series \"Healers quacks or mystics\". Bodyworkers use a range of techniques to release tension and anxiety in the body in order to release energy for life and healing. Bodyworkers believe the body holds secrets for our health and that our society's over-emphasis on the mind, destroys the important mind/body balance. Techniques demonstrated include massage, the Alexander technique for improving posture, Rolfing (developed by US biologist, Dr. Ida Rolf) and Wilhelm Reich's theories of sexual energy and release."
