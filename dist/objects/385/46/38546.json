        "Episode of Series \"Riding the tiger\". Riding the Tiger Series. Even though the Indonesians rid themselves of Dutch colonisers in 1949, the new economic order developed by the military has replicated the vastly unequal distribution of wealth that has plagued Indonesia's modern history: now, however, the wealthy few are Indonesian not European. This episode examines Indonesia's feudal past and the impact of European colonisation on the Indonesian population. The maintenance of feudal authority by the European colonisers is one of the roots, this video claims, of the military's successful suppression of democracy in contemporary Indonesia."
