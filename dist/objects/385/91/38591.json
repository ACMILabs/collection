        "Described as \"an abstract environmental video for insomniacs\" this video features the electronic music of O Yuki Conjugate and imagery accumulated and compiled by Andrew Hulme. The impression is of a moving abstract painting, of colours, shapes and textures which move across the screen in an endlessly moving display, with, now and then, the tantalising suggestion of an object or a person just at the edge of vision."
