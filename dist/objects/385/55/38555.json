        "Cleavon Little is a black railroad worker in the 19th century mid-west who with the assistance of an alcoholic gunfighter tries to foil the plans of a crooked attorney and his henchmen. Well, that's the supposed plot. In reality, \"Blazing Saddles\" is a continuously hilarious parody of Hollywood westerns (and Hollywood racism) featuring great comic performances by Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Mel Brooks and Slim Pickens. In films such as \"Blazing Saddles\", Mel Brooks consolidated his position as one of the most unique and talented of comics in contemporary American cinema. The film is co-scripted by Richard Pryor."
