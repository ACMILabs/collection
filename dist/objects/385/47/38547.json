        "Episode of Series \"Sweat of the sun, tears of the moon\". Jack Pizzey is in Brazil the week before Carnaval, Rio's fantastic explosion of glittering, sexy extravagance, a celebration where even the poor blacks of the fovellas (shanty towns) can be \"Kings for a Day\". Preparations for Carnaval are top secret and intense as rival teams vie for the top prize as champions of Carnaval. Pizzey himself, bedecked in sequins and lurex, is able to take part in the all-night climax of this unique festival."
