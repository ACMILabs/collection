        "Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) resolves to find his niece, abducted by Indians at the end of the Civil War. It is an odyssey which takes five years, by the end of which he plans to take revenge on the Indians for the friends and family he has lost. John Ford used sumptuous Monument Valley as a background for this, his most poetic and complex Western. Stars Vera Miles and a young Natalie Wood. Based on a novel by Alan Le May."
