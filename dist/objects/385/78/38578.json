        "Episode of Series \"Quantum\". Heart disease is the biggest cause of death in Australia, causing 30,000 deaths per year. Although heart disease has many causes one of those most publicised is high cholesterol levels. But is cholesterol really the major villain, and is it easily combated by dietary changes? This program looks at cholesterol in detail, noting that there is \"good\" cholesterol and \"bad\" cholesterol and that the effects of cholesterol on the individual may be due more to factors such as sex and genetic makeup than diet."
