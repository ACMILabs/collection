        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Marketing / Coast Community College District\". Dr. Roy Adler, an expert in consumer behaviour, takes as an example, the American love affair with the car. He relates Maslow's hierarchy of needs: Basic physiological needs, Safety and security needs, Social needs, Esteem needs, and Self-actualisation to examples of consumer choices of motor cars. He then relates this to advertising and marketing as the manufacturers identify these needs and design their products and marketing strategy accordingly. Although the examples given each demonstrate the satisfaction of one particular need in the hierarchy, Dr. Adler stresses that when a consumer makes a purchase there is usually a more complicated mix of influences at work."
