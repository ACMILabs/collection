        "We look at some of the daily activities of the Chinese inhabitants of Beijing, beginning with Tai Chi exercises in the morning. Highlights work work, school, peasant farmers in a collective near Beijing, lunchtime, Children's palaces where children may indulge in extra-curricular activities in sport and the arts, and Sunday visits to the park and the Forbidden City. Professor Colin Mackerras explains the history of calligraphy, and the ways in which the Chinese spend their time. Two dramatised segments show a grandfather sitting in the park and a family quarrel."
