        "Record numbers of Australians are living longer. The increase in the numbers of elderly people poses problems with the provision of suitable community services including health and accommodation. At the same time society can discriminate against people as they age, depriving them of companionship, dignity and fulfilment. Indeed there is no reason why they should not pass the Century mark, leading full and active lives. Written and narrated by David Goldie."
