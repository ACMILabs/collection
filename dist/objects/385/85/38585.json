        "Waves of the future looks at the lives and methods of two theorists as they investigate gravity waves and propose extravagant experiments with gravity wave detectors, both here on earth and in space. \"Stardust\" looks at the life and death of stars, in particular how they are born in dark areas of the universe. \"Prospecting for planets\" concentrates on the explosion of discoveries made by the Voyager project, the search for other planetary systems and how planetary systems are formed."
