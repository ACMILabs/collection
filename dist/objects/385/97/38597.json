    "description": [
        "Seven examples of the recent renaissance in British animation fostered by Channel Four. \"Next\" (dir. Barry Purves) elegantly condenses all 37 of Shakespeare's plays into 5 minutes. \"Feet of song\" (dir. Erica Russell) is an abstract explosion of African dance rhythms. \"The Victor\" (dir. Animation City) uses comic book graphics for its dissection of chemical manipulation of military aggression. \"Early bird\" (dir Aardman Animations) is a witty claymation sound collage of a radio station at work. \"Girl's night out\" (dir. Joanna Quinn) is a raucous comedy where a bored Welsh housewife is transformed during a bawdy night at the pub. \"Deadsy\" combines David Anderson's animation with Russel Hoban's narrative on the arms race. Finally, \"The Black dog\" (dir. Alison De Vere) is a wry imaginative fantasy on female sexuality."
