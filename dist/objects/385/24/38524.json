Buskirk of the University of Southern California's entrepreneurial program talks about the qualities needed and the strategies to adopt when setting up a new business. Crucial to the development of a new business is the business plan. This plan should be detailed but flexible and should include elements of market research, financing and forecasting. Examples are given, stressing the need for creativity, courage, energy, aggressiveness and above all, the desire to win."
