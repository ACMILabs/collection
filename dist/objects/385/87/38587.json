        "Episode of Series \"Quantum\". Developed by Jim Haseloff and Wayne Gerlach of the CSIRO, \"gene shears\" technology offers a precise way of removing unwanted genes and viruses from plants and animals, a genetic scalpel which could revolutionise the breeding of plants, and lead to cures for cancer and AIDS. The history of this major new discovery is presented, stressing the priority now given to commercial development and protection of intellectual property through patents, against the free exchange of scientific ideas. Australian attitudes to research and development are also explored - Australian business has shown virtually no interest in developing and exploring this and other major new break-throughs in biotechnology."
