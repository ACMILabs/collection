        "Briefly looks at four aspects of non-verbal communication and what they indicate. 'Gestures' often reveal insecurity, 'Posture' relates to dominance and submission, 'Personal space' consists of four invisible zones, intimate, personal, social and public, 'Eye contact' is often used to co-ordinate and synchronise conversation."
