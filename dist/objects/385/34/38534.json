        "Episode of Series \"Healers quacks or mystics\". Over a quarter of a million Australians now use the services of alternative healers, a sign, perhaps, of a new understanding of the holistic nature of health care where the patient can do much to achieve good health. In this episode, presenter Nevill Drury interviews a chiropractor; naturopath, Dorothy Hall, who explains iridology and how it can be used to diagnose illness; Melbourne surgeon, Avri Sali, who explains how dietary change can prevent gallstones and bowel disease; and participants at Hopewood Health Centre and Euroa House who use relaxation techniques, healthy diet and rebirthing to improve their lives."
