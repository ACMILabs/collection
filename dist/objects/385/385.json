        "The Fang is an animation that uses the animated contributions of past AIM students. Produced and directed by Al MacInnes with the song performed by his band Dan and Al, the Fang celebrates and displays the vast animation techniques and styles used by Al's peers. The Fang himself is a character around town who wonders what the fang is and discovers that he is the fang, a very much sort after man."
