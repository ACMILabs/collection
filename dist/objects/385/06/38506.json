        "Episode of Series \"Changing Australia\". Amongst the Vietnamese community in Australia there are often unresolved tensions between those who left Vietnam before 1975 and the boat people who left after 1975. In 1987 Buddhist priest and Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Thich Nhat Hanh, accompanied by his co-worker, Cao Ngoc Phuong, a Buddhist nun, visited Australia in an attempt to reconcile some of those differences and to teach those who suffered how to free themselves from painful memories. This moving documentary, focuses on this impressive pair and their philosophy which teaches that one must have peace within oneself in order to achieve peace in the world, so that meditation becomes a drastic peace action."
