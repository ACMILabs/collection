        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Bali triptych\". Balinese religion is an amalgam of the worship of local deities and Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. The Balinese display a strong sense of community co-operation and collective responsibility in their adherence to ancestor worship. This is most apparent in the regularity of their attendance at complex rituals at numerous temples and shrines across the island. This program records and explains the significance of many of the most important ceremonies of the 210 day Balinese calendar, ceremonies which feature sacred dance, frenzied trance states and mass exorcism, animal sacrifice, cock fighting, mock battles and time-consuming preparation of elaborate and beautiful decorations and offerings of food."
