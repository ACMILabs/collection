        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". Teresa M. Amabile demonstrates simple graphs which show in pictorial form the distribution of data. Simple histograms are used to picture the distribution of lightning strikes in Colorado and the results of TV programming research. When data is set out in this way a trend can be easily identified. The importance of choosing the correct classes and range is stressed and the significance of outliers, deviations and distribution centres is explained. Finally a stemplot is used to picture data comparing the number of hysterectomies performed by male and female gynaecologists."
