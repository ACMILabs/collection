        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The Business file.\". Alex Burton questions Professors John Coyle and Donald Bowersox on product distribution as part of the marketing mix. Distribution is defined as putting the right product in the right place at the right time in the right quantity and is essential in the provision of customer service. Simple and complex distribution channels are described, some involving many \"middle men\" and some involving only the supplier and the customer. The managing director of Celestial Seasonings then describes the problems of distribution and how he has solved them."
