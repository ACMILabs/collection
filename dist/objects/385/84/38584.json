        "A series which looks at the research projects of individual astronomers, and the process of astronomy. \"Where is the rest of the universe?\" looks at the work of three astronomers: Vera Rubin and Tony Tyson who are conducting separate research projects into dark matter, which astronomers believe makes up 90% of the known universe and Frank Dobson, inventor of a home-made telescope, who preaches the gospel of astronomy to anyone who will listen. \"Searching for black holes\" looks in detail at an experiment linking several radio telescopes worldwide in an attempt to discover if there is a black hole at the heart of a quasar-like galaxy NGC1275. \"A Window to creation\" looks at background radiation from the big bang and the attempt to explain how the smoothness of the primeval universe developed into the complex universe we now can see. Narrated by Richard Chamberlain."
