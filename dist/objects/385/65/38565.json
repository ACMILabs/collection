        "In Australia they're precious. In New Zealand they're pests. A native to Australia, the possum does its best to adapt to the ever increasing suburban sprawl, nesting in our rooves and our backyard trees. In New Zealand however where the species was introduced to bolster the fur industry, this 'native favourite' becomes an 'introduced pest', competing for the precious food supply with New Zealand's native birds, leading to its culling by forestry employees and hunters. Presented by Richard Morecroft."
