        "Depicts women recruits in the Australian Army training camp at Kapooka. The video follows the women as they arrive at Kapooka, to the shouting abuse of the army corporals. The second week of training is marked by strenuous exercise. Shot over the full twelve weeks of their basic training course, this documentary is a graphically accurate portrayal of the process of military indoctrination which tests the women both physically and mentally. Although they came from both urban and country environments, the recruits were united by their desire to make something of their lives. In the end, many were forced to ask themselves the question, 'is it worth it?' Frank, compelling and controversial, this is award-winning documentary making at its finest."
