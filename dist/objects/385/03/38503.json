        "The flamboyant Spanish director, Pedro Almodovar, is one of contemporary cinema's comic masters. \"Law of Desire\" is an exquisite farce about the hypocrisy of machismo, whether in its homosexual or heterosexual guise. Pablo is a famous \"erotic film-maker\" who enjoys a discreet gay lifestyle. But when the beautiful Antonio falls for him Pablo's world is turned upside down by the young man's persistent and obsessive attentions. Very soon Pablo is involved in a crime of passion and his beautiful transsexual sister Tina is the only one who can save him. A festive, colourful mixture of melodrama and hilarity \"Law of Desire \" celebrates sexual difference while simultaneously poking fun at the conventions of romantic love. With Antonio Banderas, Carmen Maura and Bibi Anderson."
