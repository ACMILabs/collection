        "Episode of Series \"Dragons tongue. - Series 2.\". Professor Colin Mackerras looks at the ways in which the Chinese live in community in neighbourhoods. Houses are often concealed behind walls with gate access and arranged around a courtyard. One large extended family may occupy the houses or a few different families may live in this arrangement. There is a communal kitchen facility and the area is supervised by a Resident's Committee. This program also looks at the history of the evolution of Chinese writing into a single script."
