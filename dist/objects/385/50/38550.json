        "Episode of Series \"A Dreamtime story\". Belzah Lowah narrates this story of the Dreamtime, based on a retelling by Charles P. Mountford. The story is of Pariki, a young boy, one of the first people, who lived on an island. Although he had many animal friends he was lonely, and so, when one day he found himself in an unexplored part of the island, he ventured deep into the forest in spite of the warnings of the rock python. Here he met the evil bat spirit, whose bats caught him and carried him up into the heavens where they became stars and Pariki became the biggest star of all, with the bat spirit becoming the man in the moon."
