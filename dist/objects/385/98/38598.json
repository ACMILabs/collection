        "Episode number 5 of Series \"The Business file.\". Sooner or later every business has to consider what to charge for its goods or services. The objectives every company should have when developing a pricing strategy should be profit, gaining market share and stabilising prices, and in the process preventing competition if possible. To achieve this the businessman must consider his costs, market supply and demand and the competition. With the help of Professor Jerry DeHay and using the example of the Zale Corporation, America's largest chain of jewellery stores, Alex Burton explains some of the ways in which these objectives can be achieved."
