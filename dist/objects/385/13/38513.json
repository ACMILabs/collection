        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Bali triptych\". The first part of a fascinating trilogy on the history, culture and way of life of the people of Bali provides an extensive historical survey of the island. Commencing with the myths and legends of pre-history, the program progresses through the peaceful adoption of Buddhism and then Hinduism by the Balinese, the Javanese conquest of Bali in 1343 which led to an unprecedented flowering of Balinese art and literature, the Dutch annexation of Bali in the mid-19th century which the Balinese met with fierce resistance and mass suicides, the Japanese invasion in 1942 and finally the tourist invasion which still goes on today. The program also covers the Balinese rice industry and the importance of dramatic art in conveying Bali's history to the Balinese."
