        "A wealthy society girl, who is about to marry for the second time, finds she still loves her first husband. This witty and sophisticated romantic comedy features a sparkling screenplay, great performances and has a well-deserved reputation as a Hollywood \"screwball\" classic. With Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart. Based on a play by Philip Barry and the inspiration for the musical \"High Society\"."
