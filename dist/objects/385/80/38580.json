        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Marketing / Coast Community College District\". The Irvine Co. is one of the largest property developers in the United States. The success of their planned communities has depended on a careful study of the needs of different segments of the housing market and building to meet those needs. The program explores the history of the company and how it has adapted to changing economic situations in order to design communities which encourage people to live there all their lives, even though their needs change as they age."
