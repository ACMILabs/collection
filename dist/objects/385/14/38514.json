        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Bali triptych\". This second part of a fascinating trilogy on the history, culture and way of life of the people of Bali concentrates on the spiritual beliefs of the Balinese. The Balinese believe in the fundamental unity of all aspects of existence, from birth, to death, to rebirth. Religion is practised as an integral part of daily life and has survived the absorption of Bali into the greater nation of Indonesia and a flood of western tourists. The complex and colourful purification and consecration rites for marriage, pregnancy, birth and death, shown in the video are still practised to maintain the balance between man, nature and the spiritual world and to offer protection from evil spirits."
