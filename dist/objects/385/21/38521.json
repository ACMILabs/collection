        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Sweat of the sun, tears of the moon\". The title of this episode is a quote from Simon Bolivar, the general who liberated South America from its Spanish conquerors over 150 years ago. Bolivar's victory brought independence, but not necessarily freedom given the virtual epidemic of military dictatorships in South America since Bolivar. Writer and narrator, Jack Pizzey, visits two countries - Bolivia, named after Bolivar and Pinochet's Chile - to discover why South Americans are prone to dictatorship and asks whether or not Bolivar's nightmare of tyrants is fading."
