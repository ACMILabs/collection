        "Master carpenter Scott Schuttner will instruct you on how to build solid and attractive stairs by assembling two common staircases: a straight run stair and an L-shaped stair. You will also discover how a professional troubleshoots and corrects problems, how to calculate and mark the rise and run for any length stair, anchor posts and handrails and fasten treads and risers. During the action, the camera takes you where your eyes want to be."
