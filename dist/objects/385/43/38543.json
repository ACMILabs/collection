        "Episode of Series \"Dragons tongue. - Series 2.\". The eating habits of the Chinese are illustrated through filmed and dramatised segments. We see different kinds of restaurants, factory canteens, and a Chinese family at home during mealtimes. The \"History of Chinese\" segment describes the different dialects and languages that exist in China emphasising that there is really only one written script for all of these. Vocabulary introduced covers day to day language concerned with mealtimes and shopping for food."
