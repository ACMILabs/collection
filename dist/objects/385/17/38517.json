        "The Groseilles and the Le Quesnoys are two French families who, under normal circumstances would never meet. The Groseilles are hedonist working class, seizing on every opportunity to make money and have fun. The Le Quesnoys are aristocratic pillars of the community. A vengeful nurse swapped their babies at birth and, after many years, she reveals the secret. A satirical comedy which won four French Academy Awards, including Best Director. In French with English subtitles."
