        "Episode of Series \"Healers quacks or mystics\". At 24, vet and athlete, Ian Gawler was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer. After having one leg amputated, he was faced with only a few weeks to live. Determined to conquer his cancer, Ian embarked on a quest for an alternative cure for his illness. Now, many years later, his cancer arrested, he and his wife conduct meditation support groups for other cancer sufferers. This program follows Ian's search and introduces us to the Melbourne pioneer of non-drug pain relief, Dr. Ainslie Meares, faith healing in the Philippines and Indian healing philosophies."
