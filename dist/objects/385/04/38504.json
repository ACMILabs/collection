        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". The 50's saw a massive intake of young immigrants from Europe, but as these immigrants approach old age the community is encountering problems in how best to cope with their needs, which may be very different from those of the anglo-saxon community to which most retirement and nursing homes are geared. Most of these people come from cultures in which it is not accepted practice to put the aged into institutions. This program looks at two different approaches to the problem - firstly by setting up retirement villages specifically aimed at particular immigrant groups, and secondly by initiating a variety of ethnic foods into the regime of a mixed retirement home."
