        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Dragon's tongue\". In this second episode we are introduced to simple vocabulary associated with leisure activities and the phrases \"Do you like?\", \"What do you like?\", \"How many times?\" as well as vocabulary associated with weather and family members. The calligraphy section shows words which include \"ball\", eg. \"football\", \"volleyball\", etc. The program concludes with two short dramatised situations \"The TV addict\" and \"The Picnic\" in which a Chinese couple are introduced to the joys of the Australian barbecue. In Mandarin and English."
