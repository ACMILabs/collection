        "Episode of Series \"Healers quacks or mystics\". In this episode, Nevill Drury visits the Oki East-West Centre to investigate disciplines which draw on eastern thought and philosophy for new directions in health care. \"Chi\" is the Chinese word for breath of life, an inner energy. The Chinese believe it is the source of remarkable power, so the ability to control this energy is vital for a healthy and happy life. In a healthy person, the \"Chi\" flows smoothly, integrating body, mind and spirit, but in an unwell person there are blockages, or imbalances. The techniques demonstrated include Oki Yoga, Tai Chi, Shiatsu (with Bruce Gyngell as the patient), macrobiotics and acupuncture."
