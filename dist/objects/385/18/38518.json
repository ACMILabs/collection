        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Marketing / Coast Community College District\". The Disney Channel is shown consulting the marketing research company ASI to find out how best to place Disney in the cable TV market. Executives from the companies explain the four P's of marketing - product, price, place, promotion - to be considered when planning a market strategy. Examples of different types of surveys and testing are shown, including phone surveys, focus groups and previews. There is a short explanation of how the data is tabulated, indexed, collated and evaluated, but it is stressed that, however valuable the research is, intuition and experience also play a major part."
