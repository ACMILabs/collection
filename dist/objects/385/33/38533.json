        "Episode of Series \"Healers quacks or mystics\". Marion Fine used no drugs to relieve pain after major surgery, relying instead on techniques of self-hypnosis to both relieve the pain and promote rapid healing. Marion's case vividly demonstrates the importance of patient attitude in the healing process, a factor increasingly recognised by practitioners of traditional medicine. This program demonstrates the history and techniques of hypnosis to relieve pain, bio-feedback and the Pain Education Program for non-drug pain relief, conducted at Macquarie University in Sydney."
