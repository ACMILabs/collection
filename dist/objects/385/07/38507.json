        "Working on no more than a bushman's intuition Bernard O'Reilly battled for days over miles of dense and seemingly impenetrable rainforest to try and locate a downed Stinson airliner. After a two day battle with the elements he not only located the crashed Stinson but assisted in carrying out two of the survivors. Narrated by John Schindler."
