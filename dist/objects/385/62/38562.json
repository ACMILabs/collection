        "19th century author, Rudyard Kipling spent the first six years of his life in Bombay where his father taught sculpture. After schooling in Britain, he returned to India to work for seven years as a journalist before returning forever to England to write full time. Although he never returned to India, Kipling never lost his delight in the romance, mystery and endless variety of Indian life. India formed his imagination and provided his best themes. In this program, Keith Adam retraces the journey of Kipling's character Kim, to locate traces of the old India Kipling loved, and in doing so exposes us to the fascination of India."
