        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Dragon's tongue\". Colin McKerras introduces this lesson, which centres on work. He introduces vocabulary associated with work, such as \"How many days a week do you work?\" and \"What do you want to do when you leave school?\" We see workers in a factory in Beijing and talk to school students about their future plans. The calligraphy section shows the character \"to produce\" and associated characters for \"production\", \"products\" and \"maternity leave\" The two dramatised sections \"Work or study\" which depicts a Chinese family in Australia, and \"Work experience\" showing a student on work experience assignments, include much of the vocabulary introduced. In Mandarin and English."
