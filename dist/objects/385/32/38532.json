        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Dragon's tongue\". Centred around various festivals, particularly the Spring festival or Chinese New Year, this program looks at the lion dance, the use of firecrackers weddings, birthdays and the Chinese national day. Vocabulary learnt is centred around time, with examples being, \"How long?\", \"time off\", \"often\", \"How many?\". Professor Colin Mackerras attends a wedding and explains how a wedding is celebrated, and some of the traditions associated with birthdays. The calligraphy section shows various characters for different festivals. There are dramatised sequences which show a family celebrating the Spring festival, and a birthday, and we also witness a performance of \"Waltzing Matilda\" in Chinese."
