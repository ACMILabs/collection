        "Looks at safety in the office and dispels the notion that offices are safe workplaces but can in fact be the exact opposite. The video covers safety awareness in the office - recognition, evaluation and control; the office environment - correct sitting posture, correct way to lift and carry objects; falls in the office and how to avoid them; office fires and what to do when there is one; storage of chemicals and what to do if there is faulty equipment."
