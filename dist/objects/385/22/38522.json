        "Episode of Series \"Sweat of the sun, tears of the moon\". What qualities inspire passionate admiration in South Americans? This is the question asked by Jack Pizzey as he introduces us to three very contrasting South American stars. Jairo Antonio in Bogota is a champion bullfighter, the sport of Colombia's Spanish conquerors which can cost fans up to 3 weeks wages for an entrance ticket. Antonio Cervantes, three times welterweight champion of the world, hails from an extremely poor Colombian village, populated by descendants of rebel African slaves, where boxing is the main source of cultural pride. Cristina is the star of Brazilian \"soapies\" (telenovellas), her programs watched by 90% of Brazilians. NOTE: BULLFIGHT SCENES ARE VERY GRAPHIC AND MAY OFFEND SOME VIEWERS."
