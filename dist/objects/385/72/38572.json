        "Episode of Series \"Quantum\". Segment from the ABC TV series Quantum documenting a new device that makes it possible to convert solar power (ac) into mains power while at the same time running a diesel generator to produce dc power. The device can also decide which power supply to use at almost any time, favouring the solar/battery combination if possible. The device is being used in an outback Australian town to produce an integrated mains supply. Presented by Geoffrey Burchfield."
