        "Lovesick maidens of Castle Bunthorne pursue poet, aesthete, and fake - Reginald Bunthorne. But Bunthorne loves the village milkmaid, Patience, who does not like poetry, nor understand love. When she finally discovers what it means, it is Reginald's rival whom she decides to marry. Performers include: Derek Hammond-Stroud, John Fryatt, Sandra Dugdale, Anne Collins. The London Symphony Orchestra (London) conducted by Alexander Faris. John McCarthy (Chorus Master), Ambrosian Opera Chorus. Staged by John Cox. Introduced by Douglas Fairbanks Jnr."
