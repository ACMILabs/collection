        "A multi Academy Award winning movie, Mrs. Miniver is an absorbing, emotional and even suspenseful drama of a family living in an English village and how they are touched and even brought to tragedy by World war II. The human element is the key to the appeal of Mrs. Miniver. The relationships, depicted with affection and wit are the basis of poignant, unforgettable drama. Stars Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon, the most popular romantic team on the screen of the 1940's and adapted from the best seller by Jan Struther."
