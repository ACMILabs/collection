        "Episode of Series \"Bush tucker man series\". Les Hiddins' remarkable bushcraft skills have been gained in more than a decade of travel and research in the Top End. They provide the means not only of survival, but also for making life in the bush a little easier: a soap tree used to clean the pots and pans, buffalo dung to repel mosquitoes. Once again, Les demonstrates his ability to eat well in very different environments. He explains how to find water in arid terrain, and advises us not to trust a seemingly innocent-looking fruit. We also discover that the Simpson Desert is no barrier to a man determined to attend a cricket match."
