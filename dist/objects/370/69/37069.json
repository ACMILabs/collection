        "This is Zeffirelli's lavish production of Verdi's much-loved opera, \"La Traviata\", starring Teresa Stratas and Placido Domingo. Violetta Valery is giving a party to celebrate her return to society after an illness - here she meets Alfredo, son of a wealthy merchant, and they fall in love. They live happily together until Alfredo's father comes to Violetta and asks her to end the affair in order to spare his family further dishonour. The heartbreak destroys Violetta's health completely, and Alfredo realises what Violetta has sacrificed - but it is too late!"
