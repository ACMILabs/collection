        "June 25, 1950 - The 38th Parallel marked the beginning of a war that was to be like no other. Witness the non-stop action - from the Pusan Perimeter conflict and General MacArthur's brilliant invasion at Inchon, to the offensive at Yalu River and the Chosin Reservoir battle. Hurtled into combat, thousands of young, inexperienced soldiers battled overwhelming odds and highly trained North Korean forces. Marine platoons fought against enemy regiments as army units desperately tried to hold back hordes of charging soldiers. Fighter pilots flew continuously to support outnumbered ground units, and the casualty rate for the United Nations forces ran into tens of thousands. Robert Stack presents the events that shattered the peacetime atmosphere and plunged America into \"Korea: the forgotten war\"."
