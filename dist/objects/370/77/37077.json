        "In this rollicking tale two members of a school stamp club, the artful scammer and a timid Ralph James compete to find an album of precious stamp treasures hidden on the other side of the world. In trying to track down the hidden stamps, Ralph and his sister, Nancy, uncover a secret magical formula that allows anyone who believes in magic to become so tiny they can ride in the picture on a postage stamp. But Ralph and Nancy are not the only ones with the secret. Tommy Tricker has also discovered the secret. Tommy Tricker has also discovered this method of travel and arrives in Australia before Ralph... but who will find the stamps?"
