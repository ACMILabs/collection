        "Princess Ida was betrothed as a baby to Prince Hilarious - who intends storming the school to take his bride. With her father, King Gama, subtly but none too painfully tortured and her brothers defeated in a fight, Ida agrees to subordinate herself to Hilarious... and love. Performers include: Frank Gorshin, Neil Howlett, Laurence Dale, Bernard Dickerson, Anne Collins. The London Symphony Orchestra (London) conducted by Alexander Faris. John McCarthy (Chorus Master), Ambrosian Opera Chorus. Staged by Terry Gilbert. Introduced by Douglas Fairbanks Jnr."
