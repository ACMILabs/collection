        "It's a normal Thursday in Sheffield when East and West stumble into war and Britain is devastated by 200 megatons of nuclear explosive. This chilling story tells the story of a nuclear strike on Britain. Through the eyes of two Sheffield families, we witness the immediate after effects of the attack - the shock, grief, radiation sickness, hypothermia and starvation. In the following months, hideous injuries remain untreated, looters are shot on sight, food supplies run out and many die in the intense cold of the nuclear winter. Thirteen years on a depopulated Britain living below subsistence level is revealed - a devastated economy where money has no value, crops fail through lack of pesticides, fuel and machinery, and a brutalised postwar generation grows up stunted mentally, physically and emotionally. The fragile fibres that hold society together - the threads - have been completely destroyed and there is no outside aid."
