        "Reviewing the sights of Australia's city streets during the swinging '60's brings back all the memories of those wonderful times. This video features Brisbane's trams from the mid-sixties up until the closure of the system; Flinders and Collins Streets in Melbourne, where we see tramcars; Ballarat, with its mixture of bogie and four wheel cars; Bendigo, for a variety of types including the single truck Birney trams; and the last route to survive in Adelaide's once extensive system, the Glenelg line."
