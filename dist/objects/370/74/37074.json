        "A battle of wits emerges between Father O'Malley and Sister Benedict when their ideas clash in how the children should be taught at St. Mary's School. However, Sister Benedict takes a tip from his unusual methods and buys a boxing book and a baseball bat, then finds herself in the business of making men out of boys. It's not Father O'Malley's only battle. The school is badly in need of repairs and a cynical millionaire has started proceedings to condemn the school building. Starring Ingrid Bergman and Bing Crosby."
