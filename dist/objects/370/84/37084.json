        "The dingo - a mysterious and controversial animal. Filmed over three years, this program shows the natural behaviour of dingoes as never seen before. It follows the life cycle from mating, birth and the growth of pups to adults. The dingo emerges as a tough, resourceful survivor that has earned itself an important part in the Australian legend."
