        "In a \"breach of promise\" case, the learned Judge and Jury are somewhat smitten by the pretty Plaintiff's charms, and the Defendant is hard pressed to explain that indeed he loved this girl once, but fell in love with another. Despite his suggestion that he marry both women, the learned Judge has his own solution - he will marry the Plaintiff himself! Performers include: Frankie Howerd, Ryland Davies, Anna Dawson, Kate Flowers, Tom Mc Donnell. The London Symphony Orchestra (London) conducted by Alexander Faris. John McCarthy (Chorus Master), Ambrosian Opera Chorus. Staged by Wendy Toye. Introduced by Douglas Fairbanks Jnr."
