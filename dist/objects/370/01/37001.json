        "Peace - is a history of the search for peace throughout the war. The ultimate ceasefire is seen by the U.S. as 'peace with honour', and by Saigon as a sellout. \"Surrender\" - examines the final offensive in 1975, two years after America's withdrawal. \"The Unsung Soldiers\" - views the silent homecoming of the veterans. The post war world is unrewarding and sometimes hostile towards men who fought in America's first 'defeat'."
