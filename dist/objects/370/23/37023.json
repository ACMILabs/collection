        "Here, a somnolent Sonny Bono appears as the friendly face of commercial interests. This document is one of a series of reactionary films against drug use and the toning down of 1960's youth culture. A dramatised examination of the \"facts\" relating to marijuana. Contrasts the use of marijuana, alcohol and other drugs. Points out that some people can develop a psychological dependence, and that the laws of the country are designed to protect both the individual and the society. [Ignores established and medical fact that cannabis was freely grown and consumed, and indeed providing the principle source of paper pulp in the U.S. until the Harris Narcotics Act of 1937]. Music by Gene Clarke."
