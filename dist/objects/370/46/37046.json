        "Set in the Oklahoma Territory in the early 1900s \"Oklahoma!\" is an idealised vision of a simpler time, a story of tender romance and violent passion. With choreography by Agnes De Mille, the score is ripe with classics: \"Oh, What A Beautiful Mornin'\", \"The Surrey With The Fringe On Top\", \"People Will Say We're In Love\" \"Oaklahoma\" and many more. This was the first Rodgers and Hammerstein collaboration, starting the most successful creative partnership in the history of musical theatre."
