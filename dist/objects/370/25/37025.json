        "Tender romance, an immortal score and enchanted South Seas splendour are set against the dark backdrop of a world at war, in this lush and passionate musical classic. The score is as breathtaking as the South Seas setting - \"Some enchanted evening\", \"Bali Hai\", \"There is nothing like a dame\", \"Younger than springtime\", and many more. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, \"South Pacific\" ranks among the most celebrated of Rodgers and Hamerstein's acclaimed musical masterpieces. Stars Mitzi Gaynor, Rossano Brazzi, John Kerr, Ray Walston, France Nuyen and Juanita Hall as Bloody Mary."
