        "The pack of women was first devised by Robyn Archer as a cabaret for the stage, and as such it played in London in 1981 and toured Australia in 1983/84. It involved three women and three musicians playing, speaking, dancing and singing - in turns serious, tender, witty, angry, outrageous, sombre, hilarious. All the songs, poetry and prose fitted together to make up a mosaic of new ways of looking at women. Old images were juxtaposed with new lyrics, layers of irony and humour bringing out startling new meanings in familiar songs, and new songs celebrating new women. This version is designed to be as enriching in terms of visual wit and density as it is in text, persuasion and performance."
