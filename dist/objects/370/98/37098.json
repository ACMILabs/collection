        "The title refers to a child's dress size, which the film's heroine, Lili, has unmistakably outgrown. A sullen, uncommunicative 14 year old vacationing with her family in Biarritz, Lili is clearly ready to strike out on her own. She does so by dressing up in jeans, a corset and a raincoat, then hitching a ride to the local nightclub in search of adventure. Not surprisingly, adventure comes her way! \"36 Fillette\", written and directed by French novelist Catherine Breillat, is based on one of her novels."
