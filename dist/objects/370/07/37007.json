        "Take a wonderful journey through the rich and varied fishing areas of South Australia. A geographic presentation gives us not only a tapestry of the best fishing areas, but also a beautifully cinematic vision of the magnificent Southern Coastline. The Murray Valley, Coorong, Eyre and York Peninsulas, and the Spencer and Flinders Gulfs are explored, and sophisticated graphics give both an insight into the best season to fish and the species to be caught in those areas. A summary of the tourist facilities and other attractions is also presented, which makes this program the ideal guide to the coastal and freshwater recreational areas of South Australia."
