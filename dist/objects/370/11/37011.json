        "Episode of Series \"Miss Marple Series\". Elspeth McGillicuddy travels from London to St. Mary Mead to visit her old friend Miss Marple, catching the 4.50 train from Paddington. On the way the train draws to a halt and another train draws alongside. In the carriage opposite the blind suddenly snaps up. Glancing across, Mrs McGillicuddy witnesses a sight she will never forget. Almost immediately the train chugs away, leaving the image printed in Mrs. McGillicuddy's mind - she has witnessed a murder! Stars Joan Hickson as Miss Marple."
