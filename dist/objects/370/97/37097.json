        "For an opera which in its original form met with derision, Puccini's \"Madam Butterfly\" has more than proved those critics wrong. It is now one of the standard and favourite works adored by opera-lovers everywhere. Its themes of love and heartbreak are common in almost every human experience and its plethora of beautiful melodies make it immediately attractive to audiences everywhere. The orchestra of the Arena is conducted by Maurizio Arena."
