        "The Sound of Music, the most popular movie musical of all time, is a heart warming, inspirational and true story based on the lives of the Trapp Family Singers. Julie Andrews is Maria, a spirited, young Austrian woman who becomes governess to the children of the autocratic widower Baron Von Trapp. She brings warmth and music to the strict household of the reserved former naval captain, and soon wins over the children - and finally the Baron as well."
