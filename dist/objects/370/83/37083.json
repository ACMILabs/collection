        "Part two of this major drama production which coincided with the centenary of Richard Wagner's death. Wagner remains an enigma with his rags-to-riches saga with a fairytale end. He was loved yet hated, admired yet despised, a villain yet a hero. Wagner was worshipped and a man whose fame and exploits were the gossip of Europe. Above all, he was an incurable romantic, whose love affair with Liszt's illegitimate daughter rivals that of Romeo and Juliet in excitement and drama. This is Wagner's story - the story of one of the greatest composers who ever lived."
