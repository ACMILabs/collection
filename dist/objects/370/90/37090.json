        "Kismet is an enchanting musical filled with sensual dance and magical song. Howard Keel plays the witty poet-beggar whose quick tongue is forever getting him in trouble...and out again. Masquerading as Hajj, a famous sorcerer with magic powers, he has just the right amount of charm to turn a fair lady's head, a fair lady who happens to be the Wazir's Number One Wife! Cast also includes Ann Blyth, Dolores Grey, Vic Damone."
