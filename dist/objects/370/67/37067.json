        "In 1947, the House of Un-American Activities Committee came to Los Angeles to investigate communism in the motion picture industry. This feature-length documentary details the hysteria and paranoia of the blacklist years which deeply divided America and Hollywood. This was a time of the Red Scare, loyalty checks and Joseph McCarthy, of the Hollywood Ten and the Motion Picture Alliance for the preservation of American Ideals, of film union wars and anti-communist movies - a time that America and Hollywood would like to forget."
