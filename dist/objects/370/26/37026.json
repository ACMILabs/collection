        "Shall we dance? is a lightweight, farcical, and quite delightful story about people who appear to have no serious problems or thoughts. Fred Astaire plays Petrov, a supposedly Russian ballet dancer, and Linda Keene plays a revue dancer. On the liner, \"Queen Anne\" - bound for New York from Le Havre, they are mistakenly believed to be husband and wife, and consequently many complications arise from this mistaken premise!"
