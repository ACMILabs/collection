        "Recorded live in the intimate surroundings of Ronnie Scott's Club, on the 21st February, 1985, this video features one of the finest incarnations of The Messengers yet heard - driven on as ever by the unstoppable energy of Art Blakey. The great man also talks frankly about his life, music and beliefs in an exclusive interview."
