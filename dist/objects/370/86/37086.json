        "As part of an experiment to separate the good and bad sides of men's souls, Dr Harry Jekyll drinks his own potion and turns into Mr Hyde, his evil self. When his fiancee is taken abroad, the lonely Jekyll turns to Hyde for release. He ensnares a pretty barmaid and keeps her a virtual prisoner. Hyde soon begins to overpower Jekyll, and the doctor becomes trapped in a vortex of cruelty and murder. Cast includes: Spencer Tracy, Ingrid Bergman, and Lana Turner."
