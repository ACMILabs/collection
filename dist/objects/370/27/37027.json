        "Gunga Din is rowdy, heroic, exciting, funny and steeped in the romantic tradition of moviemaking. A sergeant in the British army, Cutter is a restless treasure-seeker likely to get everyone into trouble; MacChesney is a typically gruff and aggressive NCO always ready for a fight; and Ballantine is a gentleman who thinks he wants to leave the army to marry his one true love. Gunga Din is an Indian water carrier, a friend in need to the trouble-making trio - a simple man who is destined to become a hero. Based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling the film stars Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Joan Fontaine."
