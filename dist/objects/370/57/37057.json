        "Banished for twenty-five years for marrying a mortal, beautiful fairy, Iolanthe, returns from her watery prison still only seventeen years old. But her youth and beauty cause trouble when her half-mortal son, Strephon, cannot convince his fiancee, Phyllis, that the girl with whom he is discovered is really his mother. Phyllis decides to marry a Lord instead, and the Fairy Queen has to meddle in politics to set things right - even reuniting Iolanthe with Strephon's father, the Lord Chancellor. Performers include: Derek Hammond-Stroud, Richard Van Allan, Kate Flowers, Alexander Oliver, Anne Collins, Sandra Dugdale. The London Symphony Orchestra (London) conducted by Alexander Faris. John McCarthy (Chorus Master), Ambrosian Opera Chorus. Staged by David Poutney. Introduced by Douglas Fairbanks Jnr."
