        "In this program, Jean Kilbourne examines images in advertising. She explores the relationship of media images to actual problems in society, such as the channelling of men and women into traditional roles and occupations, economic discrimination against women, the sexual abuse of children, rape and other forms of violence, pornography, sexual harassment, teenage pregnancy and eating disorders."
