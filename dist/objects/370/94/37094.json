        "Episode number 8 of Series \"The Shock of the New Series\". Part 8 of an 8-part series which presents a social history of the impact and development of the visual arts in the 20th century. In this episode, art critic, Robert Hughes discusses the future of modern art. He examines how modern art has gradually lost its sense of newness and possibility, and how the avant-garde has become a dying form. The program explores the influences museums, investment and media have had on the general public's response to modern art."
