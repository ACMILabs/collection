        "The ads proclaimed \"Garbo laughs!\" and back in that banner movie year of 1939, moviegoers everywhere joined in the laughter as the legendary actress starred in her first romantic comedy, \"Ninotchka\". Garbo plays a dour, severe Soviet official who comes to Paris on business involving the the sale of some Czarist jewels. Soon business turns to pleasure as she discovers the special magic of Paris and succumbs to the charms of a suave Frenchman named Leon D'Algout (Melvyn Douglas)."
