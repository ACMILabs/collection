        "Seven brides for seven brothers is a funny, romantic, physically lively movie musical. It represents a wonderful mix of story, characters, song, ideas, and dancing. In Oregon, when Adam Pontipee brings a bride back to the farm after a visit to town, Milly finds that she has to be not only a wife, but also mother to her brothers-in-law. The six brothers listen to Adam's story of the sobbing' women and decide to steal brides for themselves."
