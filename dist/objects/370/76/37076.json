        "Verdi, himself an honoured patriotic figure, held the poet Alessandro Manzoni in the highest esteem. The great Requiem Mass, as superb and typical as any of his operas, was composed by Verdi in memory of Il Santo Don Alessandro. A rare gathering of four of the world's most distinguished soloists - Jessye Norman, Margaret Price, Jose Carreras, and Ruggero Raimondi - sets the scene for an unforgettable performance of one of the finest of all Requiem Masses. From the Edinburgh International Festival the London Symphony Orchestra is conducted by Claudio Abbado."
