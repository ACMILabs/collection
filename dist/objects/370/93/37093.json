        "A thousand miles in an open outrigger canoe, voyaging through some of the most beautiful islands and most treacherous waters on earth! This is the challenge accepted by nine crews from all over the world who gather in Bali to sail through the Indonesian archipelago, across the Timor Sea to Darwin. For crews of young men and women from Australia, U.K., Holland, Germany, France, Japan, U.S.A., New Zealand and Indonesia, it was an adventure that they will never forget."
