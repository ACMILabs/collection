        "Episode of Series \"Bush tucker man series\". Wild and spectacular countryside forms the backdrop for Les Hiddins' adventures, including the rock pinnacles of a 'Lost City', enormous underground lava tubes and the rugged beauty of the Kimberleys. Les retells the often tragic social history of many of these remote places, such as the failed British garrison at Port Eisington. Along the way, his varied diet includes anything from Barramundi to the Tennis Ball fruit. We see how even Les gets bogged down in the wet lands of Cape York, and follow his explorations of an inland lake in an ingenious canoe made from tree bark."
