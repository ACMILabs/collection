        "Irving Berlin's \"Easter Parade\" united Judy Garland and Fred Astaire, the screen's top song and dance stars, for the first time. The story is about the ups and downs of a top dancing duo who split up after a long and successful career. The song and dance man is convinced that he can take any girl from the chorus line as a partner and become more famous, but he finds that he is in for a shock or two! Also features Ann Miller and Peter Lawford."
