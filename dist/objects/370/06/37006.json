        "Known as history's first 'living room war', the Vietnam conflict is presented here with clarity, authority and insight. Written by Pulitzer Prize winner, Peter Arnett, and narrated by Richard Basehart, it's seen through the eyes of key policymakers and fighting soldiers. The interviews, film clips, and commentary put this 'police action' into an illuminating perspective. \"America in Vietnam\" - gives an overall perspective of the shifting attitudes of the United States towards Vietnam, from the early liaison to the ultimate fall of Saigon. \"Dien Bien Phu\" - examines the French surrender at this crucial battle, and how it triggered 20 years of direct American involvement in Vietnam."
