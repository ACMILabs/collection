        "Wagner - the film is one of the most important independent productions ever attempted, bringing together the talents of some of Britain's most prominent musical and theatrical names. Music is conducted by Sir Georg Solti and the production stars Richard Burton as Wagner with Vanessa Redgrave, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir Laurence Olivier. This is the first in a two part series which chronicles the rags-to-riches saga of Richard Wagner - one of the greatest composers that ever lived."
