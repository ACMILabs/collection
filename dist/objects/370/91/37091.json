        "When King Kong, the eighth Wonder of the World and living god of fog-shrouded Skull Island, sets his passions on blonde beauty, Ann Darrow, all hell breaks loose. The enraged Kong battles a menagerie of prehistoric monsters, stomps jungle villages and chews up their inhabitants when Ann is snatched from his hairy paw. Captured and transported to New York, Kong breaks loose to wreak havoc on the Big Apple. The last scene atop the Empire State Building is one of the truly great moments in Hollywood history. Based on a story by Edgar Wallace."
