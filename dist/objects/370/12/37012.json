        "Episode of Series \"Miss Marple Series\". Everyone in Chipping Cleghorn thinks that the advertisement in the local paper is a joke - but the villagers are intrigued by this new style of party game, and turn out in force at the appointed hour. They are not disappointed. As the clock strikes seven, the lights go out, the door to the drawing room swings open, a torch beam plays around the room - and three shots ring out. Then a body slumps at the door. It is no longer a game. Inspector Craddock and everyone present agree that the dead man shot himself. Miss Marple thinks differently. Stars Joan Hickson as Miss Marple."
