        "Episode number 8 of Series \"The Shock of the New Series\". Fifty years ago our culture became that of the mass media, crammed with stimuli, an overload of advertising and technology. The late 19th century saw the arrival of industrial imagery; then it was the sign and print which dominated. In this fight between painting and media, art could not win. Pop sensibility's good side was letting art react to mass culture; its bad side was the manipulation of promotional garbage. Yet even in today's culture, man is judgemental - choice and taste may yet preserve the responsibility of painting. Written and narrated by Robert Hughes."
