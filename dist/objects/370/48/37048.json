        "George and Marion are killed in a car crash - but their spirits 'live' on, invisible, on terra firma rather than in some heavenly eternity. They discuss their predicament - and decide that they'll have to do a good deed to go to 'the other place'. They feel that Cosmo Topper, the bank president, should learn how to enjoy life and set about doing something about it. Some of the trouble comes from the fact that Cosmo can see them but nobody else can."
