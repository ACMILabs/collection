        "Charlie Chaplin was born on April 6, 1889 in South London, of not so successful music hall entertainers. At the age of eight, he joined a variety act called \"The Eight Lancashire Lads\", and worked throughout England and parts of Europe during his childhood. He toured America in 1910-11 and returned again in 1912-13 when he joined the Keystone company. This compilation features four of his short films, The Vagabond\", \"The Fireman\", \"The Count\" and \"Behind the Screen."
