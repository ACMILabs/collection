        "Bound by an ancient curse to commit a crime everyday, Sir Despard Murgatroyd is greatly relieved to learn that shy Robin Oakapple is, in fact, the rightful Lord of Ruddigore and victim of the curse. Robin, who has won, and now lost, his etiquette-obsessed sweetheart, Rose Maybud, ultimately calls on his ancestor's ghost, and his own logic to lift the curse and win back Rose. Performers include: Vincent Price, Keith Michell, John Treleaven, Donald Adams and Sandra Dugdale. The London Symphony Orchestra (London) conducted by Alexander Faris. John McCarthy (Chorus Master), Ambrosian Opera Chorus. Staged by Christopher Renshaw. Introduced by Douglas Fairbanks Jnr."
