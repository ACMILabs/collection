        "One of 6 works selected by AIM director David Atkinson as representing the best interactive work produced by the AIM centre up until 2004. Memo is a journal-like collection of imagery, text and observations that looks at the permeation of the mediascape, technology and popular culture with the everyday. Intrigued by how this convergence shapes and influence what we perceive as self, experience, memory and identity I have examined and re-presented visual and verbal material derived from daily life-sounds, samples, imagery, text and language. A subtle and very beautiful piece of interactive design and visual patina. Selected for exhibition at MILIA's \"New Talent Pavilion\" 2001, Cannes, France."
