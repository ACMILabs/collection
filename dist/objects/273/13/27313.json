        "Episode of Series \"Planning for Teaching\". Shows how teachers need to maintain their own mental growth and resilience to make the most of teaching. Dramatises cases of four typical teachers to explain how a teacher can avoid failure and frustration, and give inspiration instead of boredom to their charges. Stresses that teachers need to make conscious effort to deepen their understanding."
