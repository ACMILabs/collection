        "Point Pelee National Park, southernmost tip of the Canadian mainland in Ontario, provides a hunting ground every spring for the ornithologist, entomologist, botanists- and the photographer. This seven-mile strip of forest-covered land projecting into Lake Erie services as a main way-station for migrating birds. This film shows many different species of birds found into this protected area, as well as butterflies and other insects and examples of wild-flowers and shrubs."
