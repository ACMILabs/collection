        "This film shows how Julius Erdelyi, a teacher at Woodlands School, New Westminster, prepares children for real-life situations outside the classroom - walking through downtown traffic, for instance. He brings in actual traffic lights and follows this up with field trips. The children suffer from varying degrees of being mentally handicapped, but they all obviously welcome such opportunities to learn and grow."
