        "Produced in collaboration with the Williamsburg Restoration, this film aims at an authentic portrayal of life in 18th century colonial Virginia. Williamsburg was the centre of the economic, social and political life of the colony, which depended mainly on the products of the tobacco plantations in the area for its wealth. The life of the slaves and indentured servants is studied, in conjunction with the current legal system, together with the social customs of the plantation owners and their families, and the music, architecture, and costumes of the period. The methods of manufacture, means of transport, and the medical practices of the day are also presented."
