        "This film shows that industrial, home and noise pollution are occurring more often in society. It shows that individual selfishness is to blame for much pollution. The role of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) in detecting and preventing pollution especially sewage pollution, is shown. Suitable for secondary school level."
