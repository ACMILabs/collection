        "An original method of presenting children's poetry. Introduces the fundamental ideas of rhythm, imagery, and word sounds. Shows that poetry is wonderfully descriptive, using all the aspects of language to communicate meaning with feeling. Develops the idea that poetry stimulates a greater appreciation of surroundings."
