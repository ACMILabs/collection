        "Episode of Series \"Searching for values: a film anthology\". A long-term popular politician, proud of \"getting things done for the people\", ruthlessly fights to retain his office with a panoply of unethical tactics and henchmen. Deeply entrenched in corruption, the politician retains his office due to the efforts of his supporters who organised a mass movement of popular support for him. Edited from the film \"All the King's Men\" produced and directed by Robert Rossen."
