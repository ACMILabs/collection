        "Pleuropneumonia, the dread cattle disease. In one Victorian outbreak, 8000 cattle were quarantined and 7000 slaughtered. Despite a six month quarantine in NSW and a permit entry, northern cattle could introduce the disease again. The symptoms, hollow flanks, laboured breathing and dribble from the mouth, are not apparent in either the incubating or carrier animals. Farmers notify the local Department of Agriculture when the disease is first noticed. The suspect area is quarantined and all animals brought into the State in the same mob are blood tested in order to trace and eradicate the disease."
