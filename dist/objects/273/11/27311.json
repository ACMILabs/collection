    "description": [
        "In 1949 the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works was asked to formulate a plan that would estimate the future needs of Melbourne. From information gathered through surveys, inspecting every street and alley to determine its use, this was made possible. \"Planning for Melbourne's Future\" is photographed and directed by Geoffrey Thompson and is an examination of this plan. It is a rare and honest account of the deficiencies and lack of planning made to prepare Melbourne for an increase in future population growth."
