        "In 1943 Montreal had 4000 juvenile delinquency cases; in 1948 it had 1800. The Police Juvenile Boys' Club, started by Captain-Detective Ovila Pelletier, made all the difference. By providing youngsters who had few, if any, options in their leisure activities with the opportunity to learn, play and watch team sports, and to borrow the expensive sports equipment, he offered them a pleasing and acceptable alternative to delinquent behavior."
