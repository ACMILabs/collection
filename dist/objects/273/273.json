    "description": [
        "Surfing, sexuality and masculine bodies beneath the female gaze. A handheld camera closes in on private space of surfers as they disrobe in carparks and attempts to catch them 'out'. Filmed in and around Sydney beaches, Moffatt and female friends have documented a playful but edgey representation of surfer culture as the interaction between the filmmaker and subject moves towards active voyerism. The heavy drum beats and lapping waves of the soundtrack mirror the thrill and excitement of gender mis-representation. How do the males react, or perform, on camera and how do audiences interpret their own voyeuristic desires? What does it suggest about the role of the film maker, of ethics or 'surveillance'?"
