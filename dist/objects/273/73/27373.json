        "Produced in 1960, this still timely two-part film examines the effects of widespread chemical insecticide use, both on the insect population and on warm-blooded creatures, including humans. Part 1 looks at the ravages of insects and the centuries-old struggle to control them. Part 2 shows experiments being conducted to find ways of controlling specific insects, while leaving harmless ones unaffected."
