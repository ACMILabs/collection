        "With light all plant life would be limited to fungi, for light, like water, is essential to plant growth. Experiments with potatoes demonstrate how, as spring approaches, stalks feel their way towards the nearest light source. Explains that light is essential because it is the means by which the leaves can produce starch from water and carbon dioxide. Uses time lapse photography."
