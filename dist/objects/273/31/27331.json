        "From a pond to the sea, we investigate the structure of plants suited for life in the water. Careful distinction is made between two major plant groups. Examples of the simplest group, the algae, range from microscopic \"pond scum\" to giant kelps. Examples of plants with true leaves, stems and roots range from eloda to water hyacinth, water lily and lotus."
