        "A sequence of three major links - plankton, water fleas and fish - is selected to demonstrate the food chain as a continuous cycle in different aquariums. We observe the effects of varying the fish population and what happens when the balance is upset. Viewers are led to collect and compare visual evidence and evaluate the factors that contribute to the satisfactory function of the chain."
