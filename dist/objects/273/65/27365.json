        "A prose poem read by Leonard Cohen from his novel \"Beautiful Losers\" to the accompaniment of diverse photographs and other illustrations, with the camera moving in and out of the pictures often with surrealistic effect. He reads four times and each time the effect is different because of his rendition or the accompanying visuals. (Awards: Bilbao, Oberhausen)"
