        "This film aims at persuading managements to replan their factories and introduce work-flow, modern lighting and other developments. Points out that rises in productivity in steel-making, printing and laundering firms resulted from improved plant layout. Stresses the importance of co-operation between management and their commercial and technical staffs, and also that redundancy is not necessarily the consequence of rising output."
