        "Steam engines are no longer used for ploughing, but this film shows such machinery at work in ploughing, cultivating, mole draining, dredging, and the special operation of moving a barn. Steam engines are costly to run, and have been replaced by tractors, but the Steam Plough Club is keeping the traditions alive."
