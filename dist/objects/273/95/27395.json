        "How much faith should one put in popular psychology? When psychological theories are all around, how is the lay person to keep proper perspectives? The film centers the question around two women, Barbara and Jane. Barbara is regarded by Jane as indulging in the psychology fad, looking for problems in her husband and child to practise her do-it-yourself analysis. But, wonders Jane, is a little psychology better than none at all? The question is left open for discussion."
