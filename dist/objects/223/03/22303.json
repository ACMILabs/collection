        "This film depicts a world where space is geometric, noise is absent and nothing happens until a small white cube comes bumping along, stirring up movement where before there was none. Chased by a wicked demon, the cube symbolizes the inner struggle which goes on inside each one of us: the confrontation, or evasion, of one's private demons. A film without commentary. (Awards: San Francisco)"
