        "Episode of Series \"The Willis Reed basketball series\". Dick Van Arsdale of the Phoenix Suns is a rare \"four-way\" player - equally good at both defense and offense and at ease both as a forward or a guard. In this film, Van Arsdale concentrates on the elements of defense at which he is so outstanding. He shows how a player must learn to position his feet and use his hands properly, shows how to fight over a \"pick\" and switch on a \"screen\"."
