        "Shows the different practices of English and American secondary schools as shown in typical London and Chicago examples. In England there is segregation of students by ability, specialisation of courses and emphasis on passing external examinations, the school atmosphere generally formal and authoritarian, and with some social stratification of schools. In America students of all abilities are in the same classes, the supervision is relatively relaxed and permissive and social adjustment and development of individual personality is emphasised. There is much experiment and variation between schools, and some social discrimination particularly against African Americans."
