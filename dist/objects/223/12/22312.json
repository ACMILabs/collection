        "Explores the gamut between blues and depression. Differentiates between normal and abnormal reactions to crisis and shows us how to recognise danger signs. In depth case studies of three young people are carried out as two of them seek help and one does not. Others have an opportunity to ask questions about their emotional ups and downs. Dr Marvin Karno of the UCLA Neuro-psychiatric Institute appears as a counsellor to offer authentic doctor/patient experience. Commentary by Joseph Campanella."
