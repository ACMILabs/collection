        "Episode of Series \"Geometry\". Presents basic ideas of symmetry by exhibiting dihedral groups by reflections of intersecting mirrors. From reflection in a single mirror the film proceeds to study the surprising effects and beautiful patterns that can be produced with two or three mirrors. Observations on the general case are made as well as on the limiting case in which two mirrors are parallel."
