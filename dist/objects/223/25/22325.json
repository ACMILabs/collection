        "Episode of Series \"Earth and it's peoples\". Shows how the nomadic tribes of the Sahara have adapted their way of living to the barren environment in which they live. Water is scarce and vegetation is scattered, so that the nomads must continually move their camels and goats in search of new pastures. Camels are the sole means of transportation and also the main source of wealth, and periodically the tribesmen go to the cities to sell camels and buy barley and other goods. The film also shows the nomads visiting oases where there is permanent water and exchanging animal products for dates, grain and vegetables. Photographed by Richard Leacock."
