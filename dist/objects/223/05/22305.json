        "Designed to serve as a practical aid for teachers presenting a course in film appreciation. Experience has shown that one of the first barriers to be broken down in such a course is the students' ignorance of the fact that a film is MADE, that it is the result of conscious decision by the film maker. Teachers may use it to demonstrate the more common shots in film making. They may use it to establish the idea of film editing - the joining together of separate shots into a meaningful unit. The film's deficiencies and faults should serve as valuable teaching points during discussion after the film."
