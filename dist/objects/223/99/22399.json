        "The history of the diplomat's functions and skills. The commentary includes quotations from figures as contrasted as Demosthenes, Machiavelli, and President Kennedy. Shows how the modern career diplomat exercises techniques developed over centuries, but today is supported by the resources of modern technology. He must have qualities of patience, integrity and a strong sense of national purpose. Narrated by Alastair Duncan."
