        "Describes the work of two palaeontologists looking for fossils on a rocky hillside. They uncover the paddle or flipper of a plesiosaur which was a large water living reptile or sea serpent closely related to dinosaurs. The methods used to uncover the bones, preserve them, and transport them to a museum are shown, also the tedious work of assembling the bones, fitting them in position and reconstructing the entire animals are explained. Models of representative animals of the age of dinosaurs are shown."
