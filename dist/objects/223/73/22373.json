        "Millions of tons of gravel and sand are sifted and washed in the search for diamonds in South Africa. In London the diamonds are cleaned and sorted according to size, shape, color and clarity. Most are used in industry but the finest are kept for jewellery. This age old craft of designing and making jewellery is shown as a delicate and unique work of art."
