        "Episode of Series \"Psychology\". Presents the thesis that though heredity sets certain limits to the development of an individual, environment, which includes everything that happens to an individual, is of great importance. Shows how Tommy and Jimmy Bradley develop different personalities since their environments are not really similar, social expectancy pushing one toward one side of the family, the other toward the other side. Reaction of the two brothers to a new neighbour and different family life are shown."
