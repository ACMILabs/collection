        "In this animated fable with no narration, a caveman builds a car and soon the whole planet is overrun with cars, trucks and airplanes and the air choked with polluting fumes. The imaginative cartoon focuses on one aspect of destruction to the environment and offers a tongue-in-cheek solution - send all cars off in a rocket, into outer space."
