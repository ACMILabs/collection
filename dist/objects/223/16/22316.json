        "Philosophical, scientific voices intone the marvels beyond man's comprehension, to the accompaniment of dreamy, highly coloured images and sounds. Until, finally the camera pulls back to reveal the subject of the symposium. This parody of the jargon and the relentless close-ups of didactic scientific films is actually a parable of an 800 year old story: \"Elephant in the Dark\" a little fable about people who feel different parts of an elephant, all believing that what they feel is the whole beast. A serious yet entertaining look at the impediments in current thought which prevent certain forms of understanding between people. Written by Idries Shah"
