        "Concerned with the use of absorbtion spectra data in the calculation of structural information such as bond lengths, bond angles and bond strengths. The emphasis in the program is on the electrical characteristics of molecules which absorb electro-magnetic radiation, and how absorbtion in the microwave and infra-red regions of the spectra can be related to motions of the individual molecules."
