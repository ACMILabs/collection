        "This is the companion piece to the film, \"Democracy\". It presents the abstract thesis that power concentrated in the hands of a few, who thus control the means of communication and are able to slant economic distribution in their own favour, and restricted respect of one's fellow men, are two of the important characteristics of despotism."
