        "This film is a study of English town-planning from pre-Roman settlements to modern housing estates. The survey includes the fortification of medieval feudal towns, the dignity and elegance of the 18th century mansions, and the chaos which the industrial revolution caused for the vast majority of the population of cities. After World War 1 new ideas for housing and town-planning were formulated but much remains to be done. World War 2 brought bomb damage to hundreds of English communities."
