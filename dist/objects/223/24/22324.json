        "An account of the life cycle, structure and behaviour of the desert locust. Follows the development of the locust through the five hopper stages when the insect goes through a state of immobility, explaining that this is the best time to destroy it. The most widely used method of destruction is hand dispersed poison mixed with a bait such as wheat bran."
