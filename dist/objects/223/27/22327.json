        "The story of the British Eighth Army's victory at El Alamein, and its advance commencing on 23rd October, 1942 across nearly 1,400 miles of desert in 80 days to Tripoli. The film begins in the days when Generals Alexander and Montgomery took command. The disposition of the opposed forces and the strategy of both sides are explained by means of diagram. After the break-through at El Alamein the camera follows the advance through Mersa Matruh, Halfaya Pass, Sollum, Tobruk, Benghazi, and El Agheila, to the victory parade in Tripoli. Commentary written by J.L. Hodson. (Awards: Academy award, 1943 Best Documentary)"
