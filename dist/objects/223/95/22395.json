        "A film without words (with titles in French) in which simple actions achieve surprising results. A man wants a door in a wall; he draws a rectangle and, presto, there is an opening. In the same way, he conjures up furnishings. If too high or too low, a raising or lowering of a finger puts everything right. The film is a sort of lesson in proportions, which young viewers especially should enjoy. Cast: Paul Buissonneau, Louise Latraverse."
