        "Research on problems of building design for Australian conditions. Maintaining an acceptable indoor climate by economic means involves a building of suitable thermal characteristics using insulation and heating and cooling as required, proper lighting and ventilation. The noise problem, protection of external surfaces and relating the building to its environment for best use of the natural climate are considered."
