        "Episode number 13 of Series \"Wild Life\". The emu, found only in Australia, is second in size to the ostrich. Like the ostrich it is unable to fly, but with its long and powerful legs is able to run at great speeds. Traces the history of the emu from when it roamed over the whole continent and Tasmania. European settlement has led to the extermination of the emu except in Central Australia. Shows laying of eggs, the male emu keeping the nest, hatching chicks and two years growth to full size."
