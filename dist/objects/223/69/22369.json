Various researchers explain the nature of diabetes; it differs when it attacks children and adults.A mother and daughter comment on the effect the illness has on the latter and how through family and outside support she copes with it. An adult man discusses his illness and Dr. Best explains, with the help of old photographs, how he and Dr. Banting discovered insulin - which we see being manufactured."
