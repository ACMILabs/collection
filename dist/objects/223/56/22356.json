        "Episode of Series \"Elementary School Teacher Education\". As the child grows toward maturity, successive stages of development are apparent - each stage has a distinctive pattern of behaviour. A study of the daily life of an eight-year-old girl and a nine-year-old boy illustrates the chief development characteristics of pre-adolescents. Their patterns of behaviour provide information on developing a curriculum suitable to their needs and educational experiences."
