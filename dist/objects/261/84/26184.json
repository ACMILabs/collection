        "In four short situations this film examines a paradox of modern life; our increased knowledge about all phases of the universe except ourselves. In the first, a Wiggleman discouraged by one light switch which does not respond to him discovers a number of possible switches yet to be tried; in the second two figures choose togetherness in preference to separateness when their game on a teeter-totter doesn't \"work\"; the third depicts two Wiggleman maintaining a difficult course over an obstructed road because of their optimism and the fourth portrays a figure who, undecided about all the possibilities open to him, grabs at them all only to become frustrated and confused."
