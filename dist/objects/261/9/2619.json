        "Using Larry Jenkins' extraordinary and comprehensive photographic archives of the Sharpies throughout the 1970s, this Public Imaging work is an edited collage of photographic materials and provides viewers with a rare insight into this counter cultural grouping. Faces, places, gatherings, gestures and fashion are explored through this rhythmic assemblage of images. The work consists of two sections: one consisting primarily of portraits and social groupings; the second concentrating on details of gestures and adornments representative of Sharpie culture."
