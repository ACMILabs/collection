        "This film uses animation and maps to explain normal weather conditions and the atmosphere that creates the prevailing winds. Maps and diagrams also show the zones of the prevailing westerlies, and trade winds, and the way in which warm moist air rises, cools by expansion, loses its moisture by precipitation, and so on."
