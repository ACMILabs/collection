        "Instead of pick and shovel, the modern prospector employs all the resources of science to look for buried treasure. Aerial surveys, airborne magnetometers, instruments to measure the breadth and depth of ore bodies - with these the prospector can provide data to the company geologist to pinpoint the most promising drilling locations."
