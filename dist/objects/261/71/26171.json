        "Life among the Polynesian people who inhabit New Zealand's Cook Islands. The sea plays an important part in the lives of these people; they are expert spear fisherman and gain much of their food from the sea; singing and dancing and also canoe racing are popular pastimes with the islanders. The film reviews health and educational services provided by the administration and mentions the exports of the Islands - copra, oranges, bananas and pineapples."
