        "Camera animation of designs for an automobile, shifting between the drawings and the prototype, and suggesting through camera movements something of the speed and vitality of the machine. What emerges is the portrait of a leashed thing, an object that seems to tremble with life like any greyhound. Through the camera and the non-instrumental music the film creates a feeling of exhilaration, of being inside this machine designed for speed. A film without words."
