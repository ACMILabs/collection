        "Inspired and colourful narration accompanies this montage of German propaganda designed to illustrate the worst tyrannies of a Soviet State. Shows the administration of justice in 1948 as applied under Ulbricht's communist regime. Includes pictures taken in Soviet zonal courts, and interviews with judges who fled to the West. An example of cold-war era red-scare demagoguery."
