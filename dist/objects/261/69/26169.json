        "The Mississippi River is the longest and most important river in America. It shaped the history of the continent and the lives of the people who live in its vicinity today. Animated diagrams are used to show its geographical and industrial importance, and the levee system of control of the river is discussed at some length. Various rural and urban industries follow the path of the great Mississippi River."
