        "A brief history of transport in Australia. Various phases, either reconstructed or shown in action, are included: the first mailman, John Conway Burke, delivering by horse; wagons; Cobb & Co. coaches; trains and differences in gauges between States; road transport; aeroplanes in operation, including the Air Beef Lift, Flying Doctor and passenger services. Also includes historical footage of Melbourne and Sydney and emphasises Australia's need for a vast transport system to develop its great areas."
