        "Friends Kat, Daisy and Jojo share their insecurities, dreams and aspirations as they work at Mystic Pizza, a successful pizzeria in small town Mystic. Kat (Annabeth Gish) is sensible and intelligent, holding down 4 part time jobs to finance her way through next year's astronomy course and about to become involved with a married man. Daisy (Julia Roberts in her first major screen role), Kat's sister, is promiscuous and sexy, arguing with her mother who wants her to \"calm down\" and involved with rich kid Charlie in a possible rags to riches romance. Jojo (Lili Taylor) is engaged to fishmonger Bill but is suffering from pre-wedding jitters and her healthy libido is at odds with Bill's catholic conscience. All three of them want to make something of their lives - perhaps get out of Mystic, and all three of them are determined to remain friends forever. Cast also includes William R Moses, Vincent D'Onofrio, Adam Storke and Conchata Ferrell."
