        "Happy Gilmore has an anger management problem, which could be really helpful if he could achieve his dream of becoming a professional ice hockey player. However he is a lousy skater. When his beloved grandmother loses her home to the IRS he desperately tries to find a way to raise the money. Quite by accident he discovers that his hockey slap shot translates to an amazingly accurate 400 yard golf tee shot. So he decides to join the pro golf tour, brining his ferocious temper and outlandish antics to the well-tended fairways. Before long he is a media sensation, attracting hordes of followers and news cameras wherever he goes. A rivalry between Happy and nasty golf pro 'Shooter' heats up, resulting in a riotous confrontation on the once-hallowed golf links."
