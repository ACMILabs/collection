        "Dangerous Australians is a nature program that looks at the venomous creatures that populate Australia. The program profiles such creatures as the red back and funnel web spiders, the blue ring octopus, the black tiger snake, the fierce snake, the sea snake, the box and man-of-war jellyfish, and various poisonous coral. The program also looks at sharks and crocodiles. Reconstructions of actual encounters between humans and various creatures illustrate the potential dangers of these encounters. The program questions why so many of the world's most venomous creatures live in Australia and why these creatures, whose prey is often harmless, have such high toxicity levels."
