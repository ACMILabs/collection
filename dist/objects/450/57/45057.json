        "The 1960's saw a proliferation in what we would now deem as a socially reprehensible, separating twins for the purposes of scientific research. What these studies do reveal however, are interesting questions about nature versus nurture - is everything pre ordained in our genes, or is parenting and the home environment responsible for who we become as adults? Program two looks at twins Jenny and Margaret who are reunited after 58 years, and the two Jims, brought up in two different countries, one raised as a Jew, the other a Nazi, for answers to the nature versus nurture question. Also tests the theory of twin telepathy. Presented by Robert Winston."
