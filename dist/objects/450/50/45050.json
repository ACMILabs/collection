        "Episode of Series \"Time watch\". Dr. Christopher Andrews unravels the complex origins of the Cold War. From the earliest days of the Bolshevik Revolution, he traces the growth of mutual distrust and fear between the Capitalist West and the world's first Communist state - an uneasy coexistence during the inter-war years which finally ended in a complete divorce, dividing the post-war world into two camps and so threatening it with destruction."
