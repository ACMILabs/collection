        "The Alien, the perfect organism. A killing machine whose physical excellence is matched only by its hostility. Officer Ellen Ripley and the crew of the starship Nostromo encountered such a creature and she alone survived the massacre. After floating in space for years Ripley is rescued only to learn that she must return to the planet where her nightmare began. L.V. 426, the world where Ripley first encountered the Alien is now colonised. When communication is lost with the settlers, a team of battle hardened space marines is sent with Ripley and find not one creature, but thousands - the Alien is breeding. Cast includes Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn and Paul Reiser."
