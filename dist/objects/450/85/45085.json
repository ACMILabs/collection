        "The sequel to the 1995 surprise hit 'Babe' moves the action of the first film into the vast unknown of a sprawling metropolis. Along with the radical change comes a surprisingly dark undertone. What launches Babe's adventure is an unfortunate well accident involving farmer Hoggett. Babe, along with Mrs Hoggett, must then head into the big city to drum up money and save the farm from bankruptcy. Once there the native duo are separated and Babe finds himself in a strange boarding house for animals. Although critics feared the film might have been too intense for kids, Miller's film is full of compassion, pathos and unexpected poignanacy."
