        "When his model wife, Amanda (Phoebe Cates) leaves him, aspiring writer Jamie Conway (Michael J. Fox) plunges into a downward spiral of drugs and alcohol on the Manhattan nightclub scene, ably assisted by his sleazy, yuppie friend Allagash (Kiefer Sutherland). Providing some sort of continuity to dreary days en route to nightly excess is the tabloid story of the plight of a coma baby which parallels Jamie's fragile existence since his mother died and Amanda left him. With the help of Allagash's cousin (Michael J. Fox's wife, Tracy Pollan), a persistent younger brother (Charlie Schlatter), and a well meaning colleague (Swoosie Kurtz), there may be hope for Jamie's salvation. \"Bright lights, big city\" is one of Fox's few attempts to break his comic/Mr Nice Guy persona (\"Casualties of war\" being another example), and did so to mixed receptions. Based on the book by Jay McInerney."
