        "Three works from multi-award winning Canadian director/animator Co Hoedeman. All are silent apart from the musical effects. 1.\"Tchou tchou\" (1971, 14 mins): A children's fantasy where painted building blocks represent a make believe city and the two children who play in it until an angry dragon appears on the scene. Themes of play, friendship, threat, fear, attack, defence, failure, inventive solutions, outwitting and success are supported by evocative music and sound effects to create a lively and optimistic \"narrative\". 2.\"The Sand Castle\", (1977, 13 mins): Set in an horizonless sand landscape, a sandman sculpts mythic like creatures from sand. Under his direction they build a wonderful sandcastle. Celebrating its completion they are interrupted by an uninvited, naughty guest. The wind blows strongly and each scrambles for shelter in the fragile sandcastle which becomes enveloped by sand, its outlines crumbling, leaving us where we began in the sand landscape. Interpretations are left to the mind of the viewer. (Awards: Winner of 22, including an Academy Award and a Melbourne International Film Festival Award) 3.\"Matrioska\", (1970, 4.5 mins): A set of Russian Babushka dolls are used as a group of dancers who separate, merge, separate in a series of arrangement themes (eg. smallest to largest, youngest to oldest) to create a choreography. Minute differences of painted expressions, supported by action and music give character to each of the dolls."
