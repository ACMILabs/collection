        "Episode of Series \"Walking with dinosaurs\". This tape comprises episodes five and six of the \"Walking with dinosaurs\" series. \"Spirits of the ice forest\"; Throughout the entire time of the dinosaurs, there were no ice caps on the poles, as thick forests covered Antarctica during the mid-Cretaceous period. Even though the climate was warm and there was no peaks of ice on the Poles, during the winter the sun would set completely for two months, and for the first time in their history, dinosaurs would have faced ice and frost. Those that lived there learned to evolve and adapt to the environment. This program follows a group of small social herbivores called Laellynasaura through their Antarctic life cycle. \"Death of a dynasty\"; After 160 million years of dominating life on Earth, the dinosaurs appear as vigorous as ever and destined to live forever. Tyrannosaurus rules over plains populated by horned and duck billed dinosaurs, beneath the surface however are hidden stresses and problematic ecosystems. Volcanic activity is high and disease and sterile eggs prevalent. The central character in this program is a female Tyrnnosaurs that is trying to raise a new brood of chicks. Her story culminates in a small flash of bright light on the horizon and the resultant earthquakes. What follows is a rain of fire and cloud of ash that covered the globe 65 million years ago after a huge meteor impacted with the Earth. Also available on DVD [318965]."
