        "An information and training video and accompanying trainer's manual about alcohol and drug use in the workplace. Contrary to the popular perception that people with alcohol or other drug related problems are unemployed or disenfranchised, 60-70% are in full-time employment. Of all workplace accidents 20-30% involve people in an intoxicated state. This video aims to demonstrate the extent of the cost, both to industry and the individual, of drug and alcohol use in the workplace. It deals with the responsibilities of industry and co-workers, and outlines employee assistance programs that will help those suffering from dependency problems."
