        "A fascinating two part documentary which follows the young and gifted musician Glenn Gould from his home town near Lake Simcoe, Canada to a recording studio in New York. Includes interviews with the artist and unique footage of him discussing composition with friend and fellow musician Franz Kraemar. Considered one of the greatest exponents of Bach, this portrait is an interesting view into the world of a sensitive creator and interpreter of music."
