        "Ren & Stimpy yuk it up. These three Ren & Stimpy episodes are definitely disgusting - but not genuinely offensive - more like a tickle from a wet hairball: \"Ren's toothache\" - Ren's teeth fall out because he doesn't brush them, and there's only one thing worse than a toothache - a visit from the Nerve Ending Fairy. \"Nurse Stimpy\" - Ren is ill. But have no fear, here comes Nurse Stimpy to attend to the patients every need - with a cure that is more dreadful than the disease. \"The Cat that laid the golden hairball\" - While Stimpy takes a vacation, Ren is left all to himself. He goes looking for something to do when he finds one of Stimpy's hairballs. Ren throws a fit, but he soon changes after the price of hairballs goes up drastically. Stimpy becomes Ren's hairball slave, and soon he runs out of hairballs. Against all odds, he keeps trying so that Ren has his pectorial muscle transplants. Video includes the short cartoon: \"Powdered toastman\"."
