        "This series, written by Sue Fabian and Morag Loh, looks specifically at the place of children in Australia's history, using early drawings and photographs to draw interesting observations about the role of children in the building of the new colony. This particular program looks at the period from the early 1900s to 1946. By the turn of the century primary education was available for all children and new childrens' hospitals were being established in all states. Children now enjoyed more leisure activities, although their games were very much gender based and dependant on whether they lived in the bush or city. During World War 1, children played war games and young men lied about their age in order to enlist, while other children became involved in the peace movement. The program shows the change in the optimistic mood of the young country as devastating losses of Australian troops occurred overseas. The Jazz Age further impacted on lifestyles and the 1920s also saw the migration of thousands of poor and orphaned children from Britain under the \"populate or perish\" notion. When the Depression developed, many families were malnourished and children were put out to work, as employers could pay them lower wages than they paid adults. This period of history also saw the establishment of kindergartens, health centres, the Scouting and Guiding Movement and developments in the education of girls, particularly in the private school system."
