        "Continuing the \"Alien\" trilogy, Ripley's spaceship crash lands into a maximum security work correctional facility, a monastic community, host to some of the most violent criminals in the universe -but she didn't come alone. Once again Officer Ripley is pitted against her deadliest enemy, only this time without the aid of advanced technology or modern weapons. This video also contains a 26 minute documentary called \"The Making of Alien Resurrection\", which is actually the next film in the \"series\" after \"Alien 3\"."
