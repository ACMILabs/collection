        "In a sleepy new England town, three women- Alex, Jane and Sukie (Cher, Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer) gather each Thursday to drink, lament the lack of eligible bachelors in their neighbourhood, and fanstasize about their dream partner. Enter wealthy and attractive Daryl van Horne (Jack Nicholson) whom they have innocently conjured up; unbeknownst to them he is the devil in disguise. It's not long before Daryl has slept with Alex, Jane and Sukie and the town gossip starts- spear headed by local busy body Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright), who soon has a nasty experience with some cherries. The women begin to suspect they are not dealing with no ordinary man and must combine their reinvigorated female energy to defeat Satan himself in the ultimate battle of the sexes. Based on the book by John Updike."
