        "This is the first feature length adventure of the Rugrat babies, intrepid explorers and stars of Nickelodeon's popular animated series created by Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo. When Tommy Pickles gets a new baby brother, Dil (short for Dylan), it's the start of an amazing adventure for Tommy and his friends, Lil, Phil, Chucky and cousin Angelica. Tommy is not at all happy with the new addition to the family as he's noisy and attention seeking. Sibling rivalry takes an unprecedented turn when Tommy decides to send his brother back where he came from- the hospital, to fix him up. While attempting to return little Dil to the hospital, the Rugrats (in the trusty Reptar Wagon) get lost in the forest that is the backyard and must successfully navigate some scary animal obstacles to make it home in one piece. Features the voices of E.G Daily, Christine Cavanaugh, Kath Soucie, Cheryl Case and Tara Charendoff. Cameos are provided by the voices of Iggy Pop, Whoopie Goldberg, David Spade, Lisa Loeb and Patti Smith."
