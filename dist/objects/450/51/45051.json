        "Narrated by Graham Kennedy and presented by Geoffrey Blainey, this 30 minute presentation looks at the effect the 1929 stock market crash had on Australians as Australia was plunged into economic depression in the 1930's. The burden was not shared equally amongst all Australians either, with the unemployed and self employed hit hardest. Those who lived throughout the era reflect on the poverty as well as a sense of comraderie and community developed through adversity. Geoffrey Blainey questions what could have been done to overcome the unemployment then, as well as the lessons that can be applied to unemployment today."
