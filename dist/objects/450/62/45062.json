        "This documentary examines home movies and their unique place in popular culture. Shopsowitz, whose father was a keen amateur filmmaker, traces the history of home movies and camera equipment manufactured for home use from the 1920's, through to the amateur explosion of the thirties, forties and beyond. Footage shot by her father and other filmmakers is interspersed with interviews with scholars, collectors and filmmakers, to convey not only the personal worth of home movies but their cultural value as historical documents that reflect social mores and values."
