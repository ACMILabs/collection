        "All machines, no matter how complicated are made up of combinations of simple machines. This program examines six types of simple machines: the lever; the wheel and the axle; the pulley; the incline plane; the screw; the wedge. Each simple machine is fully explained in a way that the young student can easily follow. Using examples familiar to children, along with computer graphics and animation, the program covers the basic principles of physics that govern simple machines. Video support notes included. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students."
