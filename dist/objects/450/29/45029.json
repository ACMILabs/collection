        "Mick Molloy, together with his coach and caddy, Alan Length, have compiled this instructional video about how to improve oneself at shonky golf. Together they cover areas such as the fundamentals (not just grip, but how to find a good parking spot in the carpark); getting the most out of the pro shop; navigating trouble spots; the mechanics of the golf cart; your relationship with the caddy, future directions in golfing attire, and most importantly, etiquette on the golf course. Put their advice into practice and you too can dubiously navigate your way around the green."
