        "Episode of Series \"Walking with dinosaurs\". This tape comprises episodes three and four of the \"Walking with dinosaurs\" series. \"Cruel sea\"; Despite the success of dinosaurs on land, they have struggled with aquatic existence. The sea is the realm of another group of reptiles, no less successful or awesome than their land counterparts. 149 million years ago, the Jurassic sea boasted creatures living in and around it such as Opthalmosaurus, Pterosaurs and the largest carnivore to grace the planet- Liopleurodon, 25 metres long with teeth that were a quarter of a metre long. This program follows the dramatic conflicts of these creatures that were an annual event in the waters around a small group of islands. \"Giant of the skies\"; This program is structured as a murder mystery, one which opens with the dead body of a giant pterosaur, an Ornithocherius. There is no sign as to why the creature has died, but during the course of the program it is revealed how this King of the Sky met his end after undertaking an epic flight to find a mate. During his journey, the incredible diversity of life in the Early Cretaceous of 127 million years ago is revealed. Also available on DVD [318965]."
