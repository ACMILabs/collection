        "Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum continues his quest to become the world's greatest Pokemon master. He's already caught two of the amazing creatures with the help of Pikachu. Together with Misty, they'll travel across the land searching far and wide for all 150 Pokemon - he's gotta catch 'em all to be the very best. There are plenty of new creatures to learn about (and friends to meet) in this second set of Pokemon adventures. In Japanese, dubbed into English."
