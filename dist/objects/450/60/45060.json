        "John Malkovich and Gary Sinise both deliver powerhouse performances in this adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic tale of doomed friendship set in the Great Depression. Best friends Lennie (Malkovich) and George (Sinise) find themselves unemployed and unable to keep stable employment for long, due to Lennie's infantile mental capacity. Their luck seems to change as they are hired at the Tyler Ranch, although they must endure the over-zealous supervision by the boss's son, Curley (Casey Siemaszko). After settling in and making friends, their world is torn asunder by tragedy when Curley's unhappy wife (Sherilyn Fenn) becomes the innocent victim of Lennie's compassion."
