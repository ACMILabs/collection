        "A compilation of rare British avant-garde and experimental films from the twenties. The loose group of filmmakers represented here contributed not only films, many of which are now lost or neglected, but also, by establishing the influential Film Society in 1925 and the equally influential film magazine 'Close Up' a few years later, provided a cultural framework for a complex web of film practices ranging from avant-garde experiments to agit-prop."
