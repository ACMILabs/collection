        "Episode of Series \"Walking with dinosaurs\". This tape comprises episodes one and two of the \"Walking with dinosaurs\" series. \"New blood\"; The setting is 220 million years ago and we find ourselves in the mid Triassic period. The world is still in recovery mode, having experienced a mass extinction that millions of years before reduced the population by 95%. The program follows a small group of ancient reptiles and primitive mammals in a river valley as they struggle through drought and the new challenge of an increase in the dinosaur population. \"A Time of titans\"; It's now only 152 million years ago and we move into the late Jurassic period. Dinosaurs dominate the globe and the most widespread group of these were the sauropds- giant, long necked herbivores weighing between 20 and 70 tonnes. This program spans 12 years to follow the hatching of a tiny Diplodocus and through her struggle for survival until she reaches maturity and mates for the first time, thus completing the circle of life. Also available on DVD [318965]."
