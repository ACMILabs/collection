        "This documentary shows how socialist economic planning has helped to increase Cuba's agricultural production. Focusing on underdevelopment and its possible solutions, it examines the mobilization of agricultural workers in Cuba's Oriente province in April 1969. This was a trial run for the kind of mobilizations that were being planned for other parts of the country in the battle of increase agricultural production, and particularly the production of sugarcane."
