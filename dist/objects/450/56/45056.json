        "Irania (vol. 2) covers the ancient Persian history, from the 3rd millenium B.C to the 7th century A.D. From the eruption of the industrious Elamite empire until the final eclipse of the Sasanids, each era is richly illustrated with an historical essay, a photo gallery and video clips. The CD-Rom is divided into four distinct periods: Elamite, Medean, Achaemenian, Seleucid and Sasanid empires, and contains in addition to these an art exhibit titled, 'Ancient treasures', with artworks and handicraft dating back as far as the 5th millenium B.C. to 7th century A.D. Well-known highlights include; Pasargardae (tomb of Cyrus the Great), ancient Ecbatane, Takht-e Jamshid (Persepolis), and the Sasanid tombs of Naqsh-e Rustam with their Zoroastrian iconography. To navigate, direct the pointer to the icons on the right-hand side of the screen. Each screen is divided in 4 sections: Photo or video, transcript of commentary, related topics and history. Each section is fully searchable and can be printed. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Multimedia PC or compatible with 486 or higher processor, CD-Rom drive, audio board, speakers and SVGA resolution monitor with 256 colors or higher, 8 MB of RAM, at least 10 MB hard drive space, Windows 95 or later.
