        "This tape comprises of episodes one to five - the first half of the magnificent series set during World War II. It is dawn on a cold winter's morning in 1943. Charles Ryder, painter turned army captain, in the twilight of World War II has marched most of the night and camped with his platoon at their secret destination. On waking, he is amazed to find he is at the rear of Brideshead Castle where he spent many years of enchantment and grief in his youth, and which, years ago he had left vowing never to return. Now here he was again, cold and with memories flooding over him like storm-surf on the shore. He was back. Brideshead revisited had begun. Cast includes Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews, Diana Quick, Laurence Olivier, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud. Adapted from the novel by Evelyn Waugh."
