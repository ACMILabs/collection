        "Presented as an enthusiastic, squeaky clean propaganda/soap opera style film, this highly satirical work from director Paul Verhoeven is an effective political comment on militaristic and colonialistic driven societies. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) and his unquestioningly patriotic friends; recent graduates of the Buenos Aires High School, join the Federation forces in a mission to the home planet of an alien bug race that threatens life on earth. What follows is an amazing epic science fiction adventure complete with love triangle, mock news flashes, schlock battle sequences and seamless special effects as the all too mannequin-like characters attempt to overcome their vicious bug enemies. Cast includes Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Muldoon and Michael Ironside. Based on the book by Robert A. Heinlein."
