Hosted by George Lewin, inventor of the Triton Workcentre, the video provides dozens of labour saving tips, and makes effective use of computer generated graphics to clarify techniques and principles. Tape one covers site preparation, laying foundations, bricklaying, wall and roof framing. Tape two covers wall and roof cladding, windows and doors, as well as fitout."
