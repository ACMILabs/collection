        "Richard Bach's best selling novel about spiritual development and human achievement is brought to life in this rendition, complete with a Neil Diamond soundtrack. The story begins with a flock of seagulls pecking at garbage left by a boat. One of these seagulls - Jonathan (voice supplied by James Franciscus), longs to soar above his current existence, reaching dizzying heights and be the fastest seagull. Thus he leaves the flock to see the world and in search of speed. On reaching aviary heaven he meets Maureen Seagull (voice supplied by Juliet Mills) who introduces Jonathan to new experiences. Jonathan returns to his flock with new found knowledge but the other seagulls are sceptical until he performs a miracle and Jonathan is elevated to a messianic hero. Voices also supplied by Philip Ahn, Richard Crenna, Kelly Harmon and Hal Holbrook."
