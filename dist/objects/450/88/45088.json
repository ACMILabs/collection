        "This story brings romance and courtship (as well as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks and director Nora Ephron for the third time) into the age of the World Wide Web via email and chat rooms. Joe and Kathleen have a lot in common, they live near each other, they are both in the publishing industry, he in supersized book department stores - Foxbooks, and she in a small independent one - Shop Around the Corner, they even buy coffee at the same place. They have not met in person as yet, but they have met one another in a chat room where they bare their thoughts about life, work and their significant others who are less than perfect. Pretty soon NY152 and Shop Girl want to meet in person, which leads to inevitable angst when two soul mates discover they are business rivals. Cast also includes Parker Posey and Greg Kinnear."
