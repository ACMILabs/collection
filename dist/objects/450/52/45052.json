        "An award-winning documentary that explores the historical roots of the Cold War and its effects on American life. Featuring historical footage from European and American archives and revealing interviews with key players from both sides, the film traces the Cold War from the end of World War II to the period of Reagan's Star Wars proposal. It was a war created from ideas, fears and actions of specific people, with real casualties in compromised ideals, economic opportunities and peoples lives. Includes an extensive sampling of Cold War images from Hollywood feature films, TV shows and animated cartoons. Suitable for upper-secondary and tertiary level education."
