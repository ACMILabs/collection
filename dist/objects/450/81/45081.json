        "The year is 2033 and water is a precious commodity. In the desolate wind swept plains, animals are banned, bathing is unheard of, and the Water & Power Company, headed by the villainous Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell), have ultimate control over the precious H20. One rebel girl stands in their way, Rebecca (Lori Petty), a chick with attitude and an outrageous hairstyle. She is captured by Water & Power when they kill her boyfriend, kidnap her young friend, and try to blackmail her into joining their team. As a prisoner Rebecca discovers a new passion- tanks, and makes a friend with mechanic and pilot, Jet Girl (Naomi Watts), who helps her escape. Once free the girls join forces with The Rippers, an army of half men and half kangaroos, genetically modified to be the ultimate fighting machines. Together they take Water & Power head on, lead by Jet Girl in the sky, and tank girl on the ground with her beloved tank in a flurry of live action and comic strip visuals. Cast also includes Ice-T, Don Harvey and Jeff Kober."
