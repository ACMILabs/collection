        "A funny tall tale puppetry animation based on real life eccentric inventor William Wallace Gibson of Balgonie, Canada. Starting in 1904 he designed, built and, in 1910, flew the first Canadian free flight airplane 200 feet, breaking the Wright Brothers record by 30 feet. A year later he succeeded in flying his airplane over a mile. His money ran out, and unable to get financial backing he abandoned his dream to perfect his airplane. Today, his engine is on display at the National Aeronautical Museum in Ottawa. This tale focuses on the achievement of his first flight."
