        "Francie Lawrence, better known as Gidget, is off on a Hawaiian holiday with her parents after being disappointed in love by her surfing boyfriend, Moondoggie. Gidget manages to conquer the boys on Waikiki with her good looks, dancing ability and naturally, her surfing prowess, but complications ensue when Moondoggie arrives unannounced. Gidget finds herself caught in a love triangle involving Moondoggie and newcomer dancing stud, Eddie Horner. Things get even worse when jealous rival, Abbey, starts a vicious rumour about Gidget having had \"an unfortunate experience\", which causes an even bigger stir with her parents. Cast includes Deborah Walley, James Darren and Michael Callan."
