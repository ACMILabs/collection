        "Based on the novel by Ira Levin, the chilling and controversial story of \"The Stepford wives\" has become a cult classic with its cutting social commentary and chauvinistic/misogynistic themes. It is a tale of perfection, where perfect housewives dutifully serve their husbands and family in domestic bliss in their perfect homes in the sanitised but perfect suburb of Stepford. But something is horribly wrong. Why do all the Stepford men belong to the mysterious Stepford Men's Club and why do all the women appear to look and behave in the same manner - vacant and robotic? Is there a strange conspiracy going on in the village of Stepford? This very 70s film features Katharine Ross, Paula Prentiss, Peter Masterson, Nanette Newman and Patick O'Neal with screenplay by William Goldman."
