        "Following a tragic accident, three people's lives are connected in a way that is emotionally intense and devastating. Christine (Naomi Watts) is a wife and mother of two girls. Paul (Sean Penn) is a mathematician with a congenital heart problem and a troubled relationship. Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-con, born-again Christian and father of two children. This revenge-style drama could be told in a straight forward way but the writer Guillermo Arriaga and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu have chosen a non-linear approach with the story told by glimpses forward and back until becoming clear to the viewer just how these people's lives do connect. The three leads are convincing in their performances with Watts and Del Toro being nominated for Academy Awards and Sean Penn for a BAFTA."
