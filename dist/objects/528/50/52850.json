        "A collection of advertising films made by French lithographer and animator, Alexander Alexeieff, some using his own 'pinboard' device, and others more conventional methods of animation. The reel includes: Fumees - which took a year to make on the pinboard and lasts barely a minute, with the smoke made from hundreds of fine oscillating lines superimposed densely on each frame, and Le seve de la terre - with delicately animated glass beads to represent drops of oil."
