        "Absolute Power is a political thriller about a retiring thief who witnesses a murder - by the President of the United States. Fearing that he will be blamed, the thief plans to flee the country - after making amends with his estranged daughter - but decides instead to stay and fight the hypocrisy. Masterfully directed (and starring) Clint Eastwood, this paranoid conspiracy crime story bristles with suspense and features an all impressive cast that includes Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Scott Glenn, Dennis Haysbert, E.G. Marshall and Judy Davis."
