        "It's the night before Christmas and the Muppet Theatre is under threat of being demolished. Stars the usual Muppet gang of Miss Piggy, Kermit and others, who all rally and with some divine intervention and funny send-ups of holiday movie cliches, to reveal the film's message is love will save the day (as well as a good song and dance number!). Humans that also feature are David Arquette, Joan Cusack and Whoopi Goldberg. Directed by Kirk R Thatcher and produced by Martin G Baker and Warren Carr."
