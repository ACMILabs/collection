        "Hilariously black romantic comedy about a hit man who returns to his home town and attends his high school reunion. Encountering a former flame, who he unceremoniously jilted several years earlier, Martin is caught between his dark past (that has followed him home) and his desire for something new with Debbie. Top cast includes John and Joan Cusack, Alarn Arkin, Minnie Driver and Dan Ackroyd."
