        "Academy Award winning biographical feature about Mexican artist Frida Khalo, played by Salma Hayek. The story unfolds in splendid colour from Frida's early years and follows through to the moment of her death. We witness her struggles in life against traditional society's perceptions of women, her own physical disabilities and most importantly, her struggle to become a recognised artist/painter in her own right. Cast includs Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera, Antonio Banderas, Valeria Golino, Ashley Judd, Mia Maestro, Edward Norton and Geoffrey Rush. Second disc contains many special features."
