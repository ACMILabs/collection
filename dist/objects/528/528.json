        "Rosenblatt presents an uneasy childhood experience of Jesus as a point of departure for exploring the nexus of fear, fascination and transcendence. A young Jewish boy who grows up fearing Jesus is confronted with the evidence of Christ's Jewishness. By initially utilising highly saturated colour super-8 home movie and kitsch images from Hollywood Bible epics, King of the Jews, begins as a sardonic commentary on Christian parochialism but ends as a terrifying document of anti-Semitic violence."
