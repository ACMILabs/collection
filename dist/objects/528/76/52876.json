        "Based on the best-selling novel by Tom Clancy with screenplay by Paul Attanasia and Daniel Pyne, this political thriller revives the tensions and paranoia of the Cold War era between the Americans and the Russians when the CIA suspect that Russia is once again involved in the development of nuclear weapons. Suspense and intrigue follow as a terrorist plot brings the two super-powers to the brink of nuclear war. Starring Ben Affleck as the rather young CIA agent Jack Ryan and Morgan Freeman as CIA Director William Cabot with James Cromwell, Liev Schreiber, Bridget Moynahan, Alan Bates."
