        "The first feature of Peter Bogdanovich combines two seemingly unrelated plots. Plot one follows the depressed retiring horror film actor (Boris Karloff) and his despairing of the real horror of 60's America. Meanwhile a lone sniper picks off strangers after coldly killing his parents and a delivery boy. The disquieting plots meet after tenion builds at a drive-in cinema. A tense and disturbing film. Cast also include Tim O'Kelly, Nancy Hsueh and James Brown."
