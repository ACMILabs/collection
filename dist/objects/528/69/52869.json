        "Based on a novel by Kurt Vonnegut \"Mother Night\" follows the story of an American playwright (Nick Nolte) living in Germany during WWII. He is approached by a US agent to become a spy. By broadcasting coded Nazi propaganda on the radio he is able to pass on allied information. During this time he seems to be a convincing Nazi. With only a few knowing his true beliefs he finds himself helpless in Israel on trial for war crimes. A moody story of assumed identity and a man alone in a strange world. Cast includes Alan Arkin, Kristen Dunst, John Goodman and an appearance of Kurt Vonnegut Jr."
