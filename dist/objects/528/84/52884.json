        "A scathing take on 1930s Hollywood motion picture industry, this film was only a moderate success at the time of release, despite garnering two Academy Award nominations. Adapted from Nathanael West's novel the film principally charts the ambitions of Faye Greener (Karen Black), a talent-less starlet dreaming of fame, well beyond her grasp. In Faye's orbit are Tod Hackett, a budding production designer and Homer Simpson, a wealthy suitor. Both men are driven mad by Faye's excessive flirtations, yet stubborn unavailability. The narrative builds to a shocking climax. Music composed and conducted by John Barry."
