        "A fascinating look into the world of Australian photographer Richard Szymczuk and his passion for the urban/industrial landscape of Geelong and its surrounding environs. Since 1987 Richard has been on a mission photographing old rundown servos, milkbars, general stores, billboards, factories, recording history before it literally disappears or is replaced. His photographs have become an art form of social expression and reflect today's society of economic rationalism. In the film Richard talks about his background, his work and his philosophy on life reflecting on the ever-changing landscape as evidenced by the many examples of his photographic works and his revisits to some of the original locales that feature throughout the documentary. Photographed by Simon Anderson with Simon Kirby and music by Steven Baker."
