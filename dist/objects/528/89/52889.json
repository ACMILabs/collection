        "Written and directed by Cedric Klapisch, \"The Spanish Apartment\", a French/Spanish co-production, investigates the issue of whether or not a job makes us who we really are. In the quest to find a steady job, Xavier (Romain Duris) heads off to Spain for a year of post-graduate study leaving his girlfriend (Audrey Tautou) and mother behind in France. He meets a French married couple with whom he develops a friendship, particularly with the wife. Moving into a share-apartment with other students he acquires a broader knowledge of women and life from his friends and their lives there. Not only learning more on Spanish politics and economy he develops his knowledge of the Spanish language. Does he find himself though? Cast includes Judith Godreche, Cecile De France, Kelly Reilly, Christina Brondo, Federico D'Anna, Barnaby Metschurat, Christian Pagh, Kevin Bishop, Xavier De Guillebon."
