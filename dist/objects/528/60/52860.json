        "Visually charged action-packed sequel to the 1996 original, \"Mission Impossible 2\", directed by John Woo, has all the kinetic thrills expected from a master of the genre, but a simplified script leaves it strangely lacking in tension. Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt, the daredevil spy, who falls for a former flame of a spy turned bad. Hunt must rescue his new love, and save the world from a deadly virus. Supporting cast includes Thandie Newton (as the love interest) and Dougray Scott (as the villain)."
