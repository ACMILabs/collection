        "Two filmmaking brothers set out to make an documentary about the New York Fire Department following a trainee's development to working at a fire station. The fire station they cover turns out to be one of the closest to the World Trade Centre and what evolves is the most gripping and terrifying footage of the terrorist attack on 9th September 2001. How this event affects the firemen, filmmakers and people of New York, is shown by a mixture of actual footage and interviews. Directed by Jules and Gedeon Naudet and James Hanlon. WARNING: SOME SCENES MAY DISTURB."
