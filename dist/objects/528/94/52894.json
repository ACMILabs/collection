        "Vincent, (Aurelien Recoing) who has been gainfully employed in a middle-management role for eleven years, suddenly finds himself fired. Not able to tell his wife or family he drifts and thinks up ways to get money to maintain the facade that he is heading off to work at an exciting new job in Switzerland. The emotion and tension builds slowly over the time he maintains this charade, with the film's dramatically restrained direction and performances getting across the internal struggle he faces daily and the growing suspicions of his family. \"Time Out\" is not just a personal, internal drama but also a commentary on the role of work in contemporary society and its effect on middle-class family life. Written and directed by Laurent Cantet, \"Time Out\" is also winner of best film awards in Venice and Montreal. Cast includes Karin Viard, Serge Livrozet."
