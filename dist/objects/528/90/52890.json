        "Walt Disney animated feature based on the novel \"Treasure Island\" by Robert Louis Stevenson. A dazzling mix with the feel of an old costumed pirate drama combined with space travel adventure. A small boy reads an animated adventure book about pirates on a quest for treasure, all set in space. The sea is replaced by space and the bad pirate is a cyborg, but the story of the personal growth of the young male protagonist is timeless."
