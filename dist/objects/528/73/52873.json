        "Taking place on the last day of school in 1974 this coming-of-age comedy drama is a interesting look at 70's youth culture. From nerds to footballers this story follows students seeking fun involving the usual booze, drugs and parties within a random storyline. Not just the usual teen flick \"Dazed and Confused\" is seen as a realist portrayal of the teenage years where a party is the main destination. Cast includes Milla Jovovich, Jason London, Joey Lauren Adams, Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey and Parker Posey."
