        "The is a film about a house which, due to a bureaucratic blunder, is sold in error. Conflict arrises between the now two owners. The original owner played by Jennifer Connelly, a recovering addict, does not want to give the house up. The new owner (Ben Kinsley) having recently fled from Iran with his family feels the same way. The film stands out for its fine acting both powerful and emotional. Themes such as the importance of a home and a persons place are told. Each owner has a compelling story and it seems are equally worthy in this moving conflict. This suspensful fine drama was nominated for three Academy Awards."
