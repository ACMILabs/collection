        "Presented as a documentary \"The Blair Witch Project\" tells of a group of students lost in the woods in search of the world of witchcraft. The story is told using the found documentary footage of the group recovered from the forest. Successfully creepy this low budget feature with jerky camerawork is understatedly disturbing."
