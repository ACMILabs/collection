        "Episode of Series \"International zone\" In every continent there are milestones which mark humanity's progress from pre-history to the age of the atom. From the temples in Cambodia to the Cathedral in Chartres, these creations stand as a common treasure. Today the temples of Nubia are threatened with inundation by the waters soon to rise at the Aswan Dam; Unesco has called for a worldwide effort to save them."
