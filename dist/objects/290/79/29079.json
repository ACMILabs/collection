        "As part of the Colombo Plan thirty-five students from Cambodia and Laos were invited by the United Kingdom Government to attend a summer-school in Singapore for a six-week course in the English language. The school was held in the University of Malaya and the students came from varied walks of life - government officials, teachers and high-school students. Emphasis was laid on conversational English, its rhythm, pronunciation and vocabulary."
