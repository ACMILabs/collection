        "A lighthearted satire about the computers and gadgets of big business. When a small Chinese-American girl wanders into a modern office building on a Sunday her innocent delight in pressing buttons and using the gadgets creates such chaos that the guard calls for police reinforcements. As they arrive the little girl slips out of the building unnoticed."
