        "An informal study of the great but extremely human dean of modern composers, a man past eighty, (at the time of making this film) full of the joy of life and, though proudly American, still very much an Old World figure with a long and alert memory for people and events in music, literature and art. The main focus of the film is Igor Stravinsky conducting the CBC Symphony Orchestra in a recording of his Symphony of Psalms."
