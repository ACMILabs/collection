        "How a small Canadian city, bearing the name of Stratford and by a river Avon, realized the vision of one of its sons: the creation of a theatre for the staging of the finest Shakespearean drama. The film tells how the idea grew, how a famous British director, Tyrone Guthrie, internationally known stars, Alec Guiness and Irene Worth, and Canadian talent were recruited, and how the Stratford Shakespearean Festival finally became a triumphant reality. (Awards: eight, including Edinburgh; Johannesburg; Oscar nomination, Hollywood)"
