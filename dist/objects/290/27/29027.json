        "Episode of Series \"Listening to Music\" Examines the construction, and basic techniques for playing, of the violin, viola and violoncello (cello). All three instruments are similar in construction. Shots of the violin show the body, bridge, nut and peg box; the purpose of each is explained. The violin, smallest of the three, has the shortest strings and the highest pitch; the cello with the longest strings has the deepest voice. Shows how the players make other notes besides those given by each open string. In conclusion, the trio plays Minuet from \"Divertimento in E Flat\" by Mozart."
