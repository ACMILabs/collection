        "In 1956 it had all begun, the sound barrier had been broken and a handful of men were thinking of making a passenger airline to break the sound barrier - to halve the world. In 1959, real work was begun on the idea. The French and the British consolidated to save time and money. In 1962 a model of the aircraft was shown at Farnsborough Air Show, and it was named \"Concorde\". America became interested, and not wanting to be left behind, began designing their own sound breaking passenger aircraft. The race was on - neither of the parties wanting to make any mistakes, both very meticulous in their research. This documentary is mostly made up of interviews with the chief personnel (French, English and American) involved in designing, testing and investigating the construction of a supersonic aircraft. Commentary by Michael Flanders."
