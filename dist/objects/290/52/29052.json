        "Through separate film portraits, depicts the different life styles of three young people, showing the joys, disappointments, decisions and consequences that shape them. Explains that each person has a different choice because of a different inner self. Steve, a school athlete has turned on to drugs; George, a grandson of an immigrant reflects on the satisfaction gained from a simple life; and Laura, a creative person, reveals herself as detached from the crowd."
