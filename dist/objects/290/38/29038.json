    "description": [
        "In an effort to salvage some land for recreational and park use in 1971, the residents of North Carlton, an inner suburb of Melbourne, came into opposition with the building contractor representing Kimberley-Clark Australia Pty Ltd. The company had proposed plans for building a warehouse for Kleenex products on the site. Unions joined forces with the residents against the building contractor, and the film shows some of those involved voicing their opinions and how events developed during the conflict. The confrontation leads to speeches, shouting, strong language, demonstrations and some violence and the increasing involvement of progressive Trade Unions in matters other than the bread-and-butter struggle. Suitable for secondary school level."
