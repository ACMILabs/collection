        "This simple film consists of a helicopter shot showing the results of strip mining with voice-overs from local mining people for and against this system of mining explaining the economical advantages versus the aesthetic and ecological disasters of it. An old man comments on all the changes that have taken place in his lifetime and mourns that strip mining is likely to be the worst."
