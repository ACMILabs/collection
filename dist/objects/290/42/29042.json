        "A picture of nurses-in-training at a large city hospital in Montreal. The starched blue uniforms of the probationers barely conceal the nervousness with which they approach their new vocation, but apparent above all is the earnest desire to learn and to do what the profession demands. The film also shows some of the courses the nurses take before they are qualified to receive their caps."
