        "The warmly human narrative of what two weeks at a Muskoka summer camp meant to a small boy from a congested city area. School was out. Roger had passed. Next year he'd be using ink, but in the meantime there wasn't much to do around town. Then, one wonderful day, Roger went off to camp. It was all fun, the preliminary scramble for the upper bunk in the cabin, exploring in the woods, cooking food over a fire, and - biggest day of all - passing the beginner's swimming test. The two weeks went by so quickly, but it was the best time Roger had ever had, and one he would never forget. (Award: Toronto.)"
