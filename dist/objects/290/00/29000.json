        "The story of Bill Barker, the owner of a small plant, who sees his production falling off and the quality of the work going down. Believing the situation calls for rigid discipline, he sacrifices personal warmth and understanding in his relations with his men. This attitude only aggravates matters until finally, in a dream sequence, Benjamin Franklin makes him see that his human relations can stand a lot of improvement."
