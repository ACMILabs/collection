        "This award-winning animated film spares no feelings, minces no words. A poignant interpretation of a short story from Montreal author Mordecai Richler's 'The Street', it makes what is sometimes an embarrassingly frank statement about how many families respond to their old and infirm members. In soft simple washes of watercolour and ink, the filmmaker interprets reactions to a dying grandmother, capturing family feelings and distilling them into harsh reality. Awards: Twenty-two including Oscar nomination, Hollywood; Toronto; Los Angeles; Melbourne. Suitable for secondary school level."
