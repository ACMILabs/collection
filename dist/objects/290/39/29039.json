        "The story of the development of the oil resources of the Canadian prairies and how their discovery is affecting the economy of the West. A gusher gone wild, oil crews working feverishly around the clock, oil barons conferring in plush board rooms, the Alberta pipeline, Edmonton's neon nightlife - these are the glimpses the film shows of how oil is taking its place with agriculture, bringing a new industrial prosperity. Despite the inexhaustible appearance of Alberta's oil wells, scientists are looking farther north, to the far sands of Athabaska where still greater deposits wait to be released."
