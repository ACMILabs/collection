        "This film about food and the food dollar examines its value for farmer, consumer and vendor. What control has the farmer over the price he gets? What control has the consumer over the price he pays? What does the supermarket give and what does it take? To answer these questions, some knowledgeable people are presented: heads of food-store chains, economists, farmers, housewives and small storekeepers."
