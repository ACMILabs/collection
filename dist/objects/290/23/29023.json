        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Children's Concert\" At one of his concerts for Ottawa children, conductor Eugene Kash illustrates points on musical form and introduces the string instruments. When the violin, viola and cello have been presented separately, they join in a fugue, and later Mr. Kash plays a gavotte on his violin. Closing scenes are of a dance by a group of little girls, set to music composed by some of the children themselves."
