        "The threat of a strike nobody wants, but which everyone seems powerless to avert, lends suspense to this story of events leading to a deadlock in negotiations between the management and employees of a furniture factory. Staged against the background of a small one-industry town, this dramatisation shows the normal processes of collective bargaining common to Canadian industry today and how they affect a union, a company and a community. (Award: Chicago.)"
