        "A simple animated film of Anne Graham's line drawings of a sunny day at the beach. Illustrates the variety of occupations people follow on the beach, and implies that a summer day by the sea is one of the best ways of enjoying life. Dis-orienting use of sound lends further interest to this unconventional sociological survey."
