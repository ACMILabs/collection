        "Diagrams of the human body and the brain depict the causes of disease of the nerves which cause strokes. Explains how strokes may affect speech and memory and result in paralysis of the body or temporary weakness of the muscles. Rehabilitation training and natural replacement in damaged brain cell areas provide reassurance of possible recovery from strokes."
