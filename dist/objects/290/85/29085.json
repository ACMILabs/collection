        "Man has responded to the sun in various times and in different cultures. Included in this brief history is a sampling of works of art related to the sun. Examples include suns chiselled in stone, carved in wood, drawn in ink, and painted on canvas. Sun symbols by contemporary artist-designers are also shown. After briefly examining the method of organizing a radial pattern by combining several materials, the three important elements necessary in designing a sun symbol are described. Sequences are shown of fourth grade students creating their own imaginative and personal sun symbols - thus the concept of an object in nature as a source of inspiration to the artist is made concrete."
