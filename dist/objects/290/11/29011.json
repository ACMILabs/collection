        "The film includes a general history of the erection of \"The Wall\" separating East and West Berlin and focuses on Bernauer Strasse where the street, although part of West Berlin, contains houses down one side which belong to the Soviet sector. This street has seen many tragedies since August 13, 1961, when the wall was erected."
