        "In 1952, over 4 million cubic feet of high-pressure gas was discovered in a great natural reservoir under the Baluchistan Desert at Sui, Pakistan. This film tells the story of the major development work that followed the discovery and deals with the laying of pipe-lines from the Sui gas field to Karachi, 348 miles away."
