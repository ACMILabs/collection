        "Episode of Series \"Structure Bonding and the Periodic Law\". Professor Haynes of Open University explains the procedures involved in the National Physical Laboratory's equipment to determine enthalpy changes. The process is compared to home/school laboratory calorimeters and used to discuss the theory of and problems associated with measuring energy changes in chemical reactions."
