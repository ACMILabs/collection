        "An experimental film utilizing children's drawings cut against a background of child-like sounds. We see signs on walls: \"Help!\", \"I am Mad!\" and \"I love You\", mixed with drawings of people, faces, the moon and the sun, fish, crabs and a sinking yacht. Music by Costas, tiles by Gus and camera by Fotis."
