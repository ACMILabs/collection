    "description": [
        "Nigel Dick discusses how he moved from veterinary science to an advertising cadetship with the \"Daily Telegraph\", finally moving into television in 1956 to Channel 9. Dick talks about the early days of television in Australia; the influence of Arthur Warner, the Royal Commission into television in the 1950's and it's ensuing recommendations, the creation of \"In Melbourne Tonight\" based on the strength of Graeme Kennedy's personality, and the response from other stations in creating a similar show for Bert Newton, or putting movies against \"IMT\" in the ratings. He also discusses the relationship between print media and television, the origins of the channel 7 logo, and the future of television, including cable channels and digitisation."
