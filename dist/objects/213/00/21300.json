        "A wry examination of the nature of television commercials, our most potent advertising medium, as seen by the ad men and producers who make them. During the production of laxative and cosmetic commercials ad men voice strong opinions both justifying and condemning what they do. They are sometimes defensive, sometimes more cynical than any consumer."
