        "Through the experiences of a patient, the basic research projects being conducted at the McArdle Memorial Laboratory are depicted. The growth of normal tissue, the similarity between the growth stimulated by estrogen and the growth of cancerous tissue are shown, as is also the change from normal to cancerous as studied through azo dye effects. The effect of nutrition on cancer and the conversion of food into energy and cell structure in normal and cancer tissue is contrasted."
