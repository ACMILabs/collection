        "Episode of Series \"The Commonwealth of Nations\". To examine this question, the film brings into focus recent historic events as recorded by the motion picture camera. We see the Commonwealth members in the arena of world affairs frequently taking diverging views on international issues but able, through their very differences, to serve as channels of communication between countries outside the Commonwealth. Edgar McInnis analyses some paradoxical situations that have arisen during the course of the Cold War, in which differing views and opposing loyalties inside the Commonwealth have helped to offset an East-West split. Narrated by Edgar McInnis."
