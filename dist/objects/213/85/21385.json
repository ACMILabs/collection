        "An account of the growth of the London County Council and a survey of its present day (1950's) operations. The first part of the film deals with the rapid expansion of the city during the 19th century, pointing out this situation eventually necessitated the amalgamation of many local authorities into one body. Contrasts present day handling of London County Council services with that of the 19th century. Scenes at an LCC election emphasize that ballot is secret and that is is possible for any Londoner to become a Councillor."
