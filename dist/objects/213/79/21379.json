        "The work of Lancelot Brown (1716-1793), the founder of the English style of landscape gardening, whose pioneering was, to a great extent, responsible for the very shape of the English countryside. Contrasts this with the formal French garden style, and looks at the great houses whose gardens were worked on by Brown - Longleat, Chatsworth House and Blenheim."
