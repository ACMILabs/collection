        "Designed to encourage two essentials to an efficient office-- tidiness and cleanliness. An office which in the first place is badly designed, and then is littered with superfluous or redundant furniture, articles of clothing, over-flowing waste-paper baskets, stacks of files piled high on desks and tea cups and tea-making equipment, cannot possibly function efficiently, quite apart from being unpleasant to work in. The film offers suggestions aimed at keeping offices clean and tidy, thereby increasing efficiency and saving time, trouble and temper."
