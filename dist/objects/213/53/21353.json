        "Episode of Series \"Canada carries on\". Canada, rich in uranium, is harnessing atomic science to peacetime living. This film provides a progress report on nuclear research conducted at the atomic energy plant at Chalk River, Ontario, and shows some of the constructive applications of atomic energy carried out in hospitals (including Canada's celebrated \"cobalt bomb\", one of the newest developments in cancer treatment), in agricultural experimental stations and in industry. Interior views of the Chalk River plant afford a look at NRX, the atomic pile itself. A brief survey is made of atomic research in Canadian universities."
