        "Deals with seeing-eye dogs, describing their use as guides for the blind, and how they are trained and selected. Points out that German Shepherd dogs usually make the best guide. Before training commences the dogs are checked for medical fitness and suitability and introduced to a normal domestic environment. They must undergo exacting tests with blindfolded instructors in city traffic; finally both dog and owner are taught to work together at the training centre."
