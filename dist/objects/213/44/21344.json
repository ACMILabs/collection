        "This film is a discussion by Geoffrey Crowther, editor of \"The Economist\", on how post-war British people can raise their standard of living. He states that as a nation we can only consume as much as we can produce, and the basic problem is, therefore, that of increasing production. Using the diagram of a cake to represent the national income, he shows how it is divided, how it might be divided, and how he thinks it could be increased in size. In the course of the discussion, he deals with the relationship of imports to exports; the need for thorough mechanization of industry, including the use of electricity so as to increase production per man hour; full employment, and the necessity of minimum restrictions on the side of both capital and labour."
