        "The Country Roads Board's Project no. 14 involves the building of a road from Orbost to Marlo. Shows the first section to Cape Conron and difficulties encountered in clearing and leveling the sandy loam. The area opened by the road has great development potential in its attractive surf beaches, bushland and off-shore oil drilling. Photography by Jim Stirling."
