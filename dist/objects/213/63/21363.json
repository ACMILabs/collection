        "This is the story of what happens to the great wheat crops of western Canada after the harvest. The route is traced from the farm to the town elevator, by box car to the huge concrete storage cylinders at terminal points on the Great Lakes, down the Lakes to the homes and bakeries of eastern Canada, and to the ocean ports for shipment abroad."
