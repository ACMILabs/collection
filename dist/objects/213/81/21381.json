        "This early venture into docu-drama remains one of the government unit's most successful, made with wit and skilful use of editing and music. The unlikely subject of scientific farm management is dramatised (using post-synchronised dialogue characteristic of the time) through the story of young Smith. Against the wishes of his father, but with his mother's support, young Smith is permitted to study at the Hawkesbury Agricultural College. Returning home, he demonstrates to a sceptical father some of the benefits of modern methods of farming. Photographed by Frank Bagnall."
