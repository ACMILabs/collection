        "WARNING: THIS FILM CONTAINS SOME VISUALLY DISTURBING IMAGES Buzkashi is the once forbidden sport performed on horseback by the tribes of Afghanistan. Buzkashi requires incredible riding ability, as the opposing teams battle for a head-less calf. the intense pride and rivalry of a tribal society, as well as the role of physical superiority and competition are implicit. No commentary - natural sound track only."
