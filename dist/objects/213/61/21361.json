        "An informal portrait of the people of Canada at a time when modern technology is reaching into every phase of national life. Beginning with the fishermen of Newfoundland and ending with the Kitimat project on the west coast, the film explores the demands of a new machine age on people of diverse origins in whom the feeling for tradition is strong. In all there is evidence of change, adjustment, adaption as the industrial expansion becomes increasingly accelerated. Award: Toronto"
