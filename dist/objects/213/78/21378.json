        "The origins of Canungra go back to 1942 when army headquarters ordered the formation of a jungle warfare training centre. Today the roles of the Land Warfare Centre have expanded to include the training of personnel of all Corps in Tactics and Administration, for land warfare and the development of associated doctrine, and equipment and operational techniques.
