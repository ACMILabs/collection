        "A view of Canada from a helicopter, showing the nature and extent of the various landform regions. We see the immense spread of forest, rock and lakeland that makes up the Canadian Shield, the plains and lowlands where the industry of man is more evident, and finally, the coastal mountain ranges of the west, north and east. The influence of the geological character of the land on what people do and where they live is illustrated in closer views of industry, urban and rural, across the country. Photography: Eugene Boyko. Award: Sydney"
