        "Front-seat view of the annual Dominion Drama Festival in Vancouver's new Queen Elizabeth Theater. Biggest affair of its kind in the world, the Dominion Drama Festival each year brings together the best of Canadian amateur theatrical talent. \"Canada on Stage\" shows you scenes from prize-winning performances during the week-long festival as Vancouver plays host to groups from all parts of Canada. Caught by the camera is the taut atmosphere after the final curtain as awards are announced by festival adjudicator Phillip Hope Wallace, British drama critic."
