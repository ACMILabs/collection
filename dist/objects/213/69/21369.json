        "Are there truly present, on the cancer cell, antigens different from those in the normal cell, i.e.cancer- specific antigens? If present, how can they be demonstrated? Moreover, through what immunologic mechanisms, and by what factors released from the host, are cancer cells destroyed? This film attempts to answer some of these questions."
