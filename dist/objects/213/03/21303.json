        "A bitter, pessimistic cartoon, showing man's utter helplessness in the face of forces stronger than himself. A man's home is invaded by the letter \"A\". Guile, flattery, magic, brute strength fail to remove this enemy. He gives up all hope - then discovers that \"A\" has disappeared. After a period of doubt he is delighted to be alone again. Suddenly \"B\" appears! In fine line pen-and-ink style reminiscent of 19th century engraving, Jan Lenica has created a visual joke based on one of Eugene Ionesco's quotations. The letters also symbolise privacy, oppression or one's own problems. (Awards: Grand Prize for Film Animation, Oberhausen Festival)"
