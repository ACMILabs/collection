        "A study of the characteristic style of A.Y. Jackson, one of Canada's foremost modern painters. Jackson learned to select the more characteristic forms in his subject and underline their dominant tones and shapes. He first made small sketches on wooden panels which formed a basis for the larger compositions on canvas which were executed later in the studio. The film accurately describes the scenes of rural Quebec in winter and spring, and of northern Ontario in summer and autumn."
