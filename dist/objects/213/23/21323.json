        "This film shows people from all around the world visiting the 'city of miracles' in the foothills of the Pyrenees. Amongst them are 40,000 of the old, the ill and the crippled who seek relief, if not a cure. The film shows the many pilgrims and tourists, the ceremonies, prayers, the grotto, the mineral springs with special properties and the great churches. Lourdes is the 'city shrine' to Saint Bernadette."
