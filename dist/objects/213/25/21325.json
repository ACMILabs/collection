        "This film is designed to impress upon all motorcyclists the constant need for care on the roads. It shows that even riders in motorcycle trials, whose performances delight and amaze their fans, do not take chances when they are on the roads, and are in fact more careful than some of the less experienced motorcyclists. Points mentioned include: hand signals, normal care and technique of safe riding; checking petrol, oil, equipment, tyres, wheel ruts, rear brake and steering; braking on a slippery surface; safe riding at night."
