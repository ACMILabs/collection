        "Episode of Series \"Canada carries on\". The film relates dancing, both as relaxation and expression, to the traditional and economic environment of the Canadian people. The influence of social conditions on dance forms is demonstrated in a survey which ranges from Indian religious dances, the national and folk dances of pioneers and settlers, the social square dances of rural communities, to the mechanistic individualism of modern jive. Narrated by David Catton."
