        "This film depicts mythological aspects of Aboriginal life in the western McDonald Range area of Central Australia with specific reference to three tribal groups. It deals with 'water dreaming' as well as various myths and legends related to the present situation of the Aboriginals. The film incorporates approximately 44 paintings by Central Aborigines using an ancient technique known as sand painting. A study of the meanings of the symbols and signs used in Australian aboriginal paintings. Legends of the Aboriginal's Dreamtime are passed down to the younger member by their elders in ritual ceremonies. Narrated by John Bell, edited by Phil Noyce."
