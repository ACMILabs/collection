        "The story of how an imaginary Canadian community might coordinate its resources, with federal and provincial government aid, to provide full rehabilitation services for its disabled citizens. The film follows a local doctor's dream of community organization in which existing agencies are brought together into a cooperative plan whereby persons disabled by accident or disease may be restored to useful, productive places in their community."
