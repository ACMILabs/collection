        "In Britain, the Citizens' Advice Bureaux give free and expert counsel on problems as different as an eviction threat, the making of a will, a broken marriage and a scooter accident. Shot in Stevenage New Town, the film also illustrates the pattern of life in this new community, one of several designed to ease the population pressure on London."
