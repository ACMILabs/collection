        "Surrounded by the ocean, dotted with inland lakes and rivers, water plays a major role in the four provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, whose inhabitants are mainly of French and British origin. Many of the people continue to lead isolated lives adequately supporting themselves by farming, fishing and lumbering."
