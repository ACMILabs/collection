        "Explains how many animals bear protective colour patterns which blend with their variegated surroundings, thus providing a measure of protection. The film illustrates how those animals most needing protection, because of age, sex, or lack of ability to defend themselves, generally have subdued colouring. In contrast other animals, of a more offensive nature, have bold markings and dazzling effects."
