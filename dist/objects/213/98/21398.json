        "The three-hundred Airstream caravans that are prowling the highways of British Columbia represent a new breed of nomad. Too active just to sit at home but too cautious to strike out on their own, these retired couples have signed up for an organized caravan tour sponsored by the company that manufactures the trailers. Few surprises are in store for the group, but then they're never alone and they don't have to worry about the day's route or entertainment."
