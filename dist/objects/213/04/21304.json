        "A doctor describes the condition of hypothermia, or exposure sickness, detailing its gradual effect on the mind and body. This slow numbing process of physical and mental faculties is then shown in a dramatic enactment of the experiences of a group of hikers who vary in stamina and in their knowledge of the dangers of inadequate protection against changes in weather. When one experienced climber recognizes the symptoms of hypothermia and takes positive action the symptoms and treatment of this insidious malady are clearly demonstrated."
