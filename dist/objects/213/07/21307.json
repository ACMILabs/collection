        "The Byzantine Empire had become, by 750 AD, the richest and most powerful in the world. This film presents a brief historical outline of the Empire, and indicates its important cultural contributions in art, religion and scholarship. Photographed principally in Greece and Turkey, the film captures the richness of the mosaic works, icons and architecture. Suitable for upper secondary level."
