        "Commentary spoken by Ingrid Bergman. Tells of a woman and her family who have lived in a refugee camp for ten years. They have had to rely on other's charity because they could not work, and must wait to start new lives while others leave. The film ends as a challenge - the refugee camps will be burned as empty buildings if nations can give their help."
