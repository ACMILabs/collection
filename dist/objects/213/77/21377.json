        "In its simplest form the canon is a kind of singing game, a round for voices where each singer picks up the words and tune, a beat or so after the preceding one. Norman McLaren and Grant Munro demonstrate, by animation and live action, how a canon works. A child's blocks are used in a checkerboard to illustrate the form of Frere Jacques. Two additional canons specially written for the film by Eldon Rathburn are acted out. Five awards, including Toronto."
