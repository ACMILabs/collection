        "A jet plane, a boomerang, and a locomotive are shown as examples of successful design in which the right materials are used for the right purposes. Showing examples of the work of Australia's industrial designers, the film explains that the purpose for which an article is intended determines the final design. Examples include household articles such as an electric iron, comfortable chairs, lamps, and saucepans."
