        "The relationship between cigarette-smoking and lung cancer. Leading US surgeons and health authorities emphasise the parallel between increased smoking in recent decades and higher incidence of lung cancer. Also stressed is the shorter life of cigarette-smokers. The film dramatizes the story of a (fictitious) editor, who is trying to persuade the Board of a US magazine to publish the facts on cancer. Includes scenes of an actual lung operation, and of the diseased lung after removal."
