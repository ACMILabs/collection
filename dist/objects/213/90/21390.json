        "The story of Noah and his Ark, told in words, animation and music. God had created a world and set mankind on it, but when He looked down on His people He saw only sinning and selfishness. But He found Noah, the only good man left, living outside the walls of Fun City, and told him in a dream what He was going to do. Music by Joseph Horovitz and lyrics by Michael Flanders."
