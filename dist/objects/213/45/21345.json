        "Episode number 5 of Series \"21st Century\". At the National Institute of Health in Baltimore, researchers are trying to find answers to the question of extending life. Scientists are studying microscopic creatures called rotifers whose life span has been increased by a drastic change of environment. The possibility that this might be an effective program for human life is the problem posed in the survey. the film also discusses organ transplanting, germ-free isolation for patients, freezing the dead or incurable for possible revival and experiments on the aging process."
