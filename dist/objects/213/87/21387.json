        "We follow the \"Genevilliers\", a petrol barge, along the River Seine from the throbbing harbour to the mellow arches of Paris. Life bounded by the ever-changing banks has its own special kind of freedom. Captain Michael hacke and his family see the river in different weathers, colors and moods. They feel a unique brotherhood with their fellow river dwellers, a chance meeting with relatives is an occasion for celebration. No matter how the life of a bargee may change with time, the river remains a world unto itself. Commentary in English. Photography by Roger Fellous and jean-Jacques Languepin. Music by Jean Wiener."
