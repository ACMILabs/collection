French and English exploration; French traders and settlements, growth of English settlement in North America; conflict over the control of the land; the war between the French and the English; English governors appointed to govern a predominantly French Catholic people. James Murray Hadden and Guy Carleton who both worked toward French equality, Carleton's work in parliament resulting in the Quebec Act of 1774, which settled many of the French-English differences to Quebec."
