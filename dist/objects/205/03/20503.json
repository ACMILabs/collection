        "Episode of Series \"B.P. Road Safety\". There is an artful dodger in every crowd and on every road. Demonstrates the driving style of such a person - the dodging in and out of traffic at high speed which is dangerous and can cause frayed nerves and accidents. The dodger is the person who takes unnecessary risks for no apparent reason - he is not a good safe driver. No other credits available."
