        "Asia now has almost two-thirds of the world's people and may double its total by the year 2000. India, China and Japan have approached the problem of overpopulation in three different ways, eg India initially tried massive birth control, but is now attacking poverty as the main source of its problems. China has always done this, with success. Japan now has little increase, but faces other problems. The approach of each country is examined and the long-term effects of the action taken are discussed."
