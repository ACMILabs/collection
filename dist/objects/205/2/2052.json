    "description": [
        "Film made to alert farmers of Pleuro-Pneoumonia, a nothern-state illness that could cripple local cattle if it was introduced into Victoria. Details how the illness manifests itself in cattle, its symptoms and how it is treated. Also describes the process of quarantine if Pleuro is suspected.  Uses diagramatical animations and illustrations throughout. These feature an animated map of Australia and Victoria. Numerous shots of cattle in hot and dry conditions. Amongst other bloody imagery there is footage of organs being removed from diseased cow and placed in a tin. Nice cheesey sequence of quarantine signs being placed around a property. Good 'The End' title."
