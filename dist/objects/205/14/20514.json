        "The principle of the artificial kidney was known as early as the 1920's, but only in later years has it been possible to use it in chronic renal diseases where the kidney has completely, or very largely, ceased to function. A Swedish girl who receives treatment from the artificial kidney machine discusses the problems she faces and the possibility of a kidney transplantation. No other credits available."
