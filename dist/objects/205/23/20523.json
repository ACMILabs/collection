        "Toscannini conducts the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a spirited rendition of Giuseppe Verdi's \"Hymn of the Nations\". With the Westminster Choir, featuring Jan Peerce as soloist, this performance was part of a celebration to mark the liberation of Italy during World War II. The film also sketches the life of Toscannini, showing the way in which he lived up to his convictions. No other credits available."
