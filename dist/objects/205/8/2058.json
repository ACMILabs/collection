        "Picture only. Footage of specialised machine used for quickly removing fruit from peach and pair trees. The machine envelopes a tree and then vibrates which causes the fruit to fall off into a catching device. This is an odd process to view as the tree is shaken quite violently by the machine and the fruit falls into the catching device in a dramamtic fashion."
