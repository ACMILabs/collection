        "The story of the transformation of the world's oldest road into a modern all-weather motor highway. The ancient caravan route stretches 8,000 miles across Asia from the Iranian-Turkish border to East Pakistan. Work started in 1958 and when completed modern asphalt or concrete roads will stretch almost halfway across Asia, linking up with European highway networks. It will serve an area where more than 600 million people live. Shows the people who live along the highway, their way of life, and their emergence from seclusion."
