        "Article 55 of the United Nations Charter provides for the promotion of economic and social progress and development. The film shows how a mission to Bolivia was established, and pictures the complete problem which faces them. Shows also how Bolivia suffers with other undeveloped countries the burdens of ill health, of relying on depression prone primary exports, and of lacking the fundamental facilities which attract overseas capital."
