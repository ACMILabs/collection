        "Balanus, Caprella, Crago, Hippolyte, Homarus, and Pagarus serve to illustrate various groups pf crustaceans found along the rocky coast of Maine. The picture opens with a colony of barnacles in action, followed by high magnifications of the cirri. Several specimens shed their integuments to allow for continual growth. Large individuals dredged from deep water are similarly shown. The skeleton shrimp shows its protective blending of form and colour with the algal background, and we see the peculiar structure of this obscure animal. The prawn and lobster reveal decapod structure and activity and demonstrate such features as the main divisions of the body, the mouth parts and the sensory and ecomotor appendages. The hermit crabs protect themselves by occupying the shells of various gastropod molluscs, and one individual deprived of its shell is seem to enter a new one in time to avoid capture of another hermit crab."
