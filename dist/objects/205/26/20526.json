        "Imagine a world where everything moves backwards. That is what happens in this experimental film without words when a man wakes up to the sound of his alarm clock and begins his day, only to find that for some mysterious reason everything is running in reverse - his electric shaver, the morning paper. Out in the street, people and cars are backing away. He alone of all the crowd seems to move forward normally. The effect on him and the viewers verges on the bizarre. Sound film without commentary."
