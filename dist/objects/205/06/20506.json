        "This film examines the major physical characteristics which are used to identify arthropods. It compares and studies examples from each of the four main classifications - myriapods, insects, arachnids and crustaceans - and describes their common characteristics, their environments, and the ways in which they are helpful and harmful. Uses magnified close-ups and detailed anatomical drawings. No other credits available."
