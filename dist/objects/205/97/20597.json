        "Episode of Series \"The Crossroads of the world: a study of North Africa and the Middle East\". Education, political reform, and technology are all being used to serve the aims of the society of North Africa and the Middle East. The primary aim is liberation from colonial control and from the grip of poverty. Throughout the region this film finds much new development, aimed for the most part at the production of larger, more varied crops and the organization of new industry. Within sight of the waterwheels of antiquity can be seen the rise of vast power dams and pumping stations, and beyond mud villages steel and concrete cities, schools and factories can be seed."
