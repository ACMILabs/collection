        "Details and promotes the 1957 Pig Carcase competition as well as pork production in Victoria as a whole. Similar to the 1955 Pig Carcase competition in format and style. Includes various shots of carcases being cut for display, general crowd shots, an awards ceremony and a speech by an official. Features fantastic footage of three carcases hanging up in front of a black backdrop being inspected and caressed by a man. Nice theatrical quality to it. Excellent shot of a boy inspecting pork shot from behind, highlighting very cute jeans. End of piece features an official from the Board of Meat, aided by illustrations, talking about how pork production in Victoria has improved over time. Behind him hang carcases and behind them there is a red wall. He wears a pink and red tie. This creates a quirky, very good-looking frame of man, meat and pig illustration. Soundtrack features music of the period and earnest narration about 'pig raisers'."
