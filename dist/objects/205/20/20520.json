        "Artists and artisans at work in the Orrefors glass-works in Sweden. We see how they design their work, how they find aesthetic and practical solutions to functional problems, and all stages of the blowing of glass. Artists hand-paint designs onto glass, then they hand-engrave the design to complete the article. Many fine examples of Orrefors glassware are included. No credits available."
