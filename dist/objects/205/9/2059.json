        "Film explains how to correctly pack and store apples for export to Enlgand on ships. Features footage of early automated fruit processing technology, as well as women sorting through apples and packing them. Nice shots, also, of people picking apples and placing them in steel buckets. Classic apple-picking imagery with rich reds and greens. Some slow-motion footage of 'expert' demonstrating how to wrap an apple before packing. End of film shot at docks with numerous crates being hiosted onto ships. Narration is upbeat and light.  Beautiful illustrated title and end credits featuring text-over-apples."
