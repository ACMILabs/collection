        "Random footage of Melbourne in the Summer."
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Film features quite general shots of Melbourne in the summer. This includes footage of the Great Ocean Road (including panoramas), a busy suburban pool and St. Kilda Beach. These sequences have a great, nostalgic 'good time' vibe to them, which is aided in part by the high-contrast film stock. There is also footage of one of Melbourne's Gardens (possibly the Botanic), including blooming flowers and people looking at them. Nice shots of man burning leaves followed by the sun breaking through smoke haze and trees in garden. Two shots include views of St. Paul's Cathederal and the Forum Theatre from the Yarra. Nice, Black and White 'The End'."
