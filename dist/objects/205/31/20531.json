        "Describes asexual reproduction processes and shows how they differ from those of sexual reproduction. Develops three concepts: that all types of asexual reproduction are basically alike, asexually reproduced offspring are like the parents, and there is no fusion of gametes. Illustrates examples of simple fission in microscopic plants and animals and budding in various plants. No other credits available."
