        "Montage of colourful shots including a streetscape, livestock and grapepicking. Attractive illustrated title. Sound consists solely of a theme song. The music is upbeat, cheesey and evocative of television programmes of the 1970s and 1980s. Good countdown at begining, some numbers written as words, ie 'six' not '6'."
