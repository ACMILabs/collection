        "A colour portrait of one of the foremost pioneers in modern art. Born in Lithuania, Jacques Lipchitz now lives in New York. Some of his works are inspired by the past while others are a reflection of present times. As he works in his studio on a portrait of the late President Kennedy, Lipchitz adds his own insight, his own knowledge about the man, and his own interpretation of the times."
