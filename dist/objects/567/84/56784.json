        "This engaging short film designed for Language and Visual Arts activities in grades 3 to 6 looks at a non-verbal form of communication that is universally understood - body language. With a candid camera and a catchy song, Body Talking demonstrates how our posture, gestures and facial expressions can tell others a great deal about how we're feeling. Scenes in parks and playgrounds, on city streets and at bus stops show that \"without saying a word, we can still be heard\" - when our body does the talking. (Award: Vancouver)"
