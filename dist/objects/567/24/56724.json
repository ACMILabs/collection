        "Takes a look at the semi-nomadic herding economy of the people of inner Mongolia whom still mantain their ancient culture despite the intrusion of the modern world. Shows the division of labour, the importance of the horse to the community and the men's superb horsemanship, constant search for water, types of food eaten and the traditional customs followed at a marriage ceremony. Also notes how the introduction of regular schooling and health care improved general standards of living and young people living an urban lifestyle unknown to their parents."
