        "A beautifully animated story about a friendly green monster who tries to change the colour of his skin and who learns he must accept himself as he really is. A rhythmic drum beat enhances the natural rhythm of the verse to which visuals are set. Animated by Tom Golden and Arnie Levey, music performed and composed by Herbert Harris."
