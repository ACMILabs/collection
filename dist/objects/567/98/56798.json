        "Charming allegorical film about the role of the United Nations in resolving disputes: Separated by a bank of cloud, the short people and tall people are becoming increasingly ill-disposed to each other. Failing to resolve the dispute on their own, the U.N. Fairy is enlisted to their aid, and the cloud dividing the conflicting parties are driven aside."
