        "A deceptively simple film about an egg who doesn't fit. Superb animation details the various stages of the production process where the egg who is 'different' fails to meet the required specifications. A film that operates on a number of levels ranging from lower primary concepts of colour, number and size to the more abstract concepts of conformity, individual differences, desire for acceptance, etc."
