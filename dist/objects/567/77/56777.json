        "Traces a segment of a feature film from casting to the actor-director relationship through these various stages. Very useful for senior media studies students as it makes tangible the relationship between the director and the actors. Also shows the actors negotiating their parts with the director, making input into how the part is to be played. Featuring Michael Caulfield as the director, Noni Hazelhurst and John Derum as the actors."
