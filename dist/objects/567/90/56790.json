        "Beginning with the statement that Lincoln became the \"last victim of the Civil War\", when he was assassinated, the film traces his life from humble beginnings in a log cabin, an axe wielding woodsman and also voracious reader as a youth, to candidate to the State Assembly at twenty-three in 1832. However, the film gives no hint of criticism of Lincoln, who spoke \"with courage and conviction for all people\", and no analysis of the causes of events or action is attempted."
