        "This film shows the various steps involved in the production of the famous British \"delicacy\" of baked beans from their beginnings on an Ontario farm to the time when they are devoured as part of a typical English meal. A useful example of vertically integrated food processing and the importance of quality control in manufacturing. Suitable for Upper Primary-Lower Secondary students. No other credits available."
