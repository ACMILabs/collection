        "An intriguing look at a group of people who set out from Australia to sail first of all to Muroroa Atoll in the Pacific and then to the west coast of the USA to protest against the French tests in the Pacific and the deployment of the Trident nuclear submarines. Raises issues about the effectiveness of such protests, the motivations of the people involved and the differences of opinion of the people in the group. Suitable for upper secondary level."
