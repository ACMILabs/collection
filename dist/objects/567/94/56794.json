        "Episode of Series \"The Nature of things\". A film study of the microscope, putting it into scientific and historical perspective from Van Leeuwenhoek's 17th century observations through an amateurish magnifying glass to the modern monsters that make a flea seem incredibly long. This is largely a pictorial film suited to students viewing simple microscopic organisms from pond water with a reasonable monocular microscope for the first time. Suitable for lower and middle secondary levels."
