        "Raises issues for teachers concerning child abuse: 1. Teachers need to be aware that child sexual abuse is a very real community problem. - 2. Teachers have a responsibility to children in their care to be aware of the behavioural indicators of child sexual abuse. - 3. The need for teachers to report suspected sexual abuse cases to the relevant authorities. Social workers and psychologists present the indicators of child sexual abuse and how to proceed (US) if one suspects child sexual abuse."
