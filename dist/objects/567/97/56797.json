        "In this film a group of children manipulate reality using a series of photographs of their own activities. As they lay out the photos in different sequences, the story of their day changes. Simple, realistic dialogue and a combination of live action and still photographs capture the viewer's imagination. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
