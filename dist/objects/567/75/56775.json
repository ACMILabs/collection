        "Describes early attempts to make wool shrink-resistant by chlorination and comments on some adverse effects of this process. It goes on toe cover CSIROs research efforts culminating in a coating technique using a resin polyamide epichlorhydrin. This method is used commercially and renders wool completely shrink proof. Reference is made to the parallel development of a method of continuous dyeing of wool and that these developments are compatible."
