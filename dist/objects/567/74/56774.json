        "Takes an intimate look at the men who make their living riding in rodeos, their dreams, their disappointments and their physical injuries. Being a rodeo cowboy is an adventurous and challenging life and although only a few ever make any real money, most would not trade for anything else. The camaraderie and dependence of friend upon friend and man upon animal are the motivations that hold them together. Photographed by Rick Freidberg and Mort \"Kai\" Schuman. Features soundtrack of original songs by Tim McIntire."
