        "A contemporary Australian story which considers the effects of unemployment on family life. George loses his job after 35 years of employment and not knowing how to tell his wife and family, pretends to go to work each day. Ideal for considering the value of work and study, the importance attached to work as viewed by different generations, family relationships, traditional sex roles, technological change and communication. Lead role played by Max Cullen."
