        "Shot in the district around Goulburn, NSW near Wollondilly river, this historical silent film warmly depicts bush life in Australia in the 1870's of early Catholic settlers as described in the poem of the title. The priest and poet, Father John O'Brien (aka Father Patrick Hartigan), appears in the film reading prose as the story begins. The humorous tale recounts his childhood experiences of childhood and education in the bush. Wonderful images include the 'old shaky slab hut school' and the bush salesman where the mother buys the children each a hat, humourously described...\"six ugly extinguishers that fitted us too soon - six ugly upturned canisters, each one a thing of gloom\". The film was not without controversy. When the film was first screened, reactions were mixed because of its obvious Catholic bias; some distributors even refusing to screen it, seeing it as Catholic propaganda. Today, as then, the film is still a charming recollection of earlier days. With music only, no intertitles."
