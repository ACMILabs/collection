        "Natural Recovery Systems of Moncton, New Brunswick, is a recycling factory. The employees are efficient and conscientious. All are eligible for on-the-job training and an after-hours life-skills program. They are mentally and physically disabled, a resource of forgotten people. The film shows them on and off the job, learning new skills, and generally relaxing among themselves in the company cafeteria. Narrated by Joseph Rutten. (Award: New York.)"
