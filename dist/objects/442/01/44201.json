        "Episode of Series \"Chants populaires\". Animated interpretation of two French folk songs. Featuring Madeleine Lachance and the Quatuor Alouette. 'La-haut sur ces montagnes' (2.59 mins) is set on the island of Orleans near Quebec, where traditional dances and folksongs are kept alive by the peasant community. In 'C'est l'aviron' (3.15 mins) McLaren used gouache drawings which he superimposed against a scenic background to give the impression of a boat travelling along a lake and river which he acheived by zooming during the photographic process."
