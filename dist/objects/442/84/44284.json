        "This film is designed to teach the four main phases which occur during the negotiation process in a commercial or business setting: preparation, discussion, proposals and bargaining. Through the use of a clever analogy between domestic and work situations, this film shows how all negotiations ultimately come down to a question of civilised bargaining."
