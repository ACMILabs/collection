        "A play on the colour, form and movement of two simple figures: a flower and a star. The effect is gay and lively, a constant surprise, but the movement has a mathematical precision as multiples of the figures form sets or ensembles, forming and reforming on the screen in absorbing, piquant harmony. A film without words; titles in French."
