        "Based on the novel Loaded by Christos Tsiolkas, Ana Kokkinos's compelling (Only the brave) debut feature Head on is a volatile, confronting and at times bleak look at race, sexuality and class in contemporary Australian society. The films lead protagonist Ari (Alex Dimitriades) is an angry, confused, nihilistic, unemployed 19 year old Greek Australian. The film traces a particularly explosive 24 hours in his life, fuelled by drugs, booze and anonymous sex as he grapples with his sexuality and clashes with his traditional Greek family, who he views with equal amounts of respect and contempt. Performances are excellent throughout, in particular Paul Capsis as Ari's defiant cross dressing friend Johnny/Toula. Cast includes Elena Mandalis, Eugenia Fragos, Julian Garner, Dora Kaskanis, Alex Papps, Damien Fotiou. (Awards: Best Actor (Alex Dimitriades) and Best Supporting Actor(Paul Capsis) for the 1999 Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards. Best Feature Film Adaptation (Andrew Bovell, Ana Kokkinos, Mira Robertson) 1998 Awgie Awards. Best Director (Ana Kokkinos) 1999 San Francisco Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. Best Achievement in Editing (Jill Bilcock) 1998 AFI Awards)"
