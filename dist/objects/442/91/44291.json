        "From a glimpse of the beautiful planet we inhabit, as seen by astronauts in outer space, this film moves in for a closer look at what we are doing to it. The film employs the multi-image technique to contrast scenes of natural grandeur - mountains, forests, and wildflowers filmed in Canada's national parks - with images such as the fouled rivers and despoiled countryside that result from the heedless exploitation of the natural environment. The challenge and the responsibility are plain for all to see. (Award: Teheran.)"
