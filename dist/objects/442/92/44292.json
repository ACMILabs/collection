        "This is about a people who dared to ask: \"What are they going to do with us?\" The Japanese-Canadians fought long and hard to be accepted as Canadians. It is important that the long story of frustration and injustice, mistrust and hate, and eventual triumph should be remembered. This film tells that story. (Awards: New York; Birmingham.)"
