        "Tangos Among Friends is a personal pilgrimage by pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim to his hometown of Buenos Aires. The film intersperses Barenboim's exposition of the history of the development of Tango music in Argentina with excerpts from concerts where Barenboim performs pieces by renowned Tango composers (such as Carlos Gardel and Piazzolla), with double bass player Hector Console and accordionist Rodolfo Mederos. Barenboim also performs a duet with Placido Domingo and there is also an example of Tango dancing. \"Tangos Among Friends\" is a fascinating journey into the wonders of Tango music and dance as well as the cultural life of Argentina. The video comes with a booklet that gives details of the songs included in the film and of the three musicians performing the music. In English and Spanish with English subtitles."
