        "People from various English-speaking groups in Montreal and other places in Quebec express their personal reactions to the October Crisis of 1970 when Quebec nationalism took a violent turn. A British diplomat had been kidnapped, a Quebec cabinet minister murdered. The troops were brought in as a safeguard. This film is a vigorous reflection of the discussions and analyses of the situation that went on wherever people gathered, voicing attitudes and fears, sympathies and concerns."
