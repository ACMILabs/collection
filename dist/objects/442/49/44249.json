        "Soil salinity is a problem that seriously affects many farmers in the Great Plains region of the Canadian West. More than two million hectares of cultivated land are already altered by high salt content, and more rich soil is lost each year. As the film explains, agricultural scientists now question certain traditional farm practices, and farmers and researchers are experimenting together to find new grass crops more tolerant of soil salinity. The problem is recognized as a community concern, and solutions do now exist."
