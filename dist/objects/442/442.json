    "description": [
        "One of the first Science Fiction films, this Melies\u2019 short humorously proposes what man discovers when he first lands on the moon. Based on the Jules Verne story, George Melies used his extraordinary cinematic illusions to tell this story of the first voyage to the moon. Made in 1902, this was a visionary film that has come to be recognised as a cinematic masterpiece. Among the many comical set pieces is the famous scene in which a rocket ship crash-lands into the eye of the 'man in the moon'. This whimsical fantasy is also exemplary in its early depiction of the moon and the possible encounters between humans and worlds beyond our imagining, in our exploration of deep space."
