        "Help! with The Beatles is an example of the evolution of the MTV pop video generation. The film's plot revolves around a strange sacrificial ring which mysteriously finds its way onto Ringo's finger. He can't get the ring off and a group of Indian mystics (led by Leo McKern) start to stalk the Beatles in their attempts to get the ring back. The plot scenarios are pretty silly, although it's fun to see the quintessentially sixties decor and clothes. The main attraction to \"Help!\" is of course the Beatles' songs which play like pop videos. Included in the film are; \"Help!\", \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\", \"Ticket to Ride\", \"Another Girl\", \"I Need You\" and \"The Night Before\"."
