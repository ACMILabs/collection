        "The film reflects the dilemma of an urban family whose private world is no longer proof against strains from outside. The head of the family, a Montreal businessman tormented by a sense of failure, seeks a new self-image in an out-of-town affair. His college son is drawn to student causes and a night-club singer. The youngest boy, confused and insecure, wants to run away from it all; and the mother, caught in the middle, no longer feels adequate as everyone's guide and protector. It is a familiar theme portrayed in moving, human terms. Stars Arthur Hill and Sharon Acker."
