        "Curious title, considering the phantom rarely lurks deeper than six feet or so underwater. Kent Taylor and Rodney Bell are investigating several mysterious underwater deaths, supposedly caused by a sea \"phantom.\" The pair suspect that a professor of oceanography (Michael Whalen) knows something about the phantom, which he most certainly does. The phantom, a mutated sea monster, is the result of the professor's evil experiments with an \"atomic ray.\" Both villain and phantom (which looks like an ulcerated beach toy) are dispatched by a few sticks of TNT. Famous for winning a 'Golden Turkey' award."
