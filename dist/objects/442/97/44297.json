        "Episode of Series \"Classic albums: the greatest records in rock history\". Fleetwood Mac's album 'Rumours' hit the charts in 1978 and reached phenonemenal success, selling 15 million copies world wide, achieving chart success in the U.K and U.S, and culminating in an Album of the Year award at the 1978 Grammy's. A little know fact behind the album's creation was the tumultuous decade preceding the 1977 recording in Sausalito. The eponymously titled band underwent several changes of personnel prior to the album's release. In 1974 the setup stabilized with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joining existing members Mick Fleetwood, John and Christine McVie. 'Rumours' was the album that almost didn't get made, as the disintegration of personal relationships within the band were conspiring against the creation of an album that would ensure the band's lasting popularity. Included on the tape is a specially recorded version of Christine McVie's \"Songbird\"; Lindsey Buckingham's acoustic rendition of \"Never going back\", along with \"You make loving fun\", \"Rhiannon\", \"Dreams\", \"Don't stop\" and \"Gold dust woman\"."
