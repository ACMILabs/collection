        "Episode of Series \"Classic albums: the greatest records in rock history\". Recorded in New York and South Africa, Paul Simon's 'Graceland' sold 14 million copies, was named Album of the Year in 1986, and brought the sound of South African music into mainstream broadcasting. The album came about when Simon, accompanied by Roy Halee, met musicians in South Africa and was impressed with their distinct sound. It was a turning point in his career, for it was at this stage that Paul Simon created a new kind of song, blending African rhythms with his own perspective on what he had experienced. African musicians were brought to work with Simon in recording and 'Graceland' emerged with chart success in the United States, United Kingdom, and South Africa. The dramatic story of the albums creation and inspiration is told here by Paul Simon, Roy Halee and fellow musicians."
