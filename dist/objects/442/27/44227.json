        "Chauvel's first \"talkie\", this film merges documentary footage and dramatic historical reconstruction. Re-enacts the mutiny led by Fletcher Christian (Errol Flynn) in 1789 against the master of the Bounty, William Bligh (Mayne Lynton), and depicts the fate of the mutineers on Tahiti and remote Pitcairn Island. Provides a unique and spectacular record of the life of the isolated community of Pitcairn in 1932 with most of the inhabitants being descendants of the Bounty mutineers. This was the first film shot on Pitcairn Island and the first in which the Australian actor, Errol Flynn, appeared. The dramatised footage was shot at the Cinesound Studio in Sydney. Cast also includes Victor Gouriet and John Warwick"
