        "This is a portrait of Frank Hurley - pioneer cameraman, war photographer, explorer, film director, writer, lecturer, broadcaster and Australia's best known stills photographer. 'Snow, sand and savages' pays tribute to Hurley's life and work and covers his first trip to Antarctica with Mawson and Shackleton, his 1919 footage of the Ross and Keith Smith flight from London to Australia, his 1920's expeditions to New Guinea, and his coverage of both world wars. Some light relief is included with an excerpt from Hurley's foray into feature films with 'The Jungle woman' in 1926. Narrated by Leo McKern and written by Joan Long."
