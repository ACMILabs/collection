        "Wild Things is a steamy thriller about two high school students, the guidance counsellor they accuse of rape, and the detective who suspects there's more to the story. This mystery of deceit, sex, greed and power moves from Blue Bay's elite beach communities into the murky swampy waters of the Everglades at a rapid pace with unpredictable plot twists abundant. Cast includes: Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Theresa Russell, Robert Wagner and Bill Murray."
