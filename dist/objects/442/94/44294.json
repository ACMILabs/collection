        "Every square inch of Canada, second largest country in the world, has been put on maps, and much of it is being mapped again, even more thoroughly. How such a vast territory is committed to paper is seen in this film, stage by stage: aerial photography; ground surveying with sophisticated instruments and at headquarters, the exacting work of translating, plotting, and printing."
