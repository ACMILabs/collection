        "Aliette lives in Montreal with her husband and three children. Since both Aliette and Pierre work outside their home full-time, they share household responsibilities. This development has changed them as individuals and, they think, has affected the dynamics of their family - for the better. This film is interesting for mixed audiences of women and men."
