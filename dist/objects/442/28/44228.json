        "This biography of pioneering aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith was modelled on the Hollywood biopic, and the Cinesound production team's smooth professionalism matched Hollywood production values. The emphasis is on Smithy's heroism, and although some conflict is provided by his doubts and domestic problems, the filmmakers seem to be more interested in Smithy's obsessive quest for perfection. The Pacific flight, the peak of his achievement, rather than his final disappearance, provides an appropriate climax. Smithy's old plane, the Southern Cross was resurrected from storage and flown by two of its old pilots. The film is also notable for the appearance of former Prime Minister William Morris Hughes as himself. Cast includes Ron Randell as Smithy and Muriel Steinbeck as Lady Kingsford Smith."
