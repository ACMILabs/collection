        "A melodrama, partly shot on location at Scone, N.S.W., involving romance and intrigue against a background of the world of horse racing and culminating in the Melbourne Cup. The film follows the fortunes of a racehorse breeding family, the Curzons, who need to strengthen their blood stock to re establish a fading reputation. This results in the purchase of a champion English horse, along with a father and son training team. Rivalry develops between the men for the love of the Curzon daughter, and for the attentions of a femme fatale nightclub singer, Zara Marlowe. A mock race was staged at Flemington and Randwick for the film and famous jockeys of the time, Jack Purcell and George Moore make brief personal appearances. Cast includes Charles Tingwell, Muriel Steinbeck and Nonnie Peifer."
