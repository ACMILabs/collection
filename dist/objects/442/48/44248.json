        "A review of the problems created by the decline of the coal-mining industry in Canada, as witnessed in one of the most affected areas of Nova Scotia. The film goes into the mines of Cape Breton to study the question at close range. It shows how high production costs, inadequate mining methods and increased competition threaten not only the livelihood of the Cape Breton miners, but also a large part of Canada's industrial economy."
