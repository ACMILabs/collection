        "Anyone bent on really remembering happy days at Montreal's world's fair, Expo 67, is likely to agree that this film is it. In a brief quarter-hour it explores most of the fair at a friendly, unhurried pace, with many a pause to smile and enjoy. It will please anyone who saw Expo, and even more, those who missed the opportunity to be there themselves. No dialogue, musical background only."
