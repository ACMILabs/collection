        "Episode of Series \"Classic albums: the greatest records in rock history\". The Grateful Dead, known for their experimentation and individual approach to music and performance have sustained a career in live performances since the mid 60's (originating from the San Francisco Bay area). Infamous for their experimentation with music and hallucinogenic drugs, the band are also well known for their loyal fans (known as 'deadheads'), who have travelled consistently with the band for 30 years. Priceless interviews recounting many humourous and bizarre tales are told in such a 'matter of fact' manner, chronicling their journey from experimental \"Anthem of the Sun\", to the accessible \"American Beauty\". Featuring interviews with core band members; Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Ron 'Pigpen' McKerman, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, which includes amongst others a rare interview with lyricist Robert Hunte. Other contributors include David Crosby, biographer Dennis McNally, keyboard virtuoso Tom Constanten, producer Steven Barnaco, legendary engineer Dan Healy and Warner Records chief Joe Smith."
