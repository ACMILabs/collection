        "The secret life of a peg! A comic animation of common wooden pegs who, once left alone in a laundry basket, come to life and sprout legs. This quirky short has the pegs getting caught up in a string, one burns itself of an iron, and they all conspire to release two of their fellow pegs from a shirt pocket, in the process cause chaos."
