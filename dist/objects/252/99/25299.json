        "In February 1968, an exhibition of the paintings of the American pop artist Roy Liechtenstein was held at the Tate Gallery in London. This is a film record of the exhibition and both members of the public and Liechtenstein comment on the work displayed. The public were interviewed by Hugh Evans. Roy Liechtenstein's comments were taken from interviews by Alan Soloman recorded for National Education Television and by David Sylvester recorded for British Broadcasting Corporation."
