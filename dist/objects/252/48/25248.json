        "Episode of Series \"Horizon\". There is a high proportion of persistent offenders in Britain's gaols. There are two schools of thought concerning the reasons for criminality. Behaviouralists consider that personality is determined by heredity as well as by environment, while psychoanalysts maintain that a criminal's aggressive behaviour arises out of internal conflict resulting from traumatic experiences in early life. Both schools of thought believe that remedial treatment and not punishment is the only way to help people."
