        "Behind the library van, making its three-weekly 750-mile circuit of British Columbia's beautiful Fraser Valley, lies the story of twenty-one communities pooling their resources to solve the problems of bringing books to the people in scattered isolated farming areas. The library van is greeted at every stop by eager borrowers - farmers, fishermen, lumbermen, engineers, adults and children alike. Books are important to all the people of Canada, and the people of the Fraser Valley have made sure that the books they want are readily available to meet their needs. Librarians for the vans are trained at the University of Toronto at the McGill University, Canada."
