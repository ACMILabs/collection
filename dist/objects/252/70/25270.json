        "An introduction, at junior level, to the subject of linear measurement. A young boy becomes interested in his own height and his curiosity is aroused about other measurement techniques. His father demonstrates the estimated measure technique when the boy wonders how far he has thrown a ball. The father and son practice guessing distances and have practical experiences in measuring length, width, height and distance."
