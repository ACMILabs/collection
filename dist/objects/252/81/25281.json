        "Often the impression conveyed in a letter is very different from the one intended, and the message is muddled and confusing. This can be disastrous when a letter is written at work, or when it is sent on behalf of a company or other organisation. The film is intended to be shown to clerks, office supervisors and managers, in fact for everyone who has to write letters during their working day. It sets out to show that there is no secret art to writing effective business letters, but that there are some basic rules which can be followed in almost every case."
