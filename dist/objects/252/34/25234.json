        "A Maori legend tells of the origin of the Wanganui River long ago. This film recounts the story, revealing something of the importance of the river to Maoris in the past, and illustrating its role today. The camera captures the mood of the river as it cascades down from its mountain source, swirls through narrow gorges, passes by dense forests ringing to the cry of birds, and eventually meets the sea near the city of Wanganui."
