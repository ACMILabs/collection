        "Shows how man passed on his heritage of tradition and justice even before he developed the printed word. An Eskimo grandfather tells an old legend about how the raven was banished from the society of men and birds because he was selfish in time of winter hunger. The story is enacted through the use of authentic Eskimo stone and ivory carvings and enriched by actual chants."
