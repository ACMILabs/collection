        "Episode number 20 of Series \"Modern social studies\". An instructional film for classroom use. Tells of life on a Northern Territory cattle station. Isolation is the governing factor in the life of this and all other outback families - their daily routine involves tasks that must be done to ensure the functioning of the station as a self sufficient community. The children play their part by helping with mustering and branding - when they are not doing lessons by correspondence or school broadcasts."
