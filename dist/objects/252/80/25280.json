        "A classroom study of New Zealand's native Kiwi - its appearance, habits and ancestry. It has been closely protected since 1908: its export is prohibited except on rare occasions, and it may only be kept in captivity for scientific studies. it has become a national emblem appearing on coins, incorporated in badges, and commonly used in referring to New Zealand's people. Told by an Australian girl, Susan Boyden."
