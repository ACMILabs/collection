        "Illustrates the history, philosophy, purposes, services and the rewards of libraries. In an interesting blend of ancient and modern, the entire sweep of recorded information - from clay tablets to computers - is pictured. At the same time the beauty of books as works of art is not forgotten. What is means to be a librarian is emphasised throughout the film. Narrated by Lester Rawlins."
