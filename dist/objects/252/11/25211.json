        "During the 1930s Britain was gradually replacing her old,out-dated unhealthy schools with modern well-equipped, fully staffed new schools. Examples of the kind of nursery school, junior school, and senior school which the New Education Act was designed to make the rule rather than the exception throughout Britain, are studied in this film; emphasis is placed on the type of syllabus being taught and the kind of skills being developed in school children in these schools."
