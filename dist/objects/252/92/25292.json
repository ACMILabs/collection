        "At Myers elementary school library in Tucson, Arizona, the librarian, teachers and students help each other use every bit of library space as a resource centre for perceiving, reading, experiencing and learning beyond the classroom. The film presents the idea that the traditional concept of primary school libraries is outdated. The library depicted is a modern resource centre in which children also have access to nonbook materials. Suitable for middle and upper primary and teacher/tertiary levels."
