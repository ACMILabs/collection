        "Episode of Series \"Science Curriculum Improvement Studies Series\". Fifth grade children, working with the communities unit, observed crickets in their terraria and set up experiments to find out what the crickets eat. Later children observe frogs eating some of their crickets and so on. The children's experiences provide background for the introduction of the concept of a community."
