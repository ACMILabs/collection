        "Hundreds of years ago, the Vandals, a tribe of barbarians from cold Northern Europe, were forced to leave their country and migrate southward. They crossed into sunny italy and plundered the beautiful city of Rome, leaving it in ruins. Since that time, any act of wasteful, senseless damage has been named after them - \"Vandalism\". This traces the history of the word \"vandalism\" and demonstrates the futility and waste caused by modern vandals. Drawings by Les Tanner."
