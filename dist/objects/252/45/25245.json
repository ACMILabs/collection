        "The community of Lantzville, British Columbia, is a cross-section of nationalities and industrial groups - farmers, fishermen, lumbermen and railroad workers. Its spirit and its public school were down at the heels, but both community and school were transformed. An adjoining barn was converted into a community hall for the parents, to serve at the same time as a school gymnasium and as a workshop for the farm mechanics class. With the improved building, the whole school program was broadened."
