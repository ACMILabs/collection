        "Dance classes are taught at Sycamore Elementary School, California, as part of the weekly curriculum. The key is \"total involvement\" - the child puts their whole being into an experience; their body, mind, emotions, imagination and enthusiasm. The theory says that creative movement promotes harmony of the inner person with their body. Shows classes being held over a period of time with groups of children of all ages."
