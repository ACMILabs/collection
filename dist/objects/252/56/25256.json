        "Designed for teenage audiences, this film should add point and persuasion to any discussion of tobacco addiction. No aspect of cigarette smoking is left unaired as a group of students question a professor of psychology. What to do with parents who smoke is one question. Displays the timeless attitude held by teenagers of not being worried about the effect smoking is going to have on them in fifty years time - old age is such a long way off! An even-tempered investigation not without humor."
