        "The story of an old man and his aging cabin in a new neighbourhood of Montreal. At one time the cabin was surrounded by fields but eventually this changed to an attractive city suburb. Legault's place became an eye- sore. What happens when the old man is persuaded to sell makes a warm and humorous story."
