        "A train ride with a difference - at an equivalent speed of 960 m.p.h. Timelapse photography is used to record the Blue Pullman run from London to Birmingham to a musical background of Strauss's \"Perpetuum Mobile\". Time lapse sequences of the complicated track in front of the Pullman are photographed from the driver's window and inter-cut with contrasting glimpses of the passengers taken at normal speed. Photography by Jack West. This film is an up-to-date version of an earlier film \"London to Brighton in Four Minutes\" (Title Code 006440) produced for television by the BBC."
