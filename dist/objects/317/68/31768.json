        "This brilliant comprehensive study of French artist Edgar Degas takes us on a leisurely tour through the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's extraordinary collection of his works. An extended presentation of paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures gives a clearly structured view of Degas' life and career. The music of Satie and Chopin are performed by Zita Carno under the direction of Elmer Bernstein, narrated by Charles S. Moffat."
