        "In 1893 a boat load of Australian bush workers and tradesmen sailed halfway around the world to Paraguay to establish a New Australia colony in which the old Australian principles of equality and mateship would at last be realised. The film follows the footsteps of those pioneers from a strike-torn sheep country into the heart of Paraguay, landlocked into the heart of South America, where the survivors of the great experiment still live today, dreaming in exile of the gum trees in a far-off land their ancestors chose to leave but could never forget. Presented by Caroline Jones and sourced from the book by Gavin Souter \"A Peculiar people: the Australians in Paraguay\". English/Spanish language."
