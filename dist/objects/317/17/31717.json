        "A filmmaker revisits Montreal's St. Lawrence Boulevard--the Main--the road from the docks to the heart of immigrant Canada. This is a little Europe, a street of many languages, many Old World foodstuffs, a hundred small courtesies that make the stranger feel at home. For the filmmaker his prevailing memory is of the seventeen steps of a walk-up apartment, but for all Canadians, born or made, this film has many nostalgic links with a common Canadian experience."
