As a character who can turn common misfortune into near disaster, Norman depicts the weary businessman returning from a business trip. The setting is a busy airport's parking lot. Norman turns the simple experience of getting out of the parking lot into a hilarious example of \"Murphy's Law\". Cast: Doug MacIntosh."
