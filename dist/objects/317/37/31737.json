        "About the Bororo Fulani of the Niger Republic in Africa. The Bororo are a nomadic tribe, moving with their cattle across the Sahel desert each year to gather in large numbers at certain watering places to celebrate their vision of themselves as chosen beings and to enjoy one another's company. Dressed in ceremonial attire, they celebrate the yearly rains by singing and dancing."
