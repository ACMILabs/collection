        "Looks at the new breed of rangers being trained at Kakadu National Park. The training program is for Aboriginals whose families have been the traditional owners of the area. The aim is that Kakadu will be managed and run by the Aboriginal people, who will pass on a little of their culture to the visitors who come to see the park."
