        "Valium - the aspirin of the emotionally upset. An investigation into Valium, the popular pill to pop when you're feeling low. This film shows the problems that Valium can cause in today's (1977) society. The wonder drug that some doctors prescribe for their patients without knowing of its addictiveness. We hear from addicts and find out what happens when you go \"cold turkey\". The manufacturers are confronted with these problems, but plead their innocence."
