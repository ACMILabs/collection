        "A documentary of social, political and economic life in Japan today. Interviews the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Ikeda and the late Leader of the Opposition, who was tragically assassinated a few days later. Gives insight into the conflicting influences of East and West in studies of the daily lives of four typical Japanese - a fashion model, a university student, a skilled worker in the Kobe Kawasaka Dockyard, and an Osaka suburban housewife."
