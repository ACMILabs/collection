        "'Pharmaceutical girl' is not strictly a claymation. The creator Dik Jarman with Nick Pledge set about experimenting with an alternate type of puppet. Pledge created an internal armitage complete with moving joints and rising chest cavity, whilst Jarman designed and sculpted the puppet using an alternate latex type of skin to form the flesh of the puppet. A surreal animation that takes us on the journey of Sukei and her addiction. Dealt mostly with symbolism, the pricks of the rose replace the syringe. The set (of which Jarman won an award for) is both functional for the purpose of shooting scenes with moveable walls etc, but also represents Sukei's mind as the greater part of the set makes up the internals of a clock. As she begins to hallucinate the clock-like set begins to grind to a halt and then into reverse, Sukei's dream takes over. What initially begins as peaceful escape quickly turns into a nightmare. (The soundtrack is by Edwina Blush and Thierry Cotco Lovett)."
