        "The Small One is a donkey, aptly named due to his size. Owned by a little boy, the donkey must be sold as he cannot match the workload of the other donkeys. Heartbroken, the boy takes the donkey into town to sell him, his main concern being to find him a good owner. The boy is disheartened when no-one is interested in his donkey, until he meets a man who has a special job for the small one- to carry his wife to Bethlehem. Based on the book by Charles Tazewell."
