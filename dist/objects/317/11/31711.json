        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The Web of life\". A study of the ecology of the lakes which form a part of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya. Each lake in this dramatic valley has its own \"web of life\" with each species adapted to the local conditions. Among the string of lakes examined there is great contrast, ranging from the 150 degree fahrenheight soda flats of Lake Magadi to the clear waters of Lake Naivasha with its abundance of pink lilies."
