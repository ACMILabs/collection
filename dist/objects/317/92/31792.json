        "Episode of Series \"Nutrition\". Six lively programs hosted by Liza Goddard which offer information and practical advice on how to dramatically improve health by altering eating habits. Although aimed at British adults the programs are short and pacy and very relevant to Australian adolescents and adults. The contents are: \"Food for life: how to include more fibre, fruit, vegetables and fish\", \"Go with the grain: re-educating children to eat more grain\", \"Don't eat your heart out: reducing fats in the diet\", \"Sweet nothing: try to eliminate sugar which provides no nourishment\", \"Pinch of chemicals: manufactured goods contain additives, preservatives and salt\", \"Food in the fast lane: simple suggestions for nourishing packed lunches and fast foods\"."
