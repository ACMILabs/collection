        "This classic Soviet film tells the story of a farming community in Iaresky in the Ukraine and of a landowner who refuses to hand over his land for a collective farm. However more importantly is the rustic beauty of this film in its telling of life, love and death. Cast: Simon Svashenko (Basil), Stephen Shukurat (Basil's father), Peter Masokna (Thomas Whitehorse), Ellen Maximova (Basil's fiancee). Note: Original Russian film soundtrack suffered of poor quality so was replaced by music score and English subtitles (added by Black Hawk Films) and the Russian dialogue removed."
