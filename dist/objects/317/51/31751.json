        "Nature's element - the movements of sun, clouds, light and shadows play the leading roles in this film. We witness the virth of a day when the first glow of morning grows to a blinding red of boiling clouds. Into this primordial atmosphere intrudes man's machines, aeroplanes - nature rebels with explosive holocaust. Made with the assistance of the Creative Development Branch of the Australian Film Commission."
