        "Set in some affluent, edwardian part of the United States, a father congratulates his son on graduating from Harvard. The father soberly points out to the son that a certain tradition must follow, a tradition dating back through the family, a tradition dating back to Sir Charles. The son must drink from a chalice.. This short film is a forgotten masterpiece of climax comedy. Written by L.James Herbert and edited by Gregory Pike."
