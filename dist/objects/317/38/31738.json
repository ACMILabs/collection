        "A film about the making of a television film, which gently satirises all the members of a film unit, and is a lesson in how not to direct a television play. The story is seen through the eyes of Joe McGill, a professional television extra given his first speaking part of two lines. But everything that can possibly go wrong in location filming, does go wrong. Stars Jack Shepard."
