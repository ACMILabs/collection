        "Scouting has become an important activity among young Aboriginal children of Maningrida on the Arafura Sea in Northern Australia. In 1964 a school teacher introduced scouting, and its popularity led to the growth of the movement to include Cubs, Rovers and Guides. Young people from eleven tribes in the area are involved."
