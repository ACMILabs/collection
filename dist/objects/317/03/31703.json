        "A view of Stonehenge which is rooted in hard evidence and sound deduction. The film views the monument as it stands today, reconstructs, with models, the monument as it was and the likely method of erection. Also makes clear the symmetry and orientation of the structure, shows a midsummer sunrise and discusses the possible significance of this."
