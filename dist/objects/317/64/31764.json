        "A heartwarming and highly entertaining film tells the true-life story of the horse now known as Cicero, which is now in the forefront of Britain's royal parades bearing the Queen's silver drums. Tracing Cicero's \"rags to riches\" adventures from Ireland to Scotland to England, the film culminates in the stirring pageantry of the annual Trooping the Colour."
