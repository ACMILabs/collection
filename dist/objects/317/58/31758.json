        "Banned until 1945, this film has strong ties to surrealist films of the 1920's. Vigo depicts the oppressive life in a French provincial boarding school and the eventual rebellion by the boys against the authority figures, symbolised in the famous pillow fight, the raising of the flag on the roof, the slow motion procession and the stylised crucifixion of the supervisor. Cinematography by Boris Kaufman, music by Maurice Jaubert."
