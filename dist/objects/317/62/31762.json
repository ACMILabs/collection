        "Deals with a Down's Syndrome girl and boy who reveal the deep human need for communication and sharing. Ricky and Lila meet for a brief afternoon of innocent closeness, eating together and talking about what they see. When Lila is sent away to school, Ricky vainly searches the town for her. Featuring Richard Cross as Ricky and Laura Jean Ellis as Lila. (Academy Award Winner in 1980) Suitable for upper secondary level."
