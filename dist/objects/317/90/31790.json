        "Against the background of a Parliament House launching of Marjorie Tipping's book \"Victoria the Golden\", this film focuses on the watercolors of William Strutt, painted during the gold rush period in Victoria. They depict scenes of watercarters, the goldfields, people on their way to the diggings, women doing traditional men's work in Melbourne when the men left to search for gold, the opening of the Legislative Council and the departure of the Burke and Wills expedition from Melbourne. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
