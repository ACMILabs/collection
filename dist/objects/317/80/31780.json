        "Episode of Series \"The History of United States foreign relations\". The third in a series which traces the development of American foreign relations. The period between 1914 and 1941 was one in which America was torn between the policies of isolationism and involvement outside its boundaries. Focuses on Wilson's policies of involvement in European affairs during and after the First World War. A backlash caused a return to isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s which was followed by partial involvement in Europe at the beginning of World War II and America's full commitment to the war in Europe and the Pacific in 1941."
