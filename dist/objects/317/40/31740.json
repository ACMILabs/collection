        "Episode of Series \"The Christians\". Traces the development of religious indifference and atheism from the French Revolution to the present. Focuses on the current state of religion in the Soviet Union, Poland, and Italy. However, makes the statement that with the New Testament there is no clear impression for readers about what Christianity stood for. The reader can glean from it any message that he/she wants...therefore Christianity has the ability to adapt."
