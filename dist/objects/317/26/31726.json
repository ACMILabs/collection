        "Episode of Series \"Acquaintance Rape\". A young girl with an older boy come home after a date. They play out what they think of each other in their minds. The young man wants to go to bed with her, while she's thinking about what a nice guy he is. She rejects him when he makes a pass at her. They argue, he slaps her and begins to harass her. The film stops there providing food for thought on the subject of sexual violence/sexual harassment."
