        "Episode of Series \"American Enterprise\". Lew Kraft, a successful and dynamic businessman, who is building a large shopping centre, opens up the intriguing and complex world of high finance and organisational know-how. The film then traces American economics from 18th century examples of community and farm organisation, through the complexity of the industrial and transportation revolutions, to modern-day international investments and multinational corporations and the organisational knack of Americans. With William Shatner."
