        "Episode of Series \"Big country\". Orbost in Victoria is a fairly normal country town, but it has one outstanding feature - two football clubs. Every winter, football becomes the focal point in the lives of most of the local people, and it provides a good deal of their social life. In this film the two local teams compete in the district final, and football fever reaches its highest pitch."
