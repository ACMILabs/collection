        "An attempt at discovering and expressing a relationship between music and a mechanical process on an abstract level. Richard Arnell was commissioned by the Ford Motor Company to compose a symphonic piece inspired by a visit to their factory. The scriptwriter then wrote a detailed scenario to fit the music, drawing a sketch of every set-up. The resulting film, following the scheme of the music, falls into three movements: The first, a general impression; the second, with the motive of Man versus Machine; the third, climaxing in the actual production of a car."
