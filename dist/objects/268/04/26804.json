        "A puppet film that wraps up some traffic safety rules in an absorbing story about a little Indian boy who pays his first visit to a big city. Even though Magic Bow is endowed with magic gifts and thrills the rodeo audience with his act, the whirl of traffic outside the arena leaves him completely bewildered. From kindly city folk he learns some basic safety precautions."
