        "A report on the mood of the 'deep south' states of the United States, where racial segregation has been an accepted way of life for hundreds of years and where integration is now making slow progress. Includes interviews with Blacks and Whites in different parts of the southern United States - South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi - and also features some actuality films of some of the situations that are encountered every day in the south, such as a Black couple being refused admission to a movie theatre."
