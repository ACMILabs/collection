        "Details the moving of the township of Adaminaby from its old site, soon to be flooded by the rising waters of Lake Eucumbene, to a new location six miles away. The building of the huge Adaminaby dam across the Eucumbene River to form Lake Eucumbene, the heart of the scheme, faced the Authority with the choice of either buying out the residents or moving their town. After consultation a new town was laid out and the houses moved, at times under unusually difficult conditions. Historic churches were demolished and reconstructed; a new shopping centre built; trees planted and a garden competition organised. Within two years the entire town was re-established, the diversion tunnel closed and the water began to rise over the old town."
