        "Shows application of Work Study methods. The main example is the assembly of governor elements for diesel fuel injection pumps. Reveals how a job is analysed on a two-handed chart. The film digresses to demonstrate the principles of Motion Economy shown under laboratory conditions at the Work Study School of the College of Aeronautics. The film shows how special fixtures and bench designs were fashioned, and the worker trained in the new methods. Stresses that the human factor must always be understood in Work Study."
