        "Episode number 1 of Series \"What Do You Think\". First in a series of discussion-provoking subjects, this film shows how one person's judgment might reasonably run counter to the majority opinion. This is illustrated in a high-school classroom where a campaign is under way to raise funds for a school project. One student, although he believes in the cause, withholds his support because he disapproves of the high-pressure methods which put individuals on the spot if they are unable to or do not wish to contribute. The audience is asked for their appraisal."
