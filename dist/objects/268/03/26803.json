        "Demonstrates the technique of \"progressive\" fire line construction. Considers the organisation of the crew, arrangement of tools, instruction and use of an untrained crew to help fight a fire. Shows men working on a fire line, pointing out that lines can be too well defined; illustrates mopping up operations and compares the line method of fire fighting with older methods."
