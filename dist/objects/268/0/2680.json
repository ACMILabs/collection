    "description": [
        "\"In ... Tangara, Gladwell enacts a new vein-popping trick sans skateboard (though he still wears dungarees and Vans sneakers). In the video - named for the type of train on which the piece was filmed - Gladwell hangs upside down from the central handrail of the train cabin. The camera has also been inverted and the footage plays in slow motion so it looks like Gladwell is hanging onto the rail to stop floating ceiling-ward. Apparently, he has done away with gravity - skaters' nemesis - and is literally space walking - space walking back-side. (Though, as his face turns red, his veins pop and he changes grip, we sense he risks dropping back to gnarly reality).\" (Simon Rees, Sherman Galleries)"
