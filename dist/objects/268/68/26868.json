        "Believing that people want to feel, hear and become involved in art, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, and its sister museums created \"Options\" - an exhibit meant to be touched and played with. It is a new approach to contemporary museums, involving more than just passive looking. The roving camera explores the reactions of the participants, and through the use of fast cuts, unusual angles and electronic music, the film becomes as involving an experience as the exhibit itself. Narrated by Ken Nordine."
