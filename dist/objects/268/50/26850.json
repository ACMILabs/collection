        "Shows how a young singer during three years at the opera school of the Royal Conservatory of Music, Toronto, prepares for an operatic career. The film follows the progress of Marie Burton (played by Marguerite Gignac) from the time she first appears for audition until she rises to a leading role in the annual opera festival. The enthusiastic dedication to music by the youghful aspirants is caught by the camera, in school and out. Excerpts from operas are heard throughout the film, and the final section presents part of a full-dress performance of Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" in English."
