        "Two different approaches to the problem of educating mentally handicapped children. The first is based on the premise that the children need guidance in personality development as well as basic educational skills, in order that they may gain an identity, and thus an idea of their place in society. The second approach involves perfecting certain skills through structured programs, in the belief that the individual will develop as he masters skills Suitable for tertiary/teacher level."
