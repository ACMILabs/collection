        "Traces the history of our numerals and system of mathematics. Numerals originated in India, spread to Arabia where Algebra was first conceived and then to Greece. Pythagoras and Archimedes added their contributions, and in the middle ages mathematics was introduced to the Universities of Spain. Merchants rapidly disseminated the new international language throughout Europe. Scientific development, the basis of our modern age owes everything to the principles of mathematics. Animation by Grete Maday, Janos Mata and Marcell Jankovics."
