        "RAAF jets circle the world in four weeks. Flying from Amberley, Queensland, to refuel in Fiji; seeing the color of Hawaii and its war cemetry. Air force bases in California, Bermuda, Malta are visited on the journey to Lagos, Nigeria, where colorful Independence celebrations attended by Princess Alexandra take place. After a week the men fly home buying gifts at Aden, seeing palm trees at Cocos Islands, passing over Perth in formation, and back to Amberley."
