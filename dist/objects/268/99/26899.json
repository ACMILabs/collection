        "Uses Racine, Wisconsin, USA to symbolically depict the tragedy of the 75,000 who die needlessly of cancer each year. Shows how Racine becomes a silent city without life. Illustrates the contrast between a cycle of orderly growth and nature unruly and without order. Emphasises the cases of seven people to portray the seven danger signals of cancer."
