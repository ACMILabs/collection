        "In New Zealand open plan generally refers to a style of building designed to accommodate open education methods. The film is set in one room with four teachers and 120 children between the ages of five and seven years. The children work in various groupings, or by themselves, in small reading groups, and in team teaching situations. Dancing and singing are also shown. The four teachers tell how they work together, and discuss the problems they strike, and the advantages they see in the system. Suitable for teacher/tertiary levels."
