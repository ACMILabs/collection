        "Ian Dunlop revisits the small Aboriginal township of Yirrkala on the Gove Peninsula. As a solution to the encroachment of NABALCO's mining interests on to traditional Aboriginal land, the people are setting up homeland centres where they can live a traditional way of life. Their development is co-ordinated and supported by the outstation movement headquarters in Yirrkala. Dunlop visits the established settlement of Baniyala, homeland of the Madarrpa clan and observes the pattern of life here and the establishment of a new centre across the bay."
