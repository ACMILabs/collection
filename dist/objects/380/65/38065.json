        "The filmed journey of six Aboriginal teenagers as they travel from the southern urbanised areas of Australia, where memories of tribal life are disappearing, to the wild north of Australia in search of the traditional ways of their people. The Dreamtime Rainbow Serpent is their symbolic guide as they follow its epic tracks from Ayers Rock, north through Arnhem Land and across the sea to Melville Island."
