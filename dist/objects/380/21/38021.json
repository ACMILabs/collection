        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". For every animal the name of the game is survival. In order to achieve this all animals have inbuilt reflexes or ready made reactions to threats and fixed action patterns such as migration. In addition animals have, to a lesser or greater degree, a capacity to learn from experience. In this program Philip Zimbardo looks at different theories of learning, from Pavlov's classical conditioning, Thorndike's instrumental conditioning to B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning. Includes archival film of classical experiments."
