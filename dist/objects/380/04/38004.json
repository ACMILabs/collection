        "Four more exciting episodes about the remarkable Twist family in their lighthouse home. 1.\"Sloppy Jalopy\" - When Pete lands in the middle of a sea of polluted sludge from Mr Gribble's waste disposal unit, even showers will not wash off the putrid smell. 2.\"Smelly Feet\" - Bronson upsets Ms James by refusing to attend her birthday party, but the real reason has something to do with the fact that he has not taken his shoes off for 6 months. 3.\"Grandma's Gifts\" - When Linda hears a strange and terrible sound behind the wall, she is convinced it is connected to the lemon tree sprouting fruit, but only Nell knows the true reason. 4.\"Ice Maiden\" - Besotted with Dad's sculpture of Ice Maiden, Bronson resolves to save it from his red-haired cousin, Terry. Based on stories by Paul Jennings."
