        "Episode number 20 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". In this episode, Philip Zimbardo of Stanford University, shows how far our subjective view of reality forms the foundation of most of our social behaviour and how people develop beliefs to make sense of the world around them. Jane Elliot's 1968 experiment in artificially generating discrimination in a class of third grade students is shown. By dividing the class into superior \"blue-eyes\" and inferior \"brown-eyes\" she showed how easily objective reality can be distorted."
