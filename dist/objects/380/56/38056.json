        "Aboriginal artists, Paddy Garrol Tjungarrayi and Dinni Nolan Tjampatimpa, demonstrate the making of a sandpainting - a traditional art form intended to be impermanent. The paintings are made in a ritual manner and then destroyed as they are danced upon during a corroboree. Shows the adaptation of western technology by the Papunya people to this traditional art form."
