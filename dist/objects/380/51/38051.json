        "Hello Australia is a series to develop better understanding of the English language and mainstream Australian culture and customs. Episodes 1 & 2 consist of short dramatisations of everyday situations involving the law regarding compulsory schooling until 15, sending notes to teachers when students are absent from school, Adult Migrant Education Services to improve English and therefore employment prospects in Australia, and learning English on the job. Featuring Rod Quantock as Dr Know and hosted by Kay Stammers and SBS newsreader, George Donikian."
