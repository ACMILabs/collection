        "Episode number 24 of Series \"Psychology: the study of human behavior\". Human beings are social animals. We live in groups and are influenced by others. Social psychology is interested in how people affect each other, in the individual in the context of the group. In particular the program looks at how stereotyping allows us to make immediate, albeit rough, assumptions about how a person may behave so that we may react appropriately. However the same process of stereotyping can lead to prejudice and bias which may in turn lead to small or large scale conflict."
