        "Episode of Series \"A Dreamtime story\". In this imaginative reconstruction of an Aboriginal legend, Ulamina, the selfish Starfish man will not share his canoe which allows him access to the rich fishing grounds of an offshore island. Bangura resolves to teach him a lesson and gains his trust to the point where he can steal his canoe. Ulamina pursues him, but as he cannot swim he is transformed into a starfish. Bangura himself has now broken nature's law by stealing the canoe, which overturns and drowns him, becoming a rock in the process. Narrated by Belzah Lowah."
