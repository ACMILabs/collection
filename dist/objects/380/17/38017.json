        "A longitudinal study of three Adelaide girls, now 18, intercut with footage from \"Smokes and lollies\", shot when they were 14. Their previous expectations have been altered by the experiences of marriage, parenthood, employment, low incomes and insecurity. However, they remain optimistic, with their humour intact. (Awards: Winner, Best Australian Educational Short Film, Australian Teachers of Media (ATOM) Awards, 1982)"
