        "Somerset Maugham himself introduces these adaptations of his short stories. \"The Facts of Life\": a highly entertaining story about a young man's trip to Monte Carlo, where he ignores his father's parting advice, and emerges from the experience better off. \"The Alien Corn\": a young man (Dirk Bogarde) is determined to become a concert pianist, despite his parents' objections. \"The Kite\": Herbert's marriage falls apart because of his obsession with flying kites. \"The Colonel's Lady\": a stuffy retired colonel is baffled by the discovery that his wife has a reputation as a passionate poetess."
