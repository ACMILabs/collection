        "Episode of Series \"Encounters\". Looks at why Aboriginal people feel so strongly about their struggle for land rights. Filmed mainly at Noonkanbah, the scene of bitter Aboriginal demonstrations of 1980, the program looks at what Aboriginal people are now doing to preserve their traditional way of life. Tribal Aboriginals explain their bond with the land and put their views on white society."
