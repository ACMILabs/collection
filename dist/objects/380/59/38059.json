        "Earlier this century, Aboriginal stockmen were the backbone of the cattle industry throughout much of Australia. Bob Massey Pootchemunka has spent most of his life as a stockman and drover, and now over 75, his ambition is to see an all-Aboriginal cattle station operating at Ti-Tree, where he and his relatives recently returned to live on their traditional clan land. Bob's dream includes his nephew Eric, an experienced stockman as the station manager, and Eric's son, Ian, as a future stockman. \"Three Horsemen\" is about the persistence of ideals from an important phase in Aboriginal history, and the formidable difficulties three people face in fulfilling them."
