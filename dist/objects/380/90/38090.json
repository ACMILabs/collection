        "Episode number 4 of Series \"The dream machine\". Pioneers of \"Artificial Intelligence\" have reasoned that computers, like brains, are capable of manipulating ideas. However, efforts to simulate human thought in machines has been hindered by complexities such as ambiguous language and the process of acquiring knowledge and common sense. This program traces the complexities that have been encountered since 1958 when Marvin Minsky and John McArthy set up a department at M.I.T dealing with Artificial Intelligence."
