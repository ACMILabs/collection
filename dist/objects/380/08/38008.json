        "Episode of Series \"A Dreamtime story\". In this imaginative interpretation of an Aboriginal creation myth, the spirits, Baime and Yhi breathe life into the planet Earth, creating plants and animals. However the animals quarrel, causing the Earth to split, releasing the evil spirit Marmoo, who destroys Baime and Yhi's creation with fire. Baime punishes Marmoo by turning him into a snake. New forests grow from surviving seeds and the animals return but without Baime's spirit, which he now breathes into his last creations, Man and Woman. Narrated by Bill Lowah."
