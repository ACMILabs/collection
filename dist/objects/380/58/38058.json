        "Episode of Series \"The World about us\". A video about the paintings produced by the Papunya Aboriginal people, some 200 miles from Alice Springs. Looking like twentieth century abstracts, the paintings use an extremely complex symbolic language that relates to religious ceremonies. Some of them are outstandingly beautiful. All reveal the richness of desert Aboriginal life and culture. Shows the lives of the painters and their families, desert nomads who are being forced to come to terms with the realities of white technology, economics and values."
