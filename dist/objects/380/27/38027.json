        "Episode of Series \"Quantum\". In this short segment from Quantum, we are shown the unique stone-age technology of quartz cutting, developed by the Australian Aborigines some 20,000 years ago. The technique for cutting quartz is quite different and more sophisticated than that used for flint and had to be invented here, although it was a skill later discarded by the Aborigines."
