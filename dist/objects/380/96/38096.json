        "Two-time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon is brilliant as Joe Clay, a public relations man who considers himself to be a social drinker but socialising is the mainstay of his work. The sweet Kirsten (played by Lee Remick) marries him and starts drinking to keep him company. This film searingly portrays the couple's downward spiral into alcoholic oblivion. A powerful script and unforgettable acting lend believability to this poignant, heart-rending story. Nominated for five Oscars and receiving one for the haunting title song, the film also co-stars Jack Klugman and boasts music by Henry Mancini. Originally a teleplay by J. P. Miller."
