        "Episode number 22 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". Therapy to treat mental illness can be divided into two main areas - biomedical therapy and psychological therapy. Biomedical therapy is usually administered by psychiatrists and neurosurgeons and involves physical intervention in the form of psychosurgery (eg. lobotomy), ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy) and drug therapy. Psychological therapy, in contrast, concentrates on changing behaviour, attitudes and our thoughts. It includes psychodynamic/psychoanalytic techniques, behaviourism, cognitive therapy, humanistic therapy and family or couple therapy. Philip Zimbardo examines all these forms of therapy in this program which also features Dr Albert Ellis and Dr Rollo May."
