        "Episode of Series \"The Australian ark\". Aboriginal man is now known to have come to Australia at least 40,000 years ago, maybe even 50,000 years ago. Leading anthropologists, including Norman Tindale, John Mulvaney, Richard Wright and Bob Edwards explain their finds, including a 30,000 year old skull of a cremated woman at Lake Mungo, the Kow Swamp excavation of skeletons which resemble Java man, the 20,000 year old wall markings of the Koonalda Cave and the strange engraved stone faces of the Cleland Hills."
