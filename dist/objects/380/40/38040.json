        "Episode of Series \"Aboriginal legends\". A serpent with an enormous appetite, Inganarr, ate all the people of North Goulburn Island and then proceeded to eat the people of Arnhem Land. Fortunately Inganarr suffered from indigestion due to his gluttony and the tribespeople poured out of his mouth in droves. This helps to explain why there are people in eastern Arnhem Land but no people in western Arnhem Land. This film is also available as a compilation film entitled Aboriginal legends no. 3. Suitable for middle and upper primary level."
