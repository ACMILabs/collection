        "Episode of Series \"Travel, Travel\". The video takes us on a detailed journey of the two jewels of Central Europe: Budapest and Prague. We start off in Budapest and travel the historic walls of the city that is nourished by the beautiful Danube River. Travelling outside the city we are shown Hungary's world-famous mineral springs that for centuries have seen visits by European royalty and artists. In the second half of the video we see the sights of Prague in Czechoslovakia, arguably one of the most visually aesthetic of cities on the planet. We visit famous castles and galleries, as well as take walks around the surrounding beauty of the Bohemian countryside."
