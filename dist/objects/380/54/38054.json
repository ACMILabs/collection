        "Bob Maza tells the Aboriginal legend of the giant frog, Tiddalik who drank all the water in the land, making a desert. The distraught animals got together and tried to make him laugh, which they finally did, so that the water poured out of him. Bob Maza uses simple stick puppets and colourful backdrops, which could easily be copied, to illustrate the legend."
