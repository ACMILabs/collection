        "Episode number 25 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". In this penultimate episode in the series, Philip Zimbardo looks at the discipline of psychology in terms of reconciling opposites, in the same way as the yin and yang of Eastern philosophy. These include nature and nurture, brain and mind, conditioned responses and behavioural freedom, life span development from infancy to old age, the power and the fallibility of the mind and our role as individuals and as group members. Yet in spite of all the advances in psychological knowledge this century, we can still only suggest the complexity of human nature."
