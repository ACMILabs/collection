        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". The diversity of remote Aboriginal tribes is vast and complex. Between them they speak fifty languages, live in 1,000 communities and number some 54,000 people. This program looks at some of the ways these communities have related to white society. Some communities live a superficially western style of life, yet cling to their tribal laws and customs. Others have developed social problems such as alcoholism by discarding their traditional lifestyles, some have returned to a traditional life-style and yet others are using western technology, such as radio broadcasting to reinforce and spread their own culture."
