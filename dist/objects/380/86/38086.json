        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". A documentary made in response to Arabic community concern at the relatively high level of academic failure amongst Arab-Australian youth. The video explores the initial inadequacy of the Australian education system to deal with young people from an Islamic background, and who were often refugees. In the last few years Language Centres have been set up to assist newly arrived migrant youth to integrate into the mainstream education system, but the video points out the importance of Arabic-speaking teachers in the school environment, to act as a point of liaison between parents and students. One of the greatest difficulties for Arabic-Australians is the conflict between a family home which stresses tradition and community responsibility, and a peer and social environment which values individual freedom."
