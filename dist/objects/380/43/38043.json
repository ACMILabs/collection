        "Episode of Series \"Rand McNally video visit trips\". Tricia Springer takes you on a tour of three exotic ports of call in the Caribbean. Behind the picture postcard beauty of Bermuda is an island filled with activity, and British tradition. Turquoise waters and natural beauty await you in the Bahamas, which has a vital night life of discos, casinos and Las Vegas style shows. Jamaica is truly West Indian and is permeated by the calypso and reggae beats. Included are bonus tips on getting there, accommodation, food, special events, clothing and climate."
