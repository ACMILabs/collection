        "The wine industries of Australia and New Zealand are producing wines of world class quality. To discover just how we are achieving this phenomenal success, we visit major wine growing areas in the two countries to hear from the growers and winemakers, followed by wine-tasting segments with Michael Hill-Smith, Australia's only \"Master of wine\". The areas visited are: the Hunter Valley and Mudgee, North-eastern Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and New Zealand. Introduced by Len Evans."
