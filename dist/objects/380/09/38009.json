        "Episode number 1 of Series \"When the war came to Australia\". Although Australians rushed to support Britain in her war with Germany, it was not until Tobruk that Australians at home really cared about the war, and not until Dunkirk that they took Hitler seriously. Mothers and wives left at home take up the traditional supporting roles and the Women's Services are formed, but soon the daily casualty lists begin to appear and the heartbreak and dread begin. Personal recollections, rare archival footage and the music of the time combine to create an evocative and haunting picture of this unique period in Australia's history."
