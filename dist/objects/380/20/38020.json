        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". It is more than twenty five years since Aborigines were granted equal rights, but in that time the conditions in which they live have barely changed, and in many instances, because of the introduction of alcohol into their communities, their situation has become more hopeless. The appalling statistics on Aboriginal health - a male life expectancy less than that of Bangladesh, the highest risk of death by murder in the world, are a disgrace to Australia, and whilst there are those who care, there seems to be little hope for the future as whites and blacks alike despair of any easy solution. Paul Barry and the Four Corners team table this generally pessimistic report."
