        "As the hunters return from their hunt, the tribe gathers around the fire to hear stories of the Dreamtime. In this story Marmoo, the Evil one tries to abduct two children and make them his slaves, but after a long chase they are rescued by the Winjarning Brothers, spirits from the heavens, who defeat Marmoo in an epic battle of minds which leaves Marmoo as an ant which then dies. An imaginative recreation of this Aboriginal legend, narrated by Belza Lowah."
