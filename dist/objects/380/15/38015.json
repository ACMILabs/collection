        "A non-narrated presentation on the theme of flight. A young girl is befriended by an older woman who spends many hours sketching the world around her. Together they begin to explore their common interest in flight, noting those things in the environment that propel themselves through the air. As well as presenting a positive and caring relationship between the young girl and the older woman the program highlights many ideas for art, craft work and language development."
