        "The year is 1900 and sheepfarmer Wally King is given the rights to territory in the Australian outback. He sets out with his family to claim the land, but having made the hazardous 600 mile journey through wilderness, they find that the \"permanent water\" - Bitter Springs - is home to a tribe of aborigines who will not move away. A violent struggle develops between tribesmen and the white settlers which can only be resolved when the white man's gun is replaced by compromise. For its time, this film was notably liberal in balancing the point of view of encroaching European settlers with Aboriginal claims for land rights. Starring Tommy Trinder, Chips Rafferty, Gordon Jackson, Jean Blue, Michael Pate, Charles Tingwell, Nonnie Piper, Nicky Yardley and Henry Murdock."
