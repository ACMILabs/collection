        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". Five years ago the small township of Aurukun on the west coast of Cape York, introduced a canteen which sold alcohol. In addition to the canteen the sly grog trade has also been allowed to flourish. Since then the level of violent crime and alcoholism has increased dramatically, destroying the Aboriginal community and ruining the future of the children. In 1991 the local council elections became a contest between the Drys, mostly women, and the Wets, led by those interested in profit, with the victory overwhelmingly going to the women. David Marr reports on the problems of this small community which mirror those of many such communities around Australia."
