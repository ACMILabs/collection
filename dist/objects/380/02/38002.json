        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Geographically, Argentina (which is Spanish for \"silver\") is the eighth largest country in the world. This colourful guided tour takes us through the highlights of Argentina's landscape and history. From chilly Tierra del Fuego, the country's southern-most region, to Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in the western hemisphere. Much of the program is devoted to the sweeping plains of Patagonia, home of the Argentinian cowboy - the gaucho. The video also introduces us to Argentinian wildlife, the beaches of Mar del Plata, the world's only growing glacier, Perito Mereno and the sights and nightspots of Buenos Aires."
