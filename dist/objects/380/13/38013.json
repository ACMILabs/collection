        "Episode of Series \"Four corners (Television program)\". Aboriginal health is notoriously bad, including high rates of alcoholism, infant mortality and leprosy, a disease which has almost disappeared from the western world. The program looks at ways the Aborigines are beginning to take control of their own health services, ultimately hoping to combine western medicine with their own bush remedies and holistic approach to the issue of health. Chris Masters reports on some of the initiatives, successful and unsuccessful, to blend the two."
