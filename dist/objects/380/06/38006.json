        "Five more exciting episodes of life with the Twist family in their lighthouse home. 1.\"Next Time Around\" - Linda hypnotises Peter, so every time someone says \"now\", Peter behaves like a chicken. Pete is soon in serious trouble when Linda can't undo the hypnosis. 2.\"Copy Cat\" - Bronson finds an ancient Mongolian cat hat and Linda takes advantage of its magical qualities to win the Birdman competition. 3. \"Little Squirt\" - Bronson is the humiliated loser in the school peeing competition, but a magic water spirit helps him prove he is no \"little squirt\". 4.\"Pink Bow Tie\" - When Peter, Gribble, Rabbit and Tiger witness an \"age-rager\" in use, the result does not impress their school principal. 5.\"Nails\" - When a new boy, who never removes his gloves, comes to school, Linda earns his trust and learns his secret. Based on the stories by Paul Jennings."
