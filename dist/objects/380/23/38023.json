        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". The relationship between brain and behaviour is reciprocal. Although our behaviour is influenced by the brain, the brain can also be changed, quite literally, by behaviour. Philip Zimbardo takes, as examples of this change, the need for touch in infants, the lack of which can lead to impaired physical and mental development, and the effects of stress on our ability to learn and to grow."
