        "This Aboriginal myth, based on Albert Karloan's version as told to Professor Berndt 1939-40, belongs to the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia. It tells how Ngurunderi formed the landscape and the wildlife from the junction of the Murray Darling Rivers to Kangaroo Island where he left the world to become a bright star in the Milky Way. The Dreaming is re-enacted in the actual location it describes."
