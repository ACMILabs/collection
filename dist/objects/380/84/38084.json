        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Aboriginal Australians have a special bond with their dogs, partly due to their traditional role in assisting in the hunt, and partly because they are part of the Dreamtime and related ceremonies. The Aborigines are therefore extremely reluctant to put down unhealthy dogs, so when it was discovered that a simple injection of a new drug restored their health, and with it, the health of the Aborigines themselves, particularly in relation to skin diseases and stomach upsets, the solution was welcomed by black communities and white authorities alike."
