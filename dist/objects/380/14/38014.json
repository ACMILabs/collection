        "A science fiction story about two children who crash land their spacecraft on an unknown planet. They are captured by a wizard who rules over a lifeless land. As the story evolves the youngsters realise that the wizard, in his own way, is also a prisoner. A conflict between the protagonists leads to the wizard's discovery of music and harmony, which ultimately prove to be the keys that spring the trap."
