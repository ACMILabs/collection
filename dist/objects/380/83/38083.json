        "An impressionistic account of the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke's, 1988 visit to the Barunga Festival in remote Northern Territory. Thousands of Aboriginal people travel to this, the largest Aboriginal sports and cultural festival in Australia. In this particular year Mr. Hawke received a petition from the Aboriginal people for recognition of their rights, and in turn he pledged the drawing up of a treaty between black and white Australia. This treaty has yet to be made."
