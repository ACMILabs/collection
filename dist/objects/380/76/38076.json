        "What this video lacks in glamorous production values, it more than makes up for in practical tips to negotiate the salary package you want from your employer. The program is in two segments, the first presented by Judy Rose who is experienced in negotiation skills. The second segment is presented by Mike Taylor of Prime Time Financial Counsellors who gives sound financial advice on options within salary packages. Produced for the Australian Institute of Training and Development."
