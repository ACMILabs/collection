        "Part 4 of the innovative film \"Two laws\", on the Borroloola people's struggle for the recognition of Aboriginal law. Aborigines actively collaborated with the filmmakers in determining the form of the film. This part describes the present movement by the Aboriginal people back to traditional land, the assertion of ceremonial practice and the setting up of cattle out-stations. The other parts of the film are: \"Police times\", \"Welfare times\" and \"Struggle for our land\". Made with the assistance of the Australian Film Commission."
