        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Discovering psychology\". How do we make decisions? What effect does the group have on our judgment? What mistakes do we commonly make in negotiation? Every day of our lives we make decisions, and generally we feel that we are good at it. However real life experience and psychological experiment has shown that we often make decisions in a totally irrational manner. Philip Zimbardo, with the help of experts in the field, explores the psychology of decision making, reason and negotiation."
