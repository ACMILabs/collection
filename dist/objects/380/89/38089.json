        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The dream machine\". Explores the technological developments and the innovative research that paved the way for the Personal Computer Revolution of the 80's. Focuses on the role hobbyists such as Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak (Co-founders of Apple Computer Company) played in making computers accessible with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Examines the failure of companies such as Xerox and IBM to recognise potential markets outside the business and science arena and their failure to commercialise research discoveries in the 60's and 70's. Looks at the impact of PC's and their extensive applications in today's society and considers the endless possibilities for the future."
