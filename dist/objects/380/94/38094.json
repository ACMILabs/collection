        "Blood-borne pathogens are microorganisms which can cause disease. They can be found in infected blood and bodily fluids. Diseases which can be spread by blood-borne pathogens include malaria and syphilis, but today, the most common are Hepatitis B and AIDS. This program gives clear, practical information on what blood-borne pathogens are, how they can (and can't) be transmitted, what you can do to reduce the risk of transmission in the workplace, and how to minimise risk if you are exposed to a blood-borne pathogen due to an accident. Made with the support of the Infection Control Department, Fairfield Hospital."
