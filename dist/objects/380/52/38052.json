        "Part 1 of a 4-part innovative film entitled \"Two laws\" which deals with the Borroloola people's struggle for the recognition of Aboriginal law. This part looks at Borroloola in the 1930's, dramatically reconstructing a conflict there between Aboriginal people, new white settlers and police in 1933. The other parts of the film are: \"Welfare times\", \"Struggle for our land\" and \"Living with two laws\"."
