        "Shayne Mooney interviews four men with two things in common - they are all gay and HIV positive. Two of the men, Colin (27), a photographer, and Ian, were filmed in the final stages of their lives. Peter Charlton and Chris Carter, political researcher, were HIV positive but had not then developed AIDS. The four men discuss how the illness has affected their lives, the discrimination they have experienced and how they have come to terms with the prospect of death with the help of AIDS support workers. It is an inspirational program that shows the triumph of the human spirit over suffering and death."
