        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". Up to 60% of refugees to Australia have experienced torture. Through interviews with survivors of torture, and by interviewing health workers and activists committed to supporting torture victims, we gain insight into the psychological, physical and emotional damage inflicted on people by organised state terrorism. \"Bent not broken\" is a compassionate and non- exploitative study of torture and trauma survivors in Australia and the video details the efforts of individuals and community organisations to address the needs of refugees coming to terms with past experiences of violence."
