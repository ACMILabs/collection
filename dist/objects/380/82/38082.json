        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". The Australian Aboriginals connection to the land and to his sacred sites has often been misunderstood by white Australia. With the help of the Aborigines from Gilwi Community, near Timber Creek, Northern Territory, Bob Ellis of the Sacred Sites Authority and spokesmen from the Northern Land Council, this program clearly explains what sacred sites are, the aboriginal concept of land tenure and how development by white Australia is managed in the Northern Territory through a mandatory consultation process, set down in the Aboriginal Land Rights Act."
