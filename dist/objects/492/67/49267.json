        "The erosion of a longtime lesbian affair between a television star (Beryl Reid) who plays the role of \"Sister George\" the bleeding heart heroine on a British TV soap opera and her younger lover (Susannah York). The breakup of the relationship comes about when a broadcast executive who fancies the younger woman, decides to write Reid out of her key TV role. The basic thrust of the plot is the gradual development of a rapport and sympathy with Reid, in inverse ratio to the loss of respect for York. The film received an X rating on its release due to a controversial five-minute lesbian love scene. Director Robert Aldrich achieved the look and feel of a \"Made in Britain\" picture, although most of it was shot near downtown LA. Cast also includes Carol Browne, Ronald Fraser, Patricia Medina and Hugh Paddick. Screenplay by Lukas Heller from the play by Frank Marcus."
