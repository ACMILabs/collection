        "Good vs Evil is the main theme of this Polish drama. In a 17th century convent, mother superior becomes possessed by the devil. Numerous priests are called in to try and exorcise the demon, yet they fail and almost all the other nuns become possessed. A young priest is called to help with the exorcism and during his first meeting with the convent head, Mother Joan of the Angels, he becomes besotted by her and desires her body and soul, vowing to do anything to prove himself worthy of her love, including murder. One of the first Polish films post following the second World War that does not deal with the subject of war. (Awards: Winner of the Jury Special Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1961). In Polish with English subtitles."
