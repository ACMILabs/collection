        "An epic costume drama set in ancient Egyptian times during the reign of Pharaoh Ramses XIII (Jerzy Zelnik), who, in defiance of tradition, assumed command of the military - a post usually occupied by priests. The story tells of the battle which consequently ensued between Ramses and his followers and the power driven priests. Based on the novel by Boleslaw Prus and starring Wieslaw Mazurkiewicz, Barbara Brylska, Krystyna Mikolajewska, Ewa Krzyzanowska, Jerzy Buczacki, Leszek Herdegen. Photography by Jerzy Wojcik. (Awards: Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film in 1967 Oscars and Golden Palm in 1966 Cannes Film Festival) NOTE: Colour appears to be faded."
