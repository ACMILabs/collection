        "This is a film of epic proportions somewhat reminiscent to \"Doctor Zhivago\" in its grandness, its breathtaking scenery, superb cinematography (Jerzy Wojcik), evocative images and a fine cast of actors. Based on the Nobel prize-winning novel by author Henryk Sienkiewicz, \"The Deluge\" takes place in 17th century Poland, during the Polish-Swedish War (1655-1660) with the central plot revolving around the intense and often stormy love affair between the main character, Andrzej Kmicic (Daniel Olbrychski), a noble man and a soldier often erratic in temperament, and Olenka (Malgorzata Braunek) a young gentlewoman of strong beliefs and convictions who will over the course of their relationship, be forced to question the morality of the war and Andrzej's involvement in it. Shot on location in Poland in many of the ancient and historic castles and accompanied by an original muscial score (by Kazimierz Serocki) which enhances and adds depth to the story, this is a war film with a difference. The myriad of characters representing all walks of life, from the peasants to the aristocracy, through to the soldiers in battle, weave in and out of the story adding a sense of realism and involvement for the onlooker. \"Potop\" was nominated for Best Foreign Film in the 1974 Academy Awards. Cast also includes Tadeusz Lomnicki, Kazimierz Wichniarz, Wladyslaw Hancza, Leszek Teleszynski. WARNING: The English subtitles are often out of sync, and sometimes too fast to read."
