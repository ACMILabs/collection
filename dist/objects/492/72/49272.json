        "The nature of religion in Australia is changing. Over the last 200 years, millions of immigrants have brought to Australia a great range of religious traditions. Since 1946, that diversity has increased all the more rapidly. All the major religious traditions of the world may now be found in Australia. At the same time, several other trends are evident. Australians are making choices about their spirituality in ways they have never done before. They are trying out the variety of options found in Australia, and drawing on the various resources. Many have detached themselves from specific religious organisations, but most continue to value the spiritual dimension of life and put together their own sense of spirituality and meaning. There is new awareness of the spiritual heritage of the Aboriginal people particularly in relationship to the land. This CD-ROM explores the world of faiths and meaning and includes all the major religions plus many of the lesser known, smaller alternative religions. It will help you explore your own traditions and background, the heritages of your neighbours and friends, and Australian history and the dynamics of contemporary society."
