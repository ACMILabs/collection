        "Featuring Pat the Cat, this rather clever film produced by the US Alcohol and Drug Foundation focuses on the damage caused by excess drinking and the availability of help and support through the Recovery Center. Pat the Cat starts drinking to excess, tries other substances, ignores his friends' advice, crashes his car and is finally referred for recovery. Narrated by Julie Harris."
