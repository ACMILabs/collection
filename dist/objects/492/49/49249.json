        "Bordered by Finland, Norway and the Baltic Sea, Sweden is a land rich with cultural heritage, spectacular scenery, a coastline dotted with islands and inlets, farm lands, wilderness and snow-covered mountains. Its northern reaches lies above the arctic circle, in a place known as Lapland where the indigenous peoples, the Sami, still carry on some of the traditional ways including herding and breeding reindeer. This video takes you on a journey from Stockholm, Sweden's capital city also known as the Venice of the north, to Goteberg, Sweden's second largest city and the gateway to the shipping world, the fijord country of fishing villages and harbours, glacial lakes, and fir-tree covered mountains and forests, and to the wild, harsh but breathtaking landscape of Lapland. Includes informative and interesting anecdotes by the Swedes about their country, customs and lifestyle. Narrated by Richard Stranberg."
