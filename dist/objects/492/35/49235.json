        "A historical glimpse of Britain using archival film from a collection of old film clips from widely different sources which represents and reflects some of the long forgotten images of life in Britain from the early 1930's to the 1960's. Includes footage of Britain in wartime, royal visits, traditional fairs and other celebrations of a bygone era. Most of the footage comes from amateur filmmakers around Great Britain. Narrated by Chris Champion."
