        "The collaboration that took place between John Boorman and Lee Marvin on two films- 'Point Blank' (1967) and 'Hell in the Pacific' (1968) led to a mutual admiration and close friendship between the two men that lasted for nearly 20 years until Marvin's death in 1987. This documentary records Boorman's personal quest to understand the man who had such a profound effect on his own life and work. It includes interviews with William Hurt, Jim Jarmusch and Marvin's widow, Pamela."
