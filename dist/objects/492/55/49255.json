        "This video documents the first 'Stories and songs of the people' event held in Australia at the Forum theatre, Melbourne in 1999. This event was organised by \"grass roots\" community and gave the opportunity for many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal artists to express a collective future through music. It's aim was to create a cultural and educational exchange with other Indigenous groups from around the globe. bearing in mind similarities which exist between some Indigenous peoples, eg the Native American and the Australian Aborigine's colonisation and dispossession, their traditional links to the land and the loss of their identity. Music is seen as a healing process towards reconciliation. Performing artists include Frankie Yamma, Peter Rotumah, Deb Morrow, Kelli Howell, Neil Murray & Stephen Teakle, Shane Howard, Illana Atkinson, Tom E. Lewis, Tiffany Eckardt & Dave Steel, Nick larkins, Lee Morgan, Russell Smith, Malcolm Jagamuarra and visiting Native American artist Johnnie Aseron. Video support notes included."
