        "Howard Hawks has been hailed as the quintessential auteur due to his mastery of a wide range of genres from screwball comedies, film noir and thrillers to musicals and gangster films. Combining previously unseen home movies, out-takes and other archival footage with interviews with actors and directors including Lauren Bacall, James Caan, Angie Dickinson, Peter Bogdanovich, William Friedkin and Michael Mann, this documentary provides an insight into Hawks' personality and professional achievements. Narrated by Stephen Frears."
