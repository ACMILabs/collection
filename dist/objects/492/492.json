        "'Rise' is a revealing look at the lives contained within a Melbourne Housing Commission estate. Set against the backdrop of a high-rise building, this is a visual account of a largely unknown environment: as the camera moves through the building, a series of portraits unfolds, telling the stories of people from a wide range of cultural backgrounds. In the context of high density living, 'Rise' is a celebration of the individual."
