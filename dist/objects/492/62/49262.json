        "Polish documentary filmmaker Jerzy Hoffman brought an aura of realism to the sweeping historical epic 'Colonel Wolodyjowski', aka Pan Wolodyjowski, an adaptation of the final part of a trilogy of patriotic novels by nobel prize winning Henry Sienkiewicz. Set in the 17th century, this film details the bloody struggle on the Eastern border of Poland at the time of the Turkish invasion. It recounts the legend of Pan Wolodyjowski and his friend Ketling, who, after bitterly defending the Kamieniec Castle against the Turks and upon the declaration of surrender took drastic action to state and resist the dishonour and devastation of the surrender. An adventurous tale of heroism, spectacular duels, everlasting friendships and the nation's past glories and defeats evoked in a patriotic manner for people to identify with the fictitious heroes, and believe in the resurrection of Poland. Very successful in its Polish release, this film made little impact internationally but as an epic representing Polish history and literature it does make its mark. Cast includes Tadeusz Lomnicki, Magdelena Zawadzka and Daniel Olbrychski. In Polish with English subtitles."
