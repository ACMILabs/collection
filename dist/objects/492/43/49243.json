        "An instructional documentary for parents and teachers dealing with left-handed children. In addition to revealing interesting facts about the number of left-handed people in the community, \"Left-handed children\" provides vital tips for a range of activities as diverse as hand writing, using scissors, using a ruler, pencil-sharpening, calligraphy, using a computer keyboard and mouse, tying shoe-laces, craft-work, using kitchen utensils and playing sport. As left-handed children may be more vulnerable to feelings of self-doubt because of their difficulty in adopting 'right-handed' tools and approaches, this documentary is an essential and invaluable guide."
