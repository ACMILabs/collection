        "Gardener Harry Dodson and lecturer Peter Thoday transform a bare garden into a traditional Victorian kitchen garden, using Victorian tools and techniques. While restoring the garden using 19th century varieties of flowers, vegetables and fruit, they explain how Victorian gardeners were able to always provide the house with fresh fruits and vegetables all year around, how they grew exotic fruits, and how they dealt with garden pests."
