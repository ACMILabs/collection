        "This program looks at the evolution of the dog as a companion animal and the adaptions dogs have made from their wolf-like existence as pack animals. We see how they use their keen sense of smell, hearing, and sensitivity to movement, combined with their territorial and protective behaviours in order to coexist happily with their human families."
