        "Episode of Series \"Visions of War\". World War II prisoners of war recall building the infamous narrow-gauge railway through the almost impenetrable, disease infested jungles between Rangoon and Bangkok. Over 116,000 Australians, British, and Dutch lost their lives. Was this infamous railway a military necessity or a monument to brutality? The survivors (including Sir Edward Dunlop) tell a story of courage and resourcefulness in the face of a hostile environment and a ruthless enemy. Rare archival film was used in the compiling of this documentary, including a Japanese propaganda film on the treatment of prisoners of war. Contains some scenes in b&w. Narrated by Gerard Kennedy."
