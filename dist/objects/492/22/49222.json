        "A slapstick silent comedy about the high jinx that occurs at the Rough and Wet Laundry between the laundry clerk and his boss as they struggle to complete their tasks on time. The story ends with disastrous results as the washing tub overflows with hot, soapy water - spilling on to the streets and wreaking havoc. Featuring Stan Laurel, Mark Jones, Eddie Baker, Katherine Grant."
