        "The horse is a paradox - a prey animal who lost his independence and submits to man's enslavement - yet is also a symbol of dignity and freedom. This video looks at man's most noble friend from an entirely new perspective; that of the horse itself. Innovative camera techniques show the world from a horse-eye-view as new research explains why horses behave like they do, allowing the viewer a greater understanding of horses and their behaviour."
