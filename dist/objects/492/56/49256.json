        "A fascinating documentary about Sam Fuller, of one of Hollywood's most illustrious writers and directors. Tim Robbins and director Adam Simon travelled to Paris, where Fuller resided for thirteen years until the mid nineties, to interview him. Through conversations with Fuller the film explores his biographical and stylistic roots and examines the three primary phases of his professional life as a newspaperman, a soldier and as a filmmaker. Observations from Jim Jarmusch, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino and extracts from Fuller's films reveal an extraordinary portrait of one of Hollywood's true mavericks."
