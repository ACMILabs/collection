        "A Cat's World is a fascinating foray into feline behaviour, examining how cats both perceive and react to the world around them by observing these mysterious creatures in domestic situations and in the wild beyond the home. Through the use of innovative camera techniques, the viewer can discover how cat senses function, and learn more about cat behaviour through the interpretation of visual cues."
