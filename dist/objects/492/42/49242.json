        "One of France's most significant and prolific Post-New Wave directors, Andre Techine's films are characterised by their exploration of the complexities of emotion and human relationships. He has collaborated with some of France's most respected actresses, including Catherine Deneuve, Juliette Binoche, Jeanne Moreau, and Isabelle Adjani. In 'Les Voleurs', his fifth film with Deneuve, Techine takes the crime genre and uses it as the framework by which to explore a three-way relationship that deals in abuse, exploitation and suicidal despair- in short, the very darkest aspects of emotional relationships. Alex (Daniel Auteuil) is a sexually-brutal cop who comes from a ruthless family of criminals. Marie (Deneuve), is a middle-aged professor who falls, first with astonishment, and then despairingly, for Juliette (Laurence Cote), a young women on the wrong side of the law who has been having sexual liaisons with Alex. A perilous sexual triangle ensues, with Juliette a pawn in a game that has the highest stakes. In French with English subtitles."
