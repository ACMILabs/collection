        "a free falling body gracefully evades the laws of gravity"
    ], 
    "description": [
        "A body falls gracefully through the air, kilometres from the earth, seeming to hover between falling, then rising again in a fluid dance that suspends and evades gravity. This looping video installation playfully dispels any laws of science as the casually dressed skydiver that we see floating through the air never gets closer to the ground. Moving hypnotically around the camera the body disorients all sense of up and down until at one point it seems to float, buffeted by the air, toward a passing plane."
