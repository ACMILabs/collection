        "One of the most popular British films of the 1960's, \"Zulu\" is based on the true story of the defence of Rorke's Drift in 1879. In this battle, 1200 men of the South Wales Borderers confronted four thousand attacking Zulu warriors. A stunning, historically accurate, battle picture starring the great British actors Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins and Michael Caine in his first screen role. A movie of \"epic\" proportions, the long and bloody battle is depicted in meticulous detail. The Zulus, who had never seen a motion picture, were shown an old Roy Rogers western to assist their performance. The Zulu chief is played by the real-life Chief Buthelezzi."
