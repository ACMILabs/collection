        "Meet the Vanderhofs - the zaniest, happiest family ever to grace the screen. They have a simple philosophy for living \"Nothing is worth doing if you can't enjoy it - and when it's over you can't take it with you\". Head of this eccentric clan is Grandpa, (Lionel Barrymore) who has decided to devote the rest of his life to having fun because he has enough money. Matters become complicated when his granddaughter (Jean Arthur) falls in love with James Stewart, son of a tycoon (Edward Arnold), who wants the Vanderhof property to expand his business. Wholesome, homespun, appealing and touching this screwball Capra comedy won two Academy Awards in 1938 for Best Picture and Best Direction."
