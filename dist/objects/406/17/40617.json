        "Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe star as two FBI agents investigating the murder of three Civil Rights activists in a small Mississippi town in the early 1960's. Parker drew on a real event for inspiration and this acclaimed film is tension filled. The violence and hatred which erupts from racial intolerance is a strong focus and is all the more shocking because it is endorsed and perpertrated by those representing the law. The excellent cast features Frances McDormand as the wife of the corrupt Deputy Sherriff, Stephen Toblowsky as head Klansman Townley and Michael Rooker who gives a chilling performance as the violent Klansman Frank. A strong point of the film's script is the developing relationship between the two FBI men who come from different backgrounds with conflicting ideas. Their relationship evolves from mutual distrust to one of respect, and ultimately their combined forces enable them to reveal the truth about the murders."
