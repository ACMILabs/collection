        "The accent is on fun and fantasy in this version of Jules Verne's classic subterranean adventure. With spectacular visuals as a backdrop, the story centres on an expedition led by Professor Lindenbrook (James Mason) into the earth's core. He is accompanied by his star student (Pat Boone) and a rival's widow (Arlene Dahl). They encounter many dangers and wonders, including giant prehistoric reptiles and a lost city."
