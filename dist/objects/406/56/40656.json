        "Episode number 10 of Series \"Art of the western world\". Peter Paul Rubens absorbed much of the intensity of religious ecstacy and suffering portrayed by the artists working in Italy during the Counter-Reformation, excelling in the texture of flesh. Another master was Diego de Velazquez, reproducing the texture of costly materials - silks, brocades and velvet. Rembrandt's work is examined from the perspective of the artist's self-confidence in his ability to produce master works of art."
