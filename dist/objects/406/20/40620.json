        "Spencer Tracy, Van Johnson and Robert Mitchum in his first leading role star in this classic World War II thriller based on the real-life diary of an American pilot (Ted Lawson) who was involved in the first American air raids on Japan. Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle (Spencer Tracy) is the tough and inspiring mastermind of the historic crew of the \"Ruptured Duck\", commanded by Captain Ted Lawson (Van Johnson). Lawson's daydreams of the bride he left behind are intertwined with the nightmarish terrors of a tense Pacific crossing, thunderous bombings and the fate of his men. This is not only an action filled, emotional, historical saga of the war in the Pacific but also a romantic tale of American patriotism at its best."
