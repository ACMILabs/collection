        "Tom Selleck stars as Matthew Quigley, an American hired gun who answers a \"Help Wanted\" ad and finds himself in Australia. Alan Rickman plays the evil, British cattle rancher who hires Quigley. Quigley refuses the job and is left stranded in the outback with a crazy woman called Cora (Laura San Giacomo). Essentially a western in an outback setting, the film also features Chris Haywood, Tony Bonner and Ben Mendelson."
