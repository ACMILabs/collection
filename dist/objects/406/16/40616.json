        "Rome - 33 A.D., the headstrong tribune Gallio, (Richard Burton), offends the Emperor's nephew Caligula, (Jaye Robinson), and is banished with his garrison and Greek slave Demetrius, (Victor Mature) to Jerusalem. At the Crucifixion, he wins Christ's robe, but later as Jesus's last words echo in his brain, he is driven half mad with fear and guilt. The slave Demetrius, becomes a Christian and takes the robe. The story of how Marcellus regains the robe, sanity and salvation aided by his true love Diana, (Jean Simmons), unfolds in this spectacular epic."
