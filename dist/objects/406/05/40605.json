        "Clint Eastwood stars in this classic tale of right, wrong and retribution which takes place in a corrupt and violent gold rush town. The local miners are trying to fend off a take-over attempt from a powerful mining syndicate. Corporate mining boss, Coy LaHood offers the miners a deal: get out or be carried out. The miners have little choice until a mysterious stranger rides into town. The miners call him the Preacher. La Hood hires a band of thugs to kill the Preacher and the miners, but even though he pays in gold he hasn't reckoned on the Preacher, who pays off in lead! Dark, funny and quietly sophisticated, \"Pale Rider\" reinterprets the Western in a manner that shamelessly combines melodrama, myth and irony."
