        "Episode number 17 of Series \"Art of the western world\". World War II cast a shadow over the development of artists in the post-war years. Virtually every visual arts mode from classical antiquity onwards has had advocates within living memory. Nevertheless, there are substantially novel and radically opposed artistic enterprises which emerged from this time and found form in movements such as Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art and Minimalism."
