        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Art of the western world\". Chartres Cathedral is one of the greatest of all Medieval structures. Gothic architecture exploits the advantages of the construction techniques of the \"flying buttress\" which permitted lighter internal walls with large areas of glass. The Gothic style reflected the new age of humanism which arose from the economic and political stability in Western Europe between 100 and 1300 AD."
