        "Episode number 16 of Series \"Art of the western world\". The march of Modernism which had begun in the decade before the First World War, continued in the period that followed. The alienation from the centuries-old traditions of Western art became even stronger; the revolutionary attack on bourgeois society and its values broadened from an artisitc minority to political mass movements. The program looks at the challenges of Dadaism and Surrealism, and the architecture of this period."
