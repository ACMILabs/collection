        "Stark, the most powerful secret society on Earth could buy the Earth a thousand times and still make a takeover bid on God. So why is Stark desperate to buy a large slab of Aboriginal land in the Australian outback? CD, (Ben Elton), doesn't care about the world, but he does care about getting laid, especially by Rachel, (Jacqueline McKenzie), a beautiful rebel looking for a cause. Together with Zimmerman and Walter, two Vietnam veterans, dippy hippy Karen and Christie Kettel, a New York journalist, they take on Stark to try and save the world from a toxic conspiracy. Filmed entirely in Australia, Stark combines Ben Elton's brash, individual humour with a serious environmental message."
