        "Episode number 4 of Series \"History in action\". Although Italy has a king, Prime Minister Benito Mussolini is the one called \"Il Duce\", the leader. Between 1919 and 1925, Mussolini promised his people political stability, law and order, prosperity, social reform and an empire. In June 1934, Mussolini met Hitler for the first time in Venice. It was rumoured that Mussolini felt himself superior to Hitler and that the relationship between the two dictators was strained. This program looks at whether Italy was strong enough to be a Great Power and whether Hitler would be an ally or competitor."
