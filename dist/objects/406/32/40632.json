        "An all-star cast that includes Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Marilyn Monroe, Donald O'Connor, Johnnie Ray and Mitzi Gaynor, sparks this tuneful Irving Berlin musical depicting the trials and triumphs of a veteran vaudeville family. Molly and Terry Donahue start out as a duo and keep adding kids to their stage act until they finally become the 5 Donahues. Their busy, sometimes tumultuous lives aren't always easy, but the Donahues have plenty of love to get them through the hard times and more than enough talent to keep them on top. Highlighted by one classic Irving Berlin song after another and an array of dazzling production numbers, this upbeat, utterly delightful tale of life on the stage proves, beyond any doubt that there is no business like show business!"
