        "Episode number 18 of Series \"Art of the western world\". For 200 years, the Western world has been coming to terms with industrialisation and with far reaching social, political and economic change. It has yet to settle with the pluralistic view of cultural history which has resulted from these changes. Beneath a blitz of information about the past, including the quite recent past, Western culture has fractured. This episode examines Conceptualism and the effects on modern day architecture."
