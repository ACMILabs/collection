        "The Young Lions depicts the individual men and women on both sides of World War II. On the American side, two men struggle to endure the hardships of Boot Camp and the struggle to reclaim France. On the German side, a dedicated officer goes from the victories of the early years to the despair of defeat. Inevitably, the two sides are drawn together for the showdown. Marlon Brando dominates the film as the young German idealist who embraces Nazism but later comes to doubt it. The film also stars Montgomery Clift, Dean Martin, Hope Lange, Barbara Rush and May Britt. Based on the novel by Irwin Shaw."
