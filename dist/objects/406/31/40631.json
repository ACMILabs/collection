        "Boris Karloff's role in the 1932 version of The Mummy has become a landmark in the annals of screen history. Karloff plays Im-Ho-Tep, the mummy, who is accidently revived after 3,700 years by a British archaeology team. In flashback, we find that he was a high priest who was embalmed alive for trying to revive the vestel virgin whom he loved after she had been sacrificed. Now, dressed in the garb of a modern day Egyptian, he sets out to find his lost love, mistaking Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) for her and terrorizing the expedition members who must find a way to stop him. Today, almost half a century after its production, this brooding, dream-like film remains a horror masterpiece. Also stars David Manners, Bramwell Fletcher, Arthur Byron and Edward Van Sloan. Based on a story by Nina Wilcox Putnam and Richard Schayer."
