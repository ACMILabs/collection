        "Episode number 15 of Series \"Art of the western world\". The few years between the opening of the 20th Century and the outbreak of the First World War saw a radical transformation in artistic styles and design. Never before, had there been such an extension of visual language or multiplicity of styles and never had so much innovation taken place in such a short space of time. This episode higlights movements such as the Secession Movement, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism and Futurism and the artists from each period."
