        "Jeremy Irons plays the dual role of Elliott and Beverley Mantle, two genius twin gynaecologists. The twins share all aspects of their lives, including their work, sexual partners and social circle. When one of them falls in love, this creates a disturbance in both of their psychologies which is horribly acted out in their medical experimentation on women. David Cronenberg has directed some of modern cinema's most effective horror films but \"Dead Ringers\" is possibly his masterpiece being a terrifying nightmare that examines the monsters in our own psyches. A startling, disturbing film that confronts the male and female viewer with our basest fears of misogyny, birth and sexuality. Co-starring Genevieve Bujold and based on the book \"Twins\" by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland."
