        "Episode number 10 of Series \"History in action\". On 2nd August 1968, Soviet planes and tanks invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion came as a surprise because only two weeks before a meeting at Bratislava between Dubcek, Secretary of the Czech Communist Party and the entire Russian Politbureau appeared to have gone well. Why then was Czechoslovakia invaded, and why did the Russians fear the new freedoms which had taken place?"
