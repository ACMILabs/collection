        "This interesting program is a very useful resource for students investigating the works of Shakespeare. It is structured in three parts and examines the treatment of alienation, love, revenge and humour in a discussion of \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Hamlet\"; ambition, violence and the nature of evil in \"Macbeth\" and rebellion and the power of words in \"Julius Caesar\". By using footage from feature films, we see how the same themes have been treated in texts such as \"Animal Farm\", \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" and \"The Outsiders.\""
