        "Episode number 8 of Series \"Art of the western world\". The Republic of Venice had enjoyed great power and prosperity for many centuries before the Renaissance, and the city in its unique setting has long been one of the jewels of Italy. By the 16th Century, however, its political power was passing its peak. The artistic achievements express confidence and an enthusiasm for experimentation. Artists such as Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese highlight the flavour of the Venetian Renaissance."
