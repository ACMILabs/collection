        "Considered one of Mel Brook's funniest films, this hilarious farce follows an attempted swindle by a con artist (Zero Mostel) and his accountant (Gene Wilder) who attempt to stage a Broadway flop only to have it backfire. This film has achieved cult status and is known for musical interlude \"Springtime for Hitler\". Wilder received an Oscar nomination for his role in this zany classic. The phony play was later actually produced by Alan Johnson."
