        "Laurel and Hardy are well-meaning toymakers who muddle an order for Santa. Instead on making one 600 foot high soldier, they make one hundred six-foot soldiers instead. The toy army comes in handy when Barnaby and his furry Bogeymen invade Toyland. The boys end up as heroes as they save Widow Peep's daughter Bo. Originally known as \"Babes in Toyland\", the film was heavily censored as it was considered too scary for children, and it was seldom seen after the Disney remake of 1963. Nevertheless, it remained one of Laurel and Hardy's best films and it was the personal favourite of Hardy."
