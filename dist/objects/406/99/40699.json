        "Episode number 9 of Series \"The Developing image\". Dr. Key is a professor of Media Studies and president of Media Probe, a centre for the study of Media. Dr. Key attempts to awaken the public to the real message behind the innumerable photographic images which surround us. This fascinating discussion focuses on subliminal advertising, and how millions of dollars are spent each year for the solitary purpose of persuading consumers to buy a product."
