        "Featuring authentic aerial battle film, this gritty World War 2 action film emphasises the heroic but perilious face of war. Convinced that an air force commander is at breaking point, Brigadier General Savage takes over the struggling bomber troop. He uses strict disciplinary tactics, despite his kind and understanding nature, to revitalise a demoralised troop. At first resentful and rebellious, the flyers learn to gradually respect Savage and to perform as expected. Eventually the stress of command begins to take its toll on Savage, until he too faces breaking point. Starring Gregory Peck, Dean Jagger, Hugh Marlowe, Gary Merrill and Millard Mitchell."
