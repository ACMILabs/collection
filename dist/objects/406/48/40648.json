        "Barbra Streisand is the exuberant Fanny Brice, Zeigfield performer extraordinaire in this sequel to the outstanding film \"Funny girl\". This lively, lavish musical opens a new chapter in Fanny's career and love life. Now divorced from the wealthy Nicky (Sharif), she teams up with songwriter Billy Rose (Caan), a brash and unkempt showman who is bursting with enthusiasm and theatrical ambitions. It is a poignant story of their showbusiness magic, unbridled temperaments and passionate romance. Featuring dazzling production numbers, elegant costuming by Bob Mackie and an electric cast, this is an unforgettable."
