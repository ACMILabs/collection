        "Episode of Series \"The Shirley Temple collection\". Shirley Temple sings, dances and charms her way into everyone's hearts in this acclaimed version of the Kate Douglas Wiggins story. When orphan Rebecca, (Shirley Temple), auditions for a radio show and doesn't get the job, her stepfather, (William Demarest), takes her to live with Aunt Miranda, (Helen Westley), owner of Sunnybrook Farm. However, the show's talent agent, (Randolph Scott), was prepared to hire Rebecca and begins to search frantically for the missing youngster - unaware the pint-sized radio star lives next door! This is a colourised version of the original black and white film."
