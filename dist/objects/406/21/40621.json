        "In this powerful thriller, John Mills plays a lonely man who is recovering from a nervous breakdown. Through mysterious circumstances, he is suspected of a local murder and his past only confirms everyone's suspicion of his guilt. His only hope is to prove his innocence himself. This superbly crafted movie benefits from a strong central performance by John Mills. The script, by Eric Ambler, could be a model for many of today's thriller writers. This is a classic British mystery that absolutely bristles with suspense."
