        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Art of the western world\". The 17th century interiors of Protestant churches were filled with Baroque art. Congregations were brought to God through the richest and most dramatic use of religious imagery. The architecture, sculpture and painting of the Baroque were designed together, part of a total and individual whole. Vigorous movement embracing the entire facade is also a characteristic of Baroque architecture and Caravaggio is highlighted in this episode."
