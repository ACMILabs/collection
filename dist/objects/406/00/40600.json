        "Sequel to \"Terminator\". The story resumes several years later in present day Los Angeles. A cybernetic assassin and bodyguard are sent back from the future. This time the target is John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's son. The story revolves around the conflict between two Terminators over the the boy's life and ultimately the future of the human race. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick are suitably impressive and menacing as the two cyborgs, but in the words of James Cameron, the \"real\" terminator is Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. Her transformation from desperate prey, in the original film, to vigilante guerilla is rivetting. At the time of its release, \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\" was the most expensive film ever made at a cost of $100 million. Fans of action adventure, mind-boggling special effects and wanton destruction will not be disappointed."
