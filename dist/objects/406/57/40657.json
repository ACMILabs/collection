        "Episode number 11 of Series \"Art of the western world\". The turbulence and restlessness of this period is reflected in the troubled history of France and Europe, in the first half of the 17th Century - Thirty Years War. The autocracy of Louis XIV was an example of the political response to disorder; the artistic response was a renewed emphasis on mathematical proportions and on compositions controlled by horizontals and verticals. Artists who followed after this included Poussin, Lorraine, Watteau and Jacques Louis David."
