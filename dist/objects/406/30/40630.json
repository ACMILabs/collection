        "Stemming from Greek mythology, this is the tale of the voyages of the intrepid Jason and his Argonauts on a quest to find the legendary Golden Fleece. He and his crew must brave all manner of dangers and face a host of terrifying foes, including the seven-headed Hydra, fighting skeletons, bloodthirsty Harpies and the invincible colossus Talos. It is also a tale of love, as the beautiful Medea risks everything for Jason and his quest. For its time, the special effects of Ray Harryhausen were given accolades by the critics. Stars Todd Armstrong as Jason and Nancy Kovack as Medea."
