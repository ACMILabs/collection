        "Joanne Woodward, in a performance which earned her the Oscar for Best Actress, plays Eve White, a mousy withdrawn housewife with multiple personalities. After startling her husband by behaving completely out of character, and having blackouts, Eve visits a psychiatrist, played by Lee J. Cobb. From these sessions, emerges the personality of Eve Black, a sexy, uninhibited woman who expresses those parts of Eve White's personality which she has suppressed. Eventually, her third self emerges as Jane; an intelligent, sensible woman, who helps resolve and integrate the different facets of Eve's personality into a whole and healthy human being. Based on a true story, this acclaimed drama explores the dimensions of the human mind."
