        "Gary Cooper takes centre stage in \"Ball of fire\" together with Barbara Stanwyck in Howard Hawks' deliciously funny, and delightful romantic comedy. Cooper is a serious English professor working with his intellectual collegues on a dictionary of American slang. Stanwyck, a red-hot nightclub singer, on the run from the mob, seeks refuge in their house and finds a place in their hearts. Soon, the professor and his friends learn a lot about language and life, and Cooper and Stanwyck prove that the world of semantics is big enough for two who can speak the language of love."
