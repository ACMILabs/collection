        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Art of the western world\". Examines Romanesque and Gothic churches as evidence of the values of the society that created them. Shows the effect of monasticism and pilgrimage on Romanesque church architecture. Gothic architecture and sculpture, exemplified in the churches of Chatres and St Denis, are discussed as evidence of a new theology and profound changes in medieval society. As most people, including Kings and Queens could not write, the visual images of Christian art were called \"Books of the illiterate\"."
