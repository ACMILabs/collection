        "A dazzling American showgirl, (Marilyn Monroe) catches the monacled eye of a debonair prince, (Laurence Olivier). Opposites attract as His Higness Grand Duke Charles succumbs to the unpolished but vivacious Milwaukee chorus girl Elsie Marina, abandoning his \"stuffed shirt\" posture for her more commonsense approach to life. While the Prince's state is beset by political worries, he seeks escape in an affair of the heart. Elsie is also interested in affairs, but in the affairs of State. When she pits her \"Yankee\" ingenuity against the Balkan bigwigs who want to remove Charles, they are no match. Monroe radiates beauty and charm, while Olivier is the perfect counterpart as the straight-man in this romantic comedy."
