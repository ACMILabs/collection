        "Clint Eastwood runs 'The Gauntlet' into an explosive piece of movie making that lives up to its title with a vengeance. He plays a burnt out Phoenix cop on an assignment to bring back from Las Vegas a 'nothing witness for a nothing trial' (Locke) which seems just another meaningless task in a meaningless life. Until the fireworks start! Trapped by treachery on both sides of the law, the two are forced through a deadly obstacle course of raging gunfire, blazing cars, swooping helicopters, murderous ambushes, crazed bikers and crooked police. With non-stop action and special effects that will blast you to the back of your seat, including a ferocious finale in which an armoured bus is shot to smithereens with more than 8,000 bullets (8000 bullets and none hit the tyres!). Leave the driving to Eastwood, sit back and enjoy the ride."
