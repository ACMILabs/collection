        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Renaissance\". This thought-provoking presentation documents how the advent of gunpowder during the Renaissance brought about drastic changes in our perception of war and warriors. Beginning with the medieval knight, the glorious warrior, we see how this noble image was forever lost with the development of grander, more mechanised warfare. This program captures the new horrors of war and emphasises the relevancy of the issues during the Renaissance through interviews with contemporary experts in the field of international warfare."
