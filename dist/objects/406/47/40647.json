        "In a time of violence and fear came a man of peace, hope, love and forgiveness. The man was Jesus and he changed the world. Panoramic scenes of clamorous battles between Roman legions and Judean rebels contrast with the serene faith of Jesus. From his birth in a Bethlehem manger, Christ's life is brought to the screen with simplicity and eloquence: his forty day ordeal in the desert, selection of the Apostles, the sermon on the Mount, Judas's betrayal, the Passion and the Resurrection."
