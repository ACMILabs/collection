        "Episode number 16 of Series \"History in action\". On 29th August 1962, American Intelligence sources indicated that missile sites had been established in Cuba. The weapons observed were identified as surface to air missiles of a defensive nature and were thus dismissed by US authorities as insignificant. Six weeks later, US spy planes took photographs of what appeared to be launch pads for long-range missiles and it was confirmed that the Soviet Union had placed offensive missiles in Cuba, capable of attacking the United States. The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun."
