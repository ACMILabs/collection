        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Renaissance\". This program documents the lives and ideas of dissenters who suffered death and/or excommunication in their challenge to the power of the Church. Through dramatic re-enactments you meet Jan Hus, John Wyclif, Martin Luther, Argula Von Grumbach, and others who questioned established authority. The essence of dissent is captured through interviews with modern day dissenters fighting orthodoxy."
