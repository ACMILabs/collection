        "George B. Cohan, born on the 4th of July, became one of Broadway's legendary composers. Cohan's prolific career spanned 55 years where he wrote 35 plays and 500 songs including \"Harrigan\", \"Give my regards to Broadway\", and of course \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" This is an exuberant song and dance production starring James Cagney, with his typical flair, in the title role. This film premiered in 1942 and was a salute to American patriotism and the 'Grand old flag', yet time has not dulled its freshness and energy."
