        "After a stage coach hold-up and killing, outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) is captured. Fearing a daring rescue by Wade's gang who are too strong for the local lawmen to handle, a large bounty is offered to anyone willing to escort Wade by train to the state prison in Yuma. Hard hit by the crippling drought and attracted by the generous sum, rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) takes on the job. He collects Wade and begins the dangerous trek to the station."
