        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Renaissance\". Of the profound changes that occured during the Renaissance, none shaped the modern world more than the emergence of science. This program documents the age through a study of the lives and works the scientists such Paracelsus, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and others who struggled to create a new vision of the world - a vision still evolving as we learn from interviews with today's scientists."
