        "Episode number 13 of Series \"History in action\". During the last week of October 1962, the world lived on the knife-edge as the two Superpowers faced each other over the Cuban Crisis. Russia was keen to have a base closer to America, just as America had power and bases surrounding Soviet territory. On the 29th October, 1962, the two Superpowers stepped back from the brink of war. Was the present agreement a new start or only a truce?"
