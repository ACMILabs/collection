        "The next war not will be fought - it will be played. The year is 2018. There are no wars. There is no crime. There is only \"The Game\". In a world ruled by Corporations, where no-one asks questions, the vicious barbaric \"sport\" of Rollerball distracts the masses and satisfies their violent and potentially rebellious impulses. Jonathon E., (James Caan), is the champion Rollerball player, but in a world governed by an elite, there is no place for an individual, let alone an icon of heroic achievement. Threatened by the head of the Corporation, (John Houseman), deprived of the woman he loves, (Maud Adams), Jonathan E. must make the choice to \"quit while he's ahead\" or suffer the consequences. In an arena, where there are no rules, there can only be one winner. A sci-fi thriller with a chilling climax."
