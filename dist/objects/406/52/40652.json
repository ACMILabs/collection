        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Art of the western world\". The love of minutely observed detail is one of the characteristics that distinguishes the art of the Northern Renaissance from that of Italy. Although the Italians too, studied the surfaces of things, their intent was to work from the inner form outwards, seeking an organising principle or harmony outlying outward appearances. It is in the work of Jan van Eyck and the master Albrecht Durer, that the style of the Northern Renaissance is best showcased."
