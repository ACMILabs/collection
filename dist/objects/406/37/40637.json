        "Jeanette MacDonald is Sonia, a bubbly widow who owns over half the property of the tiny European country of Marshovia. When she relocates to glittery Paris, suave ladies' man Captain Danilo, (Maurice Chevalier), pursues her. His mission: avert his homeland's financial ruin by bringing Sonia back on the wings of love. A frothy high-spirited gem based on Frank Lehar's operetta with the magical Lubitsch touch of wit and style."
