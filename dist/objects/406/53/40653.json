        "Episode number 7 of Series \"Art of the western world\". Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo were so highly regarded by their contemporaries, that they immeasurably raised the status of the artist. Popes and Princes felt honoured to be their patrons, and accorded them the respect and recognition of their equals. Earlier artists could not match the visual power and originality with which these three legendary artists were able to translate their thoughts into images."
