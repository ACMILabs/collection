        "Episode number 14 of Series \"Art of the western world\". Neo-Impressionists and Post-Impressionists abandoned the techniques of the Impressionists, however the diversity of styles and techniques greatly varied among the celebrated artists of the time. Colour, form and content was influenced by an awareness of non-European art such as Japanese woodcuts, and scientific theories of colour which artists Seurat and Cezanne practised with almost mathematical precision. Gaugin's lifelong passion for the exotique, Van Gogh's highly emotive style or Lautrec's interest in the bohemian side of Paris represent the creative energies of the period."
