        "On Io, the innermost moon of Jupiter, the volcanic landscape is desolate. For the Con-Am 27 mining colony, populated by misfits and losers, it is home. Violence bubbles benath the surface, ready to explode. Federal District Marshall, William T. O'Niel, (Sean Connery), is sent to investigate the grisly, frenzied deaths amongst the miners, and must struggle alone in the pursuit of truth. This is a grim view of the future, where productivity takes precendence over humanity."
