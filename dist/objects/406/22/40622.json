        "Grace Kelly received an Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of the wife, and Bing Crosby gave one of the most outstanding performances of his career as an alcoholic, guilt-ridden has-been. When he is given an opportunity to star in a new musical show, his wife (Grace Kelly) and the show's director (William Holden) attempt to bolster his ego and help him make a comeback. This superb drama, based on Clifford Odet's play, was nominated for seven Academy Awards."
