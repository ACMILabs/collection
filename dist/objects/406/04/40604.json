        "Barbra Streisand is a knockout as Dolly Levi, the woman \"who arranges things... like furniture and daffodils and lives\". The plot concerns Dolly, a young widow and professional matchmaker, who sets her sights and whatever else she can muster, on conquering tight-fisted Yonkers merchant, Horace Vandergelder, beautifully played by Walter Matthau. Spend a magical evening with the incomparabale Barbra and enjoy a great musical. Co-starring Michael Crawford."
