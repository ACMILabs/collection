        "The explosive and frank adaptation of the best-selling Harold Robbins novel stars George Peppard as the ruthless tycoon who, with amazing parallels to Howard Hughes, manages to build a multi-million dollar empire. Set in the 20s and 30s, it provides an insight into life in Hollywood, filled with \"booze and broads\". The plot centres on the eternal themes of greed, corruption, power, passion and love. The noteworthy cast also includes Elizabeth Ashley, Lew Ayres, Martin Balsam, Archie Moore, Martha Hyer, Leif Erickson, and Alan Ladd in his last performance. Costumes are by Dame Edith Head and music by Elmer Bernstein."
