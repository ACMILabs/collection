        "He was a pacifist, turned patriot; a backwoods farmboy and ace Turkey Shoot champ who decided there are some things worth fighting for. Sergeant Alvin C. York became the renowned hero of World War I, capturing 132 German soldiers during the savage fighting in the Argonne. York insisted that if a film was to be made of his life, he wanted Gary Cooper only to play his character. This performance earned Cooper an Oscar. Under the direction of Howard Hawks, and with a cast that included Walter Brennan and Joan Leslie, this film will remain an all time classic."
