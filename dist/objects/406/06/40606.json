        "This rivetting adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's best-selling novel of the same name stars Christopher Walken and Tom Berenger as mercenary soldiers involved in the overthrow of a corrupt black African dictatorship. An intricate game ensues where double cross is the rule and the strike force they have organised find themselves caught between the shadowy international cartel who hired them and the dictator they are sworn to depose. The story focuses with chilling accuracy on the perilous lives of mercenaries, soldiers for hire, and the dirty battles they fight, often impervious to the morality of the assignment and its political integrity."
