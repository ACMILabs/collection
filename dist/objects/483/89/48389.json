        "The film emphasises the necessity for conserving resources by maintaining plant at a high level of efficiency. Examples of neglect and some of the major repair work required because of the neglect of day-to-day maintenance are shown. The need for operators to realise their responsibility for keeping a machine in order is stressed. While every machine has its own maintenance routine, the simple rules common to all machines are demonstrated."
