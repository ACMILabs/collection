        "Brogan thinks Foreman McCardle has gone clean off his rocker when he has him, Brogan, carted away to the clinic although he's perfectly well. When Nurse Gilfillan starts to operate - on Brogan's trailing necktie, baggy-sleeved sweater, cuffed pants and worn-out shoes - horrid tales of workers who had worn similar clothing and been reduced to near-hamburger make everything quite clear. Cast: Joseph Carr, Marcia Diamond, Alfie Scopp"
