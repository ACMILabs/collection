        "From Te Mata Peak Summit we view the fertile plains of the Hawkes Bay catchment, touring orchards, vineyards, and sheep farms. In the rolling hills surrounding the plains the soil erosion problems present themselves and the efforts to combat them are shown and discussed. Similar problems and conservation efforts are shown on the flats - flood control is also discussed."
