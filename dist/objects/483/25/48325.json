        "Spotlights the most common causes of serious falls in industry. While an ironic commentary suggests new and better ways of tripping people up, we see workers drop truck handles in the aisles, neglect loose floor boards, leave pails on stairs, climb on rickety boxes, and use an extension ladder without safety feet. The film ends with practical advice on how to eliminate factory danger spots that may result in bad falls."
