        "Camille, a professor of mythology at the Christian New College of Faith, and her boyfriend Martin are being pressured to marry by the principal of the college. When her dog dies Camille finds comfort with Petra, a sexy circus performer, who she meets at a laundry. As their friendship gradually develops into a love affair Camille's life is turned upside down and she realises she must make a choice between a secure life with her fiance, or one of adventure, passion and uncertainty with Petra. Sumptuously filmed in lush colours, Rozema draws on the magic and drama of daring circus acts to symbolically convey Camille's struggle to set herself free. Cast includes Pascale Bussieres, Rachael Crawford, Henry Czerny and Don McKellar Winner of Audience Award, Berlin Film Festival 1995."
