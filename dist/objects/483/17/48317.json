        "This lacerating black comedy is an acerbic commentary on modern day masculinity. Two businessmen, sent by their company to oversee new company offices in another city, undertake a scheme to enact revenge on contemporary women. They plan to find a woman, wine and dine her, seduce her and then cruelly dump her. From this initial premise Neil Labute crafts an exceptionally taut and challenging work which explores the misogyny, racism and selfishness that underlies the competitive ethos of the new yuppie capitalist culture. Aaron Eckhart gives an outstanding performance as Chad, who imbues his vile character with a disturbing attractiveness. He is ably supported by Matt Malloy as his best friend who allows his personal morality and ethics to be subsumed by his desire to be \"one of the boys\"; and by Stacy Edwards as the \"victim\" who the men choose to abuse. Filmed in long takes which allow the actors to take centre stage, featuring excellent production design and music, \"In the Company of Men\" packs a mighty emotional punch. The end suggests that the culture of misogyny engendered by modern corporatism is as destructive on men as it is on women."
