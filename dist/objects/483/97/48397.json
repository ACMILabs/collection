        "An example of the modern approach of agricultural scientists to problems that affect the farming industry, the film gives an account of how a coumarin-free variety of sweet clover, under certain silage conditions, developed a poisonous mould. From a few test seedlings, through a whole program of cross-breeding, the film shows how the nutritionally safe \"Cumino\" variety of sweet clover was finally produced in commercial quantities."
