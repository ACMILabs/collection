        "Based on the true life account of Resistance fighter Andre Devigny, who was imprisoned and condemned to death by the Nazis, \"A Man Escaped\" is one of cinema's truly poetic films, a study in both the psychology of imprisonment and loss of liberty, as well as a tense and involving study of how a man plotted his escape from one of the most heavily guarded prisons in World War II. As played by Francois Letterier, the condemned man's initial fear and anger give way to a resolve and determination to defy his fascist captors. But, as his plans are disturbed on the eve of his execution, he achieves a transcendence by accepting the inevitability of fate, the need to trust another human being, and finally having the knowledge that by not surrendering his will - whatever the outcome of his escape - he has truly liberated himself from the enemy. Winner of the Best Director Award a Cannes in 1957, stunningly photographed by L. H. Burel, and featuring an evocative use of Mozart's Mass in C Minor, this is universally acknowledged as one of Bresson's supreme works. In French with English subtitles."
