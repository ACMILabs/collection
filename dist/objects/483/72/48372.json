        "Every summer thousands of visitors come to Waterton Lakes National Park to enjoy its mountain grandeur, fishing, swimming, and all the other attractions that make for summer enjoyment. To show how this heritage of beauty and pleasure is preserved year after year, the film takes us on a tour of large-scale outdoor housekeeping. We see not only how wardens organise and administer the Park's services, but also how they protect wildlife and co-operate with their partners across the border, the rangers of Montana's Glacier Park."
