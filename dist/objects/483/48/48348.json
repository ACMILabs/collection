        "Buster Keaton as a hapless blacksmith muddles his way through various comic situations in inimitable Keaton style. New shoes for a lady's horse, a revolutionary saddle for another lady rider, repairs to a young fop's expensive car and an encounter with a bratty child, lead to inevitable mayhem but with Buster emerging triumphant in the end. Cast also includes Joe Roberts and Virginia Fox."
