        "Angle Bay lies on the southern shore of Milford Haven in Pembrokshire. A scenic and historical impression of this ancient land is given, and the film then reverts to the present day, for Angle Bay is now an ocean terminal and Milford Haven a deep-water harbour for oil tankers. Narrated by Anthony Quayle."
