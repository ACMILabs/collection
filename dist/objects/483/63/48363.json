        "A family's bitter struggle to eke out a living in the harsh environment of a high mountain valley has eroded the parent's marriage. After the tragic death of her father, twelve-year-old Toss, in empathy with her grandfather's dreams, compensates for a life of isolation by inventing imaginary worlds. The fragments of reality she perceives are put together according to her own logic. When an itinerant hunter begins work on the farm and is befriended by her mother and grandfather, Toss's reality is thrown further into crisis. The landscape is centrally implicated in a world of nightmares and dreams. Cast includes Penelope Stewart, Frank Whitten, Bill Kerr and Fiona Kay."
