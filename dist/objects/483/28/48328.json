Filmed during World War II, shows fishermen who work at sea and then come home to grow potatoes and tomatoes for the War effort. Footage is shown of lobster and oyster production under government regulations. Also shows the villagers joining in a vital lifeboat practice with everyone downing tools to man the lifeboat - a very special service during war time. Narrator: Frank Phillips"
