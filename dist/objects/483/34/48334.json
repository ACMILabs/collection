        "Tells the story of how doctors and scientists of many nations made possible modern methods of preserving blood and using it far from the places where the blood was given. It traces the development and present operation of the blood donor system in Britain, emphasises the work to be done in peace as well as war, and appeals to everyone to give blood to save the lives of others."
