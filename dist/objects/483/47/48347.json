        "Episode of Series \"The Adventure parade\". A pre World War II edited news/show-reel, a dramatic and adventurous expedition into the wild jungles of India. Mostly contrived and very little adherance to actual fact. The pith-helmeted hunters eventually capture a tiger and...a lion! They soberly watch on as the two cats fight to the death. NB: SOME SCENES MAY DISTURB"
