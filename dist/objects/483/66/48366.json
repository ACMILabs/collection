        "Follow up to the controversial British series which follows the trials and sexual exploits of a group of gay men in London. This second series was created as a one off finale and re-teams the three main protagonists from the first season. The hedonistic Stuart (Aidan Gillan), his long suffering best friend Vince (Craig Kelly), and the recently 'out' teenager Nathan (Charlie Hunnam). \"Queer as folk 2\" still focuses on the same milieu of Canal street, the gay district of the first series, but this time around centers on the relationship between Vince and Stuart. Will the two best friends finally consummate their relationship? Will Stuart come out to his parents? Will the impressionistic Nathan finally get over Stuart or follow in his footsteps? Also included is \"What the folk...?\" (25 mins), a short documentary on the making of the infamous series featuring interviews with the leads and writer Russell T. Davies. Cast includes Denise Black, Antony Cotton and Andy Devine."
