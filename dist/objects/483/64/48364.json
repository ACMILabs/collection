        "This hauntingly atmospheric mood piece is set in rural Spain soon after the Civil War. In the oppressive postwar atmosphere there is an unbridgeable gulf between the parents and children of the household. The parents have retreated into private worlds - beekeeping and an obsession with a 'lost' child. After seeing James Whale's 'Frankenstein' at a travelling film show the children conjure the monster up as a playmate. In the mind of the imaginative and impressionable Ana the figure of a fugitive soldier fuses with the figure of the monster. Cast includes Fernando Fernan Gomez, Teresa Gimpera, Ana Torrent, Isabel Telleria. In Spanish with English subtitles."
