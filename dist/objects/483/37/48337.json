        "An anarchic comedy chase road move which deftly gets its three travellers on the road in a fraudulently hired Mini. They become known as the Blondini Gang as they are pursued the length of the country by the police, coming into contact with a range of eccentrics along the way. This was the first New Zealand film to recover its costs from the domestic market alone. Its popularity changed New Zealanders' reluctance to watch locally made movies. Writers, Geoff Murphy, Ian Mune ; photography, Alun Bollinger."
