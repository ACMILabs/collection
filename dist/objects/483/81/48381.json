        "Making good concrete improvements on the farm. Strong, durable, economical and fireproof, they improve the property in value and appearance. Step by step, we follow the methods of concreting a holding yard for pigs; the selection, testing and cleaning, screenings, gravel and sand; preparing the foundation; marking the bay areas; pouring; levelling the surface; the non-slip finish; curing and finally ready for use. Other improvements to fence posts, silos and cowyards are shown."
