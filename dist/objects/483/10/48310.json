        "Radioactive isotopes serve in many different ways--in preservation of food, in strengthening of plastics, in industry, medicine and agriculture. Here is a fascinating exploration, in layman's language, of what they can do. The film shows the reactors at Canada's Chalk River nuclear laboratories, the composition and function of cobalt 60, and developments in atomic science. (Awards: London; Buenos Aires; Rome)"
