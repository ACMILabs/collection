        "A virtual body built from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the artist's body. MRI scans map the water content of the body to produce axial slices. These scans were used to create a 3D body accessible on any plane, making it possible to navigate through the body, and to view it internally and externally.  (Special thanks to Ray Scan Imaging and The Childrens' Hospital Westmead Sydney)"
