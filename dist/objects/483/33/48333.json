        "In this romantic crime drama, a cat burglar gets emotionally involved with one of his victims. Unfortunately, the woman he woos is engaged to the thief's treacherous ex-partner. The louse has reformed and to all appearances is an honest, successful businessman. But appearances are deceiving. The two men end up battling it out. Later the businessman is found dead. Unfortunately, during the trial, the blame is placed upon the girl. The thief tries to take the rap for her. In the end, however, it is revealed that the businessman actually killed himself after a stock market crash."
