        "In this historical swashbuckling comedy/adventure set in France in 1654, a feisty young woman (Sophie Marceau), daughter of the famed swordsman D'Artagnan, cuts short her religious studies when she uncovers a plot to assassinate the young Louis XIV. Heading to Paris she persuades her father, now in retirement, and the three other original musketeers to fight alongside her to defend their country from the insurgent forces that threaten to throw the nation into disarray. A lush, lively film assuredly directed by Tavernier that pairs old-fashioned adventure with a contemporary knowing wit and a feminist sensibility. In French with English subtitles. Cast includes Philippe Noiret, Claude Rich and Nils Tavernier."
