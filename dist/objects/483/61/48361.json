        "An Award winning 3 part BBC television program set in a country house on the outskirts of London which is home to a unique photographic collection which spans the 20th century. The collection is cared for by a small team of dedicated but eccentric staff whose world is shaken when an American property developer purchases the mansion and its contents. His intention is to refurbish the house, with most of the collection, and establish a modern business school on the property. The library staff entrench themselves, determined to use any creative means to stop the break up of the photographic collection. The clash of economic rationalism and heritage values is brilliantly shown, as well as the power of photographs to chronicle and shape events and decisions. Adapted by Stephen Poliakoff from his own play. Special credit to the Hulton-Getty Picture Collection for still used throughout the drama."
