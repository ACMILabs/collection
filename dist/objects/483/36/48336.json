        "Set in a fashion department we meet a would-be writer, Miss Barry, who has been with the store for one year. In her conversation with another sales clerk, Mimsy, she emphasizes the benefits of being familiar with the stock and with reading trade magazines to keep up on new trends. Miss Barry gets a promotion to assistant fashion buyer and Mimsy is hired. Her contact with Miss Barry convinces her that she too can have a career in retail selling."
