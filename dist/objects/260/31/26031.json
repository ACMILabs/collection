        "The scarcity of rainfall and water supply, the significance of being an international crossroad and the importance of rich oil deposits are three key ideas developed in relation to the countries of the Middle East. Their need for water and its effect on their economy is illustrated. The region is considered as a crossroads of peoples, historic cultures and trade. Three-quarters of the world's reserves of oil are found here; this valuable product has had an important effect on relations of the Middle East with the rest of the world."
