        "A motion picture camera linked to a microscope uncovers a world of fascinating and colorful activity--the world of fungus growth. Highly magnified color cross-sections of vegetable substances attacked by various kinds of fungi give unusually clear illustrations of how these micro-organisms spread and reproduce, and also show their many useful functions."
