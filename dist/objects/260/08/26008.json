        "This appreciation by Sir William Bragg to mark the Centenary of Faraday's discovery of electro-magnetic induction was re-issued in 1962. Traces Faraday's early life, and his interest in the connections between electricity and magnetism. Shows a reconstruction of theatre in which he gave his lectures and illustrates his experiment on the influence that a magnet can exert on a coil."
