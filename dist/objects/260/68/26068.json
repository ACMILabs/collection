        "The film presents young people who collect stamps. Most of them have no interest at all in monetary values and instead collect for the sole reason of fun. They think that it is even greater fun when stamps help them to discover things about other countries of which they had little knowledge before. Many of them like to collect stamps with motifs that interest them such as animals, aircraft and boats."
