        "The aim of this film is to convey to children the excitement and interest connected with air transport. It shows the adventures and investigations of a small boy at an airport as he watches the departure of a flying boat for South Africa, and illustrates the work of the ground staff and air crew, the organisation of the airport, and some details of the structure and mechanism of the flying boat."
