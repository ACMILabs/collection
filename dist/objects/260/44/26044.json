        "The most suitable dairy products for exporting to South-East Asia are anhydrous milk fat or butter oil and skimmed milk powder - neither require refrigeration. They are separated from milk in Australia and recombined with water and sugar in modern factories in Djakarta or other South-East Asian countries. 16,000 tons of milk fat and 50,000 tons of skimmed milk powder are exported each year to supplement the protein diet of people in these countries."
