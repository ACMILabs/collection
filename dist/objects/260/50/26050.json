        "Shows the impact of a thriving multi-use indoor sports centre on a local community. One such centre is Carlton Forum in Nottingham, whereby harnessing additional capital to that received for school facilities, it became possible to build a new social recreational centre to serve the community as a whole. Many of the sports and recreational activities catered for at Carlton Forum are featured with the reactions of people who use its wide range of facilities."
