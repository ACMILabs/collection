        "Utilising techniques of time lapse photography - split screen, rapid-fire images and intricate animation effects - to define the concept of a microsecond, this film poses probing questions about time and our relationship to it. It is indicated that 2800 years are to one day what a second is to a microsecond. The 2800 years go by at the rate of twelve still pictures (the art works and artifacts of civilisation) per second. Photo-video: Ralph Sargent. Voice: Loren McLaughlin. Percussion: Jack Eaton."
