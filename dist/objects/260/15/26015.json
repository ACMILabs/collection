The principle of the micrometer is explained in detail, its spindle with a thread of a pitch of 1/40th of an inch, the thimble, the adjustable nut and sleeve, the frame and the anvil, graduated line of the sleeve, graduations on the thimble. Stress is laid on the importance of careful maintenance and cleaning, and regular checks for accuracy of this instrument."
