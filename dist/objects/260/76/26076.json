        "A history of the old gold-mining town of Walhalla in Gippsland, Victoria. Today it is almost a ghost town. Economics forced the closing of the mines after World War I and successive fires have destroyed what was left of the wooden buildings. Features archival footage and stills of the Long Tunnel Mine, richest in Victoria, and the railway to Moe opened in 1910."
