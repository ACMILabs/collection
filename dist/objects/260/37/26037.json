        "The first of a three part program which traces a Finnish family from its initial decision to emigrate to Australia, probes their reactions to living in Australia, and finally explains why the family prepare to return to Finland after 18 months in Australia. This filmed interview looks at the lifestyle of the family in Finland and their reasons for migrating. Their reasons range from undisclosed personal considerations to the feeling that personal freedom and initiative have declined in Finland and that life in Australia will provide better opportunities for their children."
