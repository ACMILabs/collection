        "A satirical impression without spoken commentary, of Surfers' Paradise. Opening with colour shots of the idyllic countryside views approaching the town, the film quickly transfers to the gaudiness of the town itself with bizarre signs, neon lights and flashy flats. Features a tape-manipulated mouth organ and Beatniks! Rich with the iconography 60's Australia, this is a fascinating document of the laconic, innocent charms that then characterised Australia's favourite seaside idyll. Reminiscent of the surrealist social documentary work of Humphrey Jennings."
