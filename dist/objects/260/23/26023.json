        "Materials such as plastics, leather, metals and textiles are opaque and must therefore be illuminated from above, Various methods of illumination are discussed; the direct method for very low-power work; the use of the simple vertical illuminator; the built-in vertical illuminator and the catoptric lens. The methods of operation are also explained."
