        "Half a million acres in the North-West Mallee get stock and domestic water supplies through the Millewa Channel system which draws water from the Murray River. 390 miles of channels are maintained by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission and 480 miles by property owners. The working of the whole system is explained in detail. Seventy townships and 120 properties in a low annual rainfall area are supplied by this vast irrigation system."
