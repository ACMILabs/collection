        "A young officer in the Greek Merchant Navy returns to his home on the island of Skiathos to marry his betrothed. Nikos has not seen Maria since she was a rather unattractive teenager, and does not know she has blossomed into the island's prettiest young woman. Their meeting and the ensuing wedding preparations make a delightful story, superbly photographed in the romantic Greek Islands. Narrated in English, with Greek dialogue."
