        "Presents the Middle East during the late 1950\"s and the various problems it was facing at that time: Christianity and Mohammedans, the nomadic Bedouin and the effect of changes; water, locust plagues and primitive farming methods; peasants and absentee landlords; disease, malnutrition and illiteracy. In contrast there was also a growing modern metropolis, and an emerging middle class education, the oil industry and the Aswan Dam. All this resulting in internal tensions and an intense growing nationalism."
