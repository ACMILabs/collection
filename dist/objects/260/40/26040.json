        "Mike and Stefani, a young Ukrainian couple, spent World War II in German labour camps. After the war the couple were reunited and as two of the eight million \"displaced persons\" in European refugee camps they sought to resettle in Australia. The film had a twofold purpose, to counter the criticism within Australia that post-war immigration procedures for such people were inadequate and that some \"undesirables\" were slipping through the net, and to encourage Australians to accept the sudden influx of non-British immigrants in the immediate post-war years. Photographer: R.G. Pearse."
