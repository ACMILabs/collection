        "A paint-on-glass animation, \"The Astronomer\" is the story of an old timekeeper who, little by little, loses sense of his world. It is a quiet rumination on time, progress and disconnection, the delicate threads that forge identity and the ease with which we can be forgotten. Created as part of coursework at the Centre for Animation and Interactive Media (AIM), RMIT, 2005."
