        "A young girl and her loyal friend are on a voyage together. While they are self-sufficient and happy, nothing can stay the same forever. This artistically creative short animation expresses emotion and feeling in its story-telling and has a mythical quality of legends and folklore. Use of strong colours and hand-drawn animation. Created as part of coursework at the Centre for Animation and Interactive Media (AIM), RMIT, 2005."
