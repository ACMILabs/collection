        "A baby boy dies on the journey from Los Angeles to Australia and is buried at sea. Many years later his mother still grieves for him, painfully and bitterly. Penny Fowler Smith uses highly evocative and sometimes abstract imagery to visual the mother's emotional narration. At Sea is a cinematic reflection on loss."
