        "Sadie Benning, at the age of 16, dropped out of high school for three weeks and stayed inside with her camera, TV and a pile of dirty laundry. The result is an introspective work of stop and start edits, grainy images and Benning's reflective commentary invoking a sense of isolation and sadness as she retreats from the outside world."
