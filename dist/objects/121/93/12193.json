        "A doco on \"home\" and \"homelessness\" - what is a \"home\" and what does \"homelessness\" mean to those who live it? The film provides a personal insight and commentary from a cross-section of the homeless community in Melbourne along with those who are lucky enough not to have experienced the social alienation, loneliness and hardships of homelessness. Thought-provoking and experimental in its presentation, Home is beautifully produced and directed by Amanda Sykes, with stunning images by cinematographer Brett Brogan, and supported by an evocative sound design and score from Pip Atherstone-Reid."
