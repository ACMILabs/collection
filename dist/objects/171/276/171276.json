    "description": [
        "Tony Agapitos was a Greek immigrant and film-maker who documented aspects of life in the Greek community in Melbourne during the 1950s to the 1970s. He focused on significant political, social and religious events, including the arrival of Greek ships at Victoria docks, celebrations and dances, protest marches, political meetings and religious occasions. ACMI holds all of the known footage shot by Agapitos. The material comprises approximately three hours of footage and was shot on 16mm and 35mm film.  This short film shows the Athenian Club celebrating the New Year and the finalists of the Miss Greek Charity Quest."
