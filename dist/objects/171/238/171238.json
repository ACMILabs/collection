    "description": [
        "Tony Agapitos was a Greek immigrant and film-maker who documented aspects of life in the Greek community in Melbourne during the 1950s-1970s. He focused on significant political, social and religious events, including the arrival of Greek ships at Victoria docks, celebrations and dances, protest marches, political meetings and religious occasions. ACMI holds all of the known footage shot by Agapitos. The material comprises approximately three hours of footage and was shot on 16mm and 35mm film.  This short film from his collection is a documentary showing the arrival of migrants from Greece aboard the Greek ship 'Patris'."
