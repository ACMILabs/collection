        "Tony Agapitos was a Greek immigrant and film-maker who documented aspects of life in the Greek community in Melbourne during the 1950s to the 1970s. He focused on significant political, social and religious events, including the arrival of Greek ships at Victoria docks, celebrations and dances, protest marches, political meetings and religious occasions. ACMI holds all of the known footage shot by Agapitos. The material comprises approximately three hours of footage and was shot on 16mm and 35mm film.  This short film from his collection was taken of the assembled Greek Boy Scouts and children at Festival Hall. The occassion was a celebration of National Day of the Greek Community held by the Greek Bishop at Festival Hall.  On the same day, another celebration was also held at the Olympic Swimming Pools"
