    "description": [
        "A program of films connected to the second wave of assisted migration of people from post-war Europe to Australia between the mid-1950s to 1970s.  Included are Australian Government produced films promoting the assisted migration scheme: 'Arriving in Australia' highlights the services available to all assisted migrants as they arrive in Australia in 1963, while 'Bring Out a Briton' demonstrates the unique attention given to encouraging British migrants to Australia from the late 1950s.  Titles from the Film Australia Collection illustrate the challenges faced by children - either migrants themselves or children of recently arrived parents - learning to adapt to a new home in 1960s and 1970s Australia.  Giorgio Mangiamele, an Italian-born film maker who migrated to Australia in 1952, produced a number of feature-length and short films that confront the reality of Italian migrant experiences in 1960s Australia."
