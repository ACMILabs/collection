        "The origins of NAIDOC (National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee) can be traced to the emergence of Aboriginal groups in the 1920\u2032s that sought to increase awareness of the status and treatment of Indigenous Australians. NAIDOC Week is an opportunity to celebrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, culture, achievements and challenges and, to recognise the contributions that Indigenous Australians have made.  We are pleased to present a range of films including significant historical documentaries and biographies from the NFSA's Film Australia collection."
