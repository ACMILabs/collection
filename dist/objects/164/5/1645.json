        "Like a filmic haiku, this very short film is a series of observations of the 'free shadow movies' that play on the streets of everyday life. Gathering images of light, time and motion from the most simple moments - a passing train, children playing - the filmmaker has created an immersion into urban mysteries of shadow and sensation. The result, while simple and modest, is a hypnotic perception of street life as glimpsed from the corners of the eye."
