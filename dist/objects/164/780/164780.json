    "description": [
        "The State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SEC) was not only a supplier of electricity, but was also a retailer of electrical goods, mainly electric Stoves. To show off the versatility of the stoves the SEC sold, they had a Home Economics department where cooks would come up with a\u00a0variety of dishes and test them with via demonstrations at shopping centres, shows and fairs. In the1950s and 60s the popularity of television gave the Electricity Commission a much bigger audience reach -- the Cooking show was the perfect platform\u00a0to sell Electric stoves."
