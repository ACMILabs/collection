        "Australia has long held a fascination with Food and Wine, although our tastes may have changed somewhat over the years! In this program of promotional films, cinema advertisements and TV shows, we relive our passion for a pudding; convert our stoves to electricity; learn how to cook Chinese cuisine at home; join the women at the 1967 Illawarra Shire Bake-off; learn how to make a fool-proof Trifle with one of Australia's Youngest TV presenters and relive Australia\u2019s discovery of wine varieties."
