        "Award-winning Australian film and documentary director Gillian Armstrong's film career spans over 40 years locally and internationally.  Here she shares her discovery of Orry-Kelly and the incredibly fortunate set of events that uncovered his memoir and his box of memorabilia including his three Oscars.  The release of Armstrong's 2015 feature-length documentary on the life and work of renowned costume designer Orry-Kelly, 'Women He's Undressed', coincided with ACMI's exhibition 'Orry-Kelly: Dressing Hollywood'."
