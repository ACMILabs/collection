        "The Sydney County Council (SCC) was established in 1935 and between 1936 and 1952. It was responsible for electricity generation and distribution in Sydney.  As with other electricity suppliers, they also sold electrical goods such as stoves. In this cinema advertisement, a delicious meal is prepared using the Koala stove showing how useful, economical and clean it can be to use and own, in a bid to entice people to make the conversion from gas to electricity.  As the woman says at the end \u201cYou'll all eventually cook with electricity so why not now?\u201d"
