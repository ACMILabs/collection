        "Short films reflecting Scorsese's thematic: troubled men & boys, on the fringe, playing up & out of sorts."

    "description": [
        "The solo, often lonely, troubled man is a main theme traversing the breadth of Scorsese\u2019s oeuvre. From Travis Bickle in \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019 to Rupert Pupkin in \u2018The King of Comedy\u2019 and Howard Hughes in \u2018The Aviator\u2019, loneliness is an integral theme of Martin Scorsese\u2019s work. Ahead of the Essential Scorsese season, film critic and writer Joanna Di Mattia has written an in-depth look at how the subject is approached within his films. She writes: \u201cScorsese\u2019s lonely men share a similar experience of masculinity \u2013 angry, troubled, and empty, exiled from the world, living on the edge of acceptability, afraid of humiliation, alone even when surrounded by others, seeking redemption as they struggle for humanity.\u201d  This series of short form works pays homage to this thematic - troubled men and boys, on the fringe, playing up and out of sorts."
