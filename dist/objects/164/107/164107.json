        "Established in 1947 to provide temporary accommodation for people displaced from post-war Europe, Bonegilla became a temporary home for over 300,000 migrants until its closure in 1971. Giving an overview of the services provided at Bonegilla, this Australian Government film was made in 1963, less than two years after the second (and last) riot by residents at Bonegilla."
