    "description": [
        "The 1960s had a huge impact upon documentary film making in Australia. Moving away from a more instructional/narrative style of documentary, film makers were influenced by the French new wave and cinema verite to produce more participant driven productions. This retrospective of award winning documentaries produced by the Australian government's Commonwealth Film Unit (the precursor to Film Australia), comes to you from the Film Australia Collection, and highlights the beginning of these trends in film making which are still relevant today."
