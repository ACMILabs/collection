    "description": [
        "This collection of works explores the rhythms and colours of Jazz music. Featuring the history of the early Jazz scene in Australia in particular, and while some aspects of the relationships explored with our American friends is, in 2016, politically not appropriate, the theme of the influence of the music wins out. Hear from Australian greats such as Graeme Bell and Pat Thompson.  See Jazz Conventions in Australia in Sydney and Dubbo from the late 1960s and 1970s. There is also an experimental work from the National Film Board of Canada using a technique of hand-painting film to animate the colours and rhythms of the music. These works show the passion and enthusiasm of the audiences and musicians, as they revel is all that is captivating about Jazz music."
