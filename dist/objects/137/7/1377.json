        "In this engaging short drama, Jane is convinced that her dog has killed the neighbours' pet rabbit! In fact, the rabbit died of natural causes and was given a decent burial.... Jane deals with the problem with the naive resourcefulness of a young girl, much to the horror of her neighbours!"
