        "Simon thought he knew his parents\u2026 A film about a family, a deception and its legacy. The visual effects in this film were all camera-created, using a technique of projection onto a moving sheet to create the insubstantial and constantly changing images that reflect the perceptions of the narrator (Simon Cooper). Nothing in his world turned out to be what it first seemed."
