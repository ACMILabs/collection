        "In an out of the way, old fashioned book shop, an eccentric proprietor defends his books from the predation of time, insects and occasional customers. Upstairs his crippled Granny remains addicted to tinned Irish stew and televised rock and roll wrestling until, that is , she is invaded by a bizarre literary book worm which infects her with a desire for TS Eliot. The Book Keeper loves his books and will do anything to protect them, even murder, but his tiny world is turned around when he catches his granny chewing on a few volumes of TS Eliot."
