        "An animated story concerning a displaced Aboriginal and and out-of-place kangaroo meet and decide to go 'bush', only to discover that they are intruders on their own land. A satire of life as an Aboringine during the resources boom of the 1970's, bushed explorer problems faced by Aborigines seeking employment, the ethics of tourism, slaughtering of kangaroos for pet food, and european denial of prior ownership by Aborigines. This program carries a strong environmental message of the impact of colonisation on our native fauna."
