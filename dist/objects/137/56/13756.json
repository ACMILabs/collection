        "Not being able to speak in tongues can be embarrassing at the very best of times. But if you are the only member of the congregation who cannot, and you are the daughter of a dynamic Revivalist preacher like Pastor Howard Spong - it's even more distressing. And that's just one of Cherith's problems. This is a serious (and satirical) comedy about fundamentalist religion. This distinguished piece of film making, with a great script, direction and performance, won Best Short Fiction Film, AFI Awards in 1988."
