        "From Henry Lawson via Russell Drysdale - the Australian myth of The Drover's Wife retold from a different perspective. Story retold by Murray Bail. Based on Henry Lawson's original story and inspired by Drysdale's painting of the same name this film explores women's invisibility in our cultural history. It uses a wide variety of commentators and visual and literary sources, and is positive and free of professional jargon. Cast features Martin Vaughan. Won Silver Award and Special Award for Acting in the General Category at the AFI Awards."
