        "\"By the light of the moon\" tells the story of two refugee girls, their reasons for leaving their home countries, their experiences, and how they came to be living in Broadmeadows and attending the Broadmeadows Secondary College. Essentially the film is about hope and optimism. Despite the difficulties faced by the two girls, and an acknowledgement that they can never forget the past, through sharing their stories they gain acceptance. They begin to connect with the community in which they now live, and have hope for the future."
