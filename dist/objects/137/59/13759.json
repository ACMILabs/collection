        "In Ruth Carr's arresting vignette, a woman rises every morning to put on her mask for the world, terrified that her husband will glimpse the real face beneath. As the camera explores in stark close-up the landscape of this aging woman's body, Lovely contemplates on the underbelly of the beauty industry, the ravages of time, and what people will do in the name of love. Cast features Greta Lindholm and Ken Snodgrass."
