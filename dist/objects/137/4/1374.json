        "Bonza is quite possibly the funniest Australian short film ever. It's a look at a family life through the eyes of a blue heeler. Bonza is a family dog. He is a loyal, confident, affectionate and trusting partner to Ted, his wife Bev and their two children Terry and Katherine who all have their own problems. Ted has been retrenched after 23 years with his firm but cannot bring himself to tell his family. Katherine has just come back from a world trip to sort herself out but is no more together. Terry is doing his HSC for the third time and being forced into dentistry but all his interested in is his starring role in his school's production of 'Jesus Christ Superstar'. One day Bonza gets into Bev's sleeping pills .... recriminations are soon flying thick and fast."
