        "career and life of J.P.McGowan"
    ], 
    "description": [
        "Born in Terowrie, South Australia, J.P.McGowan acted in more than 270 films, many of which he directed, including the acclaimed serial The Hazards of Helen. The first Australian actor and director to ever break in to Hollywood, his film work is regarded as some of the most skilful of the period, and exists in the hands of several dedicated collectors across the globe. A pioneer Australian film maker, McGowan has left an important international legacy. This half hour film documenting the Terowrie celebration of his life, and illustrating the little known life and career of J.P.McGowan is a marvellous addition to Australian film culture. There is a large extant collection of McGowan's work, clips from which will be sourced for inclusion in the film. The filmmakers will be in touch with the major collectorof McGowan's work in Adelaide; and there may be an opportunity to acquire the best of it for ACMI collections"
