        "Vlad, the forgotten Russian chimpanzee cosmonaut"
    ], 
    "description": [
        "\"Sometime in the early 50S the Soviet Space Agency  launched Project Vlad. Details are sketchy, but it was a top secret mission. Shrouded in secrecy, few records were kept and the Project has since been all but forgotten...\" Vlad is a Russian chimpanzee cosmonaut. Sent into orbit as a prelude to manned space flight, his hopes for heroism have long since faded. Vlad is a victim of Cold War politics; a long forgotten anachronism whose fate is to trace an endless and lonely trajectory around the Earth. Project Vlad was created digitally on a Silicon Graphics O2/Infinite Reality Engine using Maya 1.5 and Flame 5.5 software. It was then transferred to 35mm film using a Solitair Film Recorder."
