        "Behind the Mask reveals the complex emotions and identities of a group of young Melbourne primary school students. The ancient art of mask making provides a dramatic ritual which acts as a catalyst for self expression, revealing deep rooted feelings and thoughts, not usually associated with 10 and 11 year olds. By creating their own masks and performing with it in front of their peers and parents, the children find a voice to express the complex emotions and concerns that effect their lives. An extremely powerful and revealing program about children's experience of life."
