        "If, as a child, you were picked last for a team and sought as your refuge a wish or a dream. If you ever felt lonely, peculiar or blue, then Amelia Rose Towers is a bit like you! True! Amelia Rose Towers, 'whose initials spell ART', faces off against an adversary whose initials spell MAN, after passing through surrealist chambers and screens offering images of a personal identity that can never be reconciled. A story of juggling variables of reality of self and other; of space, time and perceptions; of the art of science and the science of art but it is also a story of hope, love and courage."
