        "Italians are the largest group of non Anglo Celtic migrants in Australia, totalling nearly one million people. Yet, like most of these migrants, they are either constantly misrepresented or not represented at all on Australian screens. Australia, 1971. \"Rabbit on the moon\" is a fairy tale about a northern Italian girl growing up in suburban Australia as seven year old, Italian born Guiseppina (Aurelia Eneide) encounters the painful realisation that she is living in a dual society."
