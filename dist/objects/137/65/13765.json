        "On a remote New South Wales property in 1912, the image was captured of a young woman who worked as a maid. Her calm gaze hid passions that emerged to subvert her fate. In Restoration fragments of memory combine in photography and dance to retell her story. Narelle Benjamin (the maid) and Solon Ulbrich (the photographer) also choreographed the dance sequences."
