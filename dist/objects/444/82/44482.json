        "When a 14 month old child disappears, Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren) is called in to lead the investigation. The case hits a raw nerve with Jane who is recovering from an abortion, as well as affecting DI Muddyman (Jack Ellis), for reasons he doesn't wish to disclose. There is only one prime suspect, Chris Hughes (Robert Glenister), a recovering paedophile who is now living with a woman who has two young children. Tennison's investigation is hampered by the lack of staff allocated to a kidnapping, the numbers increase, as does the personal involvement, when the case turns into a murder investigation. The Criminal psychologist (Stuart Wilson) who treated Hughes is convinced Hughes is incapable of murder, although he is capable of being pushed over the edge due to intense police scrutiny during the investigation. With Muddyman involved, this is a very probable scenario."
