        "Paul Ashworth discovers his passion for soccer when he accompanies his father to an Arsenal game. 24 years later, he still has the same passion, and is an unorthodox, deeply pessimistic thirty something English teacher. The highs and lows of Arsenal's performance mirrors that in Paul's personal life, thus the two worlds intermingle. Enter Sarah, and a relationship develops between two people that think the other one is either uptight or a soccer lout. As their relationship develops, Paul must question the distinction and importance between his personal life and his sporting fanaticism, as he is faced with the choice of deciding between following Arsenal's first chance to win the championship in 18 years, or to pursue love. Cast includes Colin Firth, Ruth Gemmell, Neil Pearson and Lorraine Ashbourne. Based on the novel by Nick Hornby."
