        "A struggling boxer recounts how his attraction to a young woman has drawn him into a world of shadows and omnipresent violence which threatens to overwhelm him. His life becomes imperiled when he protects a nightclub dancer from her gangster boss. Although filmed in New York locations, Kubrick's independently financed second feature has the atmosphere of a waking nightmare rather than that of realistically based drama. Cast includes Frank Silvera, Jamie Smith, Irene Kane and Ruth Sobotka."
