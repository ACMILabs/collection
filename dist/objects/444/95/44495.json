        "Episode of Series \"Famous lives\". Born in 1937 into poverty and a fatherless home, Saddam Hussein was raised by his military uncle who fought against the British, instilling in his nephew a fierce nationalism, especially for Tsuni Arabs. Following a period of exile in Nassar, Hussein returns to Iraq, marries, and assumes a number of key positions in the governing Bath party. His penchant for violent political tactics appears early in his career, as he ruthlessly sets about destroying non Tsuni's to secure a Bath party majority. His ability for self preservation and fierce nationalism also shows through as he publicly decries Europe and Russia while secretly carrying out deals with them. The 8 year war between Iran and Iraq is covered, as well as the ensuing war with Kuwait as Iraq is left financially bankrupt and geographically desolate after the war. The war against Kuwait would cease thanks to Operation Desert Storm, but with a high cost to civilian casualties. Regardless of the polarisation between those who view him as villain or hero, this documentary effectively conveys a leader who is, above all else, a ruthless survivor. Narrated by Lucy Longhurst."
