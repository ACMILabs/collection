        "A race-track robbery is planned with clockwork precision but Kubrick dispassionately observes how the mechanism is ruined by human fallibility. The intricate flashback structure presents a plot of chess-like moves in a hard boiled, visually stylised underworld richly populated by film noir stereotypes. Based on the novel \"Clean Break\" by Lionel White. Cast includes Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, Vince Edwards and Jay C Flippen."
