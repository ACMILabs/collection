        "Gabriel Burn stars as a widower and former gypsy king who has rejected his nomadic ancestry to settle with his two boys amid the grim tower blocks of Dublin. He is far from the perfect father, spending most of the time in the pub while his children tend to themselves. Their life is magically altered by the arrival of their grandfather with a magnificent white stallion called Tir na nOg, a figure out of Irish legend. The children, Ossie and Tito, take an instant shine to the horse, but events beyond their control occur when the horse is impounded by corrupt police officials. Ossie and Tito begin a desperate mission to regain the stallion that has brought happiness to their lives. This fantasy come Western is set against the magnificent Irish backdrop, and is as much a story about a father's redemption as it is about searching for happiness and adventure. Cast includes Ellen Barkin, Ruaidhri Conroy and Ciaran Fitzgerald. Written by Jim Sheridan."
