Enterprise is on a routine training mission when an urgent communication from Space Laboratory Regula One (home of the Genesis project), is received by Admiral James T Kirk. Kirk's old enemy, Khan, a genetically enhanced human from the Eugenics War, has appropriated a top secret device named Project Genesis and is using the universe threatening device in a deadly game of revenge. Aided by his band of genetic supermen made possible by the Project, Khan gains control of a Federation Starship and begins a desperate mission to gain control of the Enterprise. Cast includes William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley and Kirstie Alley."
