        "The relationship between police inspector Yeun (Chow Yun-Fat) and gangster hitman Tony (Tony Leung), who is in reality an undercover cop, is similar to the friendship between the two main characters in Woo's previous film \"The Killer\". But here, more than in earlier films, stylised action and gun play take centre stage in stunningly choreographed mayhem. This is a classic example of Hong Kong style action films and is a perfect introduction to John Woo's pre-Hollywood films. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
