        "A man is given an antique gold watch from an old woman who pleads with him to travel back in time with her. Years later, the man, Richard, is overwhelmed by a photograph of a beautiful woman. Seeing a picture of the woman in her later years, Richard realises that she is the same woman who gave him the watch, and that they had an affair the time the photo was taken. He becomes obsessed with returning to 1912 and being reunited with the young woman and is willing to sacrifice his life in the present to find happiness in the past. Cast includes Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, Christopher Plummer and Teresa Wright. Based on the novel \"Bid time return\" by Richard Matheson."
