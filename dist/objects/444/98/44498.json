        "Episode of Series \"Famous lives\". From small town boy to President of the United States, Ronald Reagan never forgot the teachings of his mother's Christian Church and its vision of America as God's chosen country. He took the world to the brink of nuclear war, and then came close to abolishing the entire nuclear arsenal of the United States and the Soviet Union. Features rare and exclusive footage. Narrated by Lucy Longhurst."
