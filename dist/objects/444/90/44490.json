        "Bowen (Quaid) is a knight dedicated to the Old Code, a noble creed of honour in a time long ago when majestic fire breathers soared through the skies. Bowen dedicates his time to instructing worthy pupils of the Old Code. He is disillusioned when one of his pupils, Prince Einon, becomes a cruel King, and Bowen loses faith in the idealism that was once the source of his inner strength. Believing Einon's soul to have been poisoned by a dragon, Bowen vows to destroy all dragons - without question or mercy. It is on this revenge quest for the good soul of Prince Einon that Bowen meets Draco (voice provided by Sean Connery), a dragon whose power, strength and wit are not easily defeated. As man and dragon contest in a life or death struggle, a friendship is formed that will change the face of the medieval world forever. Cast includes Dennis Quaid, David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite, Julie Christie and Dina Meyer."
