        "John Woo wrote and directed this action film starring Jackie Chan, Samo Hung, Dorian Tan and James Tien. Following the breakup of their group after an invasion from the rival Manchus, 8 Shaolin renegades form their own resistance group. They train under their old leader, until he deems them ready enough to challenge the Manchus and save the Chung Dynasty. Poorly dubbed into English."
