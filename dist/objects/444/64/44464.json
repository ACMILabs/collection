        "Using vignettes, still photos, interviews, and the New York landscape, this film follows the trials and tribulations of Steve (Russell Crowe) and Monica's (Salma Hayek) tumultuous relationship that vacillates between being together, and breaking up. The two realise that they can't live with each other, but can't do without the other either and are trapped in a continuous process of breaking up then making up. Ultimately, they have to decide what it is that's holding them together when the excitement of their renewed sexual attraction that occurs when they make up seems to be the overarching link between them. Written by Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Cristofer."
