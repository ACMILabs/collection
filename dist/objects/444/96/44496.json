        "Episode of Series \"Famous lives\". As the world's most famous former prisoner to being his country's leader, Mandela exemplifies a moral integrity that shines far beyond South Africa. In the revolution led by Mandela to transform a model of racial division and oppression into an open democracy, he demonstrated that he didn't flinch from taking up arms, but his real qualities came to the fore after his time as an activist, during his 27 years in prison and in the eight years since his release, when he had to negotiate the challenge of turning a myth into a man. Narrated by Lucy Longhurst."
