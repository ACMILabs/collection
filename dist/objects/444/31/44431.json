        "Sergei Yutkevich liberates the play from the confines of the stage and uses realistic backgrounds to recreate Shakespeares \"Port in Cyprus\". The text has been closely edited to concentrate attention on the relationship between Othello and Iago, and attention to visual details helps to underline the salient points of the original plot. Awarded the prize for direction at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. Original music by Aram Khachaturyan. (Film is dubbed in English). Title and credits missing."
