        "Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are happy, content and alive until a car accident turns them into ghosts, forever stuck in an afterlife - a holding cell for people who have died of unnatural causes. No sooner is the funeral over and their home is sold and \"invaded\" by two new trendy tenants. In desperation they enlist the help of a freelance bio-exorcist, Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton), to scare the new owners off the premises. This notion provides Keaton with a vehicle for showing off his comic talents. Story by Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson with music by Danny Elfman. Cast includes Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, Michael Keaton, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder. (Awards: Oscar for Best Achievement in Makeup)."
