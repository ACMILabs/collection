        "When a destructive space entity is spotted approaching Earth, Admiral Kirk resumes command of the Starship Enterprise in order to intercept, examine, and hopefully stop it. With it's relentless flight towards Earth \"V'ger's\" bloody-minded pursuit to find it's \"Creator\", Kirk and crew face possible Armageddon. Cast also includes Persis Khambatta as Lieutenant Ilia and Stephen Collins as Commander Decker. Interesting note: When Spock travels through V'ger and sees all the incredible imagery, look out for Darth Vader and Miss Piggy - right after his line \"Who or what are we dealing with?\". Written by Allen Dean Foster. Original music by Jerry Goldsmith. Cinematography by Richard H. Kline."
