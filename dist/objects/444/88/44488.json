        "A French operative named Devereaux (Frederick Stafford) is hired by a CIA agent to travel to Cuba and investigate rumours of Russian missiles and a NATO spy group known as 'Topaz'. They suspect there's a traitor in the entourage of President De Gaulle. It seems that Devereaux is onto something when the investigation leads to worried governments, murder, betrayal and suicide. As he heads home to expose a double agent, his life is endangered by forces who want to keep the truth hidden. Cast includes John Forsythe, Frederick Stafford, Philippe Noiret and Darry Robin. Based on the novel by Leon Uris."
