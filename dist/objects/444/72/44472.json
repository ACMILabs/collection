        "A thriller with a little romance and a lot of comedy, \"Spiceworld\" chronicles the five crazy days leading to the Spice Girls' first live concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Photojournalists follow as they travel from press conferences to practice sessions to photo shoots, passing London landmarks in the comfort of their tardis Spicebus and emerging into a musical cascade of colour, trendy clothes and blinding flashbulbs. Exploring the trials and tribulations of their global fame, \"Spiceworld\" takes a satirical stab at the media giants and commercial junkies who relentlessly compete to manufacture the girls' success or demise. Cast includes The Spice Girls, Richard E. Grant, Alan Cumming, George Wendt, Claire Rushbrook and Roger Moore."
