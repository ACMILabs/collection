        "The third in the series of feature films based on the original television series by Gene Roddenberry is set in the 23rd Century, the planet Genesis has been born, but at a great and terrible price - the death of Captain Spock. As per tradition, his body is consigned to deep space and the battered starship Enterprise limps back home. Lt. Saavik and Dr. David Marcus arrive on the forbidden planet to begin their research, unaware that their discoveries are also of great importance to the Klingon Battle Commander Kruge (played by Christopher Lloyd), who will stop at nothing to gain control of the secrets of this new world for the Klingon Empire. The revelations regarding Genesis will impel Captain Kirk and the Enterprise crew on a mission so personal and dangerous that they will have to confront the final frontiers of revolutionary science and the arcane rituals of Vulcan mysticism. Cast includes William Shatner, DeForest Kelly, James Doohan, George Takei, Walter Keonig, Nichelle Nichols, Merrit Butrick and actor/director Leonard Nimoy, around whom the whole story revolves."
