        "Director David Cronenberg considers this film his most personal one to date. A bold admission considering the disturbing material and particularly bitter look at marital break ups and the psychological effects that are passed down the generations. Cronenberg treats his themes of family dysfunction with his usual trade marks of experimental therapies run amuck and bodies rebelling against their hosts in the most visceral and graphic ways. Oliver Reed plays Doctor Hal Raglan, the mind behind an unconventional and radical institute which deals specifically with the physical effects of rage on the human body. One of his star pupils, the deranged Nola (Samantha Eggar), begins to use this very strange form of anger management to get back at her ex-husband (Art Hindle) who has custody of their five year old daughter. Cast also includes Cindy Hinds, Henry Beckman, Nuala Fitzgerald."
