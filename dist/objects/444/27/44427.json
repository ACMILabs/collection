        "In one of his most hard-bitten roles, Steve McQueen plays \"Doc\" McCoy, a master thief who is released on a parole arranged by his wife (Ali MacGraw) who sleeps with a political big shot. In return for this favour, McCoy must lead a group of professional thieves on a bank heist, including his wife as the getaway driver. What follows is a sinister succession of double-crosses that sour the deal until the final climactic shoot-out. This violent film, typical of Peckinpah, relentlessly depicts ruthless robbery and murder, not to mention adultery, kidnapping, bribery, extortion and general mayhem. No-one in this film is honourable or attractive, and yet the viewer finds themself actually hoping that McQueen and MacGraw, thieves though they are, will get away. Cast includes: Steve McQueen, Ali MacGraw, Ben Johnson, Sally Struthers, Al Lettieri and Slim Pickens."
