        "The trouble with Harry is that he's dead, and while nobody else seems to mind, everybody thinks they are responsible for his death. After many burials and unearthings of the corpse, and a few blossoming romances between the major characters, the real cause of Harry's death is revealed, and Harry troubles nobody again. \"The Trouble with Harry\" is a quirky comedy-mystery set in the autumnal splendour of New England. It is a decidedly different film from Hitchcock, in which Shirley Maclaine makes her screen debut. Includes music score by Bernard Herrmann. Cast includes Edmund Gwen, John Forsythe, Shirley Maclaine, Mildred Natwick and Jerry Mathers. Based on the novel by Jack Trevor."
