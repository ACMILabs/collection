        "Marnie is a psychodrama with a background of crime and suspense. Tippi Hedren is Marnie, a kleptomaniac and compulsive liar who goes to work as a secretary for Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), and then attempts to rob him. Upon discovering this, Rutland impulsively marries the troubled beauty and attempts to uncover the reasons for her obsessive behaviour and sexual frigidity. When a terrible accident pushes his wife to the edge, Rutland forces Marnie to confront her terrors and her past in a shattering conclusion. Includes music score by Bernard Herrmann. Cast includes Tippi Hedron, Sean Connery, Diane Baker, Martin Gabel, Louise Latham."
