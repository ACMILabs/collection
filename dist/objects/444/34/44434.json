        "The setting is the West Coast of Ireland, 1892. Joseph Donnelly (Tom Cruise), a poor tenant farmer, is determined to bring justice to the oppressive landlord responsible for killing his father. After setting fire to the landlord's house, Donnelly runs into the landlord's daughter Shannon (Nicole Kidman), and together they head for America - the two united by their desire to own their own land. Initially things seem to indicate a positive future for Joseph and Shannon who are posing as brother and sister. They secure lodgings, and Joseph is able to bring in a small income by boxing. The security doesn't last however, and the two must separate, just as they discover their true feelings for one another. Joseph begins work on a railroad, his goal to possess his own land in the new territory never far from his thoughts. Once again, Shannon re enters his world, only this time she has a fiance, but still shares Joseph's dream to own her own land."
