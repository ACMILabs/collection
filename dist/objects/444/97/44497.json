        "Episode of Series \"Famous lives\". 'Fidel Castro: maximum leader' chronicles the rise of Cuba's most infamous dignitary. Born in an era when Cuba was the playground of Americans fleeing prohibition, Castro became interested in student activism and witnessed the changing of leaders between Presidents Gomez and Battista. He led a gang of guerrilla rebels into the mountains, and after several unsuccessful insurrections into the capital, was finally successful in overthrowing Battista - thanks to intervention by Eisenhower. Throughout his career Castro would form Communist alliances and create a highly sensitive relationship between Cuba and America. Includes footage from the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion. Narrated by Lucy Longhurst."
