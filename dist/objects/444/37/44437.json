        "The aims of resistance are to bring about a socially equal, democratic and ecologically sustainable socialist world and to organise, educate and mobilise young people to this end. Resistance, a Melbourne based organisation, was involved in organising high school students in protesting against One Nation and the racism this political party espoused and supported. This student movement was called \"High School Walkouts Against Racism\" and spread nationally with students participating in protest rallies outside the Queensland Parliament against Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party. This short documentary presents personal views and commentary by two Resistance members, Andy and Liz along with actual footage of some of the protest rallies against racism. Soundtrack: Propagandhi and M.Y.C."
