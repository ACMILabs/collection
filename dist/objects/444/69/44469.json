        "Katie is a very special three year old gorilla who knows how to communicate using sign language and loves to talk to her friend, Rick (Will Horneff). Rick meets Katie through his mother, a behavioural scientist who is so busy working with animals that she doesn't have time for her son who is sinking into juvenile delinquency. Their friendship is threatened when Katie is reclaimed by her former owner and put in a cage with the intention of being used as an attraction at the flea market. Rick helps Katie escape and together they embark on an exciting wilderness adventure from California to Canada and having a lot of fun along the way. Cast includes Wil Horneff, Helen Shaver, John C McGinley and Peter Boyle."
