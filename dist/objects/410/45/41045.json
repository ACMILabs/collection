        "Episode of Series \"James Bond\". Dr. No was the first extraordinary adventure of the world's most famous spy: James Bond. Sean Connery is 007: suave, charming and fearless; an expert on weapons, women, martinis and just about everything. Dr. No, a fanatical scientist, is a member of the terrorist organisation SPECTRE, which plans to conquer the world. However, thanks to the daring of James Bond, Dr. No is ultimately defeated. Ursula Andress made her screen debut in the film. While there is no famous title song, the well-known James Bond theme, elaborate opening title sequences by Maurice Binder and the magnificent locations were present from this first film and have now become part of the James Bond legend."
