Life is hard for the Mousekewitz family who struggle to make ends meet and to keep their dreams alive. Tanya wants to become a singer and Fievel wants to be like his hero Wylie Burp. Lured out West by crafty Cat R. Waul, Fievel uncovers a dastardly plot to turn new settlers into mouse burgers. With the help of his cat friend Tiger and the feared Wylie Burp, Fievel saves the day. Features the voices of James Stewart, John Cleese, Dom DeLuise and Amy Irving with Linda Ronstadt singing the song \"Dreams to Dream\"."
