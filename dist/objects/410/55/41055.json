        "Gypsy Rose Lee, burlesque Queen of renown, was driven to stardom much less by her own ambition, than by the ruthless determination of her mother. As the stereotypical domineering \"stage mother\", Rosalind Russell's performance is superb, while Karl Malden as her long-suffering but loyal lover also gives a fine performance. While the references to striptease are undeniably fleeting, Natalie Wood as Gypsy Rose Lee is creditable, but it is her vulnerability rather than her sex appeal which comes to the fore. Stephen Sondheim's lyrics and Julie Styne's score makes this a musical delight."
