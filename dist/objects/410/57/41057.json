        "Episode of Series \"Marilyn\". Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe are three glamorous models on the lookout for a rich man. Pooling their funds, they decide to rent a luxurious Manhattan penthouse in order to lure their catch. Things are not what they appear to be as two of them fall in love with \"poor men.\" In the attempt to stop each other from marrying the wrong man, the threesome give their best performances. Utimately, it is love and not money which influences their choices. This film is a must see for lovers of Marilyn Monroe's quirky and individualistic comedy style."
