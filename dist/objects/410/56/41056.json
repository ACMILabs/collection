        "Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) is an eminent doctor and the new head surgeon at Westerly Hospital. The newlywed Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) is admitted to hospital requiring emergency surgery. Dr. Hill defiantly performs an unnecessary operation which leaves her unable to have children. Hit with a $20 million dollar law suit, the truth begins to unravel - this is not the first time the medical whiz with miracle hands has played God, but will it be the last?"
