        "Katharine Hepburn's debut in what was to be the first film in a long association with director George Cukor. Hillary Fairfield, shellshocked during World War One, escapes from the asylum on the day his ex-wife is to remarry. Unable to adjust, he must also confront his now grown-up daughter Sydney. Facing reality, he finally accepts his wife's determination to marry a sane, healthy man, but does not know of the impending sacrifice his daughter is to make. Sydney knows that the streak of madness in her father is inherited, not war-induced and, fearful of passing it on to her children, she cancels her marriage in order to care for her father."
