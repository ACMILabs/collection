        "Bob Jones (Michael Keaton) is an ordinary man dying of cancer. As a legacy to his unborn child, he attempts to make a video of his life as he perceives it. It is only when he is confronted with the artifice of his own existence that he becomes determined to come to grips not only with the past, but with the disease. Embarking on a new lifestyle and rigid self-examination, and aided by Mr Ho, a spiritual healer, Bob undertakes a voyage of self-discovery. Nicole Kidman stars as Gail Jones, and Dr. Haing S. Ngor as Mr. Ho. Unashamedly a tear-jerker, \"My life\" is a compelling and sentimental drama, which emphasises the dignity of the dying and the need to embrace life. Truly vomitous."
