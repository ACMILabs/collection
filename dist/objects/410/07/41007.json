        "After extensive training, Colonel Michael Kirby selects two platoons from the U.S. Special forces - known as the Green Berets - for guerilla warfare at Anang. The soldiers are needed to widen the 'killing zone' around a Strike Camp in Viet Cong Territory. One of the most controversial movies about the Vietnamese Conflict, 'Green berets' stars John Wayne and David Janssen."
