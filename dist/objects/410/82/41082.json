        "Episode of Series \"Basic music industry skills\". Introduction to the Music Industry. Module 4.6. Contemporary Australian Aboriginal music has become an international presence in recent years. This program profiles artists who have taken their brand of indigenous music to the world: Yothu Yindi, Archie Roach and Tiddas. Traditional elements are incorporated into contemporary styles. This is not simply a matter of throwing in the odd didjeridu and clap stick, but rather the traditional cultural role of Aboriginal music as an educational medium is maintained and extended to cover new, important issues and themes."
