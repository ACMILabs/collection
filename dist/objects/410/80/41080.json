        "Episode of Series \"Basic music industry skills\". Module 4.5. Pursuing a career in the rock music industry is not easy for women and the path to success is often difficult. Lindy Morrison, an ex-band member of the groups The Go-Betweens and Cleopatra Wong, interviews women who have worked in artistic and non-artistic roles in the industry. In terms of gender balance, radio airplay, income and participant numbers, there is still room for improvement. Key female industy figures featured include Kylie Minogue, Wendy Matthews and Tina Arena, along with 'pioneer' artists such as Judy Stone, Laurel Lee and Little Pattie."
