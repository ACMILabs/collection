        "A remake of the 1932 classic tale by famed author Ernest Hemmingway. Rock Hudson stars as an American ambulance driver during World War I. Wounded in action, he is restored to health by an army nurse played by Jennifer Jones. However, their love affair is doomed as the war hangs like a spectre over their lives. Shot on location in the Dolomite region of Italy, the film is sentimentally tragic and never quite reaches the heights of the earlier version. Vittorio De Sica is excellent as the cynical Major Rinaldi, while Hudson and Jones make an attractive couple, but their performances are hampered by a cliched script."
