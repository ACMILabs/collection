        "Madeline, Pepito and the girls visit an Alpine Chalet in \"Madeline's winter vacation.\" The trip is laden with adventure as they encounter the Abominable snowman, ski, skate and get caught in an avalanche. Madeline fears that because she is so small she will not be able to perform with a famed ballet master in \"Madeline at the ballet.\" Her insecurity impedes her success until a famous ballerina gives her a pep talk and some ballet shoes."
