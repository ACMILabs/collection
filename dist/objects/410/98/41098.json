        "Harold Blair was considered a curiousity at the height of his career as a tenor in the 1940's. As an Aboriginal, raised on a Reserve, Harold sang songs he had learned from watching Nelson Eddy films, or the classic operatic arias, although later in his career, the music of his own people formed part of his repertoire. Harold Blair's life is revealed in this documentary through the people who shared his life and influenced his career; chiefly his wife and family. This is an intensly personal and frank look at an Aboriginal pioneer who had to struggle to achieve success and to reconcile his 'stage persona' with his Aboriginal identity."
