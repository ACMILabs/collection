        "This is the story of the Spanish Main - when villainy wore a sash and the only political creed in the world was - Love, Gold and Adventure! Tyrone Power is a swashbucking rogue pirate who pillages galleons and towns in the company of Henry Morgan (Laird Cregar). When Morgan is elected Govenor of Jamaica, some of his pirate Captains continue their villainous ways, especially Redbeard (George Sanders). Power falls in love with the beautiful daughter (Maureen O'Hara) of the former Govenor and decides to reform which pits him against Redbeard. \"The Black Swan\" is a classic of its kind, with magnificent settings, swordplay, bravura acting and excitingly staged action sequences involving 17th Century ships and an enormous amount of cannon fire! Leon Shamroy's cinematography deservedly earned him an Oscar. Based on the novel by Rafael Sabatini."
