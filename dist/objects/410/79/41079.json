        "Donald Brittain was one of the most respected documentary filmmakers of his time and his work with the National Film Board of Canada earned him accolades from his peers and cemented his place in cinema history. This documentary examines the man behind the work and the work itself. He created films about heroes, \"exposed villians\" and offered filmgoers a \"warts and all\" expose of his subject and themes. This excellent documentary presents a frank and honest account of Brittain whose gift is described as being able to make the great man common and the common man great."
