        "Emile Zola based \"Germinal\" on a trip made in 1884 through rural France, observing the conditions of coal miners. This pivotal novel raised awareness of the miners' plight as they struggled to survive inhumane and dangerous conditions for the profit of the mine owners. Maheu, (Gerard Depardieu) is a miner. He and his wife (Miou Miou) and family eke out a miserable existence in the mines. Their lives are changed when Etienne Lantier (Renaud) enters the district and orginises a miner's union. Nevertheless, the quest for profit at all costs causes a further disintegration of conditions and results in a terrible mining accident. Despite the almost unrelieved harshness and pessimism of the subject matter, the film is an excellent historical document of an era; vividly contrasting the squalidness of the miners' lives to the opulent lifestyle enjoyed by the mine owners. French dialogue with English subtitles."
