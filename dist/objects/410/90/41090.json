        "A delightful puppet production based on the story by Ibsen and with music by Grieg. Peer Gynt enters a world filled with Trolls, Witches, Whirling Dervishes and the powerful Mountain King in the search for adventure and to get away from his nagging mother. Jim Gamble, master puppeteer introduces the story to a group of young children and then sweeps them away into a far-away fantasy land. However, things are not always what they seem."
