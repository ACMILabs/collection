        "An unusual tale of sexual exploration set against the stark beauty of the Alaskan landscape. The boyish Kotzebue (k.d. Lang in her acclaimed acting debut) and German librarian, Roswitha (Rosel Zech) help each other come to terms with their attraction, and in doing so add a further dimension to their emotional confusion. This film takes the viewer on a journey of discovery and challenges perceptions of identity, alienation, love and sexuality. Co-starring Chuck Connors, Jane Lind, Oscar Kawagley, Wolfgang Steinberg and Christel Merian. Soundtrack by k.d Lang."
