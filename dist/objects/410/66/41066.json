        "A glossy, psychological horror thriller based on Ira Levin's best seller of the power of witchcraft to destroy lives. Rosemary (Mia Farrow) is the unsuspecting wife whose actor husband (John Cassavetes) becomes involved with a witches coven. Rosemary's pregnancy precipitates sinister happenings and she soon discovers that not even Dr. Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy), a respected obstetrician is to be trusted. Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon (who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance) are the ghastly neighbours with diabolical designs on Rosemary's infant. \"Rosemary's Baby\" plays on fears even more potent and atavistic than \"Psycho.\" Co-starring Maurice Evans, Angela Dorian and Patsy Kelly."
