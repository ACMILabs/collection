        "The 1960's saw a proliferation of teenage dance music films from both the United Kingdom and United States when Elvis and Beatlemania were at their height. Cliff Richard's film \"The Young ones\" is a prime example of this genre, and was the first film to have three hits in the Top Ten of the charts. Convinced that a club for teenagers is really a den of Beatnik iniquity, a property tycoon makes preparations to tear it down. Cliff and his friends stage a teen musical to try and save the club and prove that good clean fun and dancing is all they want. Co-starring Robert Morley, Carole Gray and the talented band The Shadows."
