        "Filming \"The Alamo\" fulfilled a long-time dream for John Wayne who not only starred as the legendary Davy Crockett, but also produced and directed this sprawling epic western about Texas' fight for independence. An impressive cast features Richard Widmark (Jim Bowie), Laurence Harvey (Colonel Travis) and Richard Boone (Sam Housten). The battle sequences of the final attack are a truly memorable spectacle in the depiction of this pivotal event in American history when, in 1836, 185 \"Texans\" held off an army of 7000 Mexican troops to secure the independence of the State. This epic masterpiece earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. A haunting musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin and co-starring Frankie Avalon."
