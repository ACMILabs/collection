        "Audrey Hepburn won an Academy Award for her portrayal of a modern-day Princess rebelling against her royal obligations who escapes a goodwill tour to explore Rome on her own. She meets an American newspaperman (Gregory Peck) who, seeking an exclusive story, pretends ignorance of her true identity. Eddie Albert contributes to the fun as Peck's carefree cameraman pal. Stylishly directed by William Wyler, this romantic comedy bubbles along at a fine pace, and when the day of fun is over the Princess and the reporter are in love, but each knows that nothing can come of the Roman holiday!"
