        "This World War II film is action packed with a renown cast. The film vividly recreates in stunning detail, a controversial episode in military history known as Operation Market Garden. This involved the drop of 35,000 American and British paratroopers into Holland to secure the six major bridges leading to the German border. Sir Richard Attenborough's direction of this wartime epic is flawless and the film is filled with compelling and unforgettable imagery such as the parachute drop. The vividness and brutality of war, along with the courage and daring of the people involved are emphasised in this production."
