        "George Stevens' legendary rendition of the archetypal Western myth earned six Academy Award nominations and made \"Shane\" one of the timeless classics of American cinema. Based on on the novel by Jack Schaefer, a drifter and retired gunfighter (Alan Ladd) comes to the assistance of a homestead family terrorized by an aging cattleman and his hired gun. In fighting the last, decisive battle, Shane sees the end of his way of life. The mysterious, moody and breathtakingly atmospheric cinematography by Loyal Griggs won an Oscar and the film is enhanced by the intense performances of its splendid cast particularly Brandon de Wilde as the young son who idolises Shane."
