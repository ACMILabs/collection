        "Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood star in this famous film version of the the stage musical. Ben Rumson (Lee Marvin) is a hard-fighting, hard-drinking, happy-go-lucky man. His 'Pardner' (Clint Eastwood) on the other hand is sober, quiet and gentle. The story follows their adventures in a lawless gold mining town called No Name City (population: drunk). They stick together through thick and thin and share everything including a wife (Jean Seberg). Music and lyrics by Alan J. Lerner and Frederick Loewe"
