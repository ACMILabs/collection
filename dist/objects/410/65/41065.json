        "Wim Wenders combines his many obsessions in this bizarre and intricate science-fiction tale spanning three continents. An outstanding Solveig Dommartin plays a woman who is searching for a stranger (William Hurt) to whom she is attracted. All she knows is that he is undertaking a dangerous mission for his scientist father (Max Von Sydow). Her search takes her through an end-of-the millineum Europe and Asia in which technology and consumerism has run riot. She traces the stranger to Australia where beneath the desert soil, a group of Aborigine and European scientists are hoping to create a society which will save mankind. Combining exceptional graphics, a film noir palette and a metaphysical reflection on alienation and colonial exploitation, \"Until The End of the World\" is a difficult but exhilerating film. Co-starring Jeanne Moreau and Ernie Dingo and featuring a stunning soundtrack including U2, Lou Reed, Nick Cave, Neneh Cherry, Can and REM."
