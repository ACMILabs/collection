        "A delightful comedy which won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1992. Eight misfit Italian soldiers are stranded on an idyllic Greek island during World War II. The island is solely populated by women and soon the soldiers are seduced by the beauty of the island and its inhabitants. The ravages and horrors of war are forgotten as the young men embrace a warm and peaceful life. Eventually however, their sojourn in paradise is over and they must confront the end of the war and return to their native land. Italian dialogue with English subtitles."
