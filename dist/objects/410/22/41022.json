        "During the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, a group of \"foreigners\" are trapped inside the Forbidden City of Peking under seige by thousands of rebellious Chinese who are determined to break free from the bonds of Imperialist intervention. Charlton Heston stars as the US Marine who leads the defence, while David Niven is the British Ambassador. The Dowager Empress (Flora Robson), and her chief advisor (Sir Robert Helpmann), try to play both sides against each other. Ava Gardner, as the beautiful Russian Countess, must make a choice between freedom and commitment."
