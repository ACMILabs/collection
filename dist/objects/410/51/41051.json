        "Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers combine in another comic masterpiece. This time Sellers is not the bumbling Closeau, but the much maligned and accident-prone Indian actor Hrundi V. Bakshi. Hollywood mogul, Fred Clutterbuck is giving the Hollywood party of the century, complete with beautiful women, powerful men and \"wanna-be stars.\" Blackballed by his producer for wrecking a day's shooting, Bakshi finds himself unexpectedly invited to the party. Once this walking disaster area enters the festivities, destruction and mayhem follows. A satire on the artifice and snobbery of Tinseltown and a must for lovers of Sellers' unique comic style. Co-starring Claudine Longet, Marge Champion and Steve Franken with a musical score by Henry Mancini."
