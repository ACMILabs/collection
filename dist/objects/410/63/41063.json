        "Shakespeare's epic tragedy is brought to the screen in this British production with an all-star cast. Charlton Heston stars as Mark Antony, John Gielgud as Caeser and Jason Robards as Brutus. Opposed to the growing power of Caeser, and the fear that he poses a threat to the republican liberty of Rome, a group of senators conspire to murder him. The ringleaders, Cassius (Richard Johnson), and Casca (Robert Vaughn), convince the moderate Brutus to carry out their plan on the steps of the Senate. Mark Antony's famous and stirring funeral oration incites the Roman populus to bring the perpetrators to justice. Richard Chamberlain also co-stars as Octavius Caeser, who avenges Caeser's death in a battle with Cassius and Brutus."
