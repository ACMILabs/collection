        "James Stewart and Carole Lombard star in this romantic drama which ends happily ever after. John and Jane Mason begin their newly wedded life with a series of problems. John's mother is angry because Jane does not meet her expectations, and John's boss places enormous pressures on them. They are forced to live in a tiny apartment with Mrs. Mason and struggle to make ends meet. After their baby arrives, they separate as the strain becomes too much for their marriage. However, the baby's serious illness draws them together again, heals the breach between them and turns John's mother and boss into allies."
