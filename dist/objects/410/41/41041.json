        "Walter Mitty is a dreamer. To escape the humdrum of his life and his shrewish mother, Walter's secret life is rich and exciting by comparison. Walter's daydream personnas include a western gunslinger, a world-famous surgeon, a RAF pilot and a Mississippi river boat gambler. A mysterious and beautiful blonde is always by his side. Suddenly Walter is thrust into a real-life adventure when he comes to the rescue of a ravishing blonde trying to escape a gang of jewel thieves. Danny Kaye brings all his comic genius into the role of Walter Mitty and is supported by Boris Karloff and Virginia Mayo. Based on the renown short story by James Thurber, this is a comic fantasy which can be enjoyed by all."
