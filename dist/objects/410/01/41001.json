        "This is the nostalgic and heartwarming story of young Father O'Malley (Bing Crosby), sent by his Bishop to help Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald) at the mortgage-ridden St Dominic's parish. Initially, the younger priest's unconventional methods antagonise his gruff superior, but eventually Father O'Malley wins over the elderly priest, organises a gang of unruly kids into a choir, and rescues the parish from debt. Bing Crosby sings the famed songs: \"Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra\" and \"Swinging on a star\". This outstanding film won 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Bing Crosby) and Best Supporting Actor (Barry Fitzgerald)."
