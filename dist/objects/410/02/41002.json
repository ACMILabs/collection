        "The year is 1932 and it is the height of the Depression. In order to win prize money various couples sign on for a gruelling dance marathon lasting over 1,000 hours and in which they will be treated as performing animals, prodded into increasingly desparate acts in order to survive the continuous dancing. This is a stunning and deeply evocative film about a period in American history when desperation forced people into cruelty and debasement. The film features a stunning performance by Jane Fonda as the bitter survivor, Gloria, an outstanding performance by Gig Young as the cynical MC and brilliant direction by Sydney Pollack. Fonda's performance elevated her reputation as the leading English-language actress of her generation. Faultless in script, direction and performances, \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" is still a remarkably moving and disquieting film."
