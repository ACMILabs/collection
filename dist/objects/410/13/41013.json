        "The most influential filmmaker of the Third Reich and last great surviving image maker of the Nazis, Leni Riefenstahl is a legend with many faces, both admired and loathed. Rather than being content with updating old prejudices, this documentary approaches the most famous female film director in the world without preconceptions and attempts to decontruct her myth and look at it afresh. Was she a feminist pioneer or a woman of evil? Interviews with Leni Riefenstahl are subtitled in English."
