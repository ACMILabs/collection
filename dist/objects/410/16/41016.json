        "Stelarc is a unique performance artist, internationally renown for \"events\" he stages. In these, he suspends his nude body with fish hooks in various situations or uses a bionic arm and helmet which give him laser eyes. These live works of art, with the use of technology are shockingly magnificent in their audacity and innovation. This in-depth interview conducted in 1991, features footage and photographs from the various Stelarc \"events\", and reveals the reasons and ideas behind them. Stelarc's curiousity and vision have enabled him to make some unusual predicitions about the future of human kind."
