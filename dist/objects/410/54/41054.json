        "Peter Sellers debuts in the role that made him a legend and launched a number of sequels. As the bumbling Inspector Clouseau, Seller's own particular brand of comedy comes to the fore. The film takes its title from the rare \"Pink Panther\" Diamond owned by Princess Dala (Claudia Cardinale). Debonaire David Niven is intent on stealing the jewel and Clouseau must foil this plot. The film also stars Capucine as Clouseau's none too faithful wife and Robert Wagner as her lover. Henry Mancini's theme tune and the cartooned figure of the Pink Panther himself add acclaim to this hilarious film."
