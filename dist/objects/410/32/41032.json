        "The moving story of Father Flanagan (Spencer Tracy) who battled the courts, the community but mostly the odds to build Boys Town in Nebraska, a home for abandoned, homeless boys, regardless of race, creed or colour. When the tough, rebellious Whitey March (Mickey Rooney) arrives, Father Flanagan faces the challenge of his life. He must fight not only to save the self-destructive youth, but to save Boys Town itself. Spencer Tracy won his second Academy Award for his performance and Mickey Rooney excels as Whitey, proving his strength as a talented dramatic actor. Eleanore Griffin and Dore Schary also earned Oscars for their original story. Co-starring Henry Hull, Leslie Fenton and Gene Reynolds. \"Boys Town\" will steal your heart and leave you with something even better - inspiration."
