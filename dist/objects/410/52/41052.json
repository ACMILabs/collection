        "Adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's \"Rain\", a steamy story of sex, sin and salvation in the tropics. Set in the 1940s, it is the story of a bawdy nightclub entertainer, Sadie (Rita Hayworth) and Alfred Davidson (Jose Ferrer), a puritanical preacher waging an anti-sin campaign in the Pacific Islands. When Sadie falls in love with a straight-arrow marine (Aldo Ray), she seeks Davidson's help in reforming her life. Tragically, the repressed cleric reacts with disbelief and, ultimately violence."
