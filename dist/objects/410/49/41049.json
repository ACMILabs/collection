        "Johnny Depp is Wade \"Cry-baby\" Walker, a cool, tough but sensitive teenage delinquent. His ability to shed a single tear drives the girls wild. Cry-baby and his friends live on the outer edges of \"normal society\". Their \"badness\" attracts the beautiful rich but square Allison and she is drawn into their rockabilly, fast car world. The soundtrack is excellent, and the rock 'n roll era of the 1950's is vividly recreated. Johnny Depp is appealing as Cry-baby and is well supported by co-stars Amy Locane, Susan Tyrell, Iggy Pop, Ricky Lake, Traci Lords and Polly Bergen. John Waters style is firmly stamped on this film as he recreates a nostalgia for an era."
