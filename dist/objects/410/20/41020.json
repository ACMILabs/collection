        "The conflict arises in the Canadian rural scene where the pressures of rising prices, competitive markets, higher production costs, force farmers to abandon their traditional views of farming as a way of life, for one that places it on high levels of business. Shows how a father, holding on to old ways, and son holding onto new, resolve differences in such a way as to enable them to keep abreast of advancement in agriculture. Based on the short story by Charles Israel."
