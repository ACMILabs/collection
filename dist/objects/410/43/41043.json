        "Newly released from prison, bank robber \"Mad Dog\" Roy Earle (Humphrey Bogart) agrees to one last caper, out of gratitude to an old gangland pal. However, Earle has changed after eight years in gaol. He is torn between his hard-boiled, brutal side and more caring, compassionate feelings, which ultimately cause his downfall. When getaway plans misfire, Earle flees to the High Sierras. In a defiant last stand he is trapped at 11,000 feet with an army of police waiting below."
