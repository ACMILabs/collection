        "Episode of Series \"Basic music industry skills\". Introduction to the Music Industry. Module 4.1. A fascinating look at the development of Australian rock music from its humble beginnings during Johnny O'Keefe's \"Wild One\" days in the mid 1950's, the struggles to gain recognition at home and overseas in the '60's and '70's to the international success of Australian acts in the '80's and the diversity of styles in the '90's. Through personal accounts, photographs and music video clips we examine, decade by decade, the music styles, fashions, changing technology and trends in Australian rock music including legendary performers such as The Easybeats, Russell Morris, AC/DC, Skyhooks, Cold Chisel and Midnight Oil."
