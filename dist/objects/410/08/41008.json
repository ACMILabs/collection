        "Uncle Tom, Sambo, Simon Legree: their names are American bywords and all are characters in this acclaimed film version of Harriet Beecher Stowe's immortal classic of American literature. This shocking indictment of slavery in the American South, is based on the book Abraham Lincoln credited with starting the Civil War. It is an unforgettable presentation of the peace loving Tom, forced to submit to a sadistic master, the evil Simon Legree. The helpless slaves are raped, tortured, humiliated and eventually driven to rebel against their oppressors. \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" accurately depicts the attitudes of white 19th Century Americans towards the institution of slavery and dramatizes, in heart-breaking detail, the tragic breakup of black Kentucky families sold \"down the river.\" It is a brutal, passionate indictment of American slavery and the explosive racial hatred that spawned it. Starring John Kitzmiller, Herbert Lom, Olivia Moorefield, Mary Ann Jensen and Prentiss Moulden."
