        "Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy tale tells the story of a tiny girl called Thumbelina. One magical night she meets Prince Cornelius, an enchanted fairy as tiny as herself, and she is sure she has found true love. Before their romance can blossom, she is kidnapped by a show business family of toads, waylaid by a scheming beetle and betrothed to a befuddled mole. Thumbelina's journey home is fraught with adventure, but at last she comes to believe that if she follows her heart, nothing is impossible. Music by Barry Manilow. Features the voices of Jodie Benson, Carole Channing and John Hurt."
