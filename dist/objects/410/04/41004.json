        "The courage of Ben and Ellen Beel and their 11-year-old daughter, Matilda, has seen them through countless misfortunes in a country plagued by the harsh elements. Drought is again parching the Australian outback with devastating consequences, and having barely survived the recession of the early 1990's, the Bells now face an ever tumbling wool price dwindling their profits and their sheep dying of starvation. When all seems lost and they must leave their beloved home to move to the city, the never-say-die Aussie spirit triumphs - no worries!"
