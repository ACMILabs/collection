        "The making of \"Apocalypse now\" was almost the breaking of famed director Francis Ford Coppola. For three years Coppola drove and dragged his actors, including Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, and his crew through torturous conditions to complete his epic portrayal of the Vietnam War. Recreating the savagery of war left its mark - Sheen overcame a heart attack to finish the film and Coppola privately questioned his sanity. This riveting, funny and at times shocking film charts the progress of Coppola's dream, which he personally funded to completion. It is brutally honest and includes improvisation, often drug-induced, which made it to the big screen as \"brilliant performances\". Features exclusively restored footage previously deleted from \"Apocalypse now\", \"Hearts of darkness\" is a tragedy, comedy and disaster rolled into one."
