        "A mammoth cast includes Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle, Sid Caeser, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney, Dick Shawn, Phil Silvers, Terry Thomas, Jonathan Winters, Edie Adams, Dorothy Provine, Peter Falk and Jimmy Durante. Kramer's film recalls the zany slapstick era of silent films. Durante is a dying millionaire who gives a secret clue to the location of his buried fortune. Everyone is out to beat everyone else to the loot and nothing is done in moderation. Every obstacle is put in the path of the treasure-seekers and dealt with in unexpected or illogical ways. With this bevy of comic actors, no single performance shines and the laughs abound."
