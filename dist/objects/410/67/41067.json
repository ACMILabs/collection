        "Kirk Douglas made his film debut and Barbara Stanwyck starred as the malevolent Martha Ivers in this melodrama cum thriller which engages the viewer until its gripping climax. A strong supporting cast includes Lizabeth Scott, Van Heflin and Judith Anderson. Martha Ivers is a wicked but powerful woman who runs the town of Iverson after inheriting the family fortune. However, Martha has a deadly secret which threatens to ruin her life. As a teenager, Martha was responsible for the murder of her domineering Aunt so she could elope with her lover and the past has a way of catching up her despite her efforts to keep it buried."
