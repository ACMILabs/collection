        "John Young is an expert on Australia's Birds of Paradise. These rare birds are difficult to track and we follow John's endeavours to record the mating rituals and displays of these birds. Bird artist William Cooper's illustrations are considered the finest in this genre of painting. Sir David Attenborough narrates this program on a truly great artist."
