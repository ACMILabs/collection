        "A young Marine is brutalised by two fellow Marines at the United States Navy Base in Cuba. The bashing ends in the young Marine's death. It looks like a simple case but a methodical US Navy lawyer (Demi Moore) is keen to investigate the killing, convinced that the bashing was a result of a \"Code Red\", an unofficial system of bastardry which aims to convert the young marines into effective fighting machines. \"A Few Good Men\" is a detective story, a film about responsibility and conduct, and it features some powerful and adrenalin-pumping courtroom drama. Tom Cruise is suitably boyish and charming as a maverick Navy lawyer and Jack Nicholson is outstanding as a US General arrogantly convinced of his superiority and power."
