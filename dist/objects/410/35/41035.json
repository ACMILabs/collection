        "This is the last and perhaps best Western directed by John Ford, featuring a stellar cast including Richard Widmark, Karl Malden, Sal Mineo, Edward G. Robinson and James Stewart as the light-hearted, quick-fingered Wyatt Earp. A small band of Cheyenne Indians attempt to escape from their barren Oklahoma reservation, over 1,500 treacherous miles to their own lush Wyoming lands, from which they were transported after surrendering to the army in 1877. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Colour Cinematography, this is a beautiful and powerful film that stunningly combines a profound and passionate story of the mistreatment of American Indians with some of the most magnificent and energetic Western lore ever put to the screen."
