        "Welcome to the 23rd Century, a perfect world of total pleasure. The only thing you can't have is your 30th birthday. On Lastday, senior citizens must go through the ritual of \"renewal\" where a fiery carousel spins them into oblivion. Michael York is Logan, a loyal citizen whose job is to seek and destroy \"runners\", sceptics who seek to escape the ceremonial execution. Fast approaching his own time of renewal, he becomes a runner in order to seek refuge from his hedonistic, automated world. Based on the novel \"Logans run\" by William F. Nolan, this classic science fiction film, distinguished by awesome spectacle, won an Academy Award for Best Special Effects and was the first film to use laser beam holography."
