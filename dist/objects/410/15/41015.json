        "In March 1988, Burmese students took to the streets in the capital Rangoon as a protest against the oppressive rule of Prime Minister Ne Win. Ten thousand protesters were killed in what was perceived to be a typical response by Government forces. Many students, fighting for survival, fled into the jungle in order to find freedom. Sophie and Lyndall Barry, two young Melbourne film makers, intended to stay only a matter of days, but remained for a year recording the plight of these students on the Thai/Burma border. A compelling documentary providing insight into one of the politically sensitive regions of Asia."
