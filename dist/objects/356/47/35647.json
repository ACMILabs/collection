        "This film reveals evidence which clearly shows that the Portuguese were on Australian soil long before either the Dutch or the English - in fact 250 years before Captain Cook. It is a story of spies and political espionage, resulting from the mantle of secrecy the Portuguese threw around their explorations and discoveries, and the efforts of their European counterparts to steal their maps."
