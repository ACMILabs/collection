        "Four children's musical favourites make up this colourful series which features the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and some of New Zealand's leading actors and dancers. \"Tubby the tuba\" tells the story of a tuba who is the ugly duckling of the orchestra. \"The Sorcerer's apprentice\" Bored with the daily chores, an apprentice sorcerer seizes the opportunity to apply sorcery to his housework and ends up in trouble. \"Peter and the wolf\" Prokofiev's musical introduction to the orchestra tells of Peter and his first encounter with a wolf. \"Carnival of the animals\" Imaginatively costumed animal characters saunter and cavort in a visually exciting production of the well loved music of Saint-Saens."
