        "The first non-fiction feature about Australia's women of the surf tells the history of women's surfing in Australia from 1915. It moves through the big board era to the present day, with women becoming a surfing entity in their own right. The video shows the women surf riders surfing their own calender and tells of their hopes, fears and pleasures as they ride the waves."
