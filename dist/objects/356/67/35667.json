        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Australian wilderness series\". Part three of a series of six documentaries that examine the wilderness areas of Australia. Belinda Wright and Stanley Breeden are naturalists and photographers who work for the National Geographic Society. As they become fascinated with the \"Wandjina\" rock paintings, the viewer also gains some insight into the deep, spiritual relationship the Aboriginal people have with the land. A Teacher's guide accompanies the video."
