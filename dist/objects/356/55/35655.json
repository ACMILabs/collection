        "Universal Provider is a documentary film about a monumental building, an Australian landmark for 80 years. This film uses archival images to depict the building's construction, interiors, employees and the manufacturing adjuncts to the Hordern empire. There is also archival film relating to imperialism and nationalism as two major supports for the Hordern image."
