        "This film is firmly within the genre of racecourse melodrama. On the prosperous stud farm of Kangarooie, the squatter's daughter, Bobbie, is torn between rival suitors whilst her weak-willed brother is embroiled with racketeers and a high society vamp. After much complex criminal activity in the stables before the big race the heroine herself rides her horse to victory."
