        "Regarded as a landmark in American cinema, and a film which pioneered depiction of the \"irony\" of war. The directional quality has been compared with Eisenstein for its biting commentary and emotional outcry against war. Its bravura direction fixed in millions of viewers minds the image of youth in the trenches. Lead star, Lew Ayres, became a true-to-life conscientious objector of war after portraying its moving scenes."
