        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". In 1954, radio personality Jack Davey was the most famous person in Australia. During the same year Jack entered the first around Australia car race, the Redex Trial. On the road in north Western Australia his car fell apart under the strain. He was disqualified from the race after taking a short cut and missing a checkpoint. Disillusioned but not defeated, Jack decided he was to be the first back in Sydney regardless of whether he was still in the race or not."
