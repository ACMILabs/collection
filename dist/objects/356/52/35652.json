        "A documentary about an overlooked aspect of adoption, the experience of mothers who have surrendered or given up their children. Through the personal accounts of five women, it explores and exposes what the legally enforced secrecy surrounding adoption hides, that the majority of women who relinquish their children face seemingly unresolvable shame and grief."
