        "The title of this documentary is taken from the name that well-known Australian artist Peter Tyndall gives to all his work - `Detail'. While Peter is best known as a painter, he has also produced drawings, comic-strips, photographs, super 8 films, computer imagery, music and live performance pieces. Examining his work in a wide range of mediums since 1971, the film is also a thoughtful look at the creative process and development of an artist's work. An excellent discussion film for upper secondary school."
