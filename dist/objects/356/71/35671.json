        "Bushfires are an inevitable hazard in Australia. The tranquillity of the bush belies its potential to burn fiercely when conditions are suitable. This program shows how bushfires start fires in buildings, how embers, radiation and flame, aided by wind cause ignition and destruction of buildings; that embers are the most important means of ignition; that well-designed buildings have a very good chance of survival; and that such buildings will provide a safer place of refuge for people in bushfires."
