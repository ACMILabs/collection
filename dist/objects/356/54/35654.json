        "You learn till you die ... it's the only way. Diminishing mental faculties are not a necessary outcome of old age. This heartening film focuses on a number of people for whom retirement and old age have only served as a springboard to new activities and skills. It clearly demonstrates that stimulation is an important part of keeping independent and motivated."
