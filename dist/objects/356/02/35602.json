        "Self-employed people describe their work and explain why they are self employed. Their occupations vary from handyman, stallholders, to a proprietor of a chain of jeans stores. All of these businesses started with relatively small amounts of capital. The video also outlines essential steps to be taken by people considering self-employment and lists contacts who can give useful advice."
