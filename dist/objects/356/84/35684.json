        "Frank Hurley (1885-1962) was firmly established by 1925 as Australia's most famous photographer. His nature portraits became a model for many local filmmakers who tried to emulate his high technical standards and good romantic manner. After filming in many exotic locations, such as Antarctica and Papua New Guinea, Hurley remained in Australia in the 1930's to become the dominant figure in Australian documentary, making short industrial films for government and private sponsors, such as this film, \"A Nation is Built\". Sponsored by the New South Wales government to mark 150 years of white Australian settlement."
