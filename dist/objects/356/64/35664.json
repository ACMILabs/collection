        "Episode number 6 of Series \"Australian wilderness series\". This program is the last in a series of 6 documentaries that examine the wilderness areas of Australia. Mirka Mora is an eccentric artist, French by birth, who had never before ventured into the wilderness nor slept in a tent. Along with Tim McCartney Snape, the first Australian ever to reach the summit of Mt. Everest, and a Nepalese Sherpa, she travels into the Kosciusko wilderness. Mirka's unique and expressive personality helps viewers see and experience this wilderness from an artist's perspective. A Teacher's guide accompanies the video."
