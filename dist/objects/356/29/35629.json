        "Episode of Series \"Famous Five\". A super holiday - living in tents on the high moors, away from everybody. Of course Old Luffy, who chased insects, would be near at hand to keep an eye on them but so long as he didn't interfere. Then they heard about the spook train that came creeping out of the eerie tunnel darkness - a mystery that simply had to be solved! How glad Anne was to have the dreamy Mr. Luffy to turn to when things became really difficult. Rated: G"
