        "This film, starring \"Snowy Baker\", is about John Harland, a pugilist turned parson, who is posted to the town of Kangaroo where a gang of thugs has driven the Church out of the area. Harland defies the gang by holding a service in the Town Hall but it is disrupted by threats of violence. In defeat, Harland seeks a job as a stationhand and discovers that his sweetheart, Muriel owns a neighbouring property and that her overseer is none other than Red Jack Braggan, the leader of the gang. Red Jack kidnaps Muriel, but after many fights and chases she is rescued by Harland and the town is rid of its rowdy element."
