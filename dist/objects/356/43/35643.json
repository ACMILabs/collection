        "Barney Palmer was eight years old when his haunting began, Whispers in the waves, images in the mirror, voices in his dreams. Is it the ghost of his great Uncle Barnaby or is it the ghost of somebody not yet dead? Someone, somewhere in this world or in the next is promising to carry him away. For Barney, the answer lies close within the strength of his home."
