        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". Mary McKillop was working as a tutor in 1861 when she decided to dedicate herself to the education of the poor, and devote herself to God. She became Sister Mary of the Cross of the Order of St Joseph, which was Australia's first religious Order. Unlike other Orders, it placed itself outside the control of the local Bishop, which caused great feelings of resentment. Mary McKillop's story is an extraordinary example of the power of the human spirit."
