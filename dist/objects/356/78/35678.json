        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". Clyde Fenton was a skilled aviator and brilliant surgeon. Together with fellow doctor, Cecil Cook, the Northern Territories Chief Medical Officer, he pioneered the creation of the Flying Doctor Service. The Doctor Service was a great medical success but ran foul of the Department of Civil Aviation. Fenton battled with the Department and he soon found himself in court fighting for his right to fly and carry on with his work. Fenton soon became a folk hero to the people of the Northern Territory."
