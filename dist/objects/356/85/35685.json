        "Made as a patriotic recruiting film, endorsed and assisted by the Department of Defence. This is the story of the careers of two brothers, one who has already enlisted in the Army and another, William, who soon follows his example. The film shows Will being trained and while on his final leave, persuading his pal to enlist. His patriotism and enthusiasm for the war is simple and unquestioning, and he is the pride of his wealthy family and sweetheart. They hold a banquet in his honour and he is clearly established as an upperclass hero who will doubtless be good officer material in the Army. Once his boat leaves for Egypt, the progress of his story is unknown, for the remainder of the film is no longer in existence. Cast, Fred Francis, Guy Hastings, Loma Rossmore, C. Throoby, Ruth Wainwright."
