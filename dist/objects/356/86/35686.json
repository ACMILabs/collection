        "Episode of Series \"Reel Australia\". When the outback station of Wallaby is gripped by drought, the proud old owner, Jo Galloway, can do nothing to prevent the repossession of his land by the bank. In poverty, he moves to the city with his wife and daughter, to stay with his son Gilbert, only to learn that Gilbert has been embezzling the family funds to lead a life of luxury and decadence. Many melodramatic events follow, including a murder and a suicide, before the family can return, reunited, to the station, and the rain starts to fall once more."
