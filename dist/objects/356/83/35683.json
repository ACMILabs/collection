    "description": [
        "Featuring highlights from the bushranging career of the Kelly brothers, this 1906 film openly presents the Kelly's as gallant heroes, with the police as the enemy, and makes no attempt to apologise for the cheerful celebration of outlawry. In the spirit of myth making, the film refrains from humiliating Ned by showing his execution (an obligatory display of a just reward in later films) and the film closes on a note of sadness with his capture by the police. Cast includes Elizabeth Tait, John Tait."
