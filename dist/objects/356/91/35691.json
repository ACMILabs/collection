        "Painted Daughters is a romantic melodrama about high society and the \"flapper\" generation. It tells the story of Mary Elliot and Courtland Nixon, dancing partners in the stage show \"Floradora\". Mary forsakes Courtland and marries a wealthy admirer, who soon goes bankrupt and suicides, leaving her to raise a little daughter, Maryon. Following in her mother's footsteps Maryon eventually finds success in a theatrical career. A press agent, Ernest Glenning, decides to gather the original cast of \"Floradora\" for a charity performance, and Mary again meets Courtland. After the Show they are both injured in an apartment fire and from their hospital beds, by telephone, they arrange their wedding to coincide with that of Maryon and Ernest."
