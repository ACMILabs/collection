        "Episode number 1 of Series \"Long Bow Trilogy\". An intimate look at daily life in Long Bow - a village 600 kilometres south-west of Beijing. Ancient traditions persist - we see an elaborate funeral, a country fair, a local animal market and an open air opera. But changes have come to Long Bow, with the shift from collective to individual farming. A sense of dramatic change accompanies the simple rhythms of rural life. Part one of The Long Bow trilogy."
