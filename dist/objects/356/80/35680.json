        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". One of the greatest symbols of Australia at war is that of Private John Simpson and the Battle of Gallipoli. Simpson and his donkey \"Duffy\" were a familiar sight on the shores of Gallipoli as they worked day and night carrying wounded allied soldiers from the frontline to the beach. He was attributed with saving the lives of hundreds, his tenderness and concern for the wounded were renowned. His death was inevitable and he knew it. Private John Simpson and his donkey have gone down in history as a bastion of valour amidst a world at war."
