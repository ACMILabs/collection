        "Tchaikovsky wrote \"Swan Lake\" as a commission from the Bolshoi Ballet Theatre in 1875. The full ballet was not produced however, until 1895, after the composer's death. It captivated audiences then, as it has done ever since, becoming the best loved ballet. This production by the Royal Ballet is descended almost directly from the original St. Petersburg production, with the addition of choreography by Ninette de Valois, Rudolf Nureyev and Sir Frederick Ashton. Performed by Natalia Makarova and Anthony Dowell in the leading roles at The Royal Opera House Covent Garden. There is a brief introduction to the history of the ballet."
