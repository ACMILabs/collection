        "Episode of Series \"The wonderful world of Paddington Bear\". Disaster strikes the Brown household when Paddington is told he must attend school. This dramatic news leads to a series of adventures with unexpected consequences. Having accidentally mislaid a tin of worms while serving the school dinner, he is banished to the headmaster's study, where he falls asleep and dreams he is taking part in the school concert to be held that afternoon. After a virtuoso performance, first as a violinist and then as a Cancan dancer, he wakes up to find all is forgiven and he doesn't need to attend school ever again."
