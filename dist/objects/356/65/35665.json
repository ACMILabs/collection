        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Australian wilderness series\". This video is Part 5 in a series of 6 documentaries that examine the wilderness areas of Australia. A child returns from the future, a time when forests no longer exist and we see the rainforest and its most unusual inhabitants through her eyes. She grows to love the forest and cannot understand some of the things she sees happening. This is an imaginative and fascinating story which emphasises the delicate balance of nature, and how easily it can be destroyed. A Teacher's guide accompanies the video."
