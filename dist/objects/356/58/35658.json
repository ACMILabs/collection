        "In this film we see why the East Timor question is too important to go away. \"The Story of East Timor\" begins in a neglected corner of the Portuguese colonial empire. In Lisbon, the unexpected fall of the dictatorship projects the people of East Timor into world politics. It is to be a terrible experience. \"Buried Alive\" exposes some of the ugly truths about the nature of Western democracy, the world media and Third World Colonialism. Rated: PG"
