        "A portrait of aboriginal spokesman, story writer and distinguished playwright, Jack Davis. Positioned as he is at the end of a long line of oral story tellers and at the beginning of a blossoming written tradition, Jack Davis is unique. Since 1979, he has devoted his life to writing and has been able to combine the rigours of writing with the ever insistent demands of family and aboriginal politics. In 1989 he was granted an artistic endowment award in recognition of his contribution to Australian arts."
