        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Long Bow Trilogy\". Despite the tremendous advances women in China have made, serious problems continue. Long Bow women talk about love, marriage, work, birth control, birth customs and the now outlawed custom of foot binding. Truly moving interviews with a Long Bow woman and her mother-in-law draw us into their lives."
