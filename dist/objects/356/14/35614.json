        "Dot, the little daughter of a settler in the Australian outback loses her way in the bush. Terrified by the dark shadows and unfamiliar sounds of the bush, she is soon befriended by a big kangaroo. Dot travels in the kangaroo's pouch on an adventure packed journey. She meets many bush animals and birds - koala, platypus, kookaburra and other indigenous Australian creatures. She runs into danger as she and the kangaroo are chased by angry dingoes. There is tension and excitement until, with the help of the bush creatures, Dot finally finds her home and the kangaroo returns to her natural environment."
