        "Episode of Series \"Willesee's Australians\". Willesee's Australians portrays the stories of some of Australia's heroes and heroines; some virtually unrecognised, others known as significant figures during their own lifetimes. Following World Wars 1 and 11 large parcels of Australian farming land were purchased, divided up into small blocks and given to returned soldiers by the Federal Government. Many of the young soldiers and their families who won the land were inexperienced, untrained and undercapitalised. This is the story of the Durkin family - their hopes, triumphs and struggles as they make the most of their new lifestyle."
