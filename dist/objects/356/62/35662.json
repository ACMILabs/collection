        "Roads to Xanadu is an intriguing investigation of the dynamic interchange between East and West in the making of the modern world. Episode 3: \"Dreams of Wealth and Power\" investigates the different responses of China and Japan to the threat posed by Europe. Both countries recognised the need to modernise in some form, but it was the Japanese who forged ahead at such a speed that within forty years of opening their doors to the West, they were able to challenge the might of Imperial China, and even that of European colonial powers within Asia. Episode 4: \"The Colour of the Cat\" is the last episode of the series and it explores China's most recent past and speculates about it's future. Rated: G"
