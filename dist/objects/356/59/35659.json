        "The star of \"Double Concerto\" is the brilliant Australian pianist Roger Woodward. His inspiration and fellow musician is the equally brilliant Polish violinist, Wanda Wilkomirska. Together they play the double concerto \"Southern Cross\", a concerto written especially for them by Australia's most internationally acclaimed composer, Barry Conyingham. The film follows Roger and Wanda in rehearsal, in concert and in rambling walks along the sea shores. They discuss their music, their politics and their personal lives."
