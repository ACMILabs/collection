        "WHALES - a film as big, beautiful and complex as its subjects. Throughout history the destinies of men and whales have been closely linked. From primitive peoples, pitted against these mighty creatures with just a harpoon and cunning, whaling meant survival. In the 19th century whaling epitomised adventure, excitement and discovery. Today, whaling means big business, power and money. Now its the whales who excite our curiosity and demand our compassion. \"Whales\" is a thought-provoking look at our complex feelings of love, hate, necessity and fear towards the animals who share our planet as we struggle to balance our needs against their survival."
