        "Episode of Series \"The wonderful world of Paddington Bear\". Mr. Brown's birthday is drawing near and Paddington is worried because he can't afford to buy him a present. His efforts to raise money lead him into a series of misadventures, first as a waiter at a society dinner, then as the dancing partner of the hostess, Mrs. Smith-Chomley, in a televised dance competition at the local charity ball. Much to everyone's astonishment he and his partner sweep the floor and win the cash prize! Paddington's troubles are over and he is able to grant Mr. Brown his most unusual birthday wish."
