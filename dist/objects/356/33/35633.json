        "Another award winning title by Frederic Back, creator of the prize winning animated film CRAC, who is showcased in this new half hour film which pays tribute to a man whose toil and dedication brought life to a barren, desolate region high in the French Alps. A triumphant testament to one man's indomitable spirit. \"The Man Who Planted Trees\" is a thought provoking tale, a visually stunning tour de force, from a genius in the fine art of animated cinema. Winner of more than 25 awards, including Academy Award, 1988. Narrated by Christopher Plummer and based on a story by Jean Giono."
