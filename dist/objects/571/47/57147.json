        "Mushrooms are deceiving. They can play tricks with your head. In this animation film, mushrooms are a powerful metaphor. Their metamorphosis suggests that life is a vast \"food chain\". If this is indeed our reality, can we, the consumers, escape being consumed? A film that serves up a riveting \"plat du jour\". Awards: Zagreb; Chicago"
