        "Dramatization of how a family living in high-rise inner city flats manage to cope with caring for each other when first their mother and then their father abandon them. Provides many points which could act as stimulus for discussion including perspectives on family relationships, contrasts on single parent and conventional nuclear families, welfare workers and their role, supportive community members, and the warm relationship of the central characters."
