        "Rolf Harris presents dramatised stories to a group of children to teach them to say \"no\" to others when they feel something is wrong. Aimed at preventing child sexual abuse and demonstrates situations where children might be in danger from people they know and trust as well as from strangers. Suggests ways of avoiding potentially harmful situations and counsels children to describe what has happened to a caring adult."
