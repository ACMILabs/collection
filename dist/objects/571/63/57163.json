        "A Marx Brothers movie combining humor and music. The plot, which shifts from a sanitorium to a race track, introduces a horse doctor masquerading as sanitorium director, a jockey who encourages his horse to win by showing it a picture of the man it hates, a vendor of bad racing tips and a vampire dressed in revealing clothing. Also stars Maureen O'Sullivan."
