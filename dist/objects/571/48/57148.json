        "This is a didactic film in disguise. A progression of brilliant geometric shapes bombard the screen to the insistent beat of drums. The filmmaker programmed a computer to coordinate a highly complex operation involving an electronic beam of light, colour filters and a camera. This animation film, without words, is designed to expose the power of the cinematic medium, and to illustrate the abstract nature of time. Animation by Rene Jodoin with assistance in computer animation by Doris Kochanek and Daniel Langlois. Music score by Normand Roger, sound by Louis Hone."
