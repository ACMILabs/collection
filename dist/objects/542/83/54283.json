        "The Blackbutt, a majestic gum is felled. The removal of the tree was necessary as a fence nailed to it allowed termites to enter, nest and rot the tree with their activities. The gum is shown in all its beauty; then the preparations for its removal - dismantling the fence and the electricity wires; digging to expose the roots; lopping the branches; cutting the roots. The final act of felling comes as the winch tightens the steel ropes. The termite nest is found in the base and their activities seen in the rotten, gnarled branches. There is no commentary, but specially selected music augments the visual impressions. Suitable for primary school level."
