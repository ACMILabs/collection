        "An extract from what is considered to be a masterpiece of Japanese director, Kenji Mizoguchi. Set in sixteenth century Japan, its theme is that of the humble commoner who aspires to wealth and glory only to find them, when achieved, a delusion leading to agony and shame. In Japanese with English subtitles. Suitable for upper secondary level."
