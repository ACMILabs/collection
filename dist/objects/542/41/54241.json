        "The National Library in Canberra is the repository of some of the most distinguished works of art in Australia. Among them is a set of twelve stained glass screens by Leonard French. Taking the planets as his theme, French designed a set of screens which drew on the craggy beauty of medieval stained glass for their inspiration. Narrated by Leonard French."
