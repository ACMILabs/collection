        "Looks at the life of a young English migrant living in an inner city area of Melbourne. Shows him at school, at home, at work in his part-time job selling newspapers and at the Newsboys' Club. Presents a glimpse of Melbourne in the mid-60's when city people appear to be pressured by time, living on top of each other while Australia has so much wide open space to offer. In families, everyone helps, but time unfortunately waits for no-one."
