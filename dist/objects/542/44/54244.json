        "States in the north of Australia are the home of the Queensland Fruit Fly, the predator which each year can destroy million of dollars worth of fruit and vegetables. Shows the precautions which are taken to keep the fruit fly out of Victoria and the methods used to control it once it is discovered. Stresses the need for the co-operation of every traveller entering Victoria by land, sea or air. Photography by Ted Davis. Narrated by Terry McDermott."
