        "This film demonstrates how the study of physics improves when students have the opportunity to work out the problems actively. Shown is a classroom-turned-laboratory, where films or film loops permit experiments to be staged on screen under control of the students. By starting or stopping films at will, any particular image or development can be measured on the screen and plotted on the students' work sheets. Simple equipment for physics experiments is also shown."
