        "Hitchcock's 50th film, set during the Cold War, repeats his successful espionage-thriller theme. Paul Newman portrays American nuclear physicist Michael Armstrong who fakes defection to East Germany in order to obtain Communist defence secrets. His fiance and assistant, Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews) aroused by Armstrong's suspicious behaviour yet unaware of his intentions, follows him behind the iron curtain. When she realises her fiance's intentions, she joins him in his effort to obtain secret information and return safely to the United States. Also stars Lila Kedrova, Hansjoerg Felmy, David Opatoshu, and Ludwig Donath. Cinematography by John F. Warren. Written by Brian Moore. Music by John Addison."
