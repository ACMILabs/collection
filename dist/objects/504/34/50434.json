        "This timely film raises the question of who should be entrusted with the care of the elderly and chronically ill--government-run or privately owned nursing homes. The Business of Aging looks into the quality of nursing home care in Canada and presents a sobering picture of residents caught in the financial squeeze as operators attempt to cut overheads at the expense of their patients."
