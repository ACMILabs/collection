        "Set in 1999 Panama at the time of the handover of the canal to America, Geoffrey Rush plays Harry Pendel, an ex-con turned tailor to the towns elite. Harry meets Andrew Osnals (Pierce Brosnan), a British spy who convinces Harry to become his eyes and ears in regards to information on the political goings on in the area. What Andrew does not realise is that Harry is a master storyteller and not all that he claims to be, providing questionable information that is going to have dire consequences to all those involved in Harry's web of deceit."
