        "A hard-hitting film suggesting that new attitudes and practices are needed in Canada's fishing industry to protect the lives and property of those who work at sea. Accidents due to the unsafe condition of boats, bad habits of seamanship, fire or defects in safety equipment can be avoided. A ship safety inspector and instructors at New Brunswick's School of Fisheries and Newfoundland's College of Fisheries show where the roots of disaster can lie."
