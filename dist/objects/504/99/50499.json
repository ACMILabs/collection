        "Episode number 21 of Series \"Carry on\". The tale starts on the wedding night of King Henry VIII (Sidney James) after the failed attempts of his last wife to produce an heir. His new wife, Marie of Normandy (Joan Sims), with an obsession for garlic seems equally unpromising, and the King's manhood at stake. Enter the buxom Bettina (Barbara Windsor) who Henry VIII just has to have, and a mix of the usual sidekicks; Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas Cromwell (Kenneth Williams), his equerry Sir Roger de Loggerley (Charles Hawtrey) and Cardinal Wolsey (Terry Scott). When 'the virginal' queen is found to be pregnant the calamitous hunt is on to find and behead the head that dared before the king."
