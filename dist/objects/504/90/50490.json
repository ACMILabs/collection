        "This entertaining animation tells the story of a strange evening in the night of a happy husband and wife. The nightmare begins with a child like creature landing head first in their house, its feet flaming. At first they are very happy with this odd foundling and like many new parents take numerous photos of the arrival. Aided by a telescope, the baby communicates with its own - chaos is inevitable. The wife leaves, taking the dog. The sad man is left a great mess. The theme of this comedic short is the trials and joys brought about with the arrival of a child."
