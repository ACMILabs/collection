        "In search for meaning, U.S. sixties band The Monkees roll from one adventure to another in this hilarious plotless movie that manages to sum up the iconography of the day. Through an explosion of images from the sixties, the band bursts through with their silly antics and witty asides on a trajectory to pastiche some of the spirit the pop culture gave birth to in the 20th century. With a cast that includes The Monkees (Peter Tork, David Jones, Mickey Dolenz, Michael Nesmith), Victor Mature, Frank Zappa and Sonny Liston, 'Head' manages to turn everything back onto itself."
