        "Examines the complex range of problems involved in Third World urban transport, from cost and available technology to the different needs of the industrialized middle class and the urban poor, and proposes some surprising solutions. This film explores how transportation planners and city governments try to solve the problems associated with the growth of cities, especially the increased pressure on existing transportation systems."
