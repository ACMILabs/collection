        "All of Our Lives examines the reasons why many women face economic hardship and emotional isolation in old age. It is a film about past dreams and, for the most part, unexpected realities. Elderly women from a variety of backgrounds and circumstances recall their girlhood ideals, and contrast them with the experiences of their actual adult lives. The film challenges audiences to re-evaluate the undervalued and often \"invisible\" world of child-rearing and work in the home."
