        "Ron is an adolescent who spells trouble - for himself and those close to him. His friends taunt Ron, calling him gutless, and he reacts badly to this peer pressure. A neighbor calls him delinquent. His mother, who is single, is having a hard time dealing with him. Because Ron is walking a tightrope between proving himself and finding his place, disaster and heartbreak seem inevitable. This is a story of tension, compassion, and coming of age."
