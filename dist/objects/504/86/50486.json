        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Season one of 'The X-Files' concluded with the government shutting down the X-files project leaving agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) relieved of their special duties. At the commencement of Season two Scully and Mulder have been deliberately kept apart by unknown government forces and are back doing rank and file FBI investigations. Mulder has lost hope in ever finding 'the truth' behind his sisters alien abduction, while Scully has become despondent with her extra-ordinary FBI teaching duties. Of course that doesn't last and the two find themselves together again investigating unexplained phenomena's and government cover-ups of extraterrestrial existence. \"Little green men\" (1994): Mulder travels to Puerto Rico when he hears of a UFO crash landing, while a secret government agency desperatly tries to cover it up. \"The Host\" (1994): Scully and Mulder are on the hunt for 'The Flukeman', a deadly genetic mutation that lives in the sewers of New Jersey. \"Blood\" (1994): Scully and Mulder investigate a series of violent small town murders where normal citizens unexpectidly turn homicidal. \"Sleepless\" (1994): Agent Mulder and his new partner Krycek (Nicholas Lea) hunt for a sleep deprived marine who may be murdering people with his mind. \"Duane Barry\" (1994): Mulder and Krycek are assigned to a hostage negotiaton where a former FBI agent who claims to have been abducted by aliens has taken several people hostage.
