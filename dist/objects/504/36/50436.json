        "By focusing on six female entrepreneurs, Enterprising Women captures the essence of what it means to own your own business: the pitfalls and the joys. Women are relatively new to the area of business ownership, but they've already demonstrated a high success rate in a variety of fields. The women profiled here run companies dealing in pasta, lumber, fish, silk-screening, and a business academy. Each one expresses her personal and business philosophies."
