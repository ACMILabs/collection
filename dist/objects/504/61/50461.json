        "Satori is a sudden flash of intuitive enlightment--the spiritual goal of Zen Buddhism. This documentary yields insight into the Japanese way of being. Oblique and impressionistic in style, short scenes reflect Japan's striking contrasts and contradictions. Narration is minimal. Filmed are: monks within a Zen Buddhist monastery; Shintoist and Buddhist street festivals; masked rituals; the Zen-based Kanrisha School of Business Management; and a Shinto initiation ceremony conducted within factory walls. A film for those interested in Far Eastern Studies and religion."
