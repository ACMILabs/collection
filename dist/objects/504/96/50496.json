        "This is a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek look at \"The Season\", the time when the British aristocracy socialise and follow the Royals, when it is important to be seeing and being seen by those who count, and to attend major events such as Royal Ascot, Wimbledon, Polo, the Royal Academy, and the Henley Royal Regatta to name but a few. \"The Season\" takes place each summer in Britain but is it the same as it was in the past? Is it still important to be seen with the Royals, or even for the Royals to attend these highlight events on the social calendar? Has the social order changed allowing for almost a classless \"Season\" or is it still a case of who you know and how much money you have? Presenter and socialite Gay Close attempts to find the answers to these questions by taking to the streets and asking \"the commoners\" as well as conducting private and upfront interviews with famous British personalities including the Queen's couturier and well-known fashion designer, Hardy Amies, Managing Director of Burke's Peerage, Harold Brookes-Baker, Diary Editor of the Daily Express, Ross Benson, actress and singer Baroness Issy Van Randwyck and many others. Also includes black and white Movietone newsreel archival footage to provide a reflection of seasons past."
