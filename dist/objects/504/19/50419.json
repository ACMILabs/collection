        "Very bad things is a very grim tale of morality and the bond between killers. Kyle Fisher is about to marry Laura, a neurotic, insecure woman, whose wedding plans are being administered by her in a caustic, shrill manner. Kyle's four best friends - Adam, Michael, Charles and Robert - decide to take him to Vegas for the bucks turn, complete with drugs, booze and strippers. On the night in question one man accidentally kills a prostitute. Encouraged by Robert (Christian Slater) the group decide to bury the body in the desert. Before they can do this however a security guard discovers their crime and is promptly dispatched of also. With two bodies to dispose of the men are drawn into a gruesome pact that will assuredly be their undoing. Upon their return home the friends exchange increasingly bitter and acrimonious accusations as they attempt to deal with their misdeeds. Cameron Diaz plays Laura - the bride who will stop at nothing to have her wedding day perfect, disguising the moral degradation of those around her. Peter Berg makes his directorial debut with this very dark comedy that evokes the spirit of Tarantino, the Coen bothers and Danny Boyle. Also stars: Jeanne Tripplehorn, Daniel Stern and Jon Favreau."
