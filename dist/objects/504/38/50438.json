        "Exceptional or gifted children represent a great potential for society, yet the majority of these children go unrecognized because public educational systems are not geared to challenge their academic, artistic and personal growth. This documentary, through interviews with teachers, parents and gifted students in Coquitlam, British Columbia, looks at one of the few school districts in North America that has continually expanding enrichment programs throughout its primary and secondary grades. The film examines how these programs stimulate the students' particular talents, and discusses some of the problems that gifted children face in the absence of such resources."
