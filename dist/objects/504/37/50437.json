        "Kate is a recently discharged mental patient who now lives in a run-down halfway house. The weekly visits from her fifteen-year-old son, Arthur, are bright spots in her difficult life. For Arthur, who has trouble dealing with his mother's condition, the visits are difficult. Arthur's embarrassment and confusion lead him to lie to his girlfriend about Kate, with some surprising results when the two women meet."
