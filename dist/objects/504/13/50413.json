        "The English version of a film that was shot mainly in Bhatshala-Shapmari, in the north of Bangladesh, and at Savar and Dapashai in the center of the country. We see the efforts of teams from Gonoshasthaya Kendra to free women from poor villages from submission and misery. Through health care, education and professional courses, medical assistants and social workers allow countrywomen to benefit from their nation's progress. Part three of the series."
