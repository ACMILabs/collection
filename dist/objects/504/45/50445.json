        "A film for those seeking insight into contemporary Japanese society, this one-hour documentary examines the status of women in Japan. Through a well-balanced blend of archival footage, candid interviews and fly-on-the-wall scenes of women at home and in the workplace, it investigates Japanese lifestyles, social values, labor practices and the women's movement. A film highly recommended for students of Sociology and Far Eastern and Women's Studies, as well as for those who intend to visit or do business with Japan.
