        "A musical comedy feature about the trials and tribulations of making an old-time musical spectacular a la Busby Berkeley era of MGM. Take an inexperienced studio head, add a villainous competitor, an eccentric director, and an exquisite star who has never sung a note in her life, and you've got problems! But they're nothing to compare with the situation once your exquisite star ... is lost."
