        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". Chris Carter's long running cult series which explores the paranormal and the paranoid, introduced us to the covert world of FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and its now famous mantra, \"The truth is out there\". It all begins when special agent Dana Scully is assigned to debunk a project known as the X-files, which are reserved for unsolved cases with a paranormal twist. The man leading these investigations is agent Fox Mulder or Spooky Mulder as he is known by his mocking co-workers. Of course the sceptical Scully ends up joining Mulder in his quest for the 'truth' as they delve into a labyrinth of secret government plots, covert organizations within organizations and insidious extraterrestrial conspiracies. \"Pilot\" (1993): FBI agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is assigned watchdog duty over fellow agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). However, she finds herself being drawn into his investigations of paranormal and unexplained phenomena. \"Deep throat\" (1993): Mulder and Scully go against their superiors when they investigate the disappearance of a pilot who may have been flying aircraft made with alien technology. \"Squeeze\" (1993): Scully and Mulder search for a killer whose murder sprees occur every 40 years. \"Conduit\" (1993): When a young girl is mysteriously abducted, Scully worries that Mulder's personal feelings on the case are clouding his judgment. \"The Jersy devil\" (1993): Mulder and Scully search for a mysterious creature that has roamed the New Jersy countryside for over forty years.
