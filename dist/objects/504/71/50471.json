        "The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge was opened to traffic on the 1st of July 1940, after two years of construction. It collapsed four months later during a 42 mile per hour wind storm. This short film captures the bridge on the day of its collapse showing the start of resonance vibration and the nodal line on the surface of the roadway. It records a driver abandoning his vehicle as he attempts to crawls to safety while the bridge undulates beneath him. It finally show the tearing and collapse of the bridge. The film has a very short segment at the start depicting workers during the constructing stage and an official vehicle crossing the bridge during the opening ceremony."
