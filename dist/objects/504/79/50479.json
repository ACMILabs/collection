        "Episode of Series \"Buffy the vampire slayer\". Season three of Joss Whedon's Buffy the vampire slayer saw the show at the height of its fan base and ratings popularity. All over the globe Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) had entered into the consciousness of popular culture. Season two ended with Buffy running away from Sunnydale after having to kill her one true love Angel (David Boreanaz) who had turned into the evil Angelus. Complicating matters further was Buffy's mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) who discovered that her teenage daughter was a vampire slayer. Season three opens on a Sunnydale, minus Buffy which is proving a burden for the rest of the Scooby gang whose vampire skills aren't on the same level as the slayer (Eps. one, Annie). Buffy eventually returns to Sunnydale to find a new slayer in town, the rough and impulsive Faith (Eps. three, Faith, hope and trick). Each season creator Joss Whedon and his team of writers face the challenge of providing fresh and inventive adversary's for Buffy and her gang to fight. In season three they rise to the challenge with the introduction of the Mayor (Harry Groener), a villain whose unnerving chirpy demure hilariously clashes with his plans for world domination and the destruction of Sunnydale as we know it. With season three Whedon played up even more the hormonal havoc his teenage leads have to contend with, as Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander (Nicholas Brendon) overstep the line in their friendship and a potential new romance for Buffy is thwarted by the shock return of Angel (Eps. four, Beauty and the beasts). Other highlights include the introduction of Anya (Eps. nine, The wish), a vengeance demon that grants Cordelia's wish of a Sunnydale without Buffy and the exciting two part finale (Eps. twenty one and twenty two, Graduation day) where the Mayors apocalyptic 'ascension' comes to fruition. Cast includes: Seth Green, Charisma Carpenter, Anthony Stuart Head, Eliza Dushku, James Marsters."
