        "Meet Buck Boom--dynamic, forceful and creative--and a candidate for the job of executive assistant at a staid corporation. There's no doubt in Boom's mind that he's the person for the job, but the question is, can he convince Mr. Mudgin, the personnel manager? For, you see, Boom is a cartoon and Mudgin is not used to dealing with someone who is \"different.\" Skillfully crafted, using an innovative combination of live action and animation techniques, this hilarious short film probes stereotypes, prejudices and hiring practices."
