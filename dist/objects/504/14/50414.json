        "Set in the fantastic kingdom of Krull, our plot starts with the revelation that the kingdom is under threat from the indescribable Beast and his army of Slayers. Eager to forge an alliance, Prince Colwyn (Ken Marshall) and Princess Lyssa (Lysette Anthony) plan to marry. During the wedding ceremony however, slayers attack, killing Colwyn's father and kidnapping Lyssa and taking her to the black fortress. Waking to discover he has lost his father and his bride, Colwyn is advised by the wise Ynyr that he must retrieve the Glaive - a starfish shaped, jewel encrusted symbol with retractable blades - which, given the right bearer, is the only thing that can defeat the Beast. Colwyn recruits a motley crew of renegades (including reputable actors such as Liam Neeson and Bernard Bresslaw), to accompany him on his quest. A curious blend of science fiction and medieval iconography, \"Krull\" has all the resident tenets of a fantasy; damsel in distress, love that can cure all evil, an almighty quest and final showdown between hero and villain. Whilst receiving a G classification, there are a few ghoulish moments which belie the general rating. Made on a budget in excess of 45 million, the film received cult rather than commercial success. Written by Stanford Sherman."
