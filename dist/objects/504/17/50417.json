She is jealous of anyone who tries to steal her owners' attention. She was born in Detroit on an automobile assembly line but she is no ordinary automobile. Deep within her chassis lurks the devil incarnate and she is filled with a chilling, insatiable vengeance that will destroy anyone in her path. She seduces 17-year-old Arnie Cunningham who becomes consumed with passion for her sleek, rounded chrome-laden body. She demands his absolute and unquestioned devotion and when outsiders seek to interfere, they become victims of Christine's uncontrollable wrath. Cast includes Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton. Screenplay by Bill Phillips, based on the novel by Stephen King."
