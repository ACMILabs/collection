        "This unique and fascinating biographical documentary of World War II is based on eye-witness accounts, feelings and memories of many Americans and other nationalities who lived through those days. These accounts have been merged together to form one story from one person's perspective - the narrator (David Healey) - who relates the unfolding of events which led up to the war, and which took place during the war. Blending into this historical narrative is the wonderful talent and big band music of Glenn Miller drawn from the radio broadcasts made popular by the legendary band-leader. The documentary also features rarely seen film footage shot by band-member Paul Tanner recording episodes from the days of Miller's second civilian band on tour, on stage and on the Hollywood set. Along with Paul's home movies are included some rare and historically important cinematography, newsreel footage, radio broadcasts and stills sourced from archives in the United States, Japan, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom which overall, besides providing a visual spectacle of soldiers at war and the glory (or otherwise) of battle, also focus on the human face of war, the best times, the worst times and even the occasional humorous times. If you are a Glenn Miller fan then this is a must as there are over thirty classic Glenn Miller tunes including: \"American Patrol\", \"Boogie Woogie Piggie\", \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\", \"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\", \"In the Mood\" and \"Moonlight Serenade\"."
