        "The Wisdom of crocodiles, directed by Hong Kong veteran director Po Chih Leong, is an elegant thriller set in contemporary London that combines the serial killer and vampire genres. Steven Grlscz is a charming, wealthy man who lures beautiful women and then subjects them to wicked, deathly pursuits. A sprucely variant of the Dracula myth, \"The Wisdom of crocodiles\" creates its central character, Grlscz, as a complex individual who lives alone in a gothic, decadent, highly ornamental London 'pad' and spends his spare time cataloguing the death of his victims. Grlscz's killer instinct derives from the Dracula myth tradition: he kills in order to sustain his own well-being and life force. Though evidence points to Grlscz as a suspect, his brilliance outsmarts the police; in fact, Inspector Healey, the Catholic police inspector who tails Grlscz, comes to like and respect him after Grlscz saves his life. Soon enough, they develop a friendship and ruminate on philosophic matters of good and evil, black and white, marriage and fidelity, and so on. Steven's killer instinct is challenged when he meets structural engineer, Anna Levels, whose combination of femininity and worldliness, sensuality and astuteness, vulnerability and independence, ultimately saves her life. Director Po Chih Leong and writer Paul Hoffman have created a sophisticated, engaging thriller that fits complex characters with gorgeous visuals and an inventive soundtrack. Cast includes Jude Law, Elina Lowensohn, Timothy Spall and Kerry Fox."
