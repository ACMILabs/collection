        "This fast-paced documentary tells the inside story of how Bank of Montreal chairman William Mulholland dealt with his bank's debt-laden customers, Dome Petroleum and Mexico, during the summer of 1982, the summer the global debt crisis took the world by surprise. Interwoven with the Bank of Montreal's story are interviews with well-known international bankers and financial experts who explain the causes of the debt crisis, confirm the extreme fragility of the international banking system, and outline the problems to be solved if the system is to survive."
