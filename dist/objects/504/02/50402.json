        "This film records a lecture by scientist, Roman Catholic nun and world-renowned expert on low-level radiation, Dr. Rosalie Bertell. She explains the complex chain reactions that follow nuclear explosions, affecting natural life systems, our climate and human health, and briefly describes other war and defense operations that contribute to the level of nuclear pollution. Together, these sources have radically altered our planetary environment, endangering the future of life on Earth. Powerful stock footage and stills add urgency to Dr. Bertell's quiet plea. The film ends with her lucid ideas on what steps must be taken to reverse this critical situation."
