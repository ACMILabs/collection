        "Episode of Series \"Buffy the vampire slayer\". Starting life as a moderately successful feature film, \"Buffy the vampire slayer\" has become a cultural phenomena, spawning thousands of fan sites, a spin-off TV series (Angel), numerous theoretical journals and even it's own language (Buffy speak). Sixteen year old Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a typical teenage girl in every respect except one, (she has been destined to slay vampires) moves to Sunnydale, California with her divorced mum. What she is unaware of however is that Sunnydale was built above the 'hellmouth', an evil dimension rife with demons and vampires. Buffy reluctantly finds herself burdened with slayer duties again while she struggles to fit into her new high school, date guys and get her homework done. Geller holds her own as the blonde wise cracking, ass-kicking vampire killer but creator Joss Whedon also surrounds her with a strong supporting cast that well and truly hold their own. The 'Scooby gang' as they have come to be known consist of computer geek Willow (Alyson Hannigan), the goofy Xander (Nicholas Brendan), the snobby Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), Buffy's watcher Gile's (Anthony Stewart Head) and the brooding vampire with a soul and Buffy love interest, Angel (David Boreanaz). The pleasures in Whedon's series comes out of the clever play with adolescent angst where every minor humiliation is tantamount to Armageddon and that sometimes it really is. Season one finds Buffy and the Scooby gang battling the Master, an ancient vampire determined to open up the hellmouth and literally create hell on earth. All this and Buffy still has to survive high school."
