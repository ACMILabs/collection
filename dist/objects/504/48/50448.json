        "Sea-ice is the major habitat of some of the most spectacular wildlife in the world. This film focuses on the algal and animal life that survives in this harsh world. From the simple algae that thrives at the edge of the ice to the large narwhal and polar bear, Life on Ice looks closely at this unique chain of life. Fine photography shows rare views of sea birds, seals, whales and walrus diving beneath the canopy of ice."
