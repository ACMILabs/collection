        "Episode of Series \"The X-files = The X files\". With season three of the X-Files, creator Chris Carter and his team of writers introduce an unexpected element into the show's formula - humour. Having built a loyal fanbase of 'X-philes', the show begins to confidently toy with expectations, offering sly takes on classic American 'drive-in' movies (Ep. 12 'War of the Coprophages,' which also teases the audience and Scully with a Mulder love interest named Bambi), to all-out self parody (Ep. 20 'Jose Chung's From outer space'.) However, Carter doesn't allow the series to slip entirely into send-up, remaining faithful to what originally drew the fans in - the 'mythology' episodes. At the commencement of season 3 (Ep. 1 'The Blessing way') Mulder is missing, presumed dead, after the 'cigarette-smoking man' ordered the destruction of a train carriage that he was hiding in at the end of series 2. Scully on the other hand is convinced Mulder is still alive. Of course, Mulder shows up eventually and before too long the two are reunited, but this time their investigations are of a more personal nature. Mulder wanting to avenge his father's death at the end of season 2, while Scully experiences her own family tragedy (Ep. 2 'Paper clip.') These two tragic losses ultimately strengthen the bond between the agents; needing to depend even more on each others strength and trust. Season 3 provides plenty of other challenges for the FBI agents as they encounter old foes, (Krycek makes an unwelcome appearance) and uncover a secret government plot that will ultimately shed light on Scully's abduction (Ep. 9 \"Nisei\"). Cast includes: Gillian Anderson, David Duchovny, Mitch Pileggi, William B. Davis, Nicholas Lea."
