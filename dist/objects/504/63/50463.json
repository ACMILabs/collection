        "Sylvie's Story is part of the series The Next Step, which examines the services needed by and available to battered women. The film recreates the experience of Sylvie, a battered woman who seeks shelter in a Montreal transition house. Faced with the threat of violence, loneliness, the lack of financial resources or information about services, the victim is often understandably reluctant to seek help. The film emphasizes the importance for women of speaking out and sharing their experiences with other women. The film also points out the role of the transition house in putting the battered woman in touch with appropriate legal and social services."
