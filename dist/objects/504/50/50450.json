        "This short documentary was commissioned by SBS Independent as part of its 'Australia by Numbers' series about community life in various postcodes around Australia. This episode centres on the municipal pool in Prahran, an inner suburb of Melbourne. Every summer, since it was built in the 1960's, the pool has been a magnet for a diverse range of locals who go there both to socialise and exercise. A constant over the years has been the pool's two long serving managers, who know and are known by almost everyone."
