        "Through four moving portraits, A House Divided sheds light on the tragedy of caregiver stress and elder abuse. The abuse takes many forms, ranging from willful neglect and financial exploitation to physical assault. With great sensitivity, this film portrays the emotional complexity of family relationships that can lead to abuse of the elderly, the anguish and isolation of its victims, and the tremendous need for community understanding and support."
