        "The extension of Canada's coastal sovereignty to 322 km (200 miles), together with the increase in offshore oil and gas activity, has led to a dramatic increase in the demand for knowledge about the sea. The film highlights the work of the Atlantic Geoscience Centre, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, in Nova Scotia. Stunning visuals include rolling icebergs and undersea volcanoes. Research is shown to depend on both high-technology and patient, minute analysis."
