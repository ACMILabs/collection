        "Barry Kane, a Los Angeles aircraft factory worker witnesses his plant's firebombing at the hands of a Nazi agent. During the blast his best friend is killed, and to heighten the tragedy Kane is wrongly accused of sabotage when it is discovered that the extinguisher Kane handed him was filled with an accelerant. In a desperate effort to clear his name, Kane begins a relentless cross country chase that traverses Boulder Dam, New York's Radio City Music Hall, and culminates at the Statue of Liberty. This was Hitchcock's first film to feature an all American cast. Stars Priscilla Lane, Robert Cummings, Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevans, Norman Lloyd and Alma Kruger. Original screenplay by Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and Dorothy Parker. Cinematography by Joseph Valentine."
