        "War against the Indians traces the history of North American Indians from 40,000 years ago to the present day. Harry Rasky, writer, producer, director and narrator, questions many of the traditional beliefs about Indians from the point of view of Native Americans. Did Christopher Columbus discover the North American Indians? Don't you have to be lost to be discovered? The North American Indians were already established and living off the land of North America, perhaps it was they who discovered Christopher Columbus and not the other way round. This documentary, put together with paintings, music, photographs and interviews reflects on their history."
