        "Women have not been encouraged by society to take charge of their lives, either financially or psychologically. In Canada, three out of every five poor adults are women. This film attempts to explain why by singling out two women. One divorced, the other widowed, they found themselves in financial difficulty; neither was trained for wage-earning work. This documentary outlines some of the resources available. A counsellor at the Montreal Women's Referral and Information Centre emphasizes the need for long-range financial planning."
