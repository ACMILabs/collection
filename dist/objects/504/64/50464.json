        "A film about the effects of unemployment on the lives of individuals and their families. It exposes the harsh realities of unemployment and graphically depicts situations that contradict the notion that unemployment insurance takes care of the problems. The film illustrates that most unemployed persons prefer to work and that the real cost of unemployment is human suffering. Unemployment: Voices from the Line is a powerful and disturbing account of a national tragedy that, until now, has been viewed solely in economic terms."
