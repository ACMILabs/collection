        "With humor sometimes tinged with ruefulness, a group of women discusses menopause, sexuality, and how it feels to be aging in a society consecrated to youth. The film also examines how the medical profession is influenced by the pharmaceutical industry's advertising, and underscores the need for women to become educated health consumers."
