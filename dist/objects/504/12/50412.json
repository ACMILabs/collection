        "Using bank employees in British Columbia and employees of the Michelin Tire Company in Nova Scotia as case studies, this film argues that blue- and white-collar workers can benefit from unionization. It offers a condensed version of the information provided in Who Wants Unions, and in addition includes comments by United Auto Workers' President Bob White on the benefits realized by both unionized and non-union workers as a result of the union movement. A good overview for those already knowledgeable about labor issues."
