        "One of a group of short films on various climatic, geographic and ecological zones in British Columbia, The Temperate Rain Forest examines the special characteristics, including the life cycle and food chain, of the northwest coastal rain forest. Its highly acidic soil results in a specialized plant community and an abundance of amphibians and reptiles. As the camera reveals, it is a place of exquisite beauty, and one that has an important place in the ecology."
