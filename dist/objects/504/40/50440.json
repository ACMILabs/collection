        "Intended for women in the paid work force and young girls about to choose a career, this half-hour film, part drama, part documentary, urges viewers to acquire the skills for careers involving new technologies. In the documentary segments, women who hold senior positions in the field of microtechnology describe changing occupational patterns, and stress the need for training and job-mobility programs. In the dramatic portions, an office worker and her teenaged daughter discover how the technological revolution will affect their careers and decide how to attain their goal of financial independence."
