        "'Dr.T & the women' brings together an ensemble cast including Richard Gere, Helen Hunt, Farrah Fawcett and Kate Hudson. Gere plays Dr.T, a Dallas gynaecologist with a bevy of beautiful women who worship him. With his daughter's wedding imminent, his wife's lack of mental stability, his alcoholic sisters and her 3 children, it's no wonder he finds solace in the arms of Bree, new pro teacher at the golf club."
