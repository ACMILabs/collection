        "Based on the successful British comedy television series this feature film version of \"On the buses\" continues in the same vein with its bawdy humour, one-liners, lecherous males and well-endowed young females (mini-skirts and all). The story line is a bit thin and outdated, but all the familiar characters are still on board (pardon the pun). Bus driver Stan (Reg Varney) and his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) are rather annoyed when Inspector Blakey (Stephen Lewis) decides to put on extra bus drivers. To make matters worse however, the new drivers are not only going to stop Stan from making a bit of extra from working overtime but are female. Prepare yourself for sexist jokes and the stereotypical \"butch\" women drivers. Stan and Jack's immediate reaction is to try and sabotage the whole show. However, Inspector Blakey retaliates, and ends up with the last laugh - or does he? Cast also includes Doris Hare, Michael Robbins, Anna Karen."
