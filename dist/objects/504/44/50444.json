        "Organization, discipline and productivity in Japan are on a scale not known in any other country of the world. For the 110 million people of Japan, survival means doing things together--a concept that has seen that nation automate and computerize at an unparalleled rate. Just how this level of achievement was reached is the subject of this absorbing documentary study of Japanese business and industry."
