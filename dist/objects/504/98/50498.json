        "Using real photos, images, staged settings and live performances, this episode, the first in the \"Blackout\" series, looks at the issues of assimilation, forced adoption and sexual abuse - particularly in respect of how it can lead to addictive personalities. It is also about the universal struggle of wanting to be loved, needed and accepted. The story centres around four people sharing a city squat, 24 hours in the lives of Raylene (Lydia Miller), Wayne (Russell Page), Laniece (Rhoda Roberts) and Sharon (Lillian Crombie) as they are involved in a drunken and stoned evening out, each plagued by their past and struggling to move forward with their future. Cast also includes Willurai Kirkbright Burney. Performances arranged by Stephen Page."
