        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Carry on\". Fourth in the series of Carry On films, Carry on Constable plays host to the cast of 'carry-oners' whose camaraderie as actors made this series so successful. Sergeant Frank Wilkins (Sid James) receives three bumbling new recruits; Constable Charlie Constable (Kenneth Connor) who is plagued by superstitious fears, Constable Stanley Benson (Kenneth Williams) whose scientific deduction distracts him from the task at hand and Constable Tom Potter (Leslie Phillips) whose do-gooder intentions only ever create problems. Tested and exasperated the Sergeant follows the incompetent capers of the Constables into a farcical foray of chaos with much hilarity. Cast also includes: Eric Barker, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Hattie Jacques and Shirley Eaton."
