        "Episode of Series \"Buffy the vampire slayer\". Buffy season five opens with a deceptively playful episode, (Eps. 79 Buffy Vs. Dracula), where the slayer comes face to face with the celebrated count. Full of the expected smart one-liners and folkloric reinvention, the episode serves to reveal the running thread through this season - what is the full extent and meaning of Buffy's slayer power? Without a doubt season five is the darkest of the lot but also sees creator Joss Whedon's writing team at their most ingenious. A case in point, this is the season that Buffy's little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) is revealed (Eps. 79 Buffy Vs. Dracula and Eps. 80 Real me). What role this new addition to the Buffy universe has becomes one of the more inspired inventions that the writers have dreamed up. Also set up in season five is Spike's unsettling growing attraction to his object of hate, Buffy. (Eps. 82 Out of my mind). This plot strand is a perfect example how ideas are initially set up by Whedon and crew to have long term ramifications for the season and in this case for the entire series. This season's villan turns out to be the high priestess of insanity, Glory played with exhuberent glee by Clare Kramer( Eps. 83 No place like home). What Glory actually is simply goes down as one of the most breathtaking revelations in the series (Eps. 90 Checkpoint). Glory also proves to be quite literally an indestructable foe, lending the season a prevailing sense of fatalism that is ultimately realised in one unforgettable episode, The Body (Eps. 94 The Body). Cast includes: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Nicholas Brendon, Alyson Hannigan, James Marsters, Mark Blucas, Amber Benson, Anthony Stewart Head, Kristine Sutherland, Emma Caulfield."
