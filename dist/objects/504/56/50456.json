        "A love triangle set in Franco's Spain during the 1950's starring Victoria Abril, Jorge Sanz and Maribel Verdu. After finishing his military service, a provincial young man rents a room in Madrid to be near his fiance. Shortly after moving in, his widowed landlady seduces him into a world of sensual pleasure and petty crime. He becomes her willing accomplice as he is lured away from the conventional life he had planned with his fiance and into a world that defies the values promoted by church and state. As his fiance gradually discovers the depth of his involvement, she makes a pact with him that will ultimately affect everyone's lives. Screenplay by Alvaro Del Amo, Carlos Perez and Vicente Aranda and based on a true story. Cinematography, Jose Luis Alcaine. Editing, Teresa Font. Music, Jose Nieto. In Spanish with English subtitles."
