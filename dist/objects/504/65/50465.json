        "This film explores the confusion and negativity surrounding the subject of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS). Based on the premise that premenstrual changes are normal rather than an illness, the film provides health information and presents some of the positive aspects of the premenstrual phase. Featured are women who speak candidly about their experiences of PMS."
