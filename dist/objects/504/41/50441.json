        "Although a latecomer to the professional art scene, Elisabeth Hopkins has achieved success. In this film, the eighty-eight-year-old Canadian artist is seen, and heard, as she talks and paints her way through an interview. Fiercely independent, she lives alone and enjoys it. Scenes from her paintings, wittily underscored by a creative soundtrack, mix easily with scenes of her life on Galiano Island off the southern coast of British Columbia, and at the Bau-Xi Gallery in Toronto, where her paintings are eagerly snapped up. Elisabeth Hopkins has not allowed age to diminish her pleasure in life."
