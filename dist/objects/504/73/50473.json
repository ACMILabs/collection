        "Robert De Niro and Uma Thurman star as title characters Mad Dog and Glory in this unassuming romantic comedy. A divorced evidence gathering policeman and aspiring photographer, Wayne \"Mad Dog\" Dobie earns his nickname in reference to his mild mannered nature. One night while on duty Mad Dog inadvertently saves the life of local gangster and part time comedian Frank Milo (a dour Bill Murray, cast against type). Under guidance from his therapist and eager to bring happiness to the life of someone who empathises with his desire to be someone else, Milo befriends Mad Dog and loans Glory (Thurman) to him for a week. Before the week is over Mad Dog and Glory have fallen in love and the two are faced with settling Glory's brother's gambling debt to Milo in exchange for their relationship. Cast also includes David Caruso and Mike Star as convincingly menancing sidekick heavyweights and Kathy Baker as Mad Dog's neighbour."
