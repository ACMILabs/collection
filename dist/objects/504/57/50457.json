        "Mercenary manipulator Kathryn, furious at being dumped for the painfully naive Cecile, plots revenge on her ex-boyfriend Court by goading her amoral step-brother Sebastian to seduce her and ruin her reputation. Sebastian is initially reluctant, revealing his interest in a more challenging potential conquest - the headmaster's daughter Annette, who has vowed in a magazine article to forego sex before marriage. Undeterred, Kathryn proposes a more seductive wager: if Sebastian can successfully seduce Annette before school resumes in the fall, she will give him the one thing he has desperately desired since their parents got married... However, if he fails, then Kathryn gets to keep his most prized possession, a 1956 Jaguar Roadster. With the stakes so high, both of them are determined to win at all costs, leaving a trail of victims in their wake. It is only when their diabolical schemes take a few unexpected turns that they begin to realise the far-reaching consequences of their actions. Cruel Intentions is the fourth film adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Choderlos de Laclos' scandalous 1782 novel that portrayed sexual manipulation as an art form. Stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as Kathryn, Ryan Phillippe as Sebastian, Reese Witherspoon as Annette, and Selma Blair as Cecile."
