        "A film about parenting and education in Japan, Children of the Tribe brings out the striking contrasts between Japanese and Western family life and schooling, and illustrates the two seemingly contradictory elements of Japanese society: great competitiveness and great dependence on the group. Nuances of manner and behavior are recorded in a way that will inspire thoughtful consideration of the collective experience."
