        "Fegele (Christina Ricci) is a young girl living in a small Russian village with her father who decides to leave for America, promising to send for her as soon as he is able. Nazi troops arrive at the village, forcing Fegele to flee to England with relatives where she is adopted by a loving couple who rename her Suzie. An aspiring and gifted singer, Suzie leaves for Paris where she becomes a nightclub singer and meets Lola (Cate Blanchett). The girls commence work on a lavish opera production where Suzie meets Cesar (Johnny Depp), a poor gypsy horse trainer, and Lola meets Dante (John Turturro), the star of the opera whom she uses for his wealth and security. Suzie and Cesars short lived romance comes to an end with the Nazi occupation of France. Sally Potter, director of 'The Tango lesson' and 'Orlando' provides a lush and lavish film depicting the heartbreaking world of two souls destined for anguish."
