        "John Dall and Farley Granger play flat mates (and implied homosexual lovers) who strangle a friend for intellectual thrills and proceed to invite the victim's family and friends for dinner, believing they have committed the perfect crime. Their former teacher, James Stewart, suspects wrongdoing and by the end of the evening discovers how brutally his students have twisted his own academic theories to justify the murder. Also Stars Sir Cedrick Hardwicke and Constance Collier. Adapted by Hume Cronyn form the play by Patrick Hamilton play that dealt with the Leopold-Loeb murder trial. Screenplay by Arthur Laurents. Cinematography by Joseph Valentine and William V. Skall."
