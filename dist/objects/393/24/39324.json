        "Heightened crime and increased prosititution in the streets of Paris, force the criminal investigation department to set up a special unit of police called the Territorial Brigades. Their only hope of penetrating the French Maffia is through a network of informers but the perfect informer is killed and another must be found from the pimps and prostitutes of the French underground. Voted the best film of the year in France at the time of its release, La Balance is a world of violence where only the tough survive. This version is dubbed in English."
