        "Episode of Series \"Dance Magic\". Terry Leone hosts this lesson in how to dance the rumba. Cuba was the home of the rumba where it was danced in different styles all depicting a folk story or ritual. The rumba of today is danced to music inspired by African rhythms and Spanish melodies. The rumba music is played in 4/4 time and the best tempo is about 32 measures a minute. In the rumba most steps are danced holding each other with the bodies apart ... look deeply into your partner's eyes and you are ready to rumba! Demonstrated by David and Carrie Kloss."
