        "Another delightful program for lovers of steam trains and travel. Two episodes featured. \"Workhorses\" covers the history of steam freight trains in Britain. Miles Kington reflects fondly on the unsung heroes of the railways. \"Going Great Western\" takes us on the Great Western Railway, which opened the so-called Cornish Riviera to travellers in the Victorian era. Features beautiful West Country scenery."
