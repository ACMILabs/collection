        "The Prisoner's dilemma is a mathematical game which illustrates the dilemma at the root of the arms race. Game theory is used in politics and business and many other areas which involve conflict to identify which strategies to use and the potential outcomes of these strategies. In the prisoner's dilemma, two players have to decide whether to be loyal or to betray the other. Individual self-interest, if chosen by each player can lead to the worst result for both players, whereas loyalty can produce a compromise solution. The program also looks at \"Chicken\" a game of confrontation and a repeated \"Prisoner's dilemma\"."
