        "Directed by Josef Von Sternberg this is the first English language version of Dostoyevsky's novel of obsession, murder and guilt. Peter Lorre stars as the criminology student turned murderer and Edward Arnold as the detective who breaks him. This is an example of Hollywood tackling the great Russian epic and achieving it with style."
