        "Documents the pioneering photographic work of Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904) in which he rigorously analysed human and animal motion. Muybridge's multiple camera techniques and his projection device, the zoopraxiscope, were technical curiosities unnecessary for the development of the modern motion picture but through them he overcame a philosophical obstacle. He demonstrated empirically that the infinite flux of time could be reconstructed from a finite number of photographs."
