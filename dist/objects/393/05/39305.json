        "Episode number 25 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". This program first looks at inference for linear regression, the least squares line and the residual mean square. We then look at a simple linear regression model to measure how fast the universe is expanding. However, because space is not even, which complicates the calculations, we then need to apply the concepts of confidence intervals and significance tests to the regression line."
