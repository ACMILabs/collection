        "Episode of Series \"Australian mosaic\". This video discusses the effect of restructuring in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Removal of tarrif barriers by 1995 may lead to retrenchment of workers, many of whom are migrant women. The industries must modernise and become more productive if they are to survive. The resource notes accompanying the video are student centred (Years 10-12), particularly for those doing Economics, Commerce and Business Studies."
