        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". When Captain James Cook's expedition brought back to England the first European sketches of kangaroos, they were ridiculed as fakes. Today the kangaroo stands at the centre of another controversy. Should Australia's national animal be under conservation or shot for the damage it can do to hard-won farmland? The childhood and family life of the cuddly Grey Kangaroo stands in sharp contrast to the demanding existence of the Great Red Kangaroo in Australia's deserts."
