        "This program is about babies - having them, caring for them and watching them grow and develop. It is not only a comprehensive and practical guide to babycare but also shows what it is like to become a family and how people cope with the new relationships and feeling that a baby brings. It contains information on pregnancy, feeding, development, sleep, teething, cleanliness, safety and a host of other topics. It is designed especially to help you to enjoy the new life you have created by taking you into the lives and homes of new families who share their experiences (and babies) with you. The sections include: getting ready for a baby; pregnancy and birth (10min); the newborn baby - 0-6 weeks (32min); the settled baby - 6-12 weeks; the sociable baby - 3-6 months."
