        "A story that is as enchanting as its central character, the legendary George Gershwin. Robert Alda plays the talented composer in this moving tribute to one of America's premier musical artists. Following years of practice and an assortment of jobs, Gershwin experienced his first success with \"Swanee\" (sung in the film by the man who made it famous, the inimitable Al Jolson). Despite his ensuing accomplishments with hit songs and stage success, the musical genius yearned for something greater - to create a unique American music, combining European classics and popular songs. The realisation of Gershwin's dream is what is perhaps his best known work - the fourteen minute piece entitled \"Rhapsody in Blue\". In addition to its inspirational story, this film is musically uplifting, featuring a two-hour feast of classic Gershwin."
