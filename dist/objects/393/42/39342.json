        "The story of a special young girl named Daphne and her extraordinary relationship with the court jesters of the ocean. Nicknamed 'Tadpole' she is equally at home in the sparkling water as she is on land. Through her highly developed sense of hearing and her passionate nature, Tadpole builds a musical relationship with the humpback whales who share her second home. However, Tadpole's happy world has dark clouds on the horizon, the most foreboding being the news that the inn where her parents work is about to be sold and they will be forced to leave. Worst of all, what will happen to Elvar, her best friend, who also happens to be a dolphin?"
