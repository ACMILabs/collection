        "Valentino in his greatest role as the notorious shiek, the defiant and romantic heroic figure of the Arabian desert. This is the classic tale of the English-born but desert-bred Shiek, who fired by the love of a French dancing girl, risks all in his quest to possess her. The torrid sequence of the shiek and his Yasmine, now kidnapped and isolated in his tent, remains a landmark portrayal of sensual desire. A special bonus at the end includes highlights from Valentino's career and the mass hysteria captured on film when Valentino died."
