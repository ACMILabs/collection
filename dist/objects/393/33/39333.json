        "Episode number 5 of Series \"Alfred Hitchcock presents\". Another two macabre tales hosted by the master. \"The Big score\": A deceitful baby-sitter sets up her delinquent friends for a heist of her trusting employer's money. The evening ends in murder, but who is who in this twisted nightmare? \"Malice domestic\": A writer who loves his wife's cooking is incredulous when his doctor tries to tell him that his wife is trying to kill him. If only his dog could tell him what's really going on."
