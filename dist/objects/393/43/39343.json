        "Sol Garfunkel concludes the series by summarising some of the practical applications of mathematical discoveries which have been discussed in previous programs. He stresses the importance to all aspects of our lives of mathematics, and the exciting developments in mathematics which have taken place in the last forty years. The most significant of these, of course is the computer - a mathematical idea which is changing the idea of mathematics."
