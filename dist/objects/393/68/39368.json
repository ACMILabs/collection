        "Place your bets Gambling relies on chance but a predictable revenue can be earned from gambling by casinos. This program shows how the theory of probability is used to describe patterns in random events. We are shown how to calculate probabilities and how sampling makes deliberate use of randomness, with larger samples decreasing the variability of results. We are then shown standard deviations, the 68 95 99.7 rule and the central limit theorem."
