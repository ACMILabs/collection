        "Episode of Series \"Lift off\". How do you get to the Wackadoo Cafe? All you need to do is shout \"Wackadoo\" and you're there! These are 10 episodes of Wackadoo Cafe from the children's TV series Lift off, as seen on ABC TV. Wackadoo is a crazy cafe run under the strict orders of 'The Boss'. 'Zelda' the waitress weaves confidently amongst the customers, while 'Nearly' is nervously in charge of the drinks. 'Cook' a true artiste, creates works of genius in the kitchen. Regular customers are 'Wolf', a faded star, and the three pigs 'Boris', 'Doris' and 'Moris', who invariably display their mean streak. 'Lonely' is there too, always waiting for a friend."
