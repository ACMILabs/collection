        "Dimitri Shostakovich, Russian composer, was the most decorated Soviet civilian. He survived the Russian Revolution and World War II and wrote symphonies and operas of great acclaim. He was publicly denounced and humiliated by Stalin for his opera \"Lady Macbeth\" yet managed to survive the pressures and the purges. This dramatised account of Shostakovich's life and times, based on his memoirs, is filled with rich images and is superbly played by Ben Kingsley with Terence Rigby as Stalin. Also stars John Shrapnel and Liza Goddard. Shostakovich's music is played by The London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Rudolf Barshai."
