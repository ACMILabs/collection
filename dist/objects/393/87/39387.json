        "This documentary takes a look behind the scenes at the organising of an election. The role of the Australian Electoral Commission is examined, including such issues as the dissemination of how to vote information, the setting up of the national tally room and polling stations in suburban and remote areas of Australia, arranging postal voting and voting for those who are not able to get to a polling station, and counting of the votes. The role of the Governor General in dissolving the Parliament and associated duties are also examined."
