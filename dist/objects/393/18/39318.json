        "Her beauty is the stuff of Hollywood legends, her voice pure magic. Screen legend, Greta Garbo is captured at the very summit of her career. In one of the most romantic tales ever put on film, Garbo is breathtaking as the doomed courtesan whose passion for romance is equalled only by her passion for life. From her first appearance in the luxurious carriage that sweeps her off to the opera, to her last gasp in the arms of her broken hearted lover, Garbo's performance makes an indelible impression. As Armand Duval, her ardent suitor, Robert Taylor cuts a striking figure that makes the futility of his love all the more poignant. The supporting roles are similarly cast with uncanny accuracy. Lionel Barrymore is commanding as Armand's well-meaning father; Henry Daniell chills one's blood with his sadistic portrayal of the Baron de Varville."
