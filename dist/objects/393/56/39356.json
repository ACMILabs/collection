        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". This beautifully photographed documentary which is narrated by Peter Scott tells the amazing story of 10,000 Great White pelicans who use a tiny island in the middle of Lake Shala in Ethiopia as a breeding colony. Amazingly, the lake contains no fish, so they commute daily to another lake twenty miles away over a mountain range 6,000 feet high! Set to music by John Dankworth we share their journey and their lives on the Island."
