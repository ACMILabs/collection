        "Since Marcus Irwin introduced 'Cardio Funk' to Australia in 1989 it has become one of the most popular forms of Aerobics. Marcus and his fluorescent entourage begin this intermediate workout with a ten minute instructional segment and will guide through a routine which includes a warm up to prepare your body for the workout, a section aimed at co-ordinating, your arms and legs and gradually raises your workout level, a cardiovascular section, a 'Jammin' segment which combines the various steps and finally a 'cool down' to end your session."
