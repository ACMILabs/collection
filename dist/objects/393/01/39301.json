        "This wonderfully farcical comedy is the first big budget rock and roll movie of the fifties and features seventeen great songs of the era. Tom Ewell plays a down and out agent who is hired by a mobster to make a star out of his sex-pot girlfriend (Jayne Mansfield). Ewell gives her a rock and roll act in the hope of making the big time but Jayne yearns for the simple life and complications set in when she falls for Ewell, while searching for the perfect husband. Includes Little Richard, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, Platters, Fats Domino and more. Also stars Edmond O'Brien."
