Stars Claude Rains as a man with amnesia and Billy Mumy as a lost little boy. \"The Landlady\": A young man arrives in a provincial town in England needing a place to stay. It was strange circumstance that drew the young man to stay at this boarding house, it was an even stranger circumstance that made him a permanent guest. A gentle horror story based on a Roald Dahl short story and adapted by Robert Bloch. Stars Dean Stockwell."
