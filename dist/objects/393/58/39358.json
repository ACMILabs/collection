        "Overview There is very often a direct and measurable relationship betweem maths and our concept of beauty, often based on geometry. This program explores this relationship, through spirals and the Fibonacci sequence, the golden ratio, the golden rectangle, perspective, symmetry, repeating patterns, hyperbolic geometry and fractal geometry. The works of Leonardo da Vinci and M. C. Escher, as well as natural forms are used to illustrate the relationship."
