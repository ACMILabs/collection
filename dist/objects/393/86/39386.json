        "In 1915, the Australian Land Army marched on the Cooee trail from the mid-western farming town of Gilgandra to Sydney, gathering volunteer troops for the Dardanelles on the way. In 1987, a new band of \"Cooees\" set off to re-enact the march. The film's production crew were involved from the march's planning stage. This record of the re-enactment covering the 550 km from Gilgandra to the Sydney Town Hall not only provides a portrait of the individuals involved but also gives a glimpse of the mood and attitudes of rural Australia, 1987."
