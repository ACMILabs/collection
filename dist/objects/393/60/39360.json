        "Former world champion, Dennis Taylor, covers every aspect of this popular indoor sport. Dennis insists that you must start the right way: understand the rules, find the right cue and take care of it, stand and hold the cue correctly and know when and how to use rests and extensions. And, once you've got started, then it is time to learn how to pot, how to control the cue ball, how to play difficult shots and how to develop strategies and tactics."
