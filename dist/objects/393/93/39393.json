        "Probably the most valuable asset in our lifetime is the home we live in, so it's well worth taking as much care of it as possible. All too often though, it's the jobs which really need doing which seem so difficult to do yourself. It does not really seem worth bringing in the expensive professionals. Help is now at hand, \"DIY - the top 50 jobs\" is a practical guide aimed at beginners. It shows you how to tackle a whole range of subjects from home plumbing and electrics to painting, decorating and home security. It quite simply gives you the basic grounding and confidence to do the fifty most important jobs around the home. The subjects covered are: exterior decoration and maintenance, home security, insulation, electrics (WARNING - provides advice which does not conform to Australian Electrical Specifications and Regulations), plumbing, interior decoration, and fixtures and fittings."
