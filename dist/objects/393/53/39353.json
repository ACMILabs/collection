        "In this program Sol Garfunkel explains and defines algorithms, which are a sequence of steps or directions to accomplish a goal, and which lie at the root of programming. Algorithms must be well-defined, effective, must produce an output and must terminate in a reasonable period of time. Examples used to demonstrate are making a peanut butter and jam sandwich and finding the best route to work. The program concludes with a basic task of a computer - sorting and two forms of sorting - insertion sorting and merge sorting."
