        "Episode number 9 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". This program looks at the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables, by interpreting correlations, deriving the correlation co-efficient, and correlation and regression. Examples used are the relationship between twins' personality and whether they were raised together or apart, and the relationship between baseball home runs and players' salaries."
