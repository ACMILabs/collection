        "Acknowledged by generations of moviegoers as one of the greatest Disney animated classics ever produced, this extraordinary movie miracle is most fondly remembered as Walt Disney's favourite picture. The simple, heartwarming story of the newborn 'prince of the forest' reflects the universal joy in us all as we discover the wonders of life and the beauty of nature. Each new revelation, along with bashful Flower and fun-loving Thumper, elevate this beloved classic to the status of timeless masterpiece. Nominated for five Academy Awards."
