        "Episode of Series \"Palettes\". Veronese's monumental work is one of the two largest canvases in the world, and has had a turbulent history. Originally planned as a \"Last supper\", Veronese changed its title after criticism from the Inquisition about the inclusion of so many secular elements in the scene. The program describes the composition, colour scheme and history of the canvas until its restoration in 1980, when the full glory of Veronese's colour scheme was revealed."
