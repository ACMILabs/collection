        "In a country ruled by a violent and oppressive military government, in a time when brutality, torture and murder destroyed a nation, one man rose to become the voice of the voiceless, champion of the poor, defender of human rights. Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador stands beside Martin Luther King and Gandhi as one of history's most heroic martyrs, whose courage and compassion became legendary. Romero's influence on the people became so great in fact, that the military junta feared his power. In 1980, Bishop Romero died for his beliefs... at the hands of an assassin. His murderers have never been brought to trial. Raul Julia delivers a powerfully disturbing portrait of a man whose vision was truly inspirational."
