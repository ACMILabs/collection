        "Set against the backdrop of a World War I ravaged England, this superbly acted romantic drama is a true classic. Merle Oberon is a revelation as a reformed vamp torn between two men - Herbert Marshall and Frederic March, the latter having returned from the war blinded. The script was adapted by Lillian Hellman from the play by Guy Bolton (a.k.a R. B. Trevelyan)."
