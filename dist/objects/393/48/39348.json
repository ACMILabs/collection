        "Features two avante-garde western classics. \"Ride in the whirlwind\": Three innocent cowboys are mistaken for outlaws when they find themselves caught in an ambush at the hideout of a gang of stagecoach robbers. They are forced to flee with a posse on their heels, unable to prove their innocence. Although the film is faded, this rough, low budget western is a must for Nicholson fans. \"The shooting\": An ex-bounty hunter is hired by a girl with no name. They are followed by a cold-blooded gunslinger. There is a harsh relentless edge to this eerie and obscure tale. Nicholson's famous \"slow-burn\" performance is matched with a fine supporting cast including Millie Perkins and Warren Oates."
