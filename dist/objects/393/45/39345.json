        "This video will delight anyone with a love of sport or a general interest in the history of one of the world's greatest sporting events. From as early as the first Olympic marathon which was won, appropriately enough by a Greek water-carrier, to as recent as the Seoul 1988, when the return of the Russians pushed the United States into third place and the drugs issue made headlines a Ben Johnson was stripped of his medal, you can relive the triumph and the heartache that have combined to make the Olympics the inspiration that they are today."
