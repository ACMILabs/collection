        "Episode of Series \"The Golden years of surf collection\". The archetypal surfing film of the 1960's, Bruce Brown defied all odds to produce one of the most successful feature-length documentary films in movie history. Filmed on locations world-wide, with diverting tongue-in- cheek narrative by Brown, we follow two surfers' quest for the ultimate wave. The heady surfing days of the sixties are forever captured in this classic."
