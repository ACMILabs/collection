        "Presented by Miles Kington, dedicated enthusiast, this celebration of the steam age looks at some of the great British engines, travels the famous lines and meets the wonderfully eccentric people who keep steam alive in Britain today. \"Travels with a Duchess\" looks at The Duchess of Hamilton, one of the most famous passenger trains built in the 1930s. \"The Fishing Line\" travels the fishing line from Fort William to Malliag, built to transport herring at the end of the nineteenth century."
