        "Episode number 22 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". Teresa M. Amabile looks at how to analyse two-sample problems, using a t procedure, to calculate the confidence interval for the difference between two means and a significance test to see whether two populations have two different means. Examples used are a comparison of two job training schemes for welfare recipients, testing the properties of a new foam product against the former one, and the efficacy of coaching for aptitude tests."
