        "When pilot Dick Scobee blasted off aboard the ill-fated Challenger space shuttle, he took with him a unique piece of Australia's aviation history: a rib from Bert Hinkler's glider. As Dick's widow June recounts this same piece was miraculously recovered floating in the ocean amongst the Challenger debris. This programme is a fascinating look at Australia's aviators. From pioneers such as Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, Charles Ulm and Lores Bonney, through to the pilots of both World Wars and Vietnam, to the barnstorming antics of today's airmen and women. Experience the thrills of cattle mustering by helicopter in Australia's wild outback, spectacular aerobatics in a rugged Pitt Special, the life-saving endeavours of the Royal Flying Doctor Service and low-level manoevres by cropduster adventurers. It is a first-hand account from the pilots who were and still are flying 'by the seats of their pants'."
