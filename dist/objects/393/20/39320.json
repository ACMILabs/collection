        "The Big country is a western epic that has it all: a classic story, an all-star cast and the impeccable direction of Academy Award winning veteran, William Wyler. Gregory Peck stars as a sea captain who trades the expanse of the oceans for the open range of the West and grows to regret his choice. Charlton Heston is the menacing ranch foreman who loves the land and has a keen eye on McKay's fiancee (Carroll Baker). The superlative cast is rounded out by Burl Ives in an Oscar winning role, Jean Simmons, Charles Bickford and Chuck Connors."
