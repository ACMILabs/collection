        "Steve Davis became the first man in history to pot 15 reds, 15 blacks, plus all the colours in sequence under tournament conditions on television. This thrilling achievement is seen through Steve's own eyes as he talks the viewer through the most difficult moments. Reminiscent of the \"Pot Black\" series and a must for snooker lovers."
