        "Juicy problems Using a simplified model of the production of two different types of fruit juice, this program shows how linear programming can solve production policy problems bearing in mind material constraints. Concepts of feasible points and sets, the corner principle and the simplex method are introduced along with the related algebraic formulae. The program concludes by showing how mathematical research is constantly seeking ways to improve linear programming methods."
