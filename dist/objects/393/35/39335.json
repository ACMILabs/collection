        "Alan Bates and Janet Suzman give exceptional performances in this unforgettable story. Based on the play by Peter Nichols, it centres around Bri and Sheila, an English couple struggling to cope with and raise their only child - a severely handicapped young girl named Jo with whom they cannot communicate. Much to the dismay of friends and relatives, who continually recommend having Jo institutionalised, the couple choose to care for their daughter in their own modest apartment. Although they try to maintain their sense of humour, the difficulty and the seeming futility of their efforts takes an emotional toll that eventually threatens to destroy their marriage. A vivid portrait of two caring individuals faced with an almost impossible situation."
