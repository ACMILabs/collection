        "Episode number 12 of Series \"Against all odds: inside statistics\". Theresa M. Amabile introduces this first program on the design and conduct of experiments. She discusses the distinction between observational studies and experiments, the concept of control groups to reduce the risk of confounding results and randomized comparative experiments. Examples used are studies of lobsters and how they communicate, the use of aspirin in reducing the incidence of heart attacks and how the police should deal with cases of domestic violence."
