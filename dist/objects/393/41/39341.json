        "Albert Finney and Jacqueline Bisset combine to bring Malcolm Lowry's powerful, critically acclaimed novel to the screen with all its imagery, symbolism, insight and passion. A despairing alcoholic British ex-consul in a small Mexican town goes on a drunken odyssey on the local day of the dead. During the intense dramatic twenty four hours he is distracted but not really diverted from his downward descent into damnation. The vivid brutal action is shocking and the tragic self absorption haunting. Also stars Anthony Andrews."
