        "Squirrel on my shoulder, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, tells the story of Sammy, an orphaned baby Grey Squirrel which was raised by a cat as one of her kittens, and eventually released back into the wild. \"Brockside\", presented by Simon King, looks at the tenuous life of the urban Badger, living off its human neighbours as urban devlopment enchroaches on the lands they have traditionally occupied."
