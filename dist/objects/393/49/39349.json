        "The Stand up conic Using the circus as an illustration, Sol Garfunkel looks at conic sections - the circle, the ellipse, the parabola and the hyperbola. He also looks at some practical applications of these geometric forms, as in aeroplane wings, elliptical chain wheels on bicycles, the Mormon tabernacle dome, headlamps, telescopes and bridges, as well as discussing the history of the conic sections from Appolonius and Ptolomy to Keppler's laws of planetary motion and Newton's Principia."
