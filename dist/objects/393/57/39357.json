        "Overview In this first episode of the computer science module, Sol Garfunkel conveys his enthusiasm for mathematics as a living, evolving science which is closely related to the real world, by asking the fundamental question \"What is mathematics\". Concluding that mathematics is the relationship between proof and truth he then launches into a history of modern mathematics, and therefore of computers. He touches on the work of David Hilbert which included symbolic logic and self-referential paradoxes, Kurt Godel and his theorem which found a true statement that was unprovable, and Alan Turing's idea of machines. He continues with John von Neumann's early work in linking, logic, proof and computation and concludes with a look at minimal surfaces, normal maps and the use of the computer as an experimental tool."
