        "Confident conclusions Inference is the reaching of conclusions from evidence. This program shows how confident a conclusion can be reached with the aid of statistics. The program discusses standard error, confidence intervals, mean quality index and control charts and stresses that all variables must be identified and that all data must be selected, analysed and interpreted very carefully."
