        "Based on R.J. Minney's novel this inspiring true story of war heroine, Violette Szabo, who volunteered to be parachuted into France as a secret agent to re-organise a shattered resistance group. Virginia McKenna gives the performance of her career as the courageous secret agent, and this magnificent film ensures that no-one will forget Violette's bravery and conviction in what she believed in most - freedom from tyranny. Also stars Paul Scofield, Jack Warner, Denise Grey and Maurice Ronet."
