        "In October 1992 the largest gathering of aircraft in Australia took place at Avalon Airport, Victoria. The five day air show was the biggest ever held in the Southern Hemisphere. A complete range of aircraft operated by the Australian Defence Forces, general aviation aircraft, warbirds, recreational and sport aircraft, airliners, antiques, balloons, radio-controlled models, hang-gliders and helicopters have all been recorded in static or spectacular flying displays on this video. Presented by Jeff Watson."
