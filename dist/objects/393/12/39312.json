        "A comprehensive source of information for beginners and experienced aquarists alike, this video is also a source of pleasure for anyone fascinated by underwater life. Written by international aquatic consultant, John Dawes, it draws on the highest level of expertise. Step by step guidance covers all aspects of setting up and keeping three types of aquaria: marine, tropical and coldwater. In addition, the video takes us through breeding and selecting fish, choosing tanks and equipment, stocking aquaria with fish, plants, and decorations, fish health, feeding and aquarium management. A joyful experience simply to watch, the video includes stunning sequences shot amidst the colourful world of coral reefs and at the heart of the Amazon. Fine examples of other hobbyists' aquaria are also included."
