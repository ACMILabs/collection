        "Episode of Series \"Survival Anglia Wildlife Series\". Narrated by Alexander John, this entrancing video is the story of the visitors, residents and the dramas that affect the wildlife inhabitants of a typical waterhole in Etosha National Park, Namibia. A waterhole in Africa is like Picadilly Circus in London or Times Square in New York, wait there long enough and you will see everyone you know from miles around turn up! Lions and Cheetas use the waterhole to hunt, the Great Python submerges to catch a duck, the Black-headed Heron catches doves whilst amongst the violence, flamingoes and and Blue Cranes soar in to feed and a fifty strong herd of giraffe gallop like a skittish herd of horses. Des and Jen Bartlett built an elephant-proof hide at water level to film this yearly cycle of one waterhole."
