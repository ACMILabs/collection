        "Picture this In this program Sol Garfunkel shows how the immense amount of data which is produced today can be summarised and described using pictorial methods, such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots and 3D pictures produced on computers for data with several variables. He also introduces the language of descriptive statistics - mean, median, range and quartiles. Examples given include baseball batting averages, and sales of soft drinks."
