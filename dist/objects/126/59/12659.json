        "A road trip through the East Gippsland region of Victoria after the bushfires in 2003 and a chance meeting at a place called Seldom Seen, somewhere between Jindabyne and Buchan, with David Woodburn owner of the \"Seldom Seen Service Statiion\". David talks of his encounter with the fires, his loss of his family home, the service station and many of his pet animals including an emu and an ostrich. But it is David's eccentricity and sardonic humour, along with the wonderful quirky photographic shots that makes this story so engaging and appealing. Created as part of the \"Bute Utes the Movie\" project in association with Regional Arts Victoria."
