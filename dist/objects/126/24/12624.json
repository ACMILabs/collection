        "An amusing 'mockumentary' on several of the Op Shops in the East Gippsland region. This tongue-in-cheek journey introduces us to the eccentricities of op-shopping, the people who run them, the people who shop in them, and the eclectic mix of goods found in them. Stars Mr Kearney and Ms Jennian, with thanks to the following participating Op Shops - Paynesville Op Shop and Uniting Church, Lakes Entrance Ambulance, Salvos and St Vincents in Bairnsdale. Music from the fabulous Stereophonic Optigan, written and played by Mr Kearney. Camera - Jeremy Johnson."
