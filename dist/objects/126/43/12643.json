        "A grandfather/grandaughter collaboration, this is one man's journey through place and time from the 1930s-1960s. Ivan Couzens reminisces about the days when riding a bike was the only way to get around; school was a five mile ride away; and when he started work at the Bluestone quarries, the bicycle was his only mode of transport. A light-hearted look at the past interspersed with photographs and images of places once travelled. Music: \"Greenflower\" by Rob Bundle. Created as part of the \"Bute Utes the Movie\" project in association with Regional Arts Victoria."
