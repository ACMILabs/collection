        "Elaine Terrick's mum, Edie Terrick, takes a journey back to the place she calls her grandfather's country - in the mountainous ranges of Gippsland, Victoria. A place where her grandfather survived the slaughtering of his aboriginal people and where he as an abandoned child was found by white people - the O'Rourke family - taken in and brought up as an O'Rourke. For Edie it is an emotional but rewarding journey. Contains beautiful images of the high country and of the \"place\" where Edi's grandfather grew up. Created as part of the \"Bute Utes the Movie\" project in association with Regional Arts Victoria."
