        "\"Murray muse\" is a suite of four digital video paintings titled Earth, Fire, Air and Water. The environmental issues affecting the sustainability of one of Australia's most precious resources, the Murray River and its surrounding ecosystems inform this Digital Video artwork. This emergent video painting process is a vehicle whereby the consideration of other media forms (photography, painting, printmaking, cinema and television) are remediated, blended and transformed. The four films in this Digital Video Painting DVD can be played and viewed randomly and continuously, culminating in a symbiotic relationship between sight and sound, editing and postproduction techniques, allowing the viewer to interact with the digital imagery and ambient audio either actively or passively."
