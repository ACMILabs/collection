        "Sept Visions Fugitives was produced in China. Cahen creates impressionistic transformations of landscape and people. He writes: \"The looking and listening audiences are confronted -- in addition to the pure impressions -- with basic questions about work (the boy using a traditional device to shake the feathers from the mattress) about freedom, about life in China ... and ultimately about life and death: the burial, the bird, the man with a sheaf of straw on his back symbolizing the passage, the beyond ..... I had to struggle to make what I know are stereotyped images my own. The pure impressions and raw filmic material are completely reworked, going much further than the original takes.\" Source: Electronic Arts Intermix [www.eai.org]"
