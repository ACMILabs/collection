        "This is a documentary film about the childhood and life of Aunty Maude Alberts, a Gundijimara Elder and the filmmaker's grandmother. With her children and grandchildren Aunty Maude visits \"the old place\", a property outside of Heywood where she grew up. The film makes a poetic exploration of Aunty Maude's upbringing and the passing on of her traditional knowledge to her children and grandchildren."
