On Sunday 17th April 2005, Johnny Mac, a Koorie MC from Melbourne, performed at an outdoor concert and BBQ for 40 odd kids and their parents at the Ballarat Aboriginal Cooperative. The theme of the song and the day was education and the kids captured footage of the show and interviewed their parents and Elders about their school days."
