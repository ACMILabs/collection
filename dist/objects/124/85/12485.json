        "A short history of Stanley J. Ellis (b. 1899), influential artisan and teacher in the field of decorative metalwork and enamelling whose intricate work represents some of the finest examples of craftsmanship to be produced in the arts and craft movement of early 20th century Australia. His work is permanently held at the Castlemaine Art Gallery and Museum in regional Victoria and in this film we see some of those highly acclaimed pieces. The film also features interviews with Peter Perry (Director, Castlemaine Art Gallery and Museum) and Beth Sinclair, one of Ellis's students. Filmed by Malcolm McKinnon and made in association with the Castlemaine Art Gallery and Museum."
