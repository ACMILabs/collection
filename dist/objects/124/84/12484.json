        "One of two stories in MAP about the stuffed animal displays in the Murtoa Museum. In this short doco, Meryl Duder talks about her life in Murtoa as a young girl of 10, relating the tale of \"dad's goanna\" and how it ended up preserved in Mr Hill's house in Murtoa in a room full of many other stuffed animals. Years later, on returning to Murtoa with her daughter and to the Murtoa Museum, Meryl was delighted to be able to point out and say \"there's dad's goanna\". Filmed by Malcolm McKinnon and made with the assistance of Murtoa Historical Society and Murtoa Lions Club. The James Hill Bird Collection is held by the Lions Club of Murtoa under a special scientific license."
