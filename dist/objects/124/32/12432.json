        "In 2004 a collaboration between the City of Greater Dandenong, Big Fish (a design and construction team), and the community of Dandenong South was formed to create a permanent, highly visible sculpture representing the cultural diversity of Dandenong South. Children from the Dandenong South Primary School were given disposable cameras and asked to take photos of the things that were culturally important to them and their favourite places in Dandenong South. Conversations with the local school children, community leaders, local identities and workers in Dandenong South were recorded on film and it was from both the children's images and the different perspectives captured in the film that ultimately combined to provide the inspiration and design for the artists' symbolic community artwork."
