    ], 
    "description": [
        "\"The Bridge\" is a celebration of a childhood sense of place and belonging to the filmmakers' birthplace, Warrandyte by video artist John Hipwell. Created to celebrate the artists' early nexus with the neighbourhood, landscape and ambience of Warrandyte and its surrounds. \"The Bridge\" over the Yarra River also symbolises the journey from childhood to manhood. The Visaural (video painting with sound scape) is made up of 8 x 30 sec. short films each representing an important particular place central to the artists' maturation. When played conitnuously and randomly \"The Bridge\" becomes a metaphor for the filmmakers' early journey of adventure, discovery and development. The titles are: 1.  Home, Presbyterian Church and The Bridge 2.  Gold mines, Petrol Station and The Bridge 3.  Research Look Out, Monsalvat and The Bridge 4.  Primary School, Folk Art and The Bridge 5.  Creek, Yarra River and The Bridge 6.  Moonlight Cottage, Potters Cottage and The Bridge 7.  War Memorial, Car wrecks and The Bridge 8.  Bush fire, North Warrandyte Fire Brigade and The Bridge Music composed by John B. Hipwell (John Hipwell's father) and cinematography and editing by Adis Hondo."
