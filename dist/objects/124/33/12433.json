        "First Hand is a Koorie Heritage Trust cultural training and media project for young Indigenous people in Melbourne and regional areas. The project gives young Koories the skills to explore questions of culture and identity through the moving image. During late 2004 and early 2005, participants completed training in communications, media and cultural studies, practical workshops in video production and a scriptwriting workshop held in the Screen Pit at ACMI. Community elders from metropolitan and regional areas (including Uncle Wally Cooper, Aunty Joy Wandin-Murphy and Uncle Sandy Atkinson) facilitated discussions about Indigenous culture and identity."
