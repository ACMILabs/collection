        "The concept of the project was to represent the process of establishing data. The data was established as a set of 20 facts about the tree outside my house. The representations of the processes were to be strongly associated with my memories of learning and using these processes. Initially the concept of the project only dealt with the visualisation of the height of the tree and the process to establish that fact. The visualisation of this process was to be based on my childhood memories of a school activity. The initial concept was later widened to include 20 facts about the tree. I was more interested in the processes used to establish the facts than the facts themselves. I wanted to explore my memories and visually represent the process as a memory. The processes I wanted to represent were tied to the following facts: \u2022The name of the tree \u2022The botanical name of the tree \u2022The distance from the tree \u2022The angle to the top of the tree \u2022The height equals distance multiplied by pi \u2022The height of the tree \u2022The width of the trunk \u2022The volume of the tree \u2022The age of the tree \u2022The colour of the bark in RGB \u2022The colour of the bark in hexadecimal \u2022The bark\u2019s range and difference of colours \u2022The shape of the leaves \u2022The colour of the leaves \u2022The size of the leaves \u2022The area of the leaves \u2022The noise of the wind in the leaves of the tree \u2022The number of branches \u2022The location of the tree"
