        "Fantastic interactive work created as part of Project Snap by digital artist Ruth Fleishman and writer Jacinta Parsons in collaboration with local programmer Mark Johnson and Grade 5/6 students of Footscray West Primary on the topic of their local environment. Each class concentrated on a different environmental theme and combined that with their study of the earth's atmosphere. The themes include:  Earth's crust; Waterways; Earth's surface; Troposphere - pollution; Troposphere - global warming."
