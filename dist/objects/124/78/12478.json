    "description": [
        "In 2004, Brimbank City Council secured funding from Arts Victoria to engage an artist to work with local residents, from diverse locales, ages and backgrounds, to produce a compelling historical and contemporary sweep of life across the municipality. Artist Angela Bailey began work on the project in mid 2004. Angela worked closely with a host of contributors to collect stories , photos and moving images that provide vignettes of the local characters, cultures, interests and passions that drive the Brimbank heart beat. The Brimbank Beat CD-Rom is the result of this endeavour but there are other less tangible outcomes. Friendships were formed along the way and here, in this compilation of disparate interests and backgrounds emerges a single municipality called Brimbank. The historical film footage that is featured on Brimbank beat is from a film by the Victorian filmmaker John Henry Jackson."
