        "\"When an elephant lost his memory, a goldfish tried to help him to remember his past with her limited memory. The elephant couldn't remember anything. He even forgot the goldfish. At last, the elephant just left everything behind and walked away.\" Slow-moving, visually provocative and backed by a haunting soundtrack, this work has a surrealistic quality that engages the viewer. Its allegorical theme of memory is beautifully portrayed through a conversation between a man and a woman,and their relationship to one another. Filmed in black and white with English subtitles."
