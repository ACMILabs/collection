        "This film aims to counter the image that \"horses sweat, men perspire, but ladies only glow\" by encouraging young girls to actively particpate in sport and physical activities. Explores the influence of sex role conditioning in determining the traditionally rigid limits within which girls have been able to find physical expression."
