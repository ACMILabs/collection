        "Queries the limits to freedom of speech and assembly in America in 1967. After introducing the First Amendment, three enacted sequences are presented: in the first, students in a classroom argue about the government's foreign policies; in the second, the teacher forcefully leads the discussion, raising the question of academic freedom and the wishes of parents; the third sequence deals with an anti-war demonstration in which a threatening crowd forms, which questions the duty of the police. The film presents conflicting opinions and controversial scenes. It's purpose: to let you find out what you think. Footage includes demonstrations for civil rights, women's rights, African-American protest, KKK meetings."
