        "An impressionistic study of crowding in the United States as ascertained from statistical information translated into endless rows of sprawling suburban houses, cities devouring the land, the world compressing itself into a sardine can. Voices comment on the appalling implications of an ever swelling world. Indicates the prblems which stem from over-population both in under-developed countries and in the United States."
