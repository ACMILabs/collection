        "A comic cartoon, without commentary, showing that not everyone who rises to the challenge of sport can be sure of success. Pictured is a man with middle-aged flab who tackles the whole range of contemporary sports - swimming, bicycling, golfing, gymnastics, jogging - with great eagerness but equal ineptitude. At a time when physical fitness is much on the public mind, Sports Challenge is a friendly warning that fitness is not necessarily an inborn trait."
