        "A survey of the development of ballet in Australia. The contribution made by such enthusiasts as Edouard Borovansky, Helene Kirsova, Laurel Martyn, Dorothy Stevenson, and other Australian dancers in training and encouraging aspiring dancers, and the untiring efforts of the various corps des ballets, the majority of whom have had to fit in their clases and training, and in many cases, their actual performances, after normal working hours, are presented as the background to the status of ballet in Australia in 1948. Narrated by John Bushelle."
