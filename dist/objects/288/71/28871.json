        "St Mary's Church, Fairford, Gloucestershire is famous for its medieval stained glass windows, illustrating the Bible Story from the Garden of Eden to the Day of Judgment. This film provides a detailed study of the windows, which are notable for their wide range of characterisation and facial expression. The final sections, dealing with the Day of Judgment and the descent into Hell, conjure up a nightmare world reminiscent of Bosch. John Betjeman is the commentator and Robert Donat reads relevant passages from the authorised version of the Bible."
