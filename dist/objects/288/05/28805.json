        "Simple demonstrations are used to compare the speed of sound through air and through metal. Methods of determing the speed of sound in air, as determined by the French Academy Commission in 1738, and in water, as determined by Colladon and Sturm in Lake Geneva, are illustrated. Practical applications of the speed of sound are mentioned; the use of sound waves in echo sounding and depth plotting; sound ranging in gun location."
