        "Describes the conditions under which a spruce bog is formed, with details of the plant types found at successive stages of development from open water to mature spruce forest. Time-lapse photography illustrates the growth and decay of vegetation preceding the appearance of sphagnum moss which chokes off water to make the floor of the forest. Discusses the commercial use of peat extracted from such bogs, and the value of black spruce to Canada's pulp industry. Written by J.V. Durden. Photography by Dalton Muir. Editing by J.V. Durden. Music by Robert Fleming. Sound by George Croll. Voice and Narration by Geoffrey Hogwood. (Award: Salerno)"
