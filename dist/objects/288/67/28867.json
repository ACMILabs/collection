        "Episode of Series \"Speech\". Analyzes the causes of stage fright and shows how an inexperienced public speaker can overcome it in the following ways: Realise that someone in the audience is interested your experiences; prepare the speech, using examples, stories, reasons and conclusions; practise the presentation of the speech; speak directly to friendly members of the audience; ignore small mistakes; concentrate on what is to be said, not on how it is presented."
