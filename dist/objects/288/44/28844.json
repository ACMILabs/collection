        "Episode of Series \"Challenge for change/Societe nouvelle\". An animation film depicting the life of a certain Nina Polanski, who could be any woman. She marries amidst much fanfare and photo-snapping, and settles into a domestic routine of cooking, washing dishes, ironing, and babies. Eventually she becomes the very machines she uses every day, until one day she walks into the woods and takes back her old self."
