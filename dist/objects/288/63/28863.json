        "To understand the life of the Montagnais, you have to walk twelve days on snowshoes as far as Lake Musquaro in search of the caribou, following a dream contained within the skins of the drum that the elders patiently craft, like a canoe. The hunters hunt the caribou, which provide the skins for their drums which give them their dreams, which brings them the caribou."
