        "Follows the adjustment of two paroled prisoners as observed by their parole officer. One of the men, aging and tired, seems resigned to the \"square\" life of \"the street.\" He seems more in need of protection than supervision. The other is younger, more demanding of life and so more tempted. How the parole officer works to aid both through the parole period is convincingly shown."
