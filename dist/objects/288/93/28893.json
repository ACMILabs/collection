        "Completely new techniques in the search for oil. The research vessel \"Calypso\", equipped with special scientific gear, took a team of geologists and aqualung divers to survey the sea bed of the Persian Gulf in 1954. A submarine gravimeter is seen in action on the sea bed, and the divers, filmed at depths up to 100 feet, are shown taking samples from the floor of the Gulf. The samples are studied by geologists while the \"Calypso\" moves on to a new station."
