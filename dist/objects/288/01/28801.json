        "This informative piece is based around a doctor who experiments on animals to find out what significance each side of the brain has, thus a monkey is operated on to \"split his brain\". Tests are then run to monitor the monkey's process. Split brain people are then looked into to find out what the left and right side of the brain does. NB: CONTAINS DISTURBING IMAGES OF ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION."
