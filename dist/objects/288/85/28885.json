        "An experiment in film animation in which \"stars\" and \"stripes\" perform acrobatics to the tune of the John Philip Sousa's march. Rippling stripes and gay sparkling stars jump and undulate, dash about the screen, and break into effects suggesting a fireworks display. Sometimes part of a stripe pursues a star. Finally the stars become flashing meteors and burst in light and colour. The film was made without a camera, by Norman McLaren drawing and colouring directly on film."
