        "This is a factual account of the life of policemen at one station in Montreal, drawn from sixty days and nights of on-the-spot filming. It is a view of life in the inner city that usually only the policeman has reason to encounter. There are ugly incidents here, but there is also reassurance that people in trouble do have help at hand, and that even for the law breaker the policeman does his work with impartiality, and usually with understanding and good humour. (Awards: Montreal; Melbourne.)"
