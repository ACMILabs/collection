        "A play on motion, against a background of multi-hued sky. Spheres of translucent pearl seem to float weightlessly in the unlimited panorama of the sky, grouping, regrouping, at times colliding like some stylised burst of the atomic chain reaction. Set to the music of Bach, played by pianist Glenn Gould. (Awards: Cordoba)"
