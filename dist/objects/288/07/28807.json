        "Emphasises the fact the Britain is becoming more dependent upon scrap metal to maintain her output of iron and steel. Iron ore deposits in the Midlands and imported ore from Africa provide insufficient supplies for new steel; over half the iron and steel produced in the United Kingdom is made from scrap. shows conversion of scrap to new steel in electric carbon-arc furnaces; by-product of process is slag, used as fertiliser."
