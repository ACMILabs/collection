        "The Freycinet and Mount Field National Parks in Tasmania. Family parties and bushwalkers visit the Freycinet Peninsular where the red granite peaks of the Hazards dominate the sheltered waters of Coles Bay. From the summit of the highest peak, Mt Amos, there is a magnificent view of Wineglass Bay. At Mt Field we find the Russell Falls, Lake Dobson, Lake Seal, the towering dolerite columns of the watcher, and beautiful trees, birds and mosses to delight the visitor."
