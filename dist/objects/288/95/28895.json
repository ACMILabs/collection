        "Episode of Series \"College Physics\". Animated drawings are used in explaining the nature of stationary waves. Includes demonstrations of pulse reflection at the fixed end of a stretched string, the reflection of a steady wave train at the string boundary, and compounding of oppositely travelling wave trains. Identifies nodes and anti-nodes, and shows the resonance patterns for a stretched string of limited length."
