        "A reality program providing an inside look into a criminal trial which took place in Perth. The key players in this real-life drama are: the Accused; Laurie Levy and Philip Dunn QC for the Defence; Hilton Dembo for the Prosecution; Justice Christine Wheeler as the presiding Judge; an observer in the Public Gallery; and the three key witnesses (portrayed by actors). The law prohibits any filming of a jury and there was also a Court Order protecting the three key witnesses. The accused has been charged of importing 13kg of drugs, mainly amphetamines and ecstacy, and if found guilty, could be sentenced to a maximum of 25 years in prison. This is an interesting and entertaining program showing the workings of the court, the day-to-day procedures, the strategies and legal tactics of both the Defence and the Prosecution, the questioning of the witnesses, all interspersed with personal commentaries from some of those involved. Tension, drama, witty exchanges, human frailties are all part of a day's work for the barristers and lawyers and as such \"The Accused\" reveals the human side of what is often thought of as an intimidating and rigidly conservative environment. It is worth watching just to experience the tension and build-up of frustration when waiting for the jury's verdict. Narrated by Tony Martin. NOTE: \"This is the first time a full criminal trial has been filmed in Australia.\""
