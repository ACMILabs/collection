    "description": [
        "Six episodes of the Japanese animated television series, \"Sailor Moon\", entitled \"The doom tree strikes\". The setting is Cross Roads Junior High School, and Serena, a young girl possesses a magical brooch that invokes mystical forces, transforming her into the powerful Sailor Moon, a super-heroine whose mission is to protect humanity from evil demons from a parallel universe. Fellow Sailor Scouts, Jupiter, Mercury and Mars join her on her adventures. Episodes featured are: \"A Knight to remember\" When a monstrous creature attacks the Sailor crew, a mysterious knight (could it be Darien?) comes to the rescue; \"VR madness\" A virtual reality theatre is the location for the mega-verse's latest assault, but without her tiara, Serena is helpless to aid her imperilled family. \"Cherry blossom time\" Sailor Moon and her friends are in danger when they are captured by alien beings. \"Kindergarten chaos\" Several potent beings with malevolent intentions threaten the lives of kindergarten children, until the Sailor crew intervene. \"Much ado about babysitting\" Darien and Sailor Moon baby-sit together whilst evil forces try to rob babies of their energy. \"Raye's day in the spotlight\" Raye organises and stars in the Autumn festival but a monster from a mega-verse makes a guest appearance. Based on the original comic \"Sailor Moon\" by Naoko Takeuchi, the series is underpinned by the decent moral codes of friendship, honesty, responsible behaviour, respect and selflessness."
