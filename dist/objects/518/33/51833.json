        "At the end of the twentieth century evidence of an advanced alien civilization emerges when an enormous spaceship crashes on earth. The United Earth government is formed to combat impending invasion and to research the advanced and dangerous alien technologies. In this American futuristic anime television series Rick, Ben, Max, and Lisa are four earthlings doing battle in cyber-space, whilst dealing with their complex romantic lives. This disc, entitled \"War and peace\", contains six episodes from the \"Macross Saga\". \"Wedding bells\": Max's budding romance takes a dramatic turn as outside forces try to stymie his marriage to a Micronian. \"The Messenger\": an uneasy truce is drawn as the Zentraedi sends a convoy to discuss peace plans. \"Force of arms\": the earth is surrounded by an armada of enemy vessels. \"Reconstruction blues\": the earth faces the mammoth task of rebuilding, as the SDF-1 crew assess the damage. \"Robotech masters\": war begins to creep back into the lives of those who have fought hard for peace. \"Viva Miriya\": several unlikely forces join an alliance for peace."
