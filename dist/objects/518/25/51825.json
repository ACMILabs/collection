        "Joe Gideon is a chain-smoking, pill popping workaholic obsessed with producing, directing and choreographing a Broadway musical while womanising and editing his latest film (actually Fosse's own film \"Lenny\"). This semi-autobiographical musical drama is framed by Gideon's conversations with a mysterious figure of nemesis the \"Lady in White\". Following Gideon's heart attack, the film assumes a surreal hallucinatory logic. Not only does Fosse borrow freely from the European classics \"8 1/2\" and \"The Seventh seal\" but he inverts the showbiz and life affirming \"That's entertainment\" ethos of the traditional musical. Cast includes Roy Scheider, Jessica Lange, Ann Reinking and John Lithgow. Awards: Winner, Best Art Direction, Costume Design, Editing, Best Score, Academy Awards, 1979."
