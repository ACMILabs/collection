        "This low-key documentary on filmmaking brothers Ethan and Joel Coen, was made during the filming of \"O Brother where art thou?\" The media shy brothers are reputed for playing with established film genres, and a disciplined approach that has enabled them to gain autonomy from studio executives and artistic freedom to create idiosyncratic, original work. Their oeuvre includes \"Fargo\", \"Raising Arizona\", \"The Big Lebowski\", \"The Hudsucker proxy\", \"Miller's crossing\" and \"Barton Fink\". The Coens' meticulous planning of production allows them to consistently deliver films on budget that often achieve cult status. As a film student Joel was working on others' low budget films, before undertaking the writing of original scripts with his philosophy graduate brother, Ethan. Their first film, \"Blood simple\" was an instantaneous alternative classic. The brothers have an unusual style in that they both contribute to filmmaking tasks and share screenwriting recognition, but Joel is credited with directing and Ethan with producing. Features interviews with the Coens, George Clooney, Peter Stormare, Holly Hunter, Jeff Bridges, John Turturro, former school teachers, and a range of close friends who attempt to explain the Coens' relaxed and symbiotic working relationship. Although they have made the occasional dud, the Coens are consistent in their output and appear to have an untapped well of ideas at their disposal."
