        "A hip, urban comedy of manners about male friendship, dating and the fantastically labyrinthine rules of how to stay cool in LA. Directed by Doug Liman (Go, The Bourne Identity), this film catapulted into the spotlight actors Jon Favreau (who also wrote the screenplay) and Vince Vaughn. Mike (Favreau), an out of work actor and comedian, is lovesick for his long-term girlfriend who he hasn't heard from in six months. Buoyed in his misery by friends Trent, Rob and Sue, Mike is taken to a slew of groovy LA bars and parties in the hope that he'll meet a babe and be jolted out of his despair. Trent (Vaughn) is Mike's most confident and smooth talking friend, a sartorial charmer who has a way with the ladies and is constantly on the make. Mike struggles with the convoluted courtship rules, whilst battling his extensive self-doubts and self-consciousness. \"Swingers\" works as a sharp satire of the LA scene where bit actors scrape by on the glory of call-backs for pilots and former glories are regurgitated in the hope of getting lucky in love. With a warm, energetic quality, and a talky, funny script, the film regales the audience with memorable characters and hilarious scenarios."
