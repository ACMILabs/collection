        "In the Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, a concerted effort is underway by the Wildlife Conservation Society to save the dwindling population of tigers. 95% of the tiger population has disappeared in the past 100 years, and in the last three years, only two Indo-Chinese tigers have been sighted in Khao Yai with humans outnumbering the creatures by ten to one in a market in which trading in tiger products is as lucrative as trading in cocaine. Poachers present the biggest threat to tigers; the animals they kill are the tiger's potential food source, the trees that are chipped part of their habitat. Years ago people inhabited the National Park, now they have been forced to move to the outer perimeters of the park and rely on illegal hunting in the forest for survival. The program also follows the undercover activities of a group of conservationists and law enforcement agents to curtail the illegal trade in tiger products, particularly in Chinatown, Bangkok."
