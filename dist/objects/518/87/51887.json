        "This visually stunning documentary is an innovative portrait of the Australian desert as seen through the eyes of five contemporary Australian artists: Gloria Petyarre, Judy Watson, Peter Sharp, Jenny Sages and Idris Murphy. Following the creative journeys of the artists - both Indigenous and non-Indigenous - from blank canvas to finished painting, the film provides a fresh insight into the connections between art and place and our changing attitudes to Australia's outback. Each artist has a different relationship to the land they paint yet all are attempting to express their identity and sense of belonging through their work. Beautiful visual imagery edited in a series of striking dissolves and fades, clearly demonstrates the relationships between the artists' work and the land. Cinematography by Joel Peterson. Editing by Nick Meyers. Comprehensive teachers notes available at: http://www.filmaust.com.au/programs/teachers_notes/8607twothirdssky.pdf"
