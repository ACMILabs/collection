        "Rivers of the World is a fascinating journey to some of the most spectacular rivers on this planet. We begin the journey at the Orinoco in Venezuela, travelling onto the Angara in central Asia which begins at Lake Baikal and holds 1/5 of the worlds fresh water, onto the Danube in Europe followed by the Nile in Egypt, the longest river in the world. Our final destination is the Mississippi in North America which has one of the busiest ports in the world. Along the way we see the people that these rivers have vital importance to. For example, the existence of the Warao People on the Orinoca lies solely with a running river to the city of Cairo on the Nile which, due to the river running directly through a desert, has enabled Cairo to produce an abundance of tropical fruit such as mangos and mandarins, truly amazing considering the dry and harsh surrounds of Egypt."
