    ], 
    "description": [
        "Three funny animated children's stories from the brilliantly playful mind of Dr Seuss (less commonly known as Theodor Geisel). \"Butter battle book\" (prod. Ralph Bakshi) - the tale of two groups of people, the Zooks and the Yooks, at war over the issue of which side is the correct one to butter bread on. An amusing parable about intolerance and arrogance. \"Daisy-Head Mayzie\" (prod. Christopher O'Hare, dir. Tony Collingwood)- a lovely young lady, named Mayzie, discovers a daisy growing out the top of her head. Her schoolteachers and townsfolk are thrown into a flap about what to do with poor Mayzie, who learns a lesson about the perils of fame and money, and the importance of family. \"Horton hatches the egg\" (prod. Leon Schlesinger, dir. Robert Clampett) - Horton, a kind-hearted elephant, agrees to sit on an unhatched egg for a mother bird named Maisy, who is in need of a holiday. When the lazy Maisy decides she likes it too much at the beach, the ever-faithful Horton sits on the egg through thick and thin, determined to hatch it safely, despite bad weather and the ridicule of his friends. These animated tales, imbued with gentle humour, and the rhyming prose of Dr Seuss, should prove a delight to children."
