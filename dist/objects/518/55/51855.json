        "When Angelica catches a few scenes from the \"The Godfather\" on television, she takes it upon herself to become the Bubfather and grants wishes to her fellow Rugrats. Chuckie's wish is to have a new mother. Not long after, Stu Pickles receives an emergency call to travel to Europetarland, France, to repair a faulty Raptor and pacify rampaging theme park director, Coco LaBouche. He's invited to bring family and friends for company and the Rugrats find themselves in Paris. In an effort to gain a promotion and become company president, the child hating Coco makes a play for Chuckie's hapless father Chas in a desperate attempt to win favour with the outgoing President. Only Angelica knows of Coco's cunning plan and it's up to the Rugrats to save Chas, imperilling a few famous landmarks along the way. Humorous throughout, the film has a strong sense of familial values and what constitutes \"good\" parenting. Features the voices of Susan Sarandon, John Lithgow, Debbie Reynolds, Christine Cavanaugh, Elizabeth Daily and Cheryl Chase."
