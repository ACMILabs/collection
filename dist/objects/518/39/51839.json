        "Princess Odette is betrothed to Prince Derek, but after he unsuccessfully explains why he loves her, beyond her beauty, she flees heartbroken with her father. On the journey, trouble befalls them when the carriage is attacked by the evil Rothbart; an enchanter who was banished from King William's (Odette's father) kingdom for treason. Rothbart places a spell on Odette, turning her into a swan and demanding that she marry him. The only time Odette returns to her human form is when moonlight touches her wings, as soon as it disappears, wherever she is, her form returns to that of the swan. Assisted by her three new forest friends, Jean Bob (a frog), Speed (a turtle) and Puffin (a bird), Odette tries to overthrow the power of her captor while Derek tries to be reunited with his love and avoid the matchmaking efforts of his parents. Features the voices of Jack Palance, Howard McGillin, Michelle Nicastro, John Cleese and Steven Wright."
