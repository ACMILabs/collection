        "Episode of Series \"Australian story (Television program)\". 280 families were affected by the deployment of the 7th and 8th battalion with INTERFET (UN Sanctioned International Force in East Timor). For the women and families left behind, there was a pressing need for group support. Shying away from a tag such as \"the army wives club,\" Patti-Jane Gould established the P.I.T. crew - Partners In Timor. The women of this support network speak candidly of the impact their partners departure has had on them and their children, how it feels to say goodbye, their fears, and how they adjust when life returns to \"normal.\" Army personnel share their fears and thoughts too and how their lives have changed since Timor. Finally, we share an emotional reunion on the docks. Introduced by Lieutenant General Peter Cosgrove."
