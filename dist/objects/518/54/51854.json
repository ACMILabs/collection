        "Six episodes of the Japanese animated television series, \"Sailor Moon\", entitled \"The Return of the doom tree\". The setting is Cross Roads Junior High School and Serena, a young girl, possesses a magical brooch that invokes mystical forces, transforming her into the powerful Sailor Moon, a super-heroine whose mission is to protect humanity from evil demons from a parallel universe. Fellow Sailor Scouts, Jupiter, Mercury and Mars join her on her adventures. Episodes include: \"Food fetish\" Serena suspects that Darien, who she has a major crush on, may be the Moonlight Knight; \"Mirror, mirror on the wall\" When Darien stages Snow White and the seven dwarfs, the Sailor scouts compete for the major parts but wicked ulterior motives mar the proceedings; \"Detention doldrums\" Much to her dismay, Serena is detained after school. \"Secret garden\" When Serena uncovers the secret identities of Alan and Anne, she has to use the zenith of her powers to fight for her life. \"Treed\" Serena struggles to free herself from Alan and Anne's doom tree. \"Serena times two\" Serena becomes jealous when a wicked baby falls from the sky in search of a powerful crystal. Based on the original comic \"Sailor Moon\" by Naoko Takeuchi. The series is underpinned by the decent moral codes of friendship, honesty, responsible behaviour, respect and selflessness."
