        "A sequel to Hoaas' \"Pyongyang diaries\", \"Rushing to sunshine\" continues the filmmaker's personal diaristic exploration of the social and political realities of life in North and South Korea. Drawing on material she gathered over a two year period from March 1998 to March 2000, a period of great economic upheaval and social change in South Korea, Hoaas' reflects on the country's attempts at reconciliation with North Korea motivated by Kim Dae Jung's 'Sunshine Policy.' Combining her personal insights with the stories of former political prisoners, student dissidents, academics and people on the street, Hoaas uncovers the uncomfortable paradoxes that face a society caught between the Government's new open door policy and the remnants of a cold war anti-Communist mindset. In English and Korean with English subtitles."
