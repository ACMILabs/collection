        "Arnold Schwarzenegger is the \"Terminator\", a deadly cyborg - part man, part machine, sent back from the future to present day Los Angeles. His mission is to kill an unsuspecting young woman, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Her only hope for survival lies with a guerrilla fighter (Michael Biehn), also from the future, whose task is to protect her at all costs. A trail of destruction and violence follows in the wake of their desperate struggle to escape the Terminator. This is a gripping science-fiction thriller, packed with action, suspense, terrific special effects and just the right amount of dark humour."
