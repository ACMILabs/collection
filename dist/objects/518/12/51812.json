        "This comedy/drama about the impact of AIDS on a gay relationship draws on the same 'ghostly lover' premise as \"Ghost\" and \"Truly, madly, deeply\". Mark, a drag performer, is HIV positive and in poor health. While he spends his last days at home preparing his own AIDS memorial quilt, his spunky young HIV negative boyfriend Simon, in denial about Mark's impending death, cruises clubs and sleeps with other men. When Mark finally dies, Simon continues to pursue his hedonistic lifestyle until Mark returns to haunt his faithless lover. Mark's endless beyond-the-grave pranks finally force Simon to face some long-submerged feelings and come to terms with his love and grief. While the patchy script undermines the film's attempts to bring a comic touch to a serious subject, \"To die for\" offers a refreshing alternative to other films that focus solely on the horrors of the AIDS virus. Cast includes Thomas Arklie, Ian Williams, Tony Slattery, Dillie Keane."
