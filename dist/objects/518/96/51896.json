        "In 1978, producer/director Bill Leimbach visited the Indonesian island of Bali and filmed a group of young Balinese boys who had discovered the art of surfing. This is the sequel to that film \"Balinese surfer\" as Bill and his production team revisit the original group, now all aged in their 40s, 25 years later. We follow their individual stories, the direction life has taken them, and how most of them still take time out to surf. Through personal narratives, intercut with footage from the original film, these Balinese men all express their concern for the environment, particularly with the enormous increase in tourism during the 80s and 90s. Their priority issues are with maintaining the supply of fresh water, and preventing sewage run-off into the ocean, reef bombing, and toxic gases from burning plastic. Bali is renowned for having some of the best waves in the world and through a program of surfing contests (attracting the international media), surfing magazines and an organization called Wave of Change, the focus is now on the next generation, who also surf, to be environmental ambassadors and promote the message for preservation of the marine environment and a policy of sustainable development in Bali and throughout the Indonesian islands. Narration - John Sheerin; Director of Photography - Simon Manzie."
