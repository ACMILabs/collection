        "Emperor Kuzco is an arrogant and selfish leader and his latest plan involves destroying a hill top village to build a summer palace. He invites village elder Pancha in to discuss options, but only to find out the best place to get the sun. When the amnesiac emperor awakes to find himself turned into a llama, he blames the kindly Pancho, unaware that his conniving advisor, the wizened Yzma, and brawny brainless sidekick Kronk, have usurped his power. Demanding he be returned to the palace, Kuzco pushes Pancha's faith that to the limit that all human beings possess goodness. Featuring the voices of David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, Patrick Warburton, Wendie Malick and music by Tom Jones and Sting, this witty Disney animation espouses the virtues of friendship and kindness to others."
