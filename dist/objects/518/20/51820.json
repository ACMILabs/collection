        "Documentary about Pakistani musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, a unique singer revered for his contribution to world music. Khan performs Qawwli, an ancient time-honoured Soufi music that is reputed to be sung on earth by prophets of Mohammad. Now deceased, Khan benefited from the promotional efforts of Peter Gabriel, which lead to collaborations with well-known singers Bjork and Jeff Buckley. Classically trained, Khan played traditional instruments such as the tabla, sarangi, sitar, dilruba and sarod, often favouring the harmonium as accompaniment. In an extensive recent and enlightening interview Khan discusses his upbringing and music tutelage at the hands of his father - Qawwli custom dictates that the teachings are passed from father to eldest son. Features an array of stunning performances from Khan, some performed mid-interview, which showcase his exceptional style, noble talents and evident respect for culture."
