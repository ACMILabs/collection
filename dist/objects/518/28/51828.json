        "Dark love continues the lonely journey of the vampire guardian Miyu and her eternal companion, Larva, with the five stories presented in this compilation focusing on the theme of forbidden love. In \"The moray boat\", Miyu encounters problems when she comes to vanquish the shinma Ayu, who has fallen in love with a failed author. In \"City of illusion\", Miyu and Reiha sense the evil of a shinma at work when buildings mysteriously begin to dissolve into piles of sand. In \"Love of the dolls\", a gifted dollmaker gets more than she bargained for when a fit of jealousy animates her most precious creation. In \"Butterfly enchantment\", Miyu is drawn into the strange life of Ruri Sone, and the dark secret that haunts her soul. In \"Flag of shinma\", Miyu makes an enemy of Reiha forever when she wanders into an alternate world and intervenes in a battle to save a young girl from becoming the bride of three shinma brothers. Based on the shoujo manga by Kakinouchi Narumi."
