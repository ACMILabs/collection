        "Mid-1980s anime from the American television show \"Robotech\" - continues the exciting story of Lisa, Rick, Ben and Max - four earthling heroes from the \"Macross Saga\". Entitled \"The Sentinels\" (essentially three episodes from an incomplete Robotech season), this film sees Lisa, Rick, and crew continue to do battle in cyber-space, combating awesome alien powers. The back-story: at the end of the twentieth century an enormous spaceship crashes on earth; evidence emerges of an advanced alien civilization that has developed systems, called Robotechnology, that provides them with awesome and destructive powers. The United Earth government is formed to combat impending invasion and to research these advanced technologies; various forces from around the universe are engaged in vicious wars over the course of fourteen years, regrouping as battle upon battle is gallantly fought. Picking up where the \"Macross saga\" left off, Lisa and Rick are on the cusp of being married when a major attack is launched by the Invid. Led by Lisa, the intrepid team form the Robotech Expeditionary Force launching a quest to find the home of the Robotech masters in order to learn more about the formidable powers of Robotechnology and in the hope of finally mastering the enemy."
