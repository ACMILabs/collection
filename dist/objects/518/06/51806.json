        "Iconic comedy from the Monty Python team, \"The Life of Brian\" ridicules Christianity, organised religion, politics, underground subversives and Jesus Christ. From birth, the unfortunate and guileless Brian is mistaken for the Son of God and dogged by his nearby presence as well as being pestered by his shrewish mother. The Monty Python crew each play numerous roles within the film, creating an anarchic madcap spoof of Biblical films and religious epics. With several musical interludes, including \"Always look on the bright side of life\" (sung at the crucifixion) the writers slay many sacred cows in the name of comedy. Blissfully sacrilegious and completely irreverent, \"Life of Brian\" was banned in several countries, but nevertheless garnered cult status and is regarded by many as the funniest of the Monty Python's feature films. Also features Spike Milligan and Beatle George Harrison, whose company produced the film."
