        "Five animated stories from famous children's author Eric Carle. In \"The Very hungry caterpillar,\" a caterpillar born on a Sunday eats a little more each day of the week but never seems to have his appetite satisfied. Until next Sunday that is, when he builds himself a cocoon. \"Papa, please get the moon for me\": Before she goes to bed, little Monica looks out the window and spies the moon, longing to play with it, but try as she might, she can't reach it, and asks her papa for help. \"The Very quiet cricket\": A baby cricket struggles to answer the call of other insects; when he rubs his legs together there's no sound. \"The Mixed-up chameleon\": An unhappy chameleon, unsure of what he wants to be, seeks inspiration from creatures at the zoo. \"I See a song\": A violinist plays notes that manifest themselves as a morphing array of colours, shapes and images. Stories narrated by Roger McGough and Juliet Stevenson. Music by Julian Nott."
