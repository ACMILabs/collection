        "Amelie is the story of a lonely and wistful only child who grows into a woman of yearning and seeks, in minute but effective ways, to improve the lives of those around her. Various eccentrics people the Montmarte district, where Amelie is a waitress; identifying their needs, and those of her neighbours, Amelie sets into motion elaborate plans to (anonymously) relieve their ailments. Amelie's schemes are both ingenious and creative but she neglects her own desires, in particular her burgeoning romantic feelings for Nino, a patron at her cafe. \"Amelie\" utilises computer-generated images to reflect the emotional essence of the protagonists' state and presents a fantastical Montmarte that is awash in glorious colour, markedly absent of graffiti or unsavoury elements. Unlike the previous features of Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City of lost children), the film's mise-en-scene works at conveying a light-hearted whimsy about the life of its heroine and her environs, determinedly steering away from the dark side. Whilst Amelie is at times shamelessly feel-good, in essence the film works as a fanciful romantic-fantasy, accompanied by a charming soundtrack. Depending on one's tolerance for cuteness, audiences should find this film a delight, as did the millions who made it a huge hit in France. In French with English subtitles."
