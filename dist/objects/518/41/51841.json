        "A German-Australian co-production created by Peter Maffay, Gregor Rottschalk and Rolf Zuckowski, Tabaluga is the last surviving dragon on earth. Using a combination of fire and flight, both peaceful options, Tabaluga fights his nemesis the evil snowman Arktos, intent on ruining Tabaluga's home of Greenland by covering it with snow and ice, thus making it inhospitable. Popular with adults and children alike, \"Tabaluga\" is in its third series and a feature film is in production. \"Someone is cheating\" (story by Gregor Rottschalk): Morris the Ice Welder is banished from Ice World with toy friend Annabel, tired, hungry and friendless. Arktos plans to take over Greenland and challenges the peaceful country to the Arctic Games; the winner takes all, including several hectares of the loser's land. \"Mr Nice guy\" (story by John Palmer): Arktos demands a new flavour of ice cream and sends James, disguised as a clown, to Greenland to fetch fruit to make fruit ice cream. Surprisingly, he finds himself befriended by Tabaluga. \"Too much salt is detrimental to the health\" (story by Gregor Rottschalk): Arktos promises his disgruntled workers that he will give them more ice cream if they work harder. The only problem is that Ice World does not have enough water to maintain the supply and Arktos devises a cunning plan to build a dam between Ice World and Greenland, supposedly an advantageous gift to Greenland."
