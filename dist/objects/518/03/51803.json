        "Susan (Madonna) is a free spirit: she lives fast and breaks hearts. After walking out on a high roller in Atlantic City - taking a priceless pair of Egyptian earrings with her - she returns to New York, only to read a newspaper headline describing his murder. She doesn't realise the killer is now on the trail of the earrings, a trail which will inevitably lead him to her. Meanwhile, bored housewife, Roberta (Rosanna Arquette) is idly reading the Personal Ads. \"Desperately seeking Susan\" announces a lover's plea, and she wishes someone would desperately look for her. Susan makes the rendezvous and so does Roberta. And from then on their lives intertwine in a high-speed drama of fantasy and reality. Exchanging clothes, identities - and men, even the murderer doesn't know which Susan he's desperate to meet. Cast also includes Aidan Quinn."
