        "Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the rings\" trilogy brought the world of Tolkien's Middle Earth to the big screen and gave visual presence to an era familiar to a legion of fans. This presentation from \"National Geographic\" seeks to find the inspiration and influences behind Tolkien's work and the relevance of the quest today. Issues covered include the origins of the Elvish language and the race of hobbits, the impact of mass industrialization to the detriment of the environment, the onset of World War I, and Anglo-Saxon culture as presented in \"Beowulf\" on Tolkien's writing. Includes interviews with cast members, director Peter Jackson, publisher and personal friend of Tolkien, Ray Unwin, historians and archaeologists, and location scouts for the film who provide fascinating details about re-creating Middle Earth. Narrated by Phil Crowley."
