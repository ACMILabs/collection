        "13 young children of varying ages share their delightfully frank observations about events that have changed their lives. Danielle, 10, attends the birth of her new sibling. Angus, 6, has just received a new baby sister and it's affecting the amount of time he gets to spend with mum. Nicholas, 9, and his sister have an upbringing that involves a lot of musical and sporting extra curricular activities. Three Turkish sisters Pelin, Sermin, Suna have lived in an inner city high-rise since emigrating from Turkey 8 years ago. Kendel, 11, is an only child with parents who work long hours. Andrew and Sarah have parents who both work and discuss routines and discipline. Tessie, 8, lives with her mother following her parent's divorce. She describes what it was like when her father left and when her mother started seeing someone else. Richard, 12, has lived with his father since his parents divorced and his father is about to remarry. Troy (13) and Amanda (12) live with their grandmother and aunt. Their mother lives in New Zealand and they didn't know their fathers. Speaking with candour, the children show remarkable insight into the dynamics of the family. Please note: child birth scene"
