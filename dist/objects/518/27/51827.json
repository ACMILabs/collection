        "For his film debut director Simon Wincer chose to tread the well-chartered territory of the horror thriller, in which the life for an innocent character is irretrievably changed through a combination of naivety and bad encounters. Angela, a young hairdresser with modelling ambitions, is talked into posing nude for a photo in order to attract attention. Soon enough, the attention is transformed in stalking, complete with the discovery of a pig's head in her bed. Of the sleazy producer, the eccentric magazine producer and the clingy ex-boyfriend -- who wants Angela dead and why? Reference: Greg Kerr 'Australian Film' (Scott Murray ed.) Oxford University Press, 1995: p. 47."
