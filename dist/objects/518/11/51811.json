        "Two convicts - one black, one white - escape across country chained together. Initially the yard of chain shackles two bitter enemies but gradually a bond grows between them. Dramatically and cinematically this is probably the most satisfying of Kramer's \"message\" pictures but, although free of sentimentality and polemics, the notion of universal brotherhood is perhaps too simplistic to carry much conceptual interest. Winner of two Academy Awards (1958). Cast includes Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier."
