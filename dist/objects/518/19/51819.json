        "Patrick, having murdered his mother and her lover, has become a polyplegic, pre-oedipal, psychotic lump. He has telekinetic powers, fancies his nurse and is hostile to his doctor. This is an entertaining mix of black humour and suspense with a few shocks. Cast includes Susan Penhaligon, Robert Helpmann and Rod Mullinar."
