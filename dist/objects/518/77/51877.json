    "description": [
        "Popular comic English television program \"Dad's army\", which ran for nine years, is about numerous men that comprise the local division of the Home Guard in the seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea during World War 2. The men are an eccentric lot who range in age from the very young to the decidedly doddery. In each episode the group muddle their way through a different situation in their own idiosyncratic way. Episodes include \"No spring for Frazer\" (1969, 30 mins) Frazer looses the spring from Captain Mainwaring's machine gun, which may have ended up in Mr Blewitt's coffin. \"Mums army\" (1970, 31 mins) Captain Mainwaring recruits women-folk to help fight the Nazis. \"Menace from the deep\" (1969, 30 mins) The Home Guard is manning the machine gun post, Pike's lost the boat and the food, and the platoon is nearly blown sky high. \"When did you last see your money?\" (1972, 30 mins) Jones causes mayhem at the bank when he tries to pay half a pound of sausages into his account. \"The Honourable man\" (1973, 31 mins) When Sergeant Wilson loses a relative he finds himself on the outer fringes of the aristocracy, much to the chagrin of Mainwaring."
