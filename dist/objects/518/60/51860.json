        "Profiles social critic and outspoken head of Canada's largest citizens rights group, the Council of Canadians, Maude Barlow. Through interviews with family members and Barlow herself, we hear how her fighting spirit emerged from an early age, her introduction to feminism in the 1970s as a young mother, and her involvement in women's affairs, including areas such as media pornography, equality and reform for the living conditions of women prisoners. Most noticeably, Barlow spearheaded the Council of Canadian's court challenge against the Competition Bureau and Hollinger Inc after the Canadian government supported media magnate Conrad Black's takeover of Southam Newspapers - without public debate. The decision would give Barlow's company control over more than half of Canada's daily newspapers. Includes footage from various speeches and forums Barlow has taken part in, including \"The Free trade debate\". She also shares her views on corporate rule and globalisation."
