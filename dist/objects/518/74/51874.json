        "Animated adaptation of \"The Little train that could\" by Watty Piper, this classic children's fable is about perseverance, self-motivation and teamwork. In a busy yard filled with hard-working locomotives of all kinds, a tiny engine named Tillie dreams of pulling a real train over the mountain beyond. Everyone tells her that she is too small to manage such a feat - but Tillie firmly believes in herself. One fateful day, the all-important Birthday Train loaded with magical toys breaks down and when none of the other engines will stop to help, Tillie hooks herself to the stranded train and starts up the steep, forbidding mountainside with the famous call\" I think I can, I think I can\"."
