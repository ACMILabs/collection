        "In a stroke of filmmaking inspiration, director John Sturges saw the possibilities of transposing Akira Kurosawa's film classic \"The Seven samurai\", from feudal Japan to the American West. And it works brilliantly. Yul Brynner stars as the leader of a group of skilled gunfighters hired to protect a poor Mexican village from marauding bandits led by the vicious Calvera, played with ruthless delight by Eli Wallach. Fighting alongside Brynner and Steve McQueen are Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Robert Vaughn, whose film careers were launched by this film. With a now-classic musical score and stunning cinematography, this film provides exciting entertainment as well as touching on themes of dignity, honour, courage and survival. The film established a new standard for generations of Westerns to come."
