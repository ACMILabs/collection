        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Nightmare: the birth of horror\". Appearing on screen in over 200 different incantations, the character of Dracula is the most famous of horror icons and set the template for a mass horror movement. Taking Bram Stoker's novel as the basis, writer and presenter Professor Christopher Frayling traces the origins of the vampire myth and the inspiration behind the novel - a combination of nightmare, literary influences, location and personal anecdotes. Frayling reviews the existing documentation of Stoker's notes and moves through how the story came into being, the process Stoker took in writing the novel, and how it has developed, been interpreted and reinterpreted since then, in comic strips, melodramas and motion pictures."
