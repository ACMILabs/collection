        "A confronting documentary which discusses the experiences of one Aboriginal family as a result of the Australian government's policy in the first 70 years of the 20th Century of removing mixed Aboriginal children from their Aboriginal families and placing them in institutions or foster homes. The impact on thousands of Aboriginal families of being cut off from each other, their language and culture is evoked here in a very personal context. One family journey's through the remembrance of the trauma of separation, confronting the consequences of it on their lives and the gradual process of being reunited and grieving for those family members they have lost. The progress of one family member is traced in detail from youth to time in jail to his release and his efforts to come to terms with his past and hopes for the future. Contains extensive interviews with family members, aboriginal support group leaders, and foster family members among others."
