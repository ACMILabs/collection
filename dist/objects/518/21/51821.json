        "Documentary on singer Cesaria Evora, born in the port town of Mindelo on the Cape Verde island of Sao Vicente - a former Portuguese colony off the north-west coast of Africa. Evora (born 1941) has brought the unique sounds of her birthplace, known as 'morna' - a slow, rhythmic song form that is a mix of blues, jazz and Portuguese folk - to world attention. Her magnificent voice and soulful singing is often accompanied by the acoustic sounds of guitar, cavaquinho, violin, accordion, and clarinet, in a expressive, lyrical style. Evora's music conveys the struggles of her people and melancholy of their history. In this work Evora is interviewed in her home town and discusses her upbringing, early musical experiences, being a single mother, unexpected fame and remarkable life. Features interviews with family and friends and performances by Evora and other local musicians and singers in various cafes and bars. Internationally, Evora is known as the 'barefoot diva' for her propensity to appear on stage in bare feet. This DVD also includes a live concert of Evora's from 1995."
