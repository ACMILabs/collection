        "Wartime inflation and the role of price control are the subjects of this publicity trailer which employs single-frame animation of direct pen-drawing on 35mm film stock. McLaren featured an animated dancing dollar sign to encourage buying bonds, promote savings and warn of the dangers of inflation. The sound-track consists of spoken rhymed verses accompanied by an orchestra. Music Louis Applebaum."
