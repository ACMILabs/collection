        "Classic adaptation of C.J. Dennis' verse narrative of life in inner Sydney in the 1910s, rich in incident but centring on the romance and marriage of the Bloke and Doreen. Filmed on location in Sydney's Woolloomooloo and the Hornsby Valley (the orchard scene), it was ahead of its time in the naturalness of the performances from a carefully chosen cast. Starring Arthur Tauchert, Lottie Lyell and Gilbert Emery."
