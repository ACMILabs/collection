        "A probing and well-conceived documentary about the values, style and goals of a new, radical right-wing movement in the United States known as the 'New Right'. Demonstrates the power and the persuasiveness of the 'New Right' from a critical and a logical perspective. Key figures in this group express their distaste for homosexuality, abortion, blacks, arms control or any kind of agreement with the Soviets. Leaders of the 'New Right' such as President Reagan are shown."
