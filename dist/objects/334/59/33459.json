        "An experimental film based on \"The Mid-Atlantic man\" by Tom Wolfe. It compares the class structure of the Western world to an experiment carried out on rats by an American ethnologist in the 1950s. Of a group only a minority live comfortably and happily, the majority are not so fortunate."
