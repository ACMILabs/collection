        "This film looks at the aftermaths of the wars in Vietnam and Laos in terms of their effects on the ordinary peasant people who now face the enormous task of rebuilding their lives with primitive and limited resources. Shows how the dropping of daisy bombs from B-52s, and the spraying chemical herbicides caused massive destruction to the rural environment. Photographed and narrated by Dr E.W. Pfeiffer. Audio reports from the war zone recorded by Dr Pfeiffer and Dr A.H. Westing. B-52 scenes from \"Year of the Tiger\" written by Dr Pfeiffer with the help of Dr Westing."
