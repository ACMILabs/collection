        "Episode of Series \"60 Minutes\". To some perfectly rational people afflicted with pain and incurable disease, rational suicide has become a real and plausible option. Others believe that you don't have to kill the patient to kill the pain. The film examines both sides of the argument, including an interview with a man who assisted his terminally ill wife in taking her own life."
