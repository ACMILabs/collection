        "In September 1980, eight Catholic pacifists known as the Plowshare 8 entered the G. E. plant known as 'King of Prussia'. They damaged two nuclear missile nose-cones and poured blood on weapon parts. By condensing 1300 pages of trial transcripts into a 70-page film script a courtroom drama has been staged. The defendants play themselves. Cast: The Plowshares 8, Martin Sheen, Jackson Browne."
