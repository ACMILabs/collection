        "A day off allows us from routine existence, but it also prepares us for re-entering the workday world. In this animated film people relaxing on a beach are constantly being reminded of tragic events happening elsewhere. By the end of the day they are able to return to the real world and continue to 'function'. (Awards: Melbourne)"
