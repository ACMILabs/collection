        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Real thing\". Shot in the style of a 1940's film, James Burke employs a detective to illustrate how the senses pick up clues from the outside world, how the brain solves the mystery and decides what is out there. Illustrates how easy it is to fool the best detective, and asks \"what is reality\"? Part one of a series of six programs written and presented by James Burke. Suitable for upper secondary level."
