        "Based on a short story by Jesse Stuart about the son of a poor uneducated farming couple who must stay after school to work off a debt incurred by breaking a cherry tree during a biology excursion. This angers and humiliates his father, who sets off for school to teach \"that modern professor\" a lesson. Instead it is he who learns a lesson: education is important, and his son deserves a chance for a better life. Cast includes Colleen Dewhurst and Will Newman."
