        "The story of Zane, a twelve-year-old boy who samples life under the big top when he travels with the family circus in New Zealand during his school holidays. Shows Zane performing tasks in the daily circus routine as well as training and playing with the lion that he has brought up from a cub. The roles played by other members of the circus team are also noted, and a final sequence depicts a circus performance, including Zane's first time in the ring with Nero, his lion. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
