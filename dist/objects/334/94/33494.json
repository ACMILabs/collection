        "Charming promotional film extolling the virtues of gas cooking through a series of simple animations. Gender stereotypes are anachronistic, but innocent rather than patronising - intended audience was contemperaneous \"housewives\". McLaren's animations employ an economical graphic style strongly influenced by the art deco and industrial aesthetics of the day - as always, stiking and appealing. The last film Norman McLaren made in the United Kingdom."
