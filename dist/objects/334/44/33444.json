        "Episode number 6 of Series \"The Real thing\". Part 6 of a series examining the latest research into the workings of the human brain. This film considers language and human use of it, noting how the meaning of a word can be changed by altering the pitch of the spoken word; how incorrect sentences can be corrected by the listener or the receiver of the information; how the use of grammar can change the information; how the use of grammar can change the meaning of words; and how many different concepts and associations can surround the use of one word, eg cat or girl. Suitable for upper secondary and tertiary levels."
