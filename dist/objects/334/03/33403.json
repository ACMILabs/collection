        "Using traditional cell animation, the timeless story of the person who sells his soul to the devil in return for present success is told. Jan and Dan are a not-too-successful folk singing duo, when Jan signs a contract with the devil to become a famous rock singer. When the devil comes to collect Jan, Dan demands a trial. Photographed by Lenora Hume; script by Ken Sobol; edited by Bob Ablack; music by John Sebastian."
