        "Episode of Series \"World in action\". In 1964 a number of seven year olds expressed their views on life, leisure, love, marriage, colour prejudice, education and money (SEVEN UP). At fourteen years of age they commented on their changing views (7 PLUS SEVEN). Now at twenty-one, using clips from these films, the program compares the responses of this group of individuals as they grow to adulthood. This film is recommended for Years 11-12 and Tertiary level education."
