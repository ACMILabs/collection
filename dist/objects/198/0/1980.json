        "'George Rolfe's 'Aquatica' conveys the epic grandeur that the 3D medium is capable of. His vision of vast futuristic cities is simply not possible in film ' it can only be done in 3D animation. George's piece has no narrative, but is connected by the theme of water ' life above it, and life below it. He has an amazing eye for cinematography, and with relatively simple models has effectively conveyed the scope of massive landscapes and titanic struggles. Key to the piece are the camera movements, and the star of the show is the water, which is exceptional ' sparkling, reflective, and in constant motion. It's a work of sophistication and maturity.Judges comment diegesis 2002"
