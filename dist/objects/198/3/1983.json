        "The film begins with a woman scrubbing a wall. Very soon, as burly men put on their white aprons, we realise that we are inside the world of the abattoir. Wordlessly the men begin to sharpen their knifes and their hatchets. The soundtrack is the music of the abattoir floor. We see none of the slaughter but we see the after-effects of the butchery and we hear the sounds of death. Finally, we see the blood and waste seep into the earth and we are left to contemplate the brutality of something called civilisation."
