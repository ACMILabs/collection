        "Episode of Series \"Full of Life\". This program aims to teach young people the mechanisms for coping. Through this program we learn that fun for fun's sake is an important part of life, that it is important to establish a list of priorities and accept that some things cannot be done, and that it often helps to talk about our problems with someone.
