        "The Priory is a public extended care hospital in Victoria, B.C. for people suffering from chronic geriatric illnesses. Treatment is innovative. It is based on the theory that even the ordinary activities of a patient's life contain elements of therapy. The film shows us how patients are encouraged to do as much as they can for themselves despite their confinement to wheelchairs. The hospital at the time of the film's release, was considered to be a leader in the field of extended care. The film won awards in Toronto and New York."
