        "Examines the suitability of a democratic form of government for three Latin American countries - Bolivia, Brazil, Chile. It cannot be assumed that their political and economic problems can be solved by Western European methods. Bolivia cannot readily revive its economy based on a barren plateau of worked out mines. Brazil, with greater potential consists of ultra modern, prosperous cities and poverty stricken desert and jungle - should the government develop the profitable sections or tackle the desperate poverty? Chile with similar extremes of wealth, is experimenting with democracy. Written and narrated by James Cameron. Guitarist: John Williams. Intertel is a joint venture of Rediffusion London, Australian Broadcasting Commission, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, National Education T/V and Westinghouse Broadcasting Company of the United States."
