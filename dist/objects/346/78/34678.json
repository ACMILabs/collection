        "Episode of Series \"Teaching Adults\" This program looks briefly at the \"consumers\" of voluntary adult education. It stresses the variety of courses they pursue and especially their own diversity. An adult class is not homogeneous, there are varieties in age, educational background, experience and social class. In many situations (notably craft classes) this tends to lead to individual teaching (which can be uneconomical in terms of the use of a teacher's time)."
