        "An experimental documentary which looks at the history of women and their education through a series of film clips, old footage, animation and interviews. Sophia Whist is a character on a journey of enquiry. She discovers an old book in the public library which comes alive. In its pages she meets ten women between the ages of 16 and 94, who talk about their education. Their stories are about wanting an education, wanting more from their education, fighting to extend their options, and demanding to be taught material that incorporates the experience of women. They reveal how women's achievements in one generation are often hidden in the next making it difficult for women to draw on the wealth of knowledge and experience of their predecessors. Cast: Robin Laurie."
