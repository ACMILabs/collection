        "In 1956 the Ministry for Housing implemented the \"Elderly Persons Housing Project\" in an attempt to meet the growing demands for public housing by senior citizens. Over the years building costs have increased rapidly and the Ministry feels that if the Community were to donate land for the project this will enable them to continue building suitable accommodation at affordable prices."
