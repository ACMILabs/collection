        "This is a film about art and artists, culture and politics. Through the story of Yosl Bergner, the film reveals a community of Australian painters who sought to create an art that would reflect the great social upheavals of the 1930s and the 1940s. Yosl Bergner, Ruth Bergner, Jim Wigley and Albert Tucker discuss this period. Rated: G"
