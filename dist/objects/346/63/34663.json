        "Explains the grassed chute as a devise for preventing erosion: an eroding vertical gully head can be converted into a gently sloping and well-grassed surface over which water can flow without damage to the soil. Shows types of gullies where the grassed chute control could not be used. Describes with simple animated diagrams all stages of planning and construction of the chutes."
