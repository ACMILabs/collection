        "Poses the problem of a girl who, through psychological inhibition, feels cut off from normal, friendly social relations with her school-fellows. Briefly shows how she tends to behave as an isolated individual; how other children distrust and resent her. Another girl tries to understand her difficulties, gives her the opportunity of mixing with the group. The film is stated in simple terms, addressed to secondary school level."
