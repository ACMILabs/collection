        "It was the biggest, bloodiest, bitterest battle ever fought. It cost the lives of at least 20 million people and ended Europe's dominance in world affairs. It was the head-on clash of the two mightiest armies Man has ever known - and in sheer numbers, miles of front, and quantity of guns and shells and tanks, no other battle in history can compare with it. Unique archival material is combined with notable contributions from some of the participants, such as Albert Speer to document Hitler's doomed attempt to subdue Russia."
