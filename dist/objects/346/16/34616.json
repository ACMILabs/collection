        "The people of Irian Jaya are fighting a little known but bloody war of survival against the government of Indonesia. This program explores what is at stake in this war - a people and their country. The West Papuan people, as they prefer to call themselves, speak from guerilla hideouts in the jungle and from crowded refugee camps in Papua New Guinea."
