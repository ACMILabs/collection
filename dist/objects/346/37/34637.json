        "These programs present Paul Bocuse's favourite recipes for real food cooked at home in the simplest ways. From the first menu to the last, the six menus are all perfectly balanced; some simple and homely cuisine, others more elegant and elaborate. All the recipes are easy, with short, clear instructions that anyone can follow. Once you know how to prepare these meals you will be ready every occasion, especially as the recipes are accompanied by Paul Bocuse's advice on how to vary the ingredients depending on the season, sensible shopping, etc. In this video he includes easy instructions, and printed guidelines for buying the necessary ingredients for both Veal Kidney Roast and Chocalte Mousse."
