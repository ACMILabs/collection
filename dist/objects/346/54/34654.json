        "A dramatisation of the extraordinary life of the revolutionary educator, Sylvia Ashton-Warner and her work with Maori children in the late 1940's in a remote part of New Zealand. She achieves wondrous results but is more than just a teacher. In a sensitive portrayal, Eleanor David depicts her artistry, nervousness, gift for friendship, cultural isolation and her courage in fighting a boorish collection of educational inspectors. Also starring Nigel Terry, Tom Wilkinson, Mary Regan. Co-starring Martyn Sanderson, Terence Cooper, David Letch and Sarah Pierce. Based on \"Teacher\" and \"I passed this way\" by Sylvia Ashton-Warner."
