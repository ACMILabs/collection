        "A wonderful story that looks at the way one young Australian boy, Eamen Burke, pushes his capacity to speak up for himself in a world careering towards destruction. Eamen's message is simple; \"If people have the capacity to make bombs, then they should have the capacity to take them apart again - there's so much beauty in the world that it would be a shame to spoil it\""
