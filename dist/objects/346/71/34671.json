        "Miss Tai Ai-Lien presents two traditional Chinese folk dances, the Yao ceremonial prelude which is used at marriages and funerals, and a solo dance drama called 'The Mute and the Cripple'. There is no dialogue or commentary, these presentations of little-known Chinese dances are accompanied by authentic folk music played on flute and drums."
