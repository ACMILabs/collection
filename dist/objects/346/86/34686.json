        "Melbourne is the headquarters for many multinational companies, and because of its strategic position has the busiest seaport in Australia. With the Victorian Government offering worthwhile assistance to suitable potential migrants, more and more overseas business people recognising the potential opportunities available, are opting to move to this state. Three such men, Alan Ang (Singapore), Heinz Karona (Germany) and Dr Robert Deutcher (USA) discuss the assistance offered by the Victorian Government, climate, education, quality of life, cost of living, as some of the reasons determining the decision to migrate."
