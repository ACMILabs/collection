        "From British Columbia, a day at a youth festival reminiscent of the folk fairs of medieval times, organised by people who choose to live outside the usual social pattern. The Pleasure Faire offered crowds a wide variety of hand-made objects--jewellery, beadwork, leatherwork, art, pottery. More than that, it provided a day of music, minstrel songs, dancing, and people participating in the spirit of the occasion, free of any commercialism or constraint. A day of joy, relived through the film."
