        "Episode of Series \"Visions of War\". This is the fascinating background story to the making and testing of the first H-Bomb. It contains much fine colour archive film as well as contributions from many of the principal participants in the hydrogen-bomb saga. The story continues on from the first atomic bomb drops on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, through to the bomb test at Bikini Atoll in 1954."
