        "There's only one thing wrong with telephones: people use them. This film sets out to explain the simple rules of telephone etiquette with special effects and fantasy sequences. Max Meldrum plays an angel, who for some reason is in charge of heaven's communications systems! Using a shonky business as an example, he explains the do's and dont's of good communication over the phone. Produced for the Australian Post Office."
