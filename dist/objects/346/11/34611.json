        "A fantastic fairytale, with the ambivalence and logic of a dream. Deals with the difference between the fairy tale stereotype of women as beautiful princesses awaiting their prince charmings and the real world of male and female relationships. \"Damsels Be Damned\" entwines fantasy, fiction and reality. Offbeat and amusing it plunges below the surface of sexual stereotypes to the darkness of sexual assault."
