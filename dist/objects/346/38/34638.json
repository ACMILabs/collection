        "Internationally recognised as one of the greatest living chefs, Paul Bocuse was made a member of the Legion d'Hooneur in recognition of his services as an ambassador of French cuisine. In this video he includes clear, step-by-step instructions for making Coq au Vin and Baked Apples. The ingredients are printed following each recipe. Bocuse's love and joy for cooking and teaching cooking are clearly evident."
