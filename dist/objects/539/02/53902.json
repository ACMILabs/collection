        "As the Victorian population increases, the problem of providing school buildings and accomodation becomes more and more accentuated. The purpose of this film is to show the progress being made in this regard, and the problems associated with the building shortage. It also demonstrates the work being done in the various departments of the school and provides a valuable opportunity of showing to children, teachers, parents and other interested adults just what is being done in Victoria to meet the demands of a growing population for the best and the latest in the educational field. Commentary by Max Meldrum, drawings by Betty Jope."
