        "This film looks at a group of amputee soldiers, shortly after the Second World War. It looks at their rehabilitation, beginning with a visit to the \"Limbless Soldiers Association, N.S.W.Aquatic Club\" where soldiers come together for a water carnival. The film goes on to the Lady Gowrie Hospital and the Rehabilitation Artificial Limb Factory where the workers are amputees. No other credits available."
