        "An instructional film for classroom use. Gives an account of the processing of uranium ore at Rum Jungle, Northern Territory, pointing out the importance of this material in the world today. Describes the development of the mine deposit to the present day. Shots taken at the mine and in the plant show mining of the ore and the processes it passes through until the uranium concentrate is isolated. Nuclear power depends on supplies of uranium and Australia is one of the few producing countries. The peacetime applications of nuclear power are almost unlimited."
