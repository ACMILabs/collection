        "This is story of biscuit manufacture in a modern factory of the 50's. The flour, sugar and milk that forms the basic dough of every biscuit is mixed, kneaded, rolled, stretched and stamped, and ready for final baking in a long oven through which biscuits pass continuously. When cooled they are packed in tins, the only operation carried out by hand. Most of the biscuits are consumed locally, although a percentage are exported to other parts of the world."
