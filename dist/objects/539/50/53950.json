        "This brilliant Australian film depicts Yuletide life in country Australia in the 1940s. A family of children, whose father owns a horse farm, realise the horses have been stolen, so they set out to track the horse thieves in an effort to return the horses to their father as a Christmas present. A storm destroys their tracks and the children become lost, while search parties, and the horse thieves, one of which is played by Chips Rafferty, desperately hunt for them. This is a superb film which won critical acclaim around the world upon its release, and is regarded as an Australian classic. Narrated by John McCallum and filmed on location in the Blue Mountains and Burragorang Valley. Cast includes: John Fernside, Stan Tolhurst, Helen Grieve, Nicky Yardly, Edmund Allison."
