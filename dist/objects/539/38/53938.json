        "Rich river basin areas make good agricultural lands. In these densely populated areas, thousands of families live by intensive subsistence farming. Land is very scarce. Farm families in the Si River Valley do their own work with crude tools with rice being the dominant crop providing more food value per acre than other grain crops grown in the region. Poverty prevails among most of the population. However there still seems to be happiness among the people as they engage in the coninuous routine of tilling the soil and reaping scant harvests on which they manage to exist."
