        "Melbourne's Moomba festival - the city comes alive with processions, regattas, the Herald open air art show, music under the stars at the Myer Music Bowl, and the crowning of the Moomba Queen. The film also shows some of the Melbourne landscape and the background of daily life; Melbourne's economic expansion; the Melbourne Cup, the race for which the nation stands still; Australian Rules Football, drawing crowds of over 50,000; fine golf courses; hunting; night life. It closes with a coverage of the Moomba procession, with all its varied floats, including the Bunyip and the Chinese dragon."
