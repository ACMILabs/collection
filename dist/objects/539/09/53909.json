        "Documentary about logging 250 year-old trees in Sweden and their journey by river and road to the mills. Some are made into planks, other timber is pulped. This pulp is processed into newsprint and paper but some is made into viscose and ends up as manmade silk and rayon. Sweden was a leader in this technique."
