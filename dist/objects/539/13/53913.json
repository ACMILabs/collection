        "Detailed description of what to do with various types of vegetables which you grow in your own home garden and may have too many to use or give away immediately, and want to sort for later use. Onions, which need to be kept dry, can be stored in the attic; when beans have been dried they are stored in glass jars or cans; for storing apples, squash, cabbage, pumpkin and root vegetables, detailed instructions are given and demonstrated in this film."
