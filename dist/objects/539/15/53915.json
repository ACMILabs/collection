        "A survey of the Australian wine industry showing how wine is made, and some of the by-products which are produced in addition to excellent table wines. For wine grapes to grow well, soil and climate must be right; various types of soil are more suitable for some kinds of wine-grapes than others. In Australia, irrigation in the Murray Valley has helped the wine industry, for in many areas where wine is now produced, soil and general climate are suitable, but the rainfall is inadequate. Narrated by John Sherwood."
