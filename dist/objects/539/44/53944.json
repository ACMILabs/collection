        "Classroom film on the Australian rice industry: rice growing in Murrumbidgee irrigation area; preparation of the fields; mechanised sowing in the spring; subsequent flooding of paddy fields until harvesting seven months later; harvesting the crop yielding fifty bags to the acre; complementary crops grown on rice farms during winter; milling processes including sifting, removing full, polishing and bagging at local mills. Half the annual rice crop satisfies the home market; the remainder is exported principally in unpolished form."
