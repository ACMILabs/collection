        "Episode of Series \"Earth and it's peoples\". Shows the life-style and occupations of the Indian people of Guatemala, including the felling of mahogany trees in the forests and farming on the high plateaux. Starting from the east in the Peten lowlands the film proceeds north-westwards across Central America, focusing attention on features which are typical of the geography of the Peten lowlands, the central highlands, and the Pacific coastlands. It exemplifies changes in modes of life with increased altitude within this tropical area, and illustrates some of the influences of the civilization of the Mayas and of Spanish colonial rule."
