        "Episode of Series \"Earth and it's peoples\". Built on a swamp at a high altitude, modern Mexico City was built on the Aztec city of Teotihuacan by the Spanish who invaded the region. This documentary follows a typical Mexican family in an adobe village, weaving serapes, harvesting corn and raising cattles, sheep, horses, goats and donkeys. Discusses their diet, education, work and family life. Also attempts to explain how Aztec Indian culture has 'blended' with Spanish culture."
