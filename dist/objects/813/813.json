        "Yonah, a taxi driver, wishes to bury his son who has committed suicide. But it is the start of the work day and there are not enough people at the funeral to form the requisite circle of mourners. We follow Yonah through the day and through the night, where after a series of encounters with a cross-section of urban Israelis, he returns by night to the grave site of his son. This subtle and exquisite Israeli film is itself a moving requiem for the relationship between a father and a son, and by extension, a lament for the contradictions and costs of the Jewish state."
