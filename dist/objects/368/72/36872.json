        "Yes, it's the distinctive cartoons, drawings and humour of the unstoppable Rolf Harris and it's Rolf Harris in person taking you through your very own \"learn to draw\" lesson. \"You can draw\", says Rolf Harris. \"We all can. It's just a matter of knowing that you can draw your way\". How to draw fun cartoons, will give you as much pleasure watching as it will when you try out Rolf's methods for yourself. Don't say \"I can't draw\" anymore, let Rolf Harris show you how."
