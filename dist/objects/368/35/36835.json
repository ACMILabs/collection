        "The story is the tragedy of a young police constable, new to the force and tongue-tied with inhibitions. Circumstances move him to murder, not only of a man, but also of his own morality. The dialogue - screenplay by David Williamson - is a unique combination of irony, cynicism, naivety and vulgar vitality, and the film explores subtle relationships. Based on the play by David Williamson. Stars John Hargreaves, Peter Cummins, Kate Fitzpatrick, Jacki Weaver and Chris Haywood."
