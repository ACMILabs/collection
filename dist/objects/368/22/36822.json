        "Based on the play by Henrik Ibsen about the fortunes of a loving family - the ineffectual loving father whose pride and dreams conceal a life of poverty and failure, his practical wife and their beautiful and faithful young daughter. The family is broken apart when deceived by the misplaced idealism of another person. Stars Liv Ullman and Jeremy Irons."
