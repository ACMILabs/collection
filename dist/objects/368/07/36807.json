        "Wendy Hughes plays an art teacher employed at a Catholic girls' convent school from Monday to Friday. At weekends she rides the overnight express train between Sydney and Melbourne as a prostitute in order to keep her addict brother supplied with morphine. Every week she changes her appearance, mannerisms, and personality, luring male clients who always pay and leave by 3 a.m. However, an intelligence agent (Colin Friels) becomes her lover and they team up to murder a politician on the train. Wendy Hughes exudes sensuality, power and passion in the lead role."
