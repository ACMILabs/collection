        "In smouldering post-nuclear devastation, a periscope protruding from the rubble leads to an underground fall-out shelter where a party is raging in celebration of the big meltdown and will continue until the end of the world as we know it. Irreverent, bizarre comedy, starring Nique Needles and Rob Howard."
