        "Artist Giuseppe Mercuri dreamed of emigrating to Australia with his family in the 1950's but was refused entry on account of his Communist Party membership and only now has he been allowed entry to visit the country of his dreams. His work captures the reflective nature of the people and lifestyle of Calabria, the area in which he was born. In this film his nephew, Franco di Chiera has documented faithfully Mercuri's life from the hardships of his youth through the years of creative achievement and finally to his long awaited trip to Australia which meant the fulfilment of a lifetime dream."
