This video is aimed at both volunteers and professionals such as social and health workers, volunteer support groups, counsellors, nurses, doctors and prison officers who offer help and support. The program is in four sections: The needs of the person with AIDS; self preparation of the carer/ counsellor; counselling skills; support for the carer/counsellor."
