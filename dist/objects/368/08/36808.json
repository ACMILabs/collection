        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Jamaica, Barbados, Martinique and more. Home to some of the most beautiful blue waters in the world, the Caribbean Islands offer everything. Deserted beaches to rainforests, deserts to mountains, here lies a diversity of terrains matched only by the pleasures found therein. Take an adventurous scuba dive off the Cayman Islands and sail in the tradewinds that blow like no other. Shop in duty free St. Thomas and in the evening it's off to the Bahamas for a little gambling."
