        "Based on the novel of the same name by Paul Theroux and adapted for the screen by Paul Schrader, the film tells the story of an eccentric inventor who, sick of seeing the world deteriorate around him, takes his family from their Massachusetts farm to the dark jungles of Honduras to start a fresh new life. However all does not run smoothly in their new jungle paradise and it is not the utopia of his dreams. Stars Harrison Ford, River Phoenix, Helen Mirren and Martha Plimpton."
