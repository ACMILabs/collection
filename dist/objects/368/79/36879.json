        "Dancers of the Royal Ballet perform classic stories from the tales of Beatrix Potter bringing to life many of her best-loved characters - Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, Pigling Bland, Squirrel Nutkin and many more. They were the tales we loved as children and still hold with great affection as adults. Brilliantly designed by Christine Edzard, and beautifully danced by some of the great names of the Royal Ballet. This is one of the most charming and ingenious ballet films of recent years."
