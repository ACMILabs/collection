        "After responding to a New South Wales government advertisement designed to attract teachers from Britain, a shy teacher from Wales is assigned to a one-teacher school in the isolated bush town of Kookaburra Springs. Initially he has problems adjusting to his new life as he struggles to gain respect from his students. Despite resistance he forms a school choir, which travels Sydney to participate in a singing competition. The trip is a success and on their return to Kookaburra Springs he decides to stay on in the town and marry. Primarily a vehicle for British singer and comedian Harry Secombe, the film was shot on location near the New South Wales town of Parkes with a budget of under $400,000. Cast also includes Maggie Fitzgibbon, John Meillon, Peter Whittle, Dawn Lake, Bobby Limb."
