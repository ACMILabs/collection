        "Jamie's life is touched by all the experiences around him; he sees how a seemingly hopeless drunk can be a man of wisdom and an unforgettable friend; how a sadistic teacher can vent all his pent-up hatred on one unfortunate boy; how a \"man of God\", trapped by his own sense of righteousness can turn brutally and commit murder; how people can join forces in times of utmost need, or turn against that which they don't know or understand. Based on the novel by Ronald McKie. Stars Christopher Pate, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Robert Helpmann and Gerard Kennedy."
