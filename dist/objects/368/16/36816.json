        "During the 24th Century a new city is launched into time to escape a polluted and dying earth. It must keep travelling to avoid the Jen-Diki, mutated descendants of the people they once were and the city's natural enemy. After yet another attack, the city is forced to repair and recharge in a safe year and comes to rest in the 20th Century. Stars Tom Burlinson, Carrie Fisher, Dean Stockwell and Nikki Coghill."
