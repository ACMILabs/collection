        "A comical study in urban alienation and taxi etiquette. Wallace is a taxi driver who lives in a St. Kilda flat with a cast of walking wounded neighbours, all of whom are chronically disconnected like him. He drives the cab at night and spends his days making cider and listening to tapes of the conversations he records secretly in the cab. Those tapes are his only real contact with the world and they allow Wallace to connect with other people's misery. Cast includes Kim Gyngell, Sally McKenzie, Paul Chubb, Barry Dickens and Daniel Scharf"
