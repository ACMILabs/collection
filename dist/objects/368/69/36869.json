        "Two friends in North Queensland leave their jobs with a boxing troupe and a shooting gallery and turn to crime. A 'road movie' with a soundtrack by the pop group, Sherbet, \"High Rolling\" set itself firmly in the sunshine and sleaziness of the Queensland coast. Produced on a small budget with an imported American star (Joseph Bottoms), it was the first feature by Melbourne television director, Igor Auzins. Cast also includes Grigor Taylor, Judy Davis and Wendy Hughes."
