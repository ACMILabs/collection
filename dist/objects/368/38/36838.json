        "Comic recreation of explorers Burke & Wills and their ill-fated expedition to cross Australia in 1860. Setting out with 28 camels and 4 camel drivers, they were two-thirds through the journey when the expedition was completely without food and almost out of tea. Public enthusiasm remained high for Burke & Wills and the expedition from which they did not return. Starring Gary McDonald and Kim Gyngell."
