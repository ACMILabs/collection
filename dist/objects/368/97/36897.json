        "As the story begins it is 1879, and talk in the opulent drawing rooms of London's upper-middle class society revolves around the Forsytes. Winifred's marriage to the roguish Monty Dartie has the Forsyte aunts cooing, as do Jo's extra-marital exploits with his daughter's Austrian governess. Jo's cousin, the coldly calculating Soames Forsyte, has meanwhile met Irene Heron, and the scene is set for a tempestuous future, where beauty clashes with possessiveness, and the results smoulder dangerously beneath the tinderbox of high Victorian morality and repressed passion."
