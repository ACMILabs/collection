        "A comedy based on the premise that Albert Einstein not only developed the theory of relativity but also invented rock `n' roll. Albert Einstein sails the world, falls in love with the world's most intelligent and beautiful girl, Marie Curie, creates the first surfboard, invents the electric guitar and uses rock'n'roll to save the planet from atomic destruction. Virtually a one-man tour de force by Yahoo Serious and co-starring Odile le Clezio, John Howard, Peewee Wilson, Su Cruickshank."
