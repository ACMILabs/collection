        "Episode of Series \"Video visits\". Ireland, the Emerald Isle, land of stone castles and white sheep opens its heart to you. Walk along the wide boulevards of Dublin. Enter the library of Trinity College to view the Book of Kells; go inside a typical pub for Guinness and Irish folk music; watch crystal being shaped at Waterford factory. Travel to County Wicklow and stroll through the gardens of Powerscourt. Continue on to County Kildare, medieval Kilkenny Castle, and visit the friendly people of Cork and be sure to kiss the Blarney Stone."
