        "Based on the play of the same name by David Hare. A young Englishwoman returns from fighting with the resistance in World War 2 and finds the apathy of post-war England difficult to tolerate. As her idealistic dreams give way to the realities of experience so her sanity gives way to madness. Stars Meryl Streep, Charles Dance, Tracey Ullman, John Gielgud, Sting and Sam Neill."
