        "A windsurfer becomes obsessed with a woman who has been watching him surf. He undertakes a comical and unrelenting search for her which eventually wears down his resistance. Underlying his passion for her is the windsurfers' determination to win the World Classic Windsurfing Championships for which he is preparing an unbeatable windsurfing rig. Stars Tom Burlinson and Nicole Kidman with Jill Perryman and Charles Tingwell."
