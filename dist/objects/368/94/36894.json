        "Based on the story by Kurt Vonnegut Jnr, author of Breakfast of Champions and Slaughterhouse Five. It's the aftermath of the world's greatest war. Allied occupied Germany, ravaged and shamed in defeat, must now pick up the pieces. One of those pieces is a small black orphan boy named Tobias. Abandoned at a cold and dismal orphanage, he dreams - despite jeers from the other embittered children - of his courageous father's return from war to claim him. When Tobias meets his first black man, he's convinced the G.I. sergeant is the father of his dreams."
