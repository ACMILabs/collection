        "Libido is a motivating force that guides, directs and even shares a personality. The film's scope encompasses four people of distinctly different backgrounds - a husband, a child, a family man and a priest. Each is dealt within a separate piece directed by four different filmmakers. Scriptwriters include Hal Porter, Thomas Kenneally and David Williamson. Cast: (The Husband) Elke Neidhardt, Bryon Williams ; (The Child) John Williams, Jill Forster ; (The Priest) Robyn Nevin, Arthur Dignam ; (The Family Man) Jack Thompson, Max Gillies."
