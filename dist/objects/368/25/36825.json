        "Several members of a bikie gang are mysteriously murdered. An undercover cop becomes the man in the middle trying to both protect the bikies and prevent them from taking venegeance. The film is perhaps more convincing as an exploration of a lifestyle than as a thriller with a series of conventionally conceived and effectively staged stunts and chases backed by a heavy rock score. With a box-office return of around ten times the $195,000 budget, 'Stone' ranks with films like 'Alvin Purple' as the most successful pre-Croc Australian feature. Cast includes Ken Shorter, Sandy Harbutt, Helen Morse, Vincent Gil, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rebecca Gilling, Roger Ward, Bill Hunter and Gary McDonald."
