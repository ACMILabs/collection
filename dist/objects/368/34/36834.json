        "Based on a novel by Sumner Locke Elliott, this is the story of Angus Weekes and the unusual family of Eve St. James. Taken in by Eve after the death of his guardian, Angus cannot resist becoming involved in the ultimately tragic patterns of their lives. This is 'art-television' in the BBC tradition of literary adaptation. Like the novel it is structured in three parts. 'Angus' (episode I) is the most Gothic and melodramatic in structure and tone; 'Bea' (episode II) is the most naturalistic and 'Eve' (episode III) is the most concentrated and formally rigorous. Cast includes Julia Blake, Arthur Dignam, Linda Cropper, Victoria Longley and Bruce Hughes."
