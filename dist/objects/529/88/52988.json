    "description": [
        "This seven part television series is about seven wonders of civil engineering in the industrial age and 'modern' world. Man-made and magnificent, the series covers the creation of the biggest steam ship ever built, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Bell Rock Lighthouse, London's sewerage system, the Panama Canal, the trans-American Railway and the Hoover Dam. Using actors in period costume and settings, and aided by computer animation techniques, this docu-drama style telling re-enacts the language and manners of the day to impart information in a really appealing way. The trials and controversies that occur when such huge constructions are undertaken - including the loss of life - are also covered. Narrated by Robert Lindsay."
