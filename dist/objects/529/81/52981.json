        "Travel with Michael Palin as he stars, writes and narrates this fascinating travel adventure across the Khyber Pass, through the Himalya finishing at the Bay of Bengal - a journey over 2000 miles. Documenting some quite spectacular scenery, Palin meets many hospitable and intriguing people from diverse cultural backgrounds - he is even granted an interview with the Dalai Lama. We learn in a pre-trip interview that at sixty years of age Palin is somewhat nervous at the prospect of this adventure but still excited by the idea of discovering new places, none of which he has been to before - quite a feat as this is his sixth televised international journey. A six part television series complete on three DVDs, the set contains over 90 minutes of extra footage."
