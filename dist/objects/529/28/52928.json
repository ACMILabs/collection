        "A secretarial role at a law firm is a first job for a young girl with expert typing skills and having just left a hostel for people with mental illness, the girl also has a troubled home life and a history of self-mutilation. A look at contemporary sexual politics where 'coming out' has new meaning. The secretary, Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal), reveals to her family and friends the need for her masochistic relationship with her boss E. Edward Grey (James Spader) and their special kind of love. The kind of office politics this film contains would horrify any Human Resources department! Based on the story \"Secretary\" by Mary Gaitskill. Cast includes Jeremy Davies. Contains Sex Scenes."
