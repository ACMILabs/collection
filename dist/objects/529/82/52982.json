    "description": [
        "Two fascinating documentary television series about the most influential artists of the Italian Renaissance. The first disc contains three parts to the television series about Leonard da Vinci and his work/creations. Written and presented by Alan Yentob. Presented as docu-drama with actors playing the roles of Leonardo and his contemporaries in a costume-drama style setting, with mock interviews and commentaries to make what would otherwise be straightforward information be imparted in a most enlightening and educative/entertaining way. The second disc contains two parts to the television series about Michelangelo. Narrated by Susannah York. \"Program One\" is about his triumph of the statue of David and \"Program Two\" is about the painting of the Sistine Chapel and his architectural designs."
