    "description": [
        "From the same team that produced \"The Human Body\" comes another fascinating and well-made documentary series presented by Robert Winston. In a four part series all on the same DVD, the history of human evolution from ancient apes to the present modern man is traversed in chronological order. Starting with 'The First Ancestors' the first ape from Africa to stand on two legs is discovered. Using the latest 'animatic' technology the viewer is privy to the ancient world and these creatures using a mixture of computer generated images and actors in monkey suits - done in a style that makes for compelling viewing. Not only physical traits but also the lifestyle of Neanderthal man is shown. The series climaxes with the discovery of one key element that makes modern man different - the gift of imagination."
