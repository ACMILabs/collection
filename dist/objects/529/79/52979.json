        "Narrated by Leo McKern, this documentary, produced by the award-winning ABC TV Natural History Unit, explores the land and life of the spectacular Kimberley region of North West Australia. Aboriginal people believe that the Wandjina, the rain spirits, created the landscape. From the vast coastal mudflats to the tidal rivers and inland waterways, this beautifully photographed film explores in detail one of the least known regions of Australia."
