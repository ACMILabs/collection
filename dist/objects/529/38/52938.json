        "Pyschologist Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) has been assigned to investigate the mysterious events occurring aboard a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. He discovers that the two surviving members on the station are struggling with their sanity and that the planet itself is a living organism with the power of entering human consciousness and recreating lost loves. Chris Kelvin is haunted by the visitation of his dead wife Khari (Natascha McElhone). This film is a remake of the more philosophical version by Andrei Tarkovsky released in 1972, and is more a personal investigation into the themes of memory and regret rather than spirituality and science. Beautiful production design lends itself to the dreamy and sensual pace. Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, this version is written and directed by Steven Soderbergh. Cast includes Jeremy Davies, Viola Davis and Ulrich Tukur."
