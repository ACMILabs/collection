        "A feast for the eyes and ears - \"Powaqqatsi: life in transformation\" is a spellbinding look at life on our planet from the depths of an iron ore mine in Brazil, to the commotion of city life in the concrete jungle of Hong Kong. Featuring hypnotic music by renowned composer Philip Glass, this is a truly amazing and totally original experience in modern cinema."
