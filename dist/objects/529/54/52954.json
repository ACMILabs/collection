        "Suitably scary J-horror that draws appealingly on the tropes of the genre with disgruntled spirits rising to haunt the terrified living. When a young social worker helps out an elderly woman, she finds a young boy residing in a spooky house. Each investigating person becomes troubled by menacing spirits, until a detective attempts to destroy the house. Aping the very successful style of \"The Ring\" (Hideo Nakata, 1998), Takashi Shimizu engages in elliptical narrative threads, whilst providing requisite scares and thrills. This film is a big-screen re-working of \"Ju-on\" and \"Ju-on 2\" two low budget Shimizu films. Cast includes: Megumi Okina, Misaki Ito, Kanji Tsuda, Shuri Matsuda, and Misa Uehara."
