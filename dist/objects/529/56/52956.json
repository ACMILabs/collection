        "With art direction by John Eng and Steve Meyers this 'around the world in 80 days adventure' is the animated tale of three highly intelligent animals created in a laboratory. The lab is going to be closed and a hunter will be rounding up the animals. The ape, Eddie, leopard, Sacia (Chaka Khan) and parrot, Trevor (voice imitation expert), escape to be tracked down by The Hunter (voice by Willem Dafoe) the world over for the next 80 days. An adventurous film with a few musical numbers thrown in but its 'look' could be interpreted as somewhat hard-edged. The three friends use their intelligence (including street-smart dialogue) and bond of friendship to get themselves out of some tricky situations. Originally made for television but released on DVD."
