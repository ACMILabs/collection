        "Interweaving his personal history, growing up in Italian-American culture of New York in the 1940s, Martin Scorsese presents his fascinating perspective on the cinema of Italian Neo-Realism. As a young boy, Scorsese watched innumerable of these iconic works on his parents tiny TV set, subtly influencing what would become his cinematic style. Using extensive clips from such works as \"Rome, Open city\", \"La Dolce vita\", \"L'Aventura\" and \"8 and 1/2\" Scorsese discusses his love and enduring admiration of these works whilst analysing the mise en scene and meanings behind the motifs. As well as being a fascinating insight into Scorseses influences, \"My Voyage to Italy\" inspires the viewer to re-visit the work of the Italian Neo-Realists. Directors featured include Antonioni, Di Sica, Fellini, Renoir, Rossellini, Visconti, and Blaseti."
