        "Episode of Series \"Australian story (Television program)\". From the ABC television series \"Australian Story\" comes this compilation of five moving portraits of five very different Australians. Common to all five though is that they are battlers in their own way, overcoming adversity and hardship to live life as best they can. \"The Big 'A'\" is about former Prime Minister's wife Hazel Hawke speaking about her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. \"A Man for all seasons\" is the story of revered rugby coach Wayne Bennett. \"Boots and all\" is about the discovery of a wonderful opera singer in a local shoe-repair shop - Peter Brocklehurst. \"About a boy\" is the story of young cricket enthusiast Dan Halloran, who grew up with his mother having a mental illness. \"On the mountain top\" is about Victoria Friend and her survival of a plane crash in remote country Australia."
