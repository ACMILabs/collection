        "This is not a typical Adam Sandler comedy. Barry Egan (Sandler) is a novelty business owner who has seven sisters and is looking for love, (even trying phone sex once) but love finds him, sending his very ordered life upside down. Watching \"Punch-drunk love\" you find a mix of dark humour and seedy characters, coupled with violent behaviour and social dysfunction - but it's also a romance with colour, mood and music that carries you along and makes you hope for a happy ending. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, winner of Best Director 2002 Cannes Film Festival for this disquieting film. Cast includes Emily Watson, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman."
