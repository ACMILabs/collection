        "Two kindred spirits, both hitched but essentially partnerless, seek solace and distraction in this updated take on \"Brief encounter\". Bill Murray simply excels as Bob - a jaded film star whose career and marriage are sagging whilst he vaguely goes through the motions, resigned to the humiliations and compromises of middle age. Charlotte by contrast, still struggles with disappointment, set in early, of her marriage and the irony of her loneliness. The visual overload of a vibrant, tasteless, seedy, bustling, 24/7 Tokyo provides the backdrop to the pair's melancholia and united quietude. Sophia Coppola was nominated for Best director, winning an Academy Award for her wonderfully droll and witty screenplay. Also stars Giovanni Ribisi. Also available on DVD [318975]."
