        "A visually stunning television series that shows the formation of Australia as an Island Continent and the evolution of our exotic flora and fauna. \"A Separate Creation\" looks at the development of Australian marsupials, in particular kangaroos. \"Seas Under Capricorn\" shows the extremes of marine environments that surround Australia - from the warmth of the Barrier Reef to the cold of the Antarctic. \"The Making of the Bush\" shows the development of forest and the wildlife it sustains. \"The Sunburnt Country\" deals with the large interior of Australia that is predominately desert. \"Land of Flood and Fire\" shows the extremes in weather the continent is subjected to and how fire forms a part of managing the land. All five programs that make up the series run for approximately 50 minutes each. Written by John Vandenbeld and Narrated by Robyn Williams."
