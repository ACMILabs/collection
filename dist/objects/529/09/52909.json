        "Volume two of The Bride's (Uma Thurman) quest to exact revenge on those who prevented her from leaving the violent world of the hired killer. In \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" The Bride is pregnant attending her wedding, when all are massacred and she is shot in the head leaving her in coma for four years. After recovering and killing the main perpetrators, she heads out in \"Vol. 2\" to find her mentor/ex-lover Bill (David Carradine) to kill him for ordering her assassination (and shooting her!). Fending off a few of his accomplices along the way, she battles these intense foes with the sword and anything else to hand. The Bride's exceptional level of skill is not just hate-driven but substantiated in the teachings of a great master, Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). An homage to martial arts films from the East and West but still infused with the wit and humour of a Quentin Tarantino picture, \"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" is a classic revenge story with all of the requisite action sequences and fine storytelling. Cast includes Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Michael Parks and Lucy Liu. WARNING: SOME SCENES MAY DISTURB."
