        "Spanning a career of more that three decades, legendary performer Neil Young and his band Crazy Horse 'crank it up' in rockin' live concert documentary footage of an extensive tour in 1996. Watch interviews with the band: guitarist Frank \"Poncho\" Sampedro, bassist Billy Talbot, drummer Ralph Molina and singer/guitarist Neil Young. Mixed with intimate back-stage and 'on-the-road' moments from the 1970s through to the 1990s, director Jim Jarmusch takes the viewer on a musical pilgrimage discovering the intensity of live performance and staying-power of these classic rock compositions by Young and the Horse. Shot on Super8, 16mm and Hi-8 Video."
