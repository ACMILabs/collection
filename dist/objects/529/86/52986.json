    "description": [
        "Wild weather is proof that the Earth and its weather can be made into an interesting and fun documentary series. The effervescent presenter Donal MacIntyre is an adventurer and extreme sports fan who takes us on a journey around the world to discover how the weather works - from a gentle breeze to an extreme tornado. Admittedly most of the action takes place in the Northern Hemisphere but it is well made television with 3D computer animation aiding the storytelling. \"Wind\" shows the way wind is created around the Earth. \"Wet\" shows how rain is made and can reach the extremes of killer storms. \"Cold\" deals with snow and glaciers and \"Heat\" looks at deserts and lightning."
