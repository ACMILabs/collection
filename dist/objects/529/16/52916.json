        "A beautifully colourful and enchanting computer animated feature about a father clown fish, Marlin, searching the vast ocean near Sydney for his lost son, Nemo. Marlin pairs up with Dory (voice provided by comic Ellen DeGeneres) who suffers short-term memory loss and Nemo finds himself in a fish tank in a dentist's office. The experiences the father and son have provide the viewer with an action-packed, sometimes fearsome and fun-filled adventure. (Please Note: some scenes may frighten young children)"
