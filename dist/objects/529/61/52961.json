        "This is a film record of a surgical operation, performed in a Montreal hospital in December, 1968, to correct a rare congenital anomaly in a sixty-six year old male - a case in which there was a fistula between the normal oesophagus and a bronchial segment. A report of this case was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, May 9, 1970, v. 102."
