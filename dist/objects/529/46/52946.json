        "Made prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States and their western allies, this biographical documentary offers an insight into the life and background of Iraqi ruler, the infamous and brutal Saddam Hussein. Director Joel Soler, on the pretence of filming Iraq's suffering under UN sanctions, managed to produce this somewhat satirical and surrealistic portrayal of a meglomaniac who \"claims he is a direct descendant of Mohammed\", taking us into the sanctity of Saddam's palaces and introducing us to the various members of his family. Discusses Saddam's obsession with architecture and monuments (all dedicated to the man himself), his brutal politics and warmongering and his egocentricities in a rather irreverent manner. Narration written by Scott Thompson, a former member of the comedy troupe \"The Kids in the Hall\" and read by comic actor Wallace Langham. Includes b&w archival footage and stills. Winner of several awards including New Orleans and Northampton Film Festivals. NB: Contains some scenes which may disturb."
