        "Whale Rider: Set in a small village in rural New Zealand, \"Whale Rider\" is the story of a Maori community who are looking for a new male heir as leader. All looks certain until the heir apparent and his mother die at childbirth leaving his twin, Pai, a baby girl. Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes) has to overcome 1000 years of tradition and the fierce determination of her beloved grandfather to assert her rightful place as leader and re-unite her people. Beautiful landscapes, moody music and underwater photography add to the lush look of this film. Internationally acclaimed and multi-award winning feature film. Based on the novel \"The Whale Rider\" by Witi Ihmaera. \"Cracker bag\": Personal childhood memories are evoked when watching this Australian short about a young girl, Eddie, as she saves her money to buy fireworks for Guy Fawkes Night. Set in the 1980s, \"Cracker Bag\" is a tender suburban study that finely depicts a disheartening pivotal moment in the life of a young girl. Photographic-like in its 35mm presentation, \"Cracker bag\" is deservedly Winner of the Palme D'Or (Short Film) Festival De Cannes 2003 and many other accolades. Written and directed by Glendyn Ivin, starring young Edith Cattell as Eddie."
