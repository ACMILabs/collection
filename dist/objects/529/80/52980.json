        "Wildlife cinematographers David Parer and Elizabeth Parer-Cook have created, with the help of research scientists, a rare glimpse into the predominantly underwater and underground world of the strangest of animals - the platypus. Filmed in the wilderness of Tasmania, learn about the habits and habitats of this wonderful creature - with a bill, webbed feet, venomous claw and egg laying ability. Actual footage of infant platypus occupying the nest/burrow and shows the care the mother gives her young. Narrated by Peter Thompson. Special feature also available on this disc is a documentary \"Bobby and the Banded Stilts\" (exec. prod. Dione Gilmour, 28 min, 1997) about birdlife in Western Australia, narrated by Hugo Weaving."
