        "Alain de Botton presents this three-part documentary series which is an exploration of the modern dilemma of how work and objects define a person's status in western society. Are we cash rich but spiritually poor? Does wealth equate to happiness? Why do we worry so much about what people think of us? Alain de Botton has a interesting take on this resulting in thought provoking television through the use of contemporary interviews mixed with some views of ancient philosophers brought into the contemporary context. He also talks to people with an alternative view, such as naturists and bohemians, to find out their understanding of 'status'. Another interesting series by the same presenter is \"Philosophy: a guide to happiness\" [318970]. Written by Alain de Botton."
