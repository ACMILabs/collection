    "description": [
        "The Australian Migration scheme and Film Australia were both set up just after World War II and were under the one minister. Hand in hand they set about promoting and encouraging migration through the film medium. Films where also made to encourage acceptance of migrants for Australians. To this day the Film Australia Collection holds over 100 immigration films. This interesting and informative DVD presents edited versions of eight of the collections most important films. The films cover a period of time from the forties to the nineties with a contemporary short documentary containing interviews with some of the participants and the film makers of each of the eight films. \"Film Australia Immigration\" also presents a series of clips arranged by subjects such as language, food, and identity. An extremely fascinating and authoritative exploration of immigration in Australia."
