        "Outstanding documentary from iconic filmmaker Errol Morris about Robert S. McNamara, Secretary of Defence in the United States government during the Kennedy and early Johnson years, who oversaw US involvement in the Vietnam war. McNamara is a fascinating and worthy subject, not only for his wry and articulate tales but also for his amazing experiences, as a key figure in the US government in the 20th century, and as head of the World Bank for thirteen years. Morris inter-cuts the interviews with stunning archival footage, recorded White House conversations and with poetically rendered images that relay the poignancy, sadness and tragedy of war. Haunting score by Phillip Glass. Academy Award winner, Best Documentary Feautre, 2003."
