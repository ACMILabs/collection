        "A refreshingly tender film about race relations in the United States that manages to be both intelligent and complex. Mina (Roshan Seth) is an Indian woman whose family fled Uganda during the rule of Idi Amin. She falls in love with Demetrius (Denzel Washington), an African-American who is challenged by the traditions of her Indian background. She in turn has to fight against her family's fears and racism. Without histrionics this film paints a picture of small-town Americana that is rich and diverse. A wonderful comic love story with excellent performances."
