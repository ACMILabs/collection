        "When no-one will play with him Tigger sets out on a journey to find his family tree, and other Tiggers. This is harder than he thought and he quickly becomes discouraged. When his friends Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Owl, Kanga and Roo see that their friend is sad, they pretend to be the family he wishes for, by writing him a letter and dressing up as Tiggers. But when Tigger finds out who they really are, he becomes more determined to find his real family, and wanders out into a snowstorm. Roo, upset that he has lost his best friend, convinces the others to follow Tigger and show him that they are his real family. Based on classic characters created by A.A. Milne. This animated feature length film is filled with the songs, colour and movement that young children adore."
