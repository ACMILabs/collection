        "Award winning cinema, this directorial masterpiece by Fernando Meirelles is violent, disturbing and skillful storytelling. The story unfolds in the slums of Rio de Janeiro's \"City of God\", a housing project built in the 1960s that becomes by the '80s a city engulfed by gang warfare. Based on a true story and a novel by Paulo Lins, young Busca-Pe (aka Rocket) grows up amongst this violence and we learn the history of the gangs through a series of stories told in flashback style with him as narrator. Rocket, through all of the horror, decides his own fate by becoming a photographer and his ability is his way out of the 'City'. Gangsters, guns and violence are so accepted that they become the norm to a new and much younger generation happy to perpetuate the lifestyle learned from birth, reinforced by poverty. Nominated for four Academy Awards. In Portuguese with English subtitles. WARNING: SOME SCENES MAY DISTURB."
