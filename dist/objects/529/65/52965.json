        "Four stories featuring Fireman Sam and his friends in the town of Pontypandy narrated by John Alderton. The first story shows what happens when a trick is played on the fireman as a sticky substance is smeared on the fireman pole. There is a cat stuck up a tree in the second episode, a camping trip in the third and a special appearance on television by the Station Officer which excites the locals."
