        "This animated tale feature Blinky Bill and his friends. The episode, titled \"Mayor Blinky Bill\" see Blinky Bill become Mayor. Being popular among the locals Blinky speaks up at a Council meeting where the loss of water from fire trucks is discussed. It seems that bumpy roads are the cause. Blinky takes on the job with enthusiasm until things become a little complicated. Blinky then finds himself facing annoying red tape and bureaucracy in trying to improve things. Blinky rethinks his position and reaches for the faithful fishing rod in exchange for the responsibility of the Mayor handing back the hat and all the difficulty that goes with it."
