        "Follows the fortunes (and misfortunes) of Stevie, a young labourer fresh out of jail. He soon finds work on a building site, converting an old hospital into luxury apartments. Stevie finds support and fellowship from his fellow workers, a melting pot of men from different parts of England. Conditions on the site are lousy, as well as unsafe, and with no help from the developers, Stevie along with his mates take matters into their own hands."
