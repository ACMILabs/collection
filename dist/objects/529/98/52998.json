        "Peer group pressure at High School is on a whole other level when the students go to a fantastical school for those good in martial arts. Students and teachers alike seem to be gifted but there is the usual pecking order of the leaders and the losers. Onto his ninth school, the new boy nicknamed 'transfer' is set upon by the nasty leader of the schoolyard, Ryang, but he is surprised by the new boy's power. Teenagers battle it out in this mythical and fun filled fight film full of whimsy and slapstick."
