        "Adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel \"Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions\" comes Tim Burton's twentieth feature film since his directorial debut in 1971. \"Big Fish\" is a sentimental exploration of the ambiguous line between fact and fiction, as a man (Billy Crudup) makes a final attempt at getting to know his dying father (Albert Finney). Mythical tall tales told to the man repeatedly throughout his life by his father are revealed to the viewer with Ewan McGregor playing the father as a young man. A departure from Burton's traditionally darker oeuvre \"Big Fish\" challenges notions that truth should be pursued before an embellished reality. Cast includes Jessica Lange and Helena Bonham Carter. Nominated for four Golden Globe Awards."
