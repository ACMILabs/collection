        "Upon waking after being in a coma for 28 days, bicycle courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) finds a completely different world. London is empty except for the virally infected zombies that want to murder everyone - and there aren't many people left. Jim is rescued by Selena (Naomie Harris) who proves to be a strong and fearless survivor. The virus is passed on through blood and devastates within seconds, driving the infected into a murderous rage that essentially threatens human existence. But is the virus all that endangers the survivors? End-of-the-world survival tale done in a dark and sombre mood - a science-fiction horror story from the director of \"Trainspotting\" and \"The Beach\", Danny Boyle. Cast includes Christopher Eccleston, Megan Burns and Brendan Gleeson. SOME SCENES MAY DISTURB."
