        "David Attenborough's thrilling series takes a guided tour through the secret world of plants, using exceptional time-lapse photography to reveal hitherto, unseen details. The six episodes are: \"Travelling\" which looks at the various forms of locomotion developed by plants to establish territory. \"Growing\" examines the development of the plant from a seedling to a mature adult, while \"Flowering\" looks at plant reproduction and the cunning ways in which plants ensure successful cross-fertilisation. \"The Social Struggle\" looks at how plants compete in the environment for territory and survival. In particular parasitic and fungal plants are highlighted. \"Living Together\" reveals how plants can co-exist with animals and other plants so that both partners thrive, while \"Surviving\" shows how plants deal with adverse conditions in coping with climate extremes, lack of nutrients and predators. Of particular interest is the focus on carnivorous plants. Also available on VHS [306236], [306237]."
