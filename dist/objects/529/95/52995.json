    "description": [
        "Using rare archival footage, photographs and interviews, we are privy to family life and relationships of seven of Australia's most powerful families. Nineteenth and twentieth century Australian history has been formed by some of the influence of these families - pastoralists, philanthropists, politicians and journalists - and some of their influence on society continues today. Families are: Murdoch, Downer, Wright, Myer, Durack, De Bortolis, and Macarthur. Two-disc set containing seven episodes from Series One of this fascinating ABC TV Documentary series. Narrated by William Zappa."
