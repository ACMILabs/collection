        "Victor (Victor Rasuk) a New York City teenager gets caught trying to sleep with 'Fat Donna' when his younger sister Vicki (Krystal Rodriguez) realises what he's up to and spreads the word in the neighbourhood. Victor, thinking his reputation has suffered a blow, quells the summer heat with a visit to the local public pool with his best friend Harold. Here he meets 'Juicy Judy' (Judy Marte) and he decides to pursue her. Living in a small apartment with his strict Grandmother, sister and piano-playing younger brother Nino (Rasuk's real-life brother Silvestre), Victor finds life as a teenager challenging when he gets the blame for having a bad influence on his siblings. Coming-of-age is tough (and sometimes comical) for Victor as he finds real love, gets a glimpse of what manhood is about and asserts his place within the family. Based on the short film \"Five Feet High and Rising\" by its writer/director Peter Sollett. Cast also includes Kevin Rivera, Altagracia Guzman, Melonie Diaz."
