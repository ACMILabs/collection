        "To 'glean' is to gather after the harvest. Gleaners are therefore those who collect potatoes and the like that remain after the harvest to survive. This documentary written, directed and narrated by Agnes Varda, shot with a digital camera, is an engrossing and intimate look at scavengers in the French countryside. We see the traditional gleaners, as immortalised in the paintings of Millet and Van Gogh, and then the present day gleaners living and surviving on what they can find. This award winning documentary is touching and presents us with food for thought."
