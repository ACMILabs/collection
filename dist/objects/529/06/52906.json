        "Australian geologist Sandy (Toni Collette) lands the unwanted task of showing a Japanese businessman Hiromitsu (Gotaro Tsunashima) around the mines and deserts of the Pilbara, hoping to sell his company the geology software she has been co-developing. Hiromitsu mistakes her for his driver and demands they go off-road, unaware of the dangers. The two journey further into the West Australian desert, gradually leaving what they know about each other and themselves behind.  Winner of 21 Australian film awards including 8 AFI Awards. Cast also includes Matthew Dyktynski, Lynette Curran, Yumiko Tanaka, John Howard."
