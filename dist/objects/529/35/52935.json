    "description": [
        "Conquering the mountain of Everest was not Sir Edmund Hillary's only achievement in Nepal. Through a philanthropic enterprise he continued to fund development projects for the Nepalese people - projects that the people themselves requested. His legacy will live on through the children of Nepal attending one of the some 30 schools that his \"Himalayan Trust\" built since 1961 - in many cases by his own hands. This DVD contains two documentaries - one made in 1980 is about Sir Edmund at sixty years of age and the other made in 2000 continues the subject matter of his philanthropic work - the DVD release commemorates the 50th Anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary's ascent of Mount Everest."
