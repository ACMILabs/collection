    "description": [
        "Discover all the work that has to be done around the farm for each of the year's four seasons as Maisy and her friends, Tallulah, Charley, Cyril and Eddie, have fun while they work. Other adventures see them climbing a mountain, going on a train journey, shopping, finding out about bugs, a duckling and even about breakfast! DVD contains sixteen sing-a-long songs that toddlers will just love and also five interactive games. Simple animation with bold, primary colours makes Maisy very appealing to the 0 to 4 year age group. Sounds and voices provided by Australia's Umbilical Brothers. Based on books by Lucy Cousins, narrated by Neil Morrissey. Comes with Instruction booklet."
