        "Made for television, this documentary explores the New Zealand locations used in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy by Peter Jackson. Television presenter Jim Hickey interviews locals who played extras in the films and those that were involved in the 'behind-the scenes' side of the business, such as caterers, horse wranglers, stuntmen, artists etc. Features an interview with Jackson discussing the way in which he used the lush New Zealand landscape as a stand-in for the Middle Earth of Tolkien's iconic text."
