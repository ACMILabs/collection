    "description": [
        "In this fascinating British TV series, writer/presenter Alain de Botton's enthusiasm and passion for philosophy is evident as he takes us on a journey of discovery about the lives and thoughts of six ancient philosophers. The somewhat complex ideas of the philosophers are simplified for the viewer by comparing them or placing them in situations and locations of contemporary western society. In the answers to life's mystery de Botton asks some of the important questions - Will shopping make me happy? Why do traffic jams make me angry? Does romantic love equate with Happiness? Made up of six programs, each dealing with one particular philosopher, this is a great introduction to the topic of philosophy. Inspired by the book written by Alain de Botton \"The Consolations of Philosophy\". Another interesting series by the same presenter is \"Status Anxiety\" [318889]."
