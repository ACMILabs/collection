        "A compilation of great wildlife cinematography celebrating the 50 year history of the British Broadcasting Corporation's Natural History Unit. Look on in wonder as killer whales come ashore to hunt seals, tigers fight and Sir David lounges around with a gorilla family. Separated into seven sections, this is a wonderful testament to the hard working people that make these spectacular programs. The sections are: Sea and shore ; Forests ; Freshwater ; Snow and ice ; Grasslands ; Sky ; Jungles. Some of the greatest wildlife moments compiled into one collection with an introduction by Sir David Attenborough."
