        "Two episodes of \"Postman Pat\" Greendale's favourite postman who loves to deliver the mail with Jess his black and white cat. The first adventure sees Pat, haven broken his own glasses, borrow an old pair of Mrs Goggins. The glasses not being suited to Postman Pat are the cause of a slight muddle as the letters are being delivered to the wrong addresses because Pat can't read them properly. Pat makes a clay model of his cat Jess, in the second story. He enters it into the Greendale art show where the statue wins a special prize."
