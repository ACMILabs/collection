        "A boy called \"Placid Lake\" is becoming a man. Tormented all through school for being different and for being the product of his new age parents, Placid (Ben Lee) has a reason for being angry. He decides to exact a type of revenge on his parents by having a career in insurance. Helped through life by his academically brilliant and crayon-chewing friend Gemma (Rose Byrne), will Placid survive the bland 9-to-5 of corporate life? Written and directed by Tony McNamara, adapted from his play \"The Cafe Latte Kid\". Features music by Ben Lee and Cezary Skubiszewski. Cast includes Garry McDonald, Miranda Richardson."
