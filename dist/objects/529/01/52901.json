        "From the director of \"LA Confidential\" and based on the novel by Michael Chabon, \"Wonder Boys\" directed by Curtis Hanson is a dry witted comedy about middle aged writing professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) who is having trouble surpassing the success of his first novel with bad case of writer's block. Things are not going well for him in life generally as a student (Tobey Maquire) is obsessed with him, his married lover is pregnant (Frances McDormand) and his wife has left him. Academy Award winner for Best Music, Song by Bob Dylan. Cast includes Robert Downey Jr, Katie Holmes and Rip Torn with screenplay by Steve Kloves."
