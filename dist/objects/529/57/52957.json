        "Faye Dunaway stars as screen legend Joan Crawford in this biographical feature about Joan's life from her adopted daughter's point of view. Joan Crawford was a powerful star produced by the Hollywood Studio System but as the old saying goes, money can't buy happiness and she yearned to be a mother. As a single woman she adopted children but her dependence on alcohol led to the alleged abuse of the children and her personality at home is revealed to be controlling and overbearing. Script is based on the tell-all novel \"Mommie Dearest\" by Christina Crawford. Also stars Diana Scarwid as the older Christina."
