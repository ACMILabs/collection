        "This video contains six delightful adventures of Little Bear, the furry fellow based upon the series of books written by Else Homelund Minarik and illustrated by Maurice Sendak. These animated works with their gentle rhythm and family values will delight the very young as Little Bear and his family and friends go about daily life in the forest. The programs are: \"What will Little Bear wear?\" Mother Bear teaches Little Bear that the best coat to keep him warm in winter is his own fur. \"Hide and seek\" a universal game played and enjoyed by Little Bear and his friends Cat, Hen, Duck and Owl. \"Little Bear goes to the moon\" Little Bear's imagination takes off as he creates a special moon hat. \"Birthday soup\" to celebrate his birthday, Little Bear invites the gang over to share in some imaginary soup. \"Polar Bear\" Little Bear's fur becomes a different colour after a painting mishap. \"Gone Fishing\" Little Bear goes fishing but takes his imagination with him."
