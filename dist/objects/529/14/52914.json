        "An Australian/Canadian co-production, based on the best selling children and young adult series 'The Saddle Club' and 'Pine Hollow' written by Bonnie Bryant. Studious Lisa (Lara Jean Marshall), tomboy Stevie (Sophie Bennett) and horse-crazy Carole (Keenan Macwilliam) are the Saddle Club, best friends united by their love for horses and their willingness to help each other. The arrival of the beautiful French Junior Champion, Dorothee Doutey (Matylda Buezko) creates a stir at Pine Hollow. What is her mystery behind her 'rest' and her disconnection from her horse 'Hugo'? While the club try to remedy the situation another serious dilemma surfaces in the form of an unknown horse virus that threatens the stables. The club rally again to race against possible disaster. Will Dorothee take up her Olympic selection or settle on love with one of the stablehands? The girls also get to do their first singing performance in front of an audience."
