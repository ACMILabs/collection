        "Ko-Yaa-Nis-Katsi (from the Hopi language) is a panoramic roller coaster of life that makes you scream but hang on. A spellbinding, staggering non-narrative film that soars across the United States in search of vistas both natural and man-made. Much of the photography is in slow motion and time-lapse edited in such away as to produce an entirely different perspective to everyday reality. With cinematography by Ron Fricke and mesmerising music by Philip Glass, the film juxtaposes distortion with truth producing quite often alarming results. It is divided into five segments as follows: 1. Crazy life. 2. Life in turmoil. 3. Life out of balance. 4. Life disintegrating. 5. A state of life that calls for another way of living. Also available on VHS [307953]"
