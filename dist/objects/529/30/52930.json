        "Impressive Australian debut feature from Tony Ayres about a young man's death and the aftermath for his friends and family. Gavin is a gay man living in Sydney when he succumbs to illness; his two best friends, Anna and Charlie, who assist his death in its final stages, grieve inconsolably, blocking their pain and memories with drugs, alcohol and sex. Whilst Charlie's relationship with his boyfriend sours, Anna embarks on an affair, whilst shifting into controlling over-drive. This puts her in conflict with Gavin's mother, who finds her role usurped. Despite the morbid subject matter \"Walking on water\" relishes in gallows humour, showing that even in death, there is life. Brilliant central performances from Vince Colosimo and Maria Theodorakis, coupled with intelligent scripting make this a memorable experience."
