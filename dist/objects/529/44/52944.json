        "Filmed over three years \"Travelling birds\" shows in dazzling detail how a variety of birds journey to assorted parts of their globe on an annual migration to warmer climes. What sets this work apart from most nature documentaries is its perspective the camera is actually in the air with these creatures, showing the animals unique perspective. The documentary also covers the foes that threaten birds: man, pollution, predators and accidents that hamper their abilities. Producer, director and screenwriter Jacques Perrin, creates a fabulously lyrical work that is supported by minimal narration allowing the visuals to tell the story."
