        "This is the ultimate anti-war film by writer/director Dalton Trumbo. The setting is World War I and a nameless, armless, legless, faceless hospitalised soldier is found to be conscious despite the extreme condition that his body remains in after an explosion. His isolation and freakish state causes unease and anguish to the viewer. The horror that he faces is broken up through the film with flashbacks of the soldiers life before the war. \"Johnny Got his Gun\" is a very important film which is both thought-provoking and distressing. Trumbo received the 1971 Fipresci Prize and was nominated for the Golden Palm at Cannes. Cast includes Timothy Bottoms, Jason Robards, Donald Sutherland, David Soul and Diane Varsi."
