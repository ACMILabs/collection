        "From the creators of \"Being John Malkovich\" - director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman - comes the strangely twisted tale of woe of a screenwriter given the task of adapting a novel to the screen. In a desperate struggle, he actually writes himself (and his twin brother) into the story and reality and fiction start to blur, creating some dramatic and at times, comic situations. Cast includes Nicholas Cage, Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper (Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actor for this role). Screenplay by Charlie and Donald Kaufman. \"Adaptation\" is also winner of two Golden Globe Awards. Based on the book \"The Orchard Thief\" by Susan Orlean."
