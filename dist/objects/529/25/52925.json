        "Alfonso Cuaron shocked and delighted audiences with his third feature, a return to his native Mexico and a return to form. Principally this is the story of two horny teenagers who take a road trip with an older woman in search of a mythical beach. But Cuaron makes his film much more than just \"'American Pie' in Spanish\" (as it is was crudely dubbed in some reviews), creating a clever, funny and provocative work that comments on the irascible nature of teenage friendship and the class delineations of Mexican society whilst retaining scintillating repartee between the leads (Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal riff off each other in a delightfully tangential fashion) and by being downright sexy."
