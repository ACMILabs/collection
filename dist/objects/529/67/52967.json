        "Franklin is a young green turtle, who, like most youngsters is having fun growing up and learning important things as he goes. Three episodes show some of his adventures. In \"Franklin's Kite\" Franklin learns that throwing out a broken toy is not always the best thing to do. \"Franklin is Bossy\" teaches Franklin that everyone has to take a turn and in \"Finders Keepers for Franklin\" he realizes that finding something means that somebody has lost it in the first place and may want it back."
