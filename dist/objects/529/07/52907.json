        "Caustic, funny, politically charged award winning television series, with an all-star cast set in New York City of the mid-1980s, when the horrific effects of AIDS was beginning to be realised. The narrative centres around numerous gay men some infected, some not and how it effects their lives and those of their families. Contains several celestial scenes, as well imaginary humorous settings that allow characters to ruminate and reflect upon their fate. Angels make appearances, the dead are raised and visions of the afterlife abound in this inventive, poetic and insightful work. Cast includes: Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Mary Louise Parker, Jeffrey Wright and Emma Thompson. Directed by Mike Nichols and written by Tony Kushner, based on his Pulitzer winning play."
