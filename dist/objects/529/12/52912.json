        "Written, directed and produced by Eli Roth, \"Cabin Fever\" is about a group of five friends who happily set out for a holiday adventure in a cabin in the woods. All seems fine until one of them gets sick with a gross flesh-eating virus. So scary it's funny, this gory film is written to graphically shock you as opposed to keeping you in suspense, it even comes with a director's warning at the beginning! Cast includes Jordan Ladd, James DeBello, Rider Strong, Joey Kern and Cerina Vincent. WARNING: SOME SCENES MAY DISTURB."
