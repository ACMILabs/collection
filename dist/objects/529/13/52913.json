        "An Australian/Canadian co-production, based on the best selling children and young adult series 'The Saddle Club' and 'Pine Hollow' written by Bonnie Bryant. Studious Lisa (Lara Jean Marshall), tomboy Stevie (Sophie Bennett) and horse-crazy Carole (Keenan Macwilliam) are the Saddle Club, best friends united by their love for horses and their willingness to help each other. A film crew use Pine Hollow as a location and rivalry stirs as the girls audition for a part. Can the leading man really ride a horse though? The girls in the club decide to help out so he doesn't hurt 'Comanche'. The dodgy wiring at Pine Hollow sends sparks into Max's love life and the girls help him out with a makeover for his first date. The girls also get some fun-time too as they take part in a Rodeo weekend."
