        "This made for television documentary focuses on the covert operations of the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) of the United States, using an array of interviews with former agents, recreations, and historical footage. Divided into six episodes, each segment focuses on a different aspect of the organisation's history. \"Berlin cowboys\" Dissects the many undercover operations in circulation after WW2 in Berlin, when the Americans were determined to protect Western Europe from the spread of Communism from the East. In the 1950s, Berlin was the spy capital of the world, and CIA officers were in the front line, competing for information and trying to win the propaganda wars being fought with the Russians. Also addresses the building of the Berlin Wall. \"Hi tech, low cunning\" Advanced technology, such as cameras in spy planes, aided the CIA in the clandestine collecting of vital information. To gain invaluable information on Soviet missiles and weapons capacity, the CIA started using air balloons, which were easily shot down, but these were soon replaced by the U2 aeroplanes, which were superseded by satellites. \"Hidden persuaders\" Fearing that the powerful and popular Communist party would win, the CIA sought to undermine the Italian elections of the 1950s. Their methods included poster propaganda, circulating footage of Communists destroying Catholic churches and letters from Italian-Americans deriding Communism. The CIA was also seriously concerned about the Communist alignment of Indonesia's President Sukarno; their methods to undermine him included circulating a 'blue' movie of him (or rather an actor who shared his likeness) making love to a white woman. \"Phoenix rising\" Using methods such as torture, kidnapping and assassination, the CIA sought to undermine the command structure of the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. An incredibly brutal chapter in the organisation's history. \"Executive action\" This episode concerns actions taken in Cuba, with the intention of removing Fidel Castro from power. Examines the fiasco which was the \"Bay of Pigs\", the innumerable assassination attempts on Castro's life, and various operations conducted with a view to undermine Castro's power. These schemes included sabotage, and manipulation of the sugar market in the hope of ruining the Cuban economy. Also examines the capturing and execution of Che Guevera in Bolivia. Because Castro was linked to Chile's democratically elected President Allende, the CIA sought to incite a coup, removing Allende from power by any means necessary. After Watergate and against the backdrop of the anti-war movement, the CIA was under scrutiny and consequently brought under Congressional control. \"Moving targets\" Final episode looks at the CIA activities in the 1980s and 1990s - Nicaragua, Iran, the Iran-Contra scandal and changes wrought within the CIA. Some scenes of torture and murder, particularly in the \"Phoenix Rising\" segment, may disturb."
