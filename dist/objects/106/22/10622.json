        "Traditionally, western cartography combines multiple data sets in a two dimensional representation. The datamapping (cross-referencing of datasets) tells a story - the land use and landforms of a place. Imaginative and politicised choice of datasets creates more esoteric 'maps'.  sub_scapePROOF uses video/audio footage of televised political rhetoric and confessional TV shows. Onto these are mapped other sources of 'data' generated from philosophical and poetic texts.  sub_scapePROOF critiques the notion of evidential, superficial 'truth', in a post-faith age. By mapping data from post-colonial locations back onto the language of superpower politics, sub_scape generates a playful and ironic critique on the traditional politics and power dynamics of knowledge-through-mapping. - Waterson and Richards."
