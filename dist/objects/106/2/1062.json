        "The bright, beautiful and spontaneous ocean is something to wallow in. A young girl plays in the ocean and with the fishes. A dashing surfer rides up on his white steed and declares 'I've come - you'll never have to chop onions again!' Jane wakes up from her dream (or was it a nightmare?) Working at the fish market, she endures the sexual innuendo and double entendres from male customers and fellow workers alike. When matters come to a head, she cleverly takes the situation into her own hands and offers a unique solution to unsolicited sexual advances... An impressionistic animation."
