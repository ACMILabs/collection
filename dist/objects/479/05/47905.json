        "Bushwalking in Australia means leaving the beaten tracks and venturing into the wild, rugged mountain country, with little more than the pursuit of adventure as the motive, and good healthy exercise and the companionship of fellow walkers, the rewards. The film includes scenes of Lamington National Park, Queensland, the upper reaches of the Yarra in Victoria's Warburton Ranges, and the Blue Mountains in New South Wales."
