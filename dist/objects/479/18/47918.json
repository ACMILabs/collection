        "To hear Bill Mason tell about the making of this feature film (he is also the narrator) is to share with him his affection for his camera-quarry: the big northern timber wolves and pure-white Arctic wolves. What he brings to the screen is some unexcelled film footage and a great depth of lore about these wary, intelligent creatures of the Canadian wilds. Filming was done over three years in the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, the high Arctic, and near his Gatineau Hills (Quebec) home where he kept and observed three grown wolves and, eventually, the litter of cubs that provides some of the film's most engaging sequences. Narration by Bill Mason."
