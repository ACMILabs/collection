        "Starting with aerial shots of the '12 Apostles', 'London Bridge' and other rugged limestone structures along Victoria's south-western coast, this travelogue documentary about Warrnambool highlights the town's tourist opportunities, the people and the business centre for the wealthy agricultural dairying district. Includes footage of 'Lady Bay', the botanic gardens, the annual steeplechase and the Fletcher Jones and Nestle factories. Written by James Jeffrey, photographed by Gary Hansen."
