        "a rapid, violent montage of clashing images decelerates according to a mathematical formula"

    "description": [
        "At first glance, 'Random cuts' is a violent, rapidly shifting assemblage of images of violence, flight and impact from manga cinema, samurai films and a brutal cock-fight. On closer inspection, the apparent randomness of the images is revealed to be constrained by a mathematical formula. 12 images, each 1.6 seconds in length add and divide, repeating 12 times, increasing by the duration of the accumulating time units. The forceful incisions of the images and cuts find a taut restraint within this order, each element unresolved amid the visual violence."
