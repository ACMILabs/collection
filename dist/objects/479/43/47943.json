        "In this rousing martial arts epic set in China during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), silver-haired eunuchs who control much of the country's wealth, and murder those who oppose them, kidnap two children. The children are rescued by an Imperial swordsman and his female companion. With the eunuchs' forces in hot pursuit, the escaping party takes shelter at a mysterious isolated tavern called the Dragon Inn run by a murderous hostess. An atmospherically tense action-drama with spectacular fight sequences and cinematography. Remake of 1966 film \"Dragon Inn\" (\"Longmen Kezhan\") by King Hu. In Cantonese and Mandarin with English subtitles. Cast includes Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, Tony Leung and Donnie Yen."
