        "The second of the popular \"Police Story\" series of films featuring Jackie Chan is considered by some critics and fans to be even better than the original. Slightly less edgy than its predecessor, 'Police Story II' is nevertheless packed to the brim with lightning-fast action and comic creativity. This instalment begins with Mr. Ku, the drug lord that Kevin Chan (Jackie) put behind bars in the first film, being released from prison. However, Chan's one-man war on a criminal gang that took place in the first film, has earned him a reprimand and a demotion from detective to traffic cop. When Hong Kong is hit by a wave of bomb threats and his wife (Maggie Cheung) is kidnapped, he finds himself caught up in another private investigation. In characteristic Chan style, the film mixes mind-blowing stunts and wonderfully choreographed fight scenes that showcase his mix of grace and comic talents. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
