        "Based on the novel by first time writer Melina Marchetta, \"Looking for Alibrandi\" is an affectionate look at three generations of strong willed Italian women, and the youngest member, Josie's (Pia Miranda) attempt to break the family \"curse\". 17 year old Josie lives with her single mother Christina (Greta Scacchi), is completing her HSC at an exclusive Sydney school on a scholarship, begrudgingly visiting her Nonna, defending the labels of \"wog\" and \"bastard\", and longing after the lifestyle afforded to rich kids with both parents. When her father, Michael (Anthony La Paglia) enters their lives again, Josie confronts her mother and her Nonna about the rift between Christina and her father, and the animosity between mother and daughter to reveal secrets long since hidden. Josie must also make decisions about her future career and what her heart desires as she is torn between school captain John Barton (Matthew Newton) and public school boy Jacob (Kick Gurry). Between work, school, family and personal relationships, Josie discovers that life is filled with uncertainty and she is not the only one debilitated by the labels society ascribes. This was the first feature film effort for both director Woods and actor Miranda. Remarkably, the film was nominated and won several AFI awards, including best film, best supporting actress (Scacchi) and best performance by an actress in a leading role (Miranda)."
