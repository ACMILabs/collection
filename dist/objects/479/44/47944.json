        "A baby polar bear finds himself in the zoo after being rescued by a ship. One day a little girl called Tilly loses her teddy bear in the enclosure and the bear takes it upon himself to return the teddy personally, thus beginning a new friendship which takes on gargantuan proportions as the girl tries to keep her new pet a secret. As it begins the snow, the bear begins to hear the call of the wild. Based on the children's novel of the same name by Raymond Briggs and featuring the voices of Peter Knapp, Philip Sheffield and Charlotte Church."
