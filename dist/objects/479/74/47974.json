        "Six monologues (each approx. 36 mins.) written by Alan Bennett and delivered by five of Britain's most auspicious female actors (Patricia Routledge, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Thora Hird, Stephanie Cole) and Bennett himself. Made for television and originally screened in Britain in 1987, each piece displays the wry observations, knowing irony and tender understatement that are characteristic of Bennett's writing style. The suburban normality of the world his characters inhabit belies their lives of secrets, revelations, fears, crimes and passions. They tell their stories, and in doing so reveal more than they know of the humour, passion and sadness of their lives."
