        "The film shows how the International Labour Organization, established in 1919, continues to bring together the representatives of forty-six member nations to set uniform standards of social welfare for the working people of the world. The carrying out of the policies in mines, mills and merchant shipping from Montreal to Shanghai demonstrates the practicality of international legislation."
