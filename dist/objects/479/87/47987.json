        "This film shows that human beings are not machines to be shut down at night; change and recreation are needed to keep well and happy in war or in peace. Of interest to industries, this film demonstrates how factory management, civic groups and workers themselves establish recreational centers, where dancing, swimming, singing, handicrafts and many other sports and hobbies are enjoyed. Canadians use their time after work to become healthy, informed citizens"
