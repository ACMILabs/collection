        "No challenge, no obstacle is too great for ten-year-old Ti-Jean. As in his other exploits, he proves equal to every situation. Working his boat passage, flying an aircraft, saving a mine from disaster--all are in a day's work for him before he again mounts his white horse and rides off in search of new adventures."
