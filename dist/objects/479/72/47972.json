        "The first volume of a compelling mini-series written by Dennis Potter which merges fantasy, reality and history through a noir-like, musical and surreal narrative entwined around its central character, Philip Marlow (Michael Gambon). He is an 'out of print' detective fiction writer who is incapacitated both physically and emotionally by a rare skin disease, and waiting for a seemingly impossible healing process to begin in an overworked National Health Hospital while he constructs the plot and imagery of a detective story in his mind, unable to use a pen. 'The Singing Detective' seams together three narratives, Marlow's hospital experiences, the detective novel set in post World War II London that he is half-composing and half-hallucinating, and memories of his wartime boyhood that cross into both his reality and his fiction. Marlow pictures himself as a crooning 1940s detective, wrapped up in an intricate murder case, an image that gradually interplays with his own progress of self-discovery and healing in the real world of his hospitalised condition and his intermittent memories of childhood. When he agrees to talk to a hospital psychotherapist, the clues to all three narratives and their inseparable significance to each other begin to accumulate."
