        "A report on the United Nations Development Decade which aims to replace labour intensive production methods in third world nations in an attempt to liberate people from hunger and poverty. Focuses on innovative international efforts that have harnessed the energy generated by the sun, wind and water and transformed it into power. By applying these technological achievements and injecting capital, the UN believes it may alleviate many of the hardships endured by underdeveloped nations. Includes a segment on the development of the Volta River Dam."
