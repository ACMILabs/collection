        "The function of an art gallery in the community. Sequences show the variety of interests a gallery can hold for people - exhibitions of great art from many nations, festivals of dancing and music. Even more important is the part a gallery can play in the development of imagination and talent in a child. Through happy participation in painting, modelling activities, costume-making and pageants, children learn about art."
