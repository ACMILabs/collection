        "From the rocky bottom of a stream this film brings you a remarkable study of the eastern brook trout, showing how instinct protects a fish and lets it survive, and how the same instinct holds it prisoner of its environment. Photographed in color at natural speed, the film's most remarkable sequence shows the spawning of fish, the event of regeneration as eggs are laid and fertilized, then hatch."
