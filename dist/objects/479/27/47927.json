        "A Triad gang in charge of a popular club fights to keep it from falling into a rival gang's hands. Along with films by directors such as Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam, \"The Club\" was one of the first films of the \"Hong Kong new wave\". It stood apart from other action films of the time due to its gritty realism and raw violence. Most of the major actors (including the lead Chan Wai Man) were current or former Triad members, and Wong took great pains to film in actual locations, even going so far as to securing \"protection\" from local gangs. Wong's filming style, which took on an almost documentary-like quality, also stood apart from the colorful, fanciful films being produced in Hong Kong in the early eighties. He went on to make 'Crime Story' (1993) starring Jackie Chan and 'The Big Hit' in Hollywood in 1998. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
