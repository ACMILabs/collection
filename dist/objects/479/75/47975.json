        "John Wayne is Lieutenant Colonel Kirby Yorke, a member of the US Cavalry defending the Rio Grande from attacking Apache Indians. His son Jeff, who he hasn't seen for fifteen years, joins the unit and very soon after Yorke's estranged wife (Maureen O'Hara) arrives to demand their son return home. Having lost his wife's respect over his actions in the Civil War, Jeff's arrival offers Yorke the opportunity to prove himself again to his wife. Their rekindled romance, however, is put at risk when a tribe of Apaches attack the lonely outpost community. Directed by veteran John Ford, this is a classically structured western film that features an outstanding group of character actors including Ben Johnson and Victor McGlaglen. If the depiction of the Native Americans may turn contemporary stomachs, the final action scenes are inarguably rousing and deftly executed."
