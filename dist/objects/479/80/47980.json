        "A look at the history of the Rideau Canal -- its original military purpose, its painstaking contruction between 1826 and 1831, its effects on the land around and on Canada as a whole. The film combines old drawings and actual footage, contemporary commentary and voices from the past, to reveal the technological and human sides of one of Canada's greatest engineering achievements."
