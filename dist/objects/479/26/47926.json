        "Spanning three generations (Ralph Fiennes appears in all three) and almost 150 years, this epic film chronicles the fortunes, and more often than not, misfortunes, of the Hungarian-Jewish Sonnenschein family, traced back to the narrator's Great Grandfather Emmanuel, manufacturer of the famous \"Taste of sunshine\" tonic (which also happens to be the German translation of their name). Across the generations, 2 wars, common themes such as forbidden or doomed love (between brother and adopted sister, brother and sister in law, and love with a married woman), and a choice between the denunciation or proclamation of personal values and their Jewish heritage are repeated. As we witness generation after generation of Sonnenschein confront the same issues, we are led to question how long it will take for the family curse to be lifted and someone to stand up for their name and what they believe in. Nominated for 3 Golden Globe awards."
