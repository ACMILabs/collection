        "For farm folk it is a day of judgment, for town folk a day of fun, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Drum majorettes and cattle shows, pipes and drums and homemade pickles - the country fair has something for everyone, and in this film the probing camera is everywhere to capture its essence to the full."
