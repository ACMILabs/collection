        "This film establishes a parallel between the 1970 electoral campaign in Quebec and the 1936 campaign dominated by Maurice Duplessis. It shows the hope but also the uncertainty that existed in 1970. Had the Quiet Revolution really changed things in Quebec? Was it possible that a new leader would emerge on the political scene?"
