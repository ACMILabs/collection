        "An oldtime silent comedy. A continually arguing couple are told separately by medical friends that the other has a heart complaint and must be treated with care. This works for a short time until they both discover the ruse. However, they then both really do believe that they each have a heart complaint and call another doctor for his advice. His solution is to give them a prescription for two for living happily together. No credits."
