        "Popular idols of the rock music scene - The Rolling Stones, The Stampeders, Whiskey Howl, Alice Cooper, Muddy Waters - are seen and heard in this film. It is a penetrating look at the whole pop music sub-culture and what keeps it alive, filmed in Canada, on and off-stage, and behind the scenes at record companies, radio broadcasting studios, and board rooms where hucksters plan the sales campaigns. The film includes personal interviews in which some of the stars explain what it's all about and features Alice Cooper hacking a doll to pieces on stage. Obscene language has been bleeped out."
