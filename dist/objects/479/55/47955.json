        "A documentary about Hephzibah Menuhin, sister of acclaimed violinist Yehudi, who led her own remarkable life. In 1938 when she was eighteen she abandoned a promising career as a concert pianist in the United States to marry Lindsay Nicholas, Australian heir to the Aspro fortune, moving to his remote sheep station. Following the War, Hephzibah toured Europe and had a scandalous affair with Viennese sociologist Richard Hauser. Moved by the horrors of the concentration camps, she became increasingly isolated from her privileged life in Australia. She left her husband and children, married Hauser and settled in London where the couple established their Centre for Human Rights. The documentary utilises archival home movie footage, Hephzibah's letters and music from her performances to gain insight into the decisions she made throughout her life."
