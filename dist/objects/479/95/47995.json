        "Harriet the chicken reads voraciously and has a multitude of hobbies, while her friend Winnie swats flies, and constantly searches for a good time. One day the suave fox, Mr. Johnson, appears with a hot air balloon, promising to show Winnie a good time. Winnie decides to \"live a little\", and takes him up on his offer, much to Harriet's horror. While Harriet contacts the police, Mr. Johnston makes a stop at the grocery store to pick up some dumplings to go with his chicken dinner. Harriet accidentally throws the weights overboard, and the balloon sails off. Mr. Johnston does not give up so easily, donning a chicken costume, he lures Harriet away from the safety of her home. Will Harriet become the main course for Mr. Johnson's dinner, or will her resourceful friend Winnie be able to outwit the crafty fox before it's too late? A cautionary tale about the importance of reading, based on the book by James Marshall."
