        "A feature drama about a young Canadian Indian's attempt to find a place for himself. It tells of the cultural shock of an educational system that teaches him to be a white man, and of his attempts to discover a way of life more meaningful to his Native culture and ancestry. It is a tragic story of unexpected pitfalls and disillusionment that are as cruel as the bitter wind that greets him on his cold and lonely journey. The film stars Buckley Petawabano, Johnny Yesno and Chief Dan George, and was shot on location with the people of Indian reserves and schools in northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba."
