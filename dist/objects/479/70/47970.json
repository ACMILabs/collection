        "Lessons take on new life and meaning for children through the magic of films, filmstrips and radio. Everybody goes to the movies, and directly or indirectly learns much of the world. If ordinary movies illumine minds, how much more can be done with specially designed films in schools. We see, for example, how through a film, a class of children \"jumps a continent\" to visit Mexico, how a filmstrip on cutouts stimulates creative activity; how a radio broadcast can make what might have been a drab history period spring into new, imaginative life. Thanks to \"sight and sound,\" learning becomes an adventure."
