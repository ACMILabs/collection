        "Infantile anxieties embodied in the apocryphal Moat Monster. Extraordinary document of unrestrained play, profiling a small group of pre-school children and the spontaneous generation of their narrative about the 'Moat Monster'. Contingent nature of children's reality finds expression in the creative dynamism of this whimsical drama. Portions of this film appear in a full length film entitled 'Role Enactment in Children's Play: a Developmental Overview'. Episode 3 of \"Training module on role enactment in children's play\" series."
