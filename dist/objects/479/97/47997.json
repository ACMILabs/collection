        "This is a short animated film based on the Russian children's book written and illustrated by Frank Asch and Vladimir Vagin. The mice are all going about their business on a beautiful day when a menacing feline shadow begins to creep over the hills toward the village. A pink-shirted mouse takes to the skies in a hot air balloon, heralding the arrival of this threat to public safety by shouting, \"Here comes the cat!\". Chaos follows this announcement and the village descends into a mad panic as the ginger kitty creeps closer and closer. But when the cat finally arrives, it becomes suddenly apparent that all is not as it seems."
