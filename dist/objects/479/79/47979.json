        "A portrait of Venice that expores the rich legacy of art bequeathed to all. Two hundred years ago Canaletto caught its elusive beauty, and in this film details of his pictures rise before you - spired churches and turreted palaces soar into a blue Mediterranean sky. Narrated by William Shatner. (Award: Vancouver)"
