        "Set in 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row \"The Green Mile\" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. The story is told as a memoir by Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), now living in an elderly care facility and revisiting his exceptional life, who was head guard on the Green Mile whilst the incidents being recounted occur. A new inmate is brought into his custody: John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), an African American convicted of the brutal murders of young twin white girls. Despite his immense size and fearsome reputation, Coffey seems to be a kind and well-mannered person with a very child-like manner about him. Soon Edgecombe and two of his fellow guards notice that he has the ability to perform miraculous cures, prompting the guards to wonder how such a man could be guilty of the heinous crimes he is charged with. The cast also include James Cromwell as the warden, Sam Rockwell and Graham Greene as inmates awaiting their time in the electric chair, and Harry Dean Stanton as a clever trustee. This film is based on the 1996 serialized novel by Stephen King."
