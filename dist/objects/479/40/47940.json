        "As the Gulf War draws to a close, a small group of soldiers discovers a map which seems to point out where Saddam Hussein has hidden a large cache of stolen Kuwaiti gold. They decide to follow the trail and recover some of the gold for themselves, but as they delve deeper into the dessert, they discover more of the consequences of George Bush's policies in the Middle East. As they become aware of what is actually happening around them, they are torn between the desire to leave with the fortune they came for and the demands of their conscience to help the oppressed and tortured Iraqi people they supposedly came to liberate from Saddam. Cast includes George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze and Nora Dunn."
