        "A compilation of five animated cartoons featuring that famous spinach-eating hero Popeye the Sailor, along with the usual co-stars, his dearly beloved Olive Oyl, Bluto the interfering bully and Popeye's mischievous young nephews. Interesting to note that in \"Popeye meets Ali Baba's forty thieves\" there is a mix of real life background with the animation which apparently was often a feature of the very early Popeye cartoons. Good family entertainment."
