        "Tony Rivers (Michael Landon) is an angry, troubled teen who shows misguided aggression towards his friends and family. Sensing something is awry, Tony agrees to see psychologist Dr Brandon, a skilled hypnotist. Unbeknownst to Tony however, Brandon is hell-bent on seeing Tony regress to a primal state under his influence. When a teen is killed, seemingly by an animal, the facts are soon uncovered - Tony is a werewolf. Despite its B-movie origins and stock characterisations, \"I was a teenage werewolf\" plays as a sharp analogy for the trials, physical transformations, alienation and inherent difficulties of puberty."
