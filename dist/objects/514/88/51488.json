        "Ultima Vez is a dance company formed by director, choreographer, actor and photographer Wim Vandekeybus in 1985. Drawing his dance vocabulary from everyday movements, his style is high adrenaline with genuine sense of jeopardy. Vandekeybus used an Irish nursery rhyme as a basis for his performance '7 for a Secret never to be told' (1997). The performance was made up of seven interflowing sections, alluding to 'two extreme emotions, the two sexes, two precious metals and a secret'. For each scene a specific scenography and different movement material was developed. This dance video is an adaptation of the fifth scene of the performance. Music, Thierry De Mey."
