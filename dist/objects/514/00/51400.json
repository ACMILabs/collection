        "One of a plethora of adaptations for the big and small screen of Jack London's famous novel, this 1972 film version of \"Call of the wild\" features Charlton Heston as Jack Thornton, a kindly would-be prospector heading for the 1897 Klondike gold rush, who adopts a mistreated dog. The man and the animal strike up a unique friendship as they travel through the wilderness. This family orientated film was a multi-national production filmed on location in Norway. The voices of non-English speaking actors were dubbed into English. Cast also includes Michele Mercier, George Eastman and Maria Rohm."
