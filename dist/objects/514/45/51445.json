        "Modern day Manhattan and an intruder, Edge, rifles through the apartment of an elderly lady, Angela who gets the better of him and bails him up with her rifle. At gunpoint Edge is forced to listen to a story from Angela's past - two American rival brothers Luke (the elder and a fiery sharp shooter) and Elijah (a Bible quoting preacher) who lived at the turn of the 19th century. When Elijah marries the prostitute that Luke has designs on, the latter flees to Macedonia and joins the local resistance fighters who are trying to rid their country of occupying Turkish forces. Elijah pursues his brother across the world and signs up with the opposing forces, the Turkish leaders, in order to extract revenge. In \"Dust\", present and past stories run parallel, occasionally melding, enabling Manchevski to remark upon the elusive nature of history. At times graphically bloody with a very high body count, the elliptical structure of \"Dust\" may frustrate some viewers but the cinematography and Macedonian setting are beautiful to watch. \"Dust\" is the second film from Macedonian director, Milcho Manchevski (Before the rain). Cast includes Joseph Fiennes, David Wenham, Adrian Lester, Anne Brochet."
