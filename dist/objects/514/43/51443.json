        "Patrice Leconte (Monsieur Hire, Ridicule, The Hairdresser's husband) directed this romantic fantasy about an aging knife thrower and a beautiful young wayward woman that he meets one night contemplating suicide on a bridge. Gabor (Daniel Auteuil) is a talented performer whose cool demeanour mirrors an emotional wasteland; Adele (Vanessa Paradis) has a history of bad luck, in particular regarding sexual experiences, which tend to leave her destitute and lonely. As Gabor and Adele join forces, they create a daring and erotic stage act and their luck turns to gold. The two share a telepathic bond that enables them to converse from separate locales and intensifies their mutual attraction, tested by Adele's whimsical attractions to a myriad of suitors. Set in France and Monaco and shot in black and white the film is aesthetically pleasing with a charming soundtrack but at times seems to have the appearance (and depth) of a television commercial. \"The Girl on the bridge\" has a comical tone and its beguiling leads and exotic settings buoy the film making it a mostly enjoyable cinematic experience."
