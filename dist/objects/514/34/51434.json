        "Using a combination of live action with animation by Chuck Jones, director George Daugherty directs a lively interpretation of the classic symphonic tale \"Peter and the Wolf\" by Sergei Prokofiev. This affectionate interpretation brings together the classic story of Peter and his band of animal friends; a bird, a cat and duck who outwit the wiley wolf as they set off on an adventure together. This story is interwoven with live characters and brought to life by a real boy named Peter who discovers the power of imagination and the spirit of adventure. Starring Lloyd Bridges as Grandpa, Kirstie Alley as his daughter Annie, Ross Malinger as Peter (whose other film credits include: Sleepless in Seattle, Kindergarten Cop and Little Bigfoot). Other credits include: Narration by Kirstie Allen and Director of animation by Jean Flynn."
