        "Ultima Vez is a dance company formed by director, choreographer, actor and photographer Wim Vandekeybus in 1985. His style is high adrenaline with genuine sense of jeopardy and he draws his dance vocabulary from everyday movement. In creating this piece, Vandekeybus worked in close collaboration with composer David Byrne and with an all-male company. Poetic and passionate, the performance is a powerful and moving mix of movement, music, symbol, words and silence that explores the different tensions, responses, emotions and energy generated by the single-sex cast. This screen adaption of 'In Spite of Wishing and Wanting' based on the 1999 dance performance of the same name was shot in the atmospheric surroundings of a racetrack and at the beautiful ballroom-concert hall 'Vooruit Arts Center' in Ghent, Belgium.
