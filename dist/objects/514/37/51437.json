        "Two students at Tokyo University, the irresponsible Shubei and the ineffectual Aoki, set out to build up the university sumo club. They coopt a sad-sack, a drag wrestler and a foreigner who refuses to \"undress\" in the right way, to form a team to uphold the honour of the alma mater at the forthcoming wrestling tournament. Unorthodox methods are called for. They are aided in their prodigious training regime by Masako, the screen's first female sumo wrestler. To the familiar victory-against-all-odds theme is added an extra dimension-- a serious look at how the West has radically influenced traditional Japanese culture. Cast includes Masahiro Motoki, Misa Shimizu, Naoto Takenaka and Hiromasa Taguchi. In Japanese with English subtitles."
