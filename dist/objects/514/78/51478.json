        "Episode of Series \"Australian story (Television program)\". Caroline Jones introduces this episode of \"Australian story\" which looks at personal reconciliation in action as demonstrated by the relationship between Sue Blacklock and Beulah Adams, descendants of victim and perpetrator in the 1838 Myall Creek massacre. Researching into her family history, Beulah Adams discovered her great uncle was one of the perpetrators in a massacre that saw 28 Aborigines killed. Beulah talks candidly about her reaction to the news, and her experience at meeting Sue Blacklock, descendant of one of the two survivors at a conference on reconciliation convened by Reverend John Brown. Another descendant of the perpetrators, Des Blake, talks about his experience at attending the memorial's opening at Myall Creek in 2002, and how the experience has changed his life since then."
