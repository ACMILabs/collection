        "With the advent of the 21st century came the unstoppable global spread of English as the universal language. \"Beyond Babel\" explores the reasons behind this phenomenal growth through four separate programs: Trade, Culture, Politics, Future. In this third program the role of English is examined as a medium for international political and diplomatic discourse. Television news via satellite has created a global connection with English as the linking language. America's CNN was the first global television broadcaster and it was their philosophy (initiated by Ted Turner), to de-Americanise the language to appeal to an international audience. Discusses British colonization of America, followed by the mainly non-English speaking immigrants who formed linguistic ghettos in New York, to today where there has been a dramatic increase in Hispanic immigrants speaking mainly Spanish. A reactionary organization known as \"US English\" with the slogan \"English must be our official language\" is gathering in strength to an extent where there are 25 American States who have passed \"English only\" legislation. Comment is also made about the demise of the Native Americans whose culture and language was deliberately destroyed by white Americans leaving their cultural values eroded and the native language devastated. South Africa has eleven official languages - English being one of them and probably the most crucial in the fight against apartheid and the transition from the Afrikaner government to the ANC lead government. Black South Africans realised that English was a useful tool and medium for communication - it was a world language. The European Union has fifteen official languages which often creates problems for the translators during EU meetings. English has become the working language but there is also recognition that languages of identity need equal respect. Finally, a debate takes place in Kyoto, Japan, about the future and probable disappearance of many native languages. Narrated by Hugh Quarshie."
