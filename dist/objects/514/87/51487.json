        "Ultima Vez is a dance company formed by director, choreographer, actor and photographer Wim Vandekeybus in 1985. This dance video, made from the material of Vandekeybus' first three choreographies with the company, places these performances in the remarkable setting of a dilapidated Brussels cinema which had been abandoned for the past twenty years. Using a range of cinematic techniques, the film radiates a particular fascination of its own, transforming the theatrical energy of the stage choreography into a dynamic screen experience.
