        "While the sale of cigarettes has decreased significantly on the Western market, worldwide consumption of cigarettes has increased markedly since the push of tobacco giants R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris to export to Asia. Presented by the British current affairs team at \"First Tuesday,\" this program looks at the human cost of cigarette smoking and the war that is being waged between health and trade. Narrator Michael Crocker explains the relationship between advertising in Asia, cigarette sales and the incidence of cancer, brand stretching to bypass advertising bans and the role of government heavy weights in lobbying on behalf of the tobacco industry. Features interviews with cigarette models Janet Sackman and Wayne (Marlboro Man) McLaren, both of whom have earned notoriety for their role in cigarette advertising as well as cancer attributed to their nicotine addiction. Presented by Olivia O'Leary."
