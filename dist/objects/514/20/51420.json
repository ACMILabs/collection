    "description": [
        "A compilation of six animated cartoons starring the wacky Daffy Duck. Daffy has many sides to his personality and that's what makes him so lovable, you never quite know what to expect. See him as Duck Drake - Private Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat in \"The Super snooper\" or dress up as a rooster to win $5000 in the Best Rooster competition in \"You were never duckier\" or even feel a wee bit sorry for Daffy as he plays Bugs Bunny's double with great gusto only to find himself on the receiving end of disrespect from both Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. Henery Hawk and George K. Chickenhawk also feature in \"You were never duckier\" and Porky Pig guest stars in \"Daffy Duck hunt\", \"Golden yeggs\" and \"Dime to retire\"."
