        "Born Isadore Freleng in 1906 in Missouri (died 1995) but better known as Friz Freleng, this Academy Award winner cartoonist/animator joined Warner Bros studios as head animator in 1930 and it is here that he created the majority of his over 300 cartoons, mainly for Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes. His brand of humour and whacky cartoon characters are loved and adored world-wide and across all age groups. This video pays tribute to Freleng by showing eight of his more prominent and well-known cartoons mainly from the 1950s period and include those evergreen favourites Sylvester and Tweety, Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, and Speedy Gonzales. Three of the eight cartoons shown are Oscar winners: \"Birds anonymous\", \"Speedy Gonzales\" and \"Knighty knight Bugs\"."
