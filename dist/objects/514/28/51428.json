        "This video collection presents nine of the best of that wisecracking rooster, Foghorn Leghorn. For decades now his practical jokes and witty remarks have captivated audiences of all ages and it is his unique way of talking that makes Foghorn Leghorn stand out from the rest of the crowd. But where would Foghorn Leghorn be without his \"companions\" Henery Hawk and Barnyard Dog, both of who feature in this collection of cartoons. Suitable entertainment for all the family."
