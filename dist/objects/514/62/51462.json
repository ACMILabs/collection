        "A revealing look at four First Nations women artists in Canada, each from a different nation, who share their thoughts and opinions both as a Native American (or Aboriginal) and as an artist or creator. For each of these women the passing on of their culture, the teachings from their elders, the spiritual and the ceremonial traditions, is foremost and it is through their individual expressions of art that they are able to achieve this end. Doreen Jensen (Gitksan Indians): wood carver/designer, fascinated by totem poles and their significance in the Native American culture where family histories can be discovered by reading the totem poles. Through her printmaking, Doreen keeps her culture alive, educating others in the meaning of the artwork of the Northwest Coast. Rena Point Bolton (Stalo Indians): weaver of baskets, blankets and robes, Rena believes in passing on the teachings of her elders. Gentle and spiritual her beautifully crafted work is displayed in museums across the world. Joane Cardinal-Schubert (Blood Indians): painter and creator of installation art using multimedia combinations, Joane is confronting and political in her work, determined to educate the ignorant and redefine indigenous art to the outsider in order to keep her culture alive. Jane Ash Poitras (Chippewyan Indians): painter of sacred/spiritual works who loves to explore other worlds or realms in her creations. Believes in the spiritual healing of her art, the passing down of legends, the allowing of the outsider to pass through and experience those other worlds through her art. Evocative in vision and sound, this beautifully presented documentary includes black and white archival footage, personal narratives and portrayals of each woman's art."
