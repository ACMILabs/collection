        "Fraggle Rock was a very successful television series from 1983-1988 emanating from the producers of the much-loved Muppet Show but featuring a whole new cast of Jim Henson's muppets, including Doc and his dog Sprocket, furry little creatures called Fraggles who share their home Fraggle Rock with other even smaller creatures known as the Doozers and the giant Gorgs who like to think they rule Fraggle Rock. These wonderful characters all inhabit the magical fairy-tale world of Fraggle Rock where the most amazing things can and do happen. \"Fraggle songs\" successfully brings together through music and song, the lovable Fraggle Rock characters in a warm and highly amusing story designed to entertain the whole family, with original music and lyrics composed by Phillip Balsam and Dennis Lee."
