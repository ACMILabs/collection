        "Rennie, a middle-aged ex-teacher, now carer of people with Downs Syndrome, has come to believe that humane containment is all that can be hoped for. Pat Cannizzaro, a young idealistic social misfit, believes that intellectually disabled people have the right to full self-realisation through self-expression and social relationships. The film has been praised for its humanity and intelligence. It has also been condemned for its cynical recycling of stereotypes and failure to portray the real issues surrounding the treatment of the intellectually impaired. Cast includes Garry McDonald, Brian Vriends and Catherine McClements."
