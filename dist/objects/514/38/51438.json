        "In this reinterpretation of the Frankenstein myth, Whit Bissell plays Professor Frankenstein - a scientist obsessed by theories of transplanting organs, recreating humans out of discarded parts. A firm believer in experimental medicine Frankenstein plans to create a man, made up of parts from various cadavers. Despite the misgivings of his colleagues, Frankenstein perseveres with this plan, even when it entails killing off his curious fiancee. Conveniently, when a car crashes nearby and several teenagers die, Frankenstein eagerly steals a body thrown clear. From these methods then Professor Frankenstein assembles his creation - who turns out to be a monstrous variation of a man, with a perfect body but a mangled face and deranged mind. Feared and loathed, the monster starts to kill and maraud the innocent, until he turns on his creator. Notwithstanding the low production values and ham acting, this curious film holds a certain appeal as a display of 50s attitudes and paranoia, mixed with B-grade horror movie tropes. Cast includes: Phyllis Coates, Gary Conway, Robert Burton and George Lynn."
