        "The Spinning Wheels were an Australian band that played in the mid 60s. They were heavily influenced by early Rolling Stones and took to playing covers by Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry and Jimmy Reed. Their version of Muddy Water's 'Got my mojo working\" became a Top 10 Australian hit. Legendary radio disc jockey Stan 'The Man' Rofe said that the band paved the way for rock and roll's popularity in Melbourne. However, the band failed to release an album until the year 2000. This video shows The Spinning Wheels playing two sets at their album launch at the Melbourne rock and roll venue The Tote. The show was compared by Rofe and features an excellent set by garage rockers The Breadmakers. The sound quality is OK and the picture quality plain as it is only one camera, however, fans of The Spinning Wheels, The Breadmakers, and of early Australian rock and roll would find this video worth checking out. No production details available."
