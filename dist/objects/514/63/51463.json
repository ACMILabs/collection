        "Mieko Ouchi is an aspiring actress, half Celtic and half Japanese, who is cast in The War Between Us, a film on the World War II internment of 22,000 Japanese-Canadians, in the midst of researching her own documentary about this key episode in her own family's history. The program investigates questions of personal and cultural identity as Mieko discovers more and more about her past and her heritage as the filming progresses and the complex implications of hers and her family's struggle to come to terms with their sense of displacement in both Canadian and Japanese society. An autobiographical documentary as well as family chronicle, this documentary also elucidates a strained period in Japanese-Canadian history through the use of archival footage, interviews with the Ouchi family, dramatic re-enactments and excerpts from The War Between Us."
