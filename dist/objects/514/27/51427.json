        "The disturbing story of a brutal, serial sex murderer, his protective wife and a woman he has previously raped. The two women shield the criminal from the police, each feeling a perverse sense of loyalty to him, one due to marriage, the other because he once saved her life. Oshima presents a taut, intelligent, and visually spellbinding portrait of repression, victimisation, and guilt, using high contrast, frequent jump cuts, isolated framing, changing character perspective, and elliptical narrative to reflect the mental polarity and deviant behavior of an amoral predator. Cast includes Saeda Kawaguchi, Akiko Koyama, Kei Sato, Mutsuhiro Toura, Fumio Watanabe. In Japanese with English subtitles."
