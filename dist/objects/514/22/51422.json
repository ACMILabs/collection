        "Shaun (Kane McNay) is a fifteen year old living in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. His mother (Nell Feeney) refuses to grow up, his father is in prison, and Shaun himself is in and out of foster care. For Shaun, going through the emotional and physical effects of adolescence, his only escape is hanging out at the local mall. Though \"Mallboy\" doesn't shy away from a gritty examination of working class and unemployed lives in contemporary urban Australia, it also manages to find great humour and compassion in Shaun's relationships with friends and family. This realist Australian film, the debut feature by Melbourne musician Giarrusso (who is a member of the Underground Lovers), is influenced by both Italian neo-realism and the socialist humanism of English filmmakers such as Ken Loach and Mike Leigh. Kane McNay won a special youth award at the 2001 AFI Awards. The sound design is by Philip Brophy."
