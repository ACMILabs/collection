        "Based on a true story, this beautifully presented and directed suspenseful drama tells the bizarre tale of Guan Jing a young man who one day walks into his local police station and demands an investigation into the death of his father, who he believes was murdered by his mother 10 years earlier. Guan Jing is at first met with an amount of scepticism by the Captain of Police but gradually the Captain finds himself drawn into this story of intrigue and betrayal. Using flashbacks the audience is taken on a journey of discovery into the lives and emotions of Guan Jing, his mother and his father, superbly played by Tao Chung Wah, Si Ching Gao Wa and Ma Jing Wu respectively. The film does moves slowly, but the atmospheric cinematography of blues and misty whites, combined with an intense and involved story of murder, passion and family relationships will keep you fascinated to the end. Cinematography by Ho Yung. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
