        "A combination of animation, live action scenes and orchestral music (conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas) provides an entertaining musical fantasy of composer Camille Saint-Saens' classical composition \"Carnival of the animals\". This is a salute to feathers, furs and fins most ably performed and co-hosted by everybody's favourite cartoon twosome, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. These wacky virtuoso display their wonderful stage talents by performing a piano duo (pianists Zita Carno, Kathryn Ando) and reciting some rather quirky poetry (courtesy of Ogden Nash) to illustrate the various carnival of animals, including lions, roosters, hens, kangaroos, and elephants. Contains an amalgamation of colourful and lively use of various animation styles. Voice characterisations by Mel Blanc."
