    "description": [
        "This is a tribute collection of classic cartoons dedicated to the remarkable voice of Mel Blanc. He was the voice of so many well known cartoon characters including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Pepe Le Pew, Yosemite Sam, Tweety and Sylvester and each of these selected cartoons features at least one of Mel Blanc's characterisations. Interestingly, the dialogue was recorded before the animators did their work meaning that Mel Blanc had to imagine and create the action from a series of sketches. This is no mean feat and requires a lot of skill and energy. Mel Blanc died in 1989 but his voice lives on in the much-loved Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons which are still showing around the world today. Suitable viewing for all the family."
