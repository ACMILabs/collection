        "From the video game \"Tomb raider\" comes the first live action film, featuring heroine (and internet icon) Lara Croft. Lady Croft is an aristocrat who enjoys breaking the rules and shocking her peers by subverting her femininity. She is astute, athletic, a talented sharpshooter, an authority on archaeology and a dextrous woman who misses her daddy. Lara discovers an ancient clock that (when combined with its missing pieces) is able to control time. It is up to Lara to destroy the clock and prevent its power from falling to the Illuminati - a secret society that aims to harness this mystic force perpetuated by a rare planetary alignment that occurs every 5000 years. The film is a modern mix of digital effects and live action sequences filmed at various exotic locations including Cambodia and Iceland. Jolie certainly looks the part with her large bosom and lithe physique, but her performance is decidedly clunky and heavy handed. Paying a huge debt to Indiana Jones, \"Lara Croft\" is steeped in a faux mysticism (intriguing given that most characters are either killing, maiming or at the very least destroying ancient tombs) but despite its flaws still manages to achieve a certain level of escapist fun."
