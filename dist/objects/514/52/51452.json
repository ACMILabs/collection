        "Steven Spielberg's heartwarming masterpiece of love between a young boy and a visitor from another planet has quickly become one of the most popular films of all time. Filled with magic and imagination, it made audiences around the world laugh and cry. Follows the story of a lost alien who befriends a 10 year old boy named Elliott. While E.T. learns about life on Earth, Elliott learns that friendship knows no earthly bounds. Overflowing with memorable performances, a stirring musical score by John Williams, its scenes of wonderment invite everyone to share the thrill of its magic. Cast includes Dee Wallace, Peter Coyote, Drew Barrymore and Henry Thomas as Elliott. Spielberg corrected certain scenes on the 20th anniversary edition with visual (computer assisted) improvement."
