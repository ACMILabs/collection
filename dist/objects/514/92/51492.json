        "With the advent of the 21st century came the unstoppable global spread of English as the universal language. \"Beyond Babel\" explores the reasons behind this phenomenal growth through four separate programs: Trade, Culture, Politics, Future. In this first program, we see the effects of globalisation and international trade on such countries as China, India, Africa and South Africa and how the English language has become a link to the outside world for the poorer nations. In recognition of the power of the English language, many non-English speaking countries are teaching English as a second language to their school children in order to help in advancing their careers, particularly in Africa and India. Shows examples of the power of global brands (American), i.e. Coca-Cola, Levis, McDonalds and how English unifies the corporate business on an international level, particularly in the recruitment of staff - all staff, whether in China, India, Africa, are required to speak some level of English. The question is asked, \"has English banished nationhood in favour of global branding?\". The dominance of English in the financial markets where words or \"mainstream jargon\" cross all international boundaries and globalisation equals connectivity, the subject of dependence by world businesses on the lingua franca of international business English is discussed. Narrated by Hugh Quarshie."
