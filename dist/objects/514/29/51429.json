        "A feature length film containing some of Friz Freleng's award winning cartoons starring those wonderful cartoon character creations of Freleng's including Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, Pepe Le Pew, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, Tweety Pie and Sylvester. The film is presented as part of an Award Ceremony honouring the classic Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes characters beginning with Bugs Bunny in an Academy Award winning cartoon short \"Knighty knight Bugs\". The program is then divided into three acts: Act I - \"Satan's waitin'\" starring Yosemite Sam; Act II - \"The Unmentionables\" starring Bugs Bunny as Elegant Ness, co-starring Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety Pie and Sylvester along with the notorious Rocky and his gang; Act III - The Oswald Awards hosted by Bugs Bunny (a take on the Academy Awards) showing cartoon highlights of the nominees in their starring performances, including Big Bad Wolf and the Three little bops. Classic cartoons, great family entertainment. Majority of voice characterisations by Mel Blanc."
