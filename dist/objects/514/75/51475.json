        "Two women, Fereshteh (Niki Karimi) and Roya (Marila Zare'i) become friends while studying at Tehran University. There's a cloud of doubt over whether the university will stay open however, there's rioting, and Fereshteh fears her future plans to become educated and enlightened will not eventuate. One day she is approached by a girl at university who wants to introduce her to Ahmad, a potential husband, she's also being harassed by a man who follows her around campus and insists he is in love with her. One day the man sees her with her cousin and, believing him to be her lover, throws acid on him. Fereshteh is unfairly blamed for the incident and her father demands she leave university and return home. An unfortunate accident removes her harasser when he is sent to jail, but Fereshteh is held to blame also and is bailed out by Ahmad, her life and family honour indebted to him due to his financial assistance. Milani's fifth film is an accomplished piece about a woman stifled in her attempt at liberation by a trinity involving her father, her husband, and a stranger. In Farsi with English subtitles."
