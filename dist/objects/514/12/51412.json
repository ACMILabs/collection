        "An only child receives a change of lifestyle when his father builds a golf course at the place where it all started, Scotland. Young Tony (Jonathan Lipnicki) is bullied at school, has a recurring dream about vampires and is miserable and without friends. His dreams prove founded when he is visited by a young boy from his dreams who turns out to be a vampire. Weak and unable to fly, Rudolph is taken care of by Tony who cares for the ailing bloodsucker and the two become friends. Tony educates Rudolph (Rollo Weeks) in the mores of life in the 21st century and Rudolph shares his life story - his family, the Sackville-Baggs are part of a vampire community cursed as lost souls until a powerful amulet can be restored to lift the curse. Tony joins the quest, even though it will mean losing the circle of friends he has found in the process. Based on the novels by Angela Sommer-Bodenburg. Cast also includes Richard E Grant, Jim Carter, Alice Krige and Anna Popplewell."
