        "A compilation of the complete series of Ludovic, an animated classic about a young teddybear. In \"Snow Gift\", Ludovic watches the snow outside the thatched cottage in which he lives with his family and dreams of tobogganing with his friends. His parents tell him he is too little, and Ludovic feels lonely, so he invents wonderful games to share with his new found friend, a doll that came to life. In \"A Crocodile in my Garden\", Ludovic organises his origami jungle animals to go on a spring picnic in his garden. The mood degenerates as the animals disobey Ludovic and fight but all is resolved happily when cookies are distributed and the animals learn to share. In \"Visiting Grandpa\" Ludovic spends the afternoon with Grandpa on the farm, tending the animals and the garden, and though they miss grandma very much they find that her magic is still around. In \"Magic in the Air\" Ludovic happily plays in the playground when another teddy tries to befriend him, or so he thinks until he is knocked to the ground. Ludovic is rescued by a smiling girl teddy. Ludovic and his new friend find ways to out-smart the bully. The leaves, the trees and even the sand castle help out and soon the bully leaves him alone. But the magic doesn't stop there and soon it is used to help cheer up the mad and sad bully. Each episode is also available as separate titles."
