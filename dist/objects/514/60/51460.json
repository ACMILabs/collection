        "Clone Inc is a critical documentary which discusses the issues of human reproductive technology, particularly the cloning of embryos, and its scientific, psychological and philosophical implications. In its focus on the advocates of human cloning, such as Clone Rights United Front and the religious cult with visions of duplicating their leader's genes, the Raelians, the program raises numerous questions about the narcissistic fantasies of these groups. Through interviews with and discussions between, among others, biologists, geneticists, a psychoanalyst, and a philosopher the ethical issues crucial to the cloning debate are outlined. The rapid progress of the technology, and the experiments that have already taken place, is also critically engaged with as notions related to a breakdown between the sexes and generational differences, parent-child bond complications and the blurring of individual identities as well as time that are potentially affected by human cloning are posed and debated. In French with English subtitles."
