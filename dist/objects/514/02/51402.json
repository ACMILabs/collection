        "Gloria turns to prostitution to support her alcohol addiction after her bullfighter husband is seriously injured. We first see Gloria on the job for a group of Mexican money launderers. Things go awry when one of the clients, an undercover DEA agent is murdered. Gloria is the only witness, and after a pique of generosity, is handed a list of contacts in Spain. Eventually deported, Gloria returns to Madrid, contacts in hand, to the home of her mother-in-law and invalid husband determined to start a new life but is pursued by one of the hitmen. An interesting subplot involves his daughter's illness exacerbated by her father's profession, seemingly as an act of God. Hailed as a Spanish \"Pulp fiction\", \"Nobody will speak of us when we're dead\" received the 1995 Goya Award for Best Picture. In Spanish with English subtitles. Cast includes: Victoria Abril, Pilar Bardem, Federico Luppi"
