        "Chuck Jones has completely turned around the classic Mark Twain story and created his own wonderful world of chaos and mayhem in Camelot for this television special of \"Bugs Bunny in King Arthur's Court\" (aka \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\"). The plot is basically the same but of course there are many new twists and the characters take on their very own familiar personalities including Daffy Duck as King Arthur, Yosemite Sam as the scheming Black Knight, Merlin of Monroe, Porky Pig as the bumbling Sir Loin of Pork and Elmer Fudd as the dragon-hating (or wabbit-hating) Sir Elmer of Fudde. King Arthur's Court and the Round Table will never be quite the same again with the arrival of Bugges Bunnye of Carrot Patchville, USA. This is a very clever and witty interpretation of the original story \"produced, directed and plagiarized by Chuck Jones\"."
