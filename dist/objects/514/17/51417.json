        "The unbelievably true story of Professor Leon Theremin (1896-1993), creator of the theremin - an electronic musical instrument played by moving the hands near its two antennas. Living in New York, Theremin was celebrated for his invention before being kidnapped in the 1930s by Russian secret service agents. A Russian by birth, Theremin was tried for treason, and sent to a gulag or labour camp in Siberia. At the outset of World War II, Theremin's talents became valuable to the Russians as an originator of surveillance devices - he went on to create the first 'bug', winning the Stalin Prize. The theremin, which predated the synthesiser in terms of electronic sound, can be heard on the Beach Boys classic \"Good vibrations\" and was also utilised in the soundtracks of \"Spellbound\" and \"The Day the earth stood still\". Used extensively in science fiction, the sound of the theremin often denotes an altered state of mind. Clara Rockmore, a theremin virtuoso and close friend of the inventor, reminisces about her experiences, displaying her mastery on the instrument. Features an extensive interview with Theremin, just prior to his death, discussing his life and work. Other interviews include Todd Rundgren, Brian Wilson and Robert Moog. With occasional English subtitles."
