        "This decidedly offbeat romantic comedy starring and directed by Maurizio Nichetti (The Icicle thief) blends live-action with animation. Nichetti plays a bumbling sound technician who combs Milan in search of interesting sounds which he uses when dubbing vintage Disney cartoons with new Italian-language soundtracks. One day he meets Martina (Angela Finocchiaro), a call-girl with a kinky clientele, who like Maurizio, is completely absorbed in catering to the fantasies and illusions of others. Both hopelessly romantic and lonely, they begin a relationship. Yet just as love is blossoming Maurizo's body undergoes a strange transformation - his hands change from human flesh to bright yellow animation. Eventually he becomes completely animated while remaining true to his flesh and blood self, a development that does wonders for the couple's relationship. Totally unpredictable and consistently witty, this movie features highly inventive visual gags. In Italian with English subtitles."
