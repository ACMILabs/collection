        "Mima is a French teenager living amid her loving extended family in rural France. Among these beautiful surrounds, she finds herself culturally conflicted, especially as her Italian grandfather has strong ties to Calabria. One day however her bucolic existence is shattered when her beloved grandfather is taken away by two mysterious men (Mafiosi) and never returns. Having witnessed the abduction, Mima is capable of identifying the killers, but is mute on the matter, fearing for her family's lives. Mima is also pressurised to maintain her silence by her father's killers and their cohorts, who are aware of her knowledge. Set in 1966, \"Mima\" is a beautifully rendered nostalgia and coming-of-age piece about identity, cultural displacement, family, and belonging. Existing between the worlds of children and adults, Mima can feel the demands of womanhood bearing down upon her as she is forced to make some alarming choices. Cast includes Virginie Ledoyen, Nino Manfredi, Margarita Lozano, Vittoria Scognamiglio and Patrick Bouchitey. In French with English subtitles."
