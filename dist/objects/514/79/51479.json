        "This ecologically-themed animated epic was the highest grossing film in Japanese film history at the time of its release. Set in the 14th century, a time when industry and firearms were introduced to feudal Japan, the story centres on Ashitka, a young warrior who, after being afflicted by a deadly curse whilst defending his village against an unknown demon, sets out to find a cure. On his journey he encounters industrialists who are damaging the nearby forest but creating employment, and forest dwellers and spirits who wish to protect their environment. Torn between his allegiances to each side, Ashitka must negotiate a middle-way between the two groups in order to avoid an all-out war. Refusing to reduce a complex problem to a simplistic opposition between good and evil, the film explores in depth the dilemma of balancing human needs with ecological preservation. Miyazaki is revered in Japan and overseas as one of the greatest artists of contemporary animation. Voices: Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, Jada Pinkett-Smith, John de Mita."
