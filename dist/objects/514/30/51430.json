        "After the death of his father, Luo returns home to his village to help his mother with funeral arrangements. On his arrival he learns of his mother's wish for a traditional burial for his father - something that has not been performed in the village for hundreds of years and a costly and exhausting ceremony. Flashbacks recount how Luo's mother and father met, after his father was posted as a young teacher to the village school, and the hurdles that stood in the way of their blossoming romance and kept them apart. Recounted as a fable, this love story explores universal themes of undying longing and hope against a lushly photographed backdrop of rural China through the seasons. Though much of Yimou's earlier work was equally as lush visually, \"The Road home\" has been criticised for its overt sentimentality, an effect emphasised by San Bao's romantic score. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
