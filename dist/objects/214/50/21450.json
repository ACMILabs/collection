        "Romantic Spain, warm with life and colour is the subject of this film. We see different aspects of its life - a hardworking farmer, a fisherman, a lady from Granada. The names themselves are evocative - Seville, seen at carnival time, the religious pageants in Malaga, Madrid with its new hotels and shops, the Costa Brava - and bull-fighting."
