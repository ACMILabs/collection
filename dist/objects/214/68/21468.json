        "A survey of the Welsh artist Ceri Richards' poetic, abstract works based on Debussy's theme of the submerged Cathedral of Ys. The sound of its chanting bells are heard rising from the depths of the sea on days of special calm. The legend of bells tolling beneath the waves is common to both Wales and Brittany, and Debussy's theme has haunted the artist's mind since his childhood on the Gower Peninsular."
