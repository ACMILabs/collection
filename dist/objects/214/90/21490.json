        "Illustrates how underground water is constantly changing our earth. We see the results of its action in limestone regions where underground water has dissolved out large caverns. In a few areas we see spectacular hot springs and geysers, created when volcanic rock heats water under the ground. Filmed with the co-operation of Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Sequoia National Park and Yellowstone National Park."
