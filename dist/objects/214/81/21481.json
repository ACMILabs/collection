        "A typical day in the life of a Central Australian stockman. Breaking camp in the early morning, saddling up a fresh horse and mustering half-wild cattle into a mob for sorting, counting and branding. The aboriginal stockmen are particularly adept. At the end of the day the cattle are turned loose and wander back to their familiar ground. Music by Isador Goodman."
