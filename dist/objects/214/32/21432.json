        "The introduction of new methods and materials is revolutionizing the British carpet industry. One of the most important of these developments lies in the use of Bri-nylon X-21, a continuous filament bulked nylon yarn, on new tufting machinery to produce an article quite different from the traditional woven carpet. Describes the manufacture of these carpets and emphasises their hard wearing qualities and the ease with which they can be cleaned."
