        "An animated fable without words starring some Gothic characters - witches, cloaked riders and the like - in a tale about the hungry natural world. Here the artist plays cat's cradle with ideas, especially the notion that one thing leads to another and lives from another; he supports the action with a witch's brew of sounds.
