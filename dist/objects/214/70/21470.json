        "A probing study of the effects of television particularly in the political life of nations. Today politicians are becoming fascinated, repelled, intrigued or perhaps frightened, by the political possibilities of television. The candidate's success no longer depends on their effectiveness at the door, or in the rented hall. Far more important is their \"image\" on the voter's TV screen. What is television doing to the political scene? Does it convey ideas or just personalities? Is it educating or deceiving the electorate? The film discusses these questions. Examples from Britain, USA and Canada are used to show how effective the marriage of television and politics has been."
