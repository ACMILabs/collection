        "Episode of Series \"Plastering\". One of a series of four films which gives a basic training in plastering as applied to building construction. The use of expanded metal lathing is demonstrated and the way in which the plaster adheres to it. Three coats are applied, render, float and set. The making of dots and screeds is shown. Before the final coat is applied the cornice is run. The method of cutting the mould for this and the addition of horse and handle is shown. Screeds and running rule are fitted in position and the cornice is run. Finally, the finishing coat is applied to the ceiling."
