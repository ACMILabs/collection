        "A light, humorous look at the motor car and the great North American itch for a place on the road. From the comparative peace of Honest Joe's used-car lot, this film hurries you onto our public speedways, where hot rubber erases any distance between all points. Slow-motion and pop-on-pop photography make this a provocative, revealing study of motormania unlimited."
