        "Under the guidance of a consultant, a foundry adopts numerous materials-handling devices; as a result of speeding the flow of castings from one point to another and using now redundant labourers on productive semi-skilled tasks, output increased by 20%. Although mainly concerned with the re-conversion of one factory, the film shows a wide range of materials-handling methods in other industries, including the use of cranes, lifting blocks, runways, conveyors, unit loads, palletization etc."
