        "This film is one of Lotte Reiniger's early films which can be described as a short pastiche on the opera story, in black and white silhouettes. The story is about Carmen, who entices the soldier Don Jose to the gypsy encampment where she steals his clothes. Disgraced and ashamed, Don Jose follows Carmen to a bullfight, but she escapes into the bullring and is carried triumphantly around the ring on the back of the bull. Designed and animated by Lotte Reiniger with music by Bizet."
