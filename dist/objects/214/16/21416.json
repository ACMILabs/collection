        "This film emphasizes the positive aspects of work in bricklaying. As in most career films the less-favourable side of the work is omitted. Bricklayers are shown learning the trade, and the application of bricklaying skills is depicted in various constructions including ornamental brickwork, arches, and brickwork in high-rise buildings. Suitable for secondary school level."
