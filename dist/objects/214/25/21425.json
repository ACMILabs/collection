        "Carl Milles was perhaps one of Sweden's most famous sculptors. After a survey of the artist - including some unique scenes of his early works, the film takes us on a tour of the Millesgarden where a number of his works are displayed. Following his death, Millesgarden was donated to the State and is now one of Stockholm's most frequented museums."
