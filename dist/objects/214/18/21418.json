        "This segment, produced as part of 'The March of Time' newsreel and documentary series, provides general career advice for young women in post-WWII America. The suggested career paths are reflective of the late 1940s, focusing on areas such as office work, nursing, fashion and retail. But rather than restrict the options to these areas, career advancement and less traditional career paths, like science and medicine, are addressed. Pointers on how to find a job matched to your personality are interspersed with successful women in each particular field. 'The March of Time' series was produced between 1935 and 1951 and, whilst a very popular series, failed to make money due to high production costs."
