        "One of a group of four films which look at various species of native trees growing on Stradbroke Island, Queensland. This film is about a species of pine tree called Casuarina Equisetifolia. Groves of these graceful trees grow on the rocky slopes above the ocean where cicadas hum in their branches and the long clusters of Casuarina needles shimmer silver and black in the breeze. The film follows the development of the small cones. The song of the small brown Honey-eater is heard on the sound track mixed in with the sound of a solo flute. Music performed by Nancy Tow."
