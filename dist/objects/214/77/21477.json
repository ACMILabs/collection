        "A dramatic account of road trains in outback Australia. Each year thousands of cattle are moved from the great cattle properties of north-west Australia to the railhead for shipment to southern and overseas markets. Today this journey is carried out as a round-the-clock enterprise operating 48 ton road trains over the tracks where drovers once rode for weeks at a time. Typical is the trail from Anna Plains to Meekatharra - the longest overland road haul of its type in Australia. (Diploma of Merit, 1962 Melbourne Film Festival)."
