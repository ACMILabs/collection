        "A colorful record of Quebec City's winter carnival - with all the fun and frolic of a southern Mardi Gras but in gleaming winter setting. Fine examples of snow sculpture, pageants, parades, sporting events, a torch-light parade on skis, folk dancing and fireworks, fill three weeks of festivities and pay due respect to King Winter."
