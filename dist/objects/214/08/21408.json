        "A typical day at St. Christopher's Home for the Children of Railwaymen, at Derby. This establishment cares for children whose parents work in transport but are unable for some reason to provide a proper home for them. How the staff of the Home look after the well-being of the children and provide the family atmosphere and individual interest which are so badly needed by the homeless child."
