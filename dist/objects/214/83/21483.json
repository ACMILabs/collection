        "Explores and illustrates the economic issues as well as the human motivations behind the act of shoplifting: the desire for adventure; plain boredom; a feeling of alienation or a need to conform. The film does more than direct attention to the scope and social consequences of shoplifting. It focuses on the greatest need to examine our individual understanding of ethics and morality, and to avoid the near occasions of self-indulgence in theft."
