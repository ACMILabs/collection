        "Carthage was once a maritime city open to the whole of the ancient world, today it is a suburb of Tunis but one has only to dig beneath the asphalt of any part of modern Carthage, to find extensive remains of the ancient city. Several missions are today making excavations in various areas in the hope of saving the stones and the mosaics."
