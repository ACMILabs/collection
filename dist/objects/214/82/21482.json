        "This film is about cats - actually, one very clever cat. The title is a play on the French \"quatuor\" meaning quartet, but the chorus is not the usual alley cat variety. The cat in this film is talented indeed. It is both pianist and piano, trumpet and trumpeter, and, if need be, even becomes the music - a pulsing rock and roll - or a whole swarm of alley cats. Award: Madrid"
