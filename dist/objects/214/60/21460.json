        "Catamarans, those sailing craft originating from the Pacific with two slender hulls spread apart to give high sail-carrying and stability, have become very popular in England. David Lutyens commentates the film which shows various types of this boat, from the simplest model to the sixty-three foot long passenger craft, and ends with shots of a Catamaran Regatta."
