        "One of 6 works created in 2003 by community artist Malcolm McKinnon specifically for the MAP project. Each of the works focuses on a different aspect of memory and identity in the Wimmera/Mallee region. Ian Darling and Doug McColl have each practised pharmacy for over forty years in the Warracknabeal district. In this film they recall the era when most drugs were hand-made on the premises, generally from raw materials. Ian also tells of the mysterious medicine jar labelled 'ADT' and of an old-fashioned coin-operated machine for a self administered electric shock."
