        "One of 6 works created in 2003 by community artist Malcolm McKinnon specifically for the MAP project. Each of the 6 works focuses on a different aspect of memory and identity in the Wimmera/Mallee region. Allan Vaughan tells the story of a funny looking stuffed kangaroo housed at the Murtoa museum. He recalls how, as a child, he used to visit the kangaroo when it was a pet belonging to his uncle. He tells how his uncle used to box with this kangaroo and also relates the story of how the animal came to end up as a taxidermic display."
