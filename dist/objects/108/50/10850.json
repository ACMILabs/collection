        "One of 6 works created in 2003 by community artist Malcolm McKinnon specifically for the MAP project. Each of the 6 works focuses on a different aspect of memory and identity in the Wimmera/Mallee region. Ian Fisher was a champion jockey in north west Victoria in the 1930s and '40s. In this film he and his brother Trenfield recall the tracks they raced on across this region, most of which have now disappeared. Standing on the site of the old Rainbow racecourse, Ian tells the story of winning the Rainbow Cup in 1937 and remembers the people who \"made racing\" in that era."
