    "description": [
        "One of 6 works selected by AIM director David Atkinson as representing the best interactive work produced by the AIM centre up until 2004. A wickedly humorous but thoughtful work. Very rich in content demonstrating how animation and interactivity can work seamlessly together. \" Explore the culture and contradictions of Japan. View beautiful woodblock prints in motion, select a haiku. Look into the personal profiles of typical Japanese citizens. Make your own haiku! Loads of fun for the culturally wise or just plain curious. Recommended by four sumo wrestlers out of ten. Basic Japanese and English phrases throughout.\""
