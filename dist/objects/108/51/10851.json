        "One of 6 works created in 2003 by community artist Malcolm McKinnon specifically for the MAP project. Each of the 6 works focuses on a different aspect of memory and identity in the Wimmera/Mallee region. The late Don Wurfel was a farmer with an unusually keen interest in wheat breeding and the trialing of new crops for improved yields. Part of his legacy is an amazing collection of over 1500 grain varieties, most of which are housed at Wheatlands museum in Warracknabeal. In this film, Don's son Ian talks about his father's obsessive interest in new grain varieties and explains the importance of crop trialing for dryland farmers."
