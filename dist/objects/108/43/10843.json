        "Ten anonymous individual stories by young secondary school students produced in-house for Memory Grid Digital Diaries. Works produced from the digital diaires program collected at the discretion of the program coordiantors. all submissions are anonymous. The Digital Diary project asks a diverse range of young people to share a personal story as they connect memories by way of simple moving images. Participants in the workshops look at one 'moment' in their lives and, concentrating on the simplicity and power of that one moment in time, they create a 'lo-fi' video work that speaks to the mind and heart. The story is then burnt to a CD (or put onto VHS) for the participants to keep, and the monologues become part of a specially curated database which, with the participant's permission, is later screened at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image at Federation Square."
