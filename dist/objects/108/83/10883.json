        "Recounts the story of Matthew Flinder's circumnavigation around Australia, his trials across the Tasman, involvement with the Nagarrindjeri tribe and his encounters with a French explorer.  The Aboriginal people clash with these \"white ghosts\".  On his way home to England, Flinders is imprisoned in Mauritius and his prized cat, Trim is killed.  A decade later, Flinders returns home to his family.  Meanwhile, the violence upon Aboriginal sacred lands continues.  An animated short entered to \"Create a Stamp Story\" section of ACMI's 'Screen It' media making competition for Primary Schools."
