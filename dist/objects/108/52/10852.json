        "One of 6 works created in 2003 by community artist Malcolm McKinnon specifically for the MAP project. Each of the 6 works focuses on a different aspect of memory and identity in the Wimmera/Mallee region. Lanz Bulldog tractors have been a big part of life in the Bolwell family since the 1930's. Tim Bolwell has inherited his father's collection of almost 30 Bulldog tractors, as well as an encyclopedic knowledge of the history and mechanics of these unusual machines. In this film, Tim explains the attraction of the Bulldog and its historical importance for many farmers in the Wimmera region."
