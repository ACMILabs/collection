        "A mother does what has to be done to help her daughter - even if it means returning from the grave. A retelling of a traditional folktale (Grimm's 'Ashputtle' as reworked by Angela Carter). Ashputtle is an unloved, uncared for and barely human child until her dead mother rises from the grave to look after her. It is a beautifully cut-out animation that explores themes of identity, responsibility, disintegration and transformation, in a bold and vibrant visual style."
