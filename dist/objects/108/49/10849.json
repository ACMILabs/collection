        "One of 6 works created in 2003 by community artist Malcolm McKinnon specifically for the MAP project. Each of the 6 works focuses on a different aspect of memory and identity in the Wimmera/Mallee region. The Coromby Brass Band is a group of farmers who come together every Monday night to practice in a draughty hall beside the wheat silos on a back road outside the small town of Murtoa. Formed in 1891, the band is the oldest continuously active brass band in Australia. Many members have been involved for decades - in some cases, their fathers and grandfathers played in the band before them. In this film, members of the band talk about what keeps them turning up at the hall \"every Monday night\"."
