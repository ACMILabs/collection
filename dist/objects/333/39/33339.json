        "Juxtaposing the views of those who don't want unions and those who do, this film examines new management techniques that have led to a steady decrease in unionization and an increase in union-free work environments. The film features portions of a lecture given by Charles Hughes, American management consultant and North American guru of the union-free model, whose Long-Range Maintenance Model has been widely adopted. As can be seen in the film, present-day management techniques are much more subtle and sophisticated than the goon squad union-busting activities that once made headlines."
