        "During an expedition to Antarctica in 1912, Mawson's two companions perished leaving him, ill and weak, to struggle back alone to a base camp at Commonwealth Bay. A reconstruction of the tragic expedition is the pivot of the documentary, which also includes interviews with the explorer-scientist's daughters, contemporaries and students."
