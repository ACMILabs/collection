        "A humorous fantasy about a little boy's tricycle which is mistakenly picked up by garbage collectors and taken to the tip. However, the tricycle mysteriously takes on a personality and a will of its own, escapes from the tip and returns to its owner - but not before having aroused the suspicion of the garbage collectors and the police road patrol. Based on the book by Bruce McNillan."
