        "Examines rape from the rapist's point of view. Interviews with convicted rapists in penitentiaries and psychiatric hospitals are combined with analysis by experts in the legal and law enforcement professions. Two groups of rapists are represented; those who knew their victims and those who did not. They discuss their feelings and motivations at the time of committing the offences. A victim of rape talks of her struggle against her assailants and the role played in this issue by the advertising and media industries."
