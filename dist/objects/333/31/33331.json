        "In this Gilles Carle feature documentary on the game of chess, the international chess match is cast as a classic Western shoot-out. Three chess greats dominate the film: Russia's Anatoly Karpov; Victor Korchnoi, a Russian defector; and American Bobby Fischer. Chess aficionados Camille Coudari and Fernando Arrabal analyse the personalities and strategies of the players and comment on the interplay of politics and chess. Voice and narration by Bondfield Marcoux; editing by Yves Leduc; photography by Pierre Letarte, Thomas Vamos. (Awards: Montreal; San Francisco)"
