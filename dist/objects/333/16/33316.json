        "A stirring history of three women's experience in labor organisation in Chicago in the 1930's, told through interviews, interspersed with archival newsreels and period photographs of stop-work meetings, working conditions, picket lines and fights with the police. Raises issues surrounding sexism and racism in union organising. The three women are Kate Hyndman, Stella Nowicki and Sylvia Woods. Based on the book entitled \"Rank and File\" by Alice Lynd."
