        "Written and presented by Professor David Bellamy, botanist and ecologist who visited the southwest Tasmanian wilderness area to make a personal stand against the establishment of the Franklin/Gordon hydroelectric scheme, outlining what would be lost if the scheme goes ahead. The film shows his visit to the area by boat, his arrest for trespassing and his subsequent release after a three day hunger strike Includes rare footage of the Tasmanian Tiger (Thylacine) - last species seen in Hobart Zoo in 1933. Note: Linda and Paul McCartney donated their song \"Wildlife\"."
