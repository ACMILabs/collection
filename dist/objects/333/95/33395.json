        "Investigates the reasons for the Dame's enduring hold on the audience's imagination. It examines her function as an outrageous and aggressive parody of female behaviour and the changes in portrayal corresponding with changing social attitudes to women and sexuality. Above all the program attempts to discover why we laugh at her. Cast includes Arthur Askey, George Lacy, Duggie Byng, Paul Laidlaw, Terry Scott, Ian Evans, Jack Tripp, Victoria Wood and John Morley."
