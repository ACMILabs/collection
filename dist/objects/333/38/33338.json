        "Episode of Series \"The Big ice: views of Antarctica\". The Antarctic continent is a unique natural laboratory for the study of simple life forms, and of physical and behavioural adaptations to inhospitable surroundings. The ocean surrounding Antarctica also has the world's greatest untrapped food supply. The film asks whether controlled exploitation and development can take place without upsetting the delicate balance of nature."
