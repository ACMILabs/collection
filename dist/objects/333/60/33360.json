        "An old Scottish song story richly illustrated by film animator Evelyn Lambart and sung by Derek Lamb to lute accompaniment. The story is about a handsome frog who courts and wins a mouse for his bride. The colourful animation does full justice to the events that take place during and after the wedding breakfast. (Award: New York.)"
