        "Pete Standing Alone is a Blood Indian who, as a young man, was more at home in the White man's culture than his own. However, confronted with the realisation that his children knew very little about their origins, he became determined to pass down to them the customs and traditions of his ancestors. This hour-long film is the powerful biographical study of a twenty-five-year span in Pete's life, from his early days as an oil-rig roughneck, rodeo rider and cowboy, to the present as an Indian concerned with preserving his tribe's spiritual heritage in the face of an energy-oriented industrial age. Includes footage of a traditional headdress and saddle being presented to Prince Charles. Photographed by Douglas Kiefer and Ernest McNabb. Edited by Tom Daly. Music by Eldon Rathburn. Sound by Bev Davidson, Claude Hazanavicius and John Knight (Awards: San Antonio, Vancouver)"
