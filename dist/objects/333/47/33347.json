        "A collaborative micro-cinema curiosity from the declining years of the Zagreb animation studio. An animated sarcastic response to the current political situation in the world. The film has no commentary but a musical accompaniment. This is another of the Zagreb Studio's hallucinatory premonitions of the Yugoslav Republic's trip to hell in a handbag."
