        "The top of a ten-meter diving tower is no place for cowards, according to Jim Lambie, the vociferous coach of two of Canada's top female divers, Janet Nutter and Linda Cuthbert. In this film we see what goes into making a champion performer and the complete faith and loyalty the athletes have towards Lambie despite his brusque manner. A highlight of the film is the close diving competition at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton."
