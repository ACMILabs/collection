        "Examines discrimination against lesbians and gay men, challenging some of society's attitudes towards homosexuality in the process. Also looks at historical patterns of racial, religious, political and sexual persecution. Historical photographs, prints, engravings and archival film, including footage from Nazi Germany and the 1954 McCarthy trials, have been incorporated in this powerful documentary. During the middle ages pink triangles represented 'victim' resurfacing in Nazi Germany concentration camps to identify homosexuals before being reclaimed by gay activists towards the end of the 20th century as a positive symbol to represent their struggle."
