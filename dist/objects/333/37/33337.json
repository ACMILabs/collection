        "Ron Tandberg is Australia's best known political cartoonist. This film follows through Tandberg's work on the front page of the Melbourne 'Age' on one particular night's edition. This document is significant for its depiction of the production of a broadsheet newspaper (including it printing) in 1983 and the dramatic change in production since computerisation was introduced shortly afterwards."
