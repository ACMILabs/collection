        "The McKenzie and Amazon Valleys are 10,000 kilometres distant from one another and are certainly distinct ecologically. Yet in a subtle sense they are collaborating elements within the biosphere - the Earth's thin layer of living matter. This film examines two of the myriad river ecosystems and shows how they are linked within the biosphere."
