        "A backstage look at Canada's burgeoning dance industry, with seven of the country's top professional dance companies. Filmed on location across North America, this documentary records the exacting daily grind of whistle-stop tours, exhausting repetitive practice, and little rest. Colourful excerpts highlight each troupe's unique repertoire, as dancers give dazzling displays of physical control and grace. It is a moving tribute to the thousands of dancers who strive for perfection every day. Narrated by Adrienne Clarkson. (Awards: New York; Ronda-Malaga) N.B. Two minutes of footage is missing from the beginning of this film."
