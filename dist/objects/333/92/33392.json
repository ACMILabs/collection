        "Jimmy Quinlan is a derelict, one of some five thousand other men and women who have abandoned their jobs and families to live in the streets and alleys in Montreal. This film, a powerful portrayal of life on skid row, tells of his \"agonies\" - his attempt to get off the bottle. It's something he's tried before, and will probably have to try again. Award: New York"
