        "Stages salutes Canada's performing artists, the singers, dancers and actors, some already famous and others struggling to make a name for themselves. In a film featuring a small group of them, they communicate through the medium of their craft the significance of being Canadian entertainers. Excerpts from such shows as Billy Bishop Goes to War, Margie Gillis's one-woman show and Clemence Desrochers's bitingly witty monologues highlight the vitality and multicultural flavour of the country's performing arts. (Award: Salerno.)"
