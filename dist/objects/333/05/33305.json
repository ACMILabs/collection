        "In any large city one of the most visible and, at the same time, anonymous characters is the taxi driver. Taxi! takes an absorbing, entertaining and sometimes comical look at a world few of us are familiar with. The filmmaker, a former cabbie, has produced a unique documentary study of the drivers, fleet operators and dispatchers who are expected to deliver passengers, parcels, and even babies. Photographed by day and night, the film explores the realities of the taxi business, the economics, and life as witnessed from behind the steering wheel."
