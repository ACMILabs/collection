        "A puppet animated fairytale, about a heroine who uses her magic whistle to break the spell of a beautiful but wicked witch, and charms a prince with her wit, goodness, prudence, and freckles. Designed to develop language arts skills. Charming and fey, this modern fairytale employs a crude and colourful animation style in the service of its gentle, whimsical nature."
