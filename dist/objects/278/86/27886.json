        "A demonstration of four resuscitation methods in the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney. A patient is anaesthetized and given an injection of curare, which paralyses the chest muscles and gives the effect of drowning. The Holger-Neilson, hip-lift and Sylvester methods of artificial respiration are then applied in turn, and a spirometer shows an adequate intake of air. The mouth to mouth resuscitation is demonstrated in detail and explained; both the direct contact method and with the use of the insufflator tube."
