        "Illustrates the basic concept that evaporation is a cooling process. A model refrigerator with plastic coils shows how, through a continuous cycle of evaporation and condensation of a refrigerant, heat is absorbed from inside the insulated box and released outside. The same principles are seen in air conditioning systems, and convection currents are illustrated."
