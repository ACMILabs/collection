        "A tale taken from a collection of short stories by Canadian author Hugh Hood. The setting is Montreal, and the story simply about a red kite that a man buys for his young daughter. This mildly impulsive act leads to encounters with strangers that cause him to wonder about the whole purpose and meaning of life. The bitter-sweet mood of the film and the setting, Montreal in late summer, creates a strangely haunting view of the city and of time."
