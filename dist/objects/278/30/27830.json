        "Episode of Series \"Rembrandt\". Sir Kenneth Clark introduces a series of three films on the life and work of the Dutch painter, Rembrandt. At the height of his success in 1642 Rembrandt amassed a large fortune, which he fritted away before his wife's death. There were difficult years ahead. Discusses Rembrandt's greater master of character; his increased, more \"dramatic\" interest in landscape. By 1664 his use of the classic rather than the baroque design marked a turning point in his career."
