        "The drama and suspense of impending victory as medical practitioners probe into the mysteries of one of mankind's most baffling diseases: cancer. The audience is taken to the forefront of the struggle to witness experiments in the field of bio-physics, and the radiation techniques developed for observing cellular activity and malignant growth. A new theory - that cancer may have its beginning with a virus - is discussed by a panel of doctors doing fundamental research at the Ontario Cancer Institute. Patients in this film are played by the Staff of the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto."
