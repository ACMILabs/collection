        "Episode of Series \"Social Security\". Rex left home at 16 after an argument with his father and now finds that he's left with the choice of life on the dole or continuing menial work. The film examines the life Rex leads and the sorts of options open to him, none of them in the area Rex is really interested in. One in a series of films made originally for daytime television panel discussions to introduce the public to the range of social services available form the government. No other credits available."
