        "Surveys the history of cinematography and microphotography with many examples of the strides that have been taken in these fields. The history of the scientific study of motion through the cine-camera. High-speed, and time-lapse cinematography allied with X-ray and the microscope have made possible the study of movements and subjects which the normal eye cannot see. Experiments from 1890 to 1940, when it was possible to slow down the flight of a bullet so that one is seen tapping a piece of glass and passing through before the glass is shattered. Cinematography from space rockets. The use of colour photography in the schlieren technique."
