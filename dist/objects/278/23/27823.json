        "Episode of Series \"Psychology\". Shows how learning is reinforced through stimulus-responses and extinguished when not reinforced, but rapidly reacquired when once more reinforced. Pigeons are used to demonstrate this learning process through responding through such stimuli as a hole in the wall, food, buzzer, and light. Removal of rewards makes them \"forget\" and return of reward reintroduces the learning almost immediately."
