        "Lake Eppalock, and its catchment area are the base for a unique water and soil conservation scheme. The area in the past has suffered severe erosion due to gold mining and bad farming. The aims of this long term project are to heal erosion, conserve water, reclaim land and increase farming production with the co-operation of land holders, shire councils and various Government departments."
