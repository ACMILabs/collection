        "Presents Renmark as Australia's first irrigation settlement. Introduces the Renmark Trust utilizing the waters of the Murray River to irrigate fruit trees and vines. We see oranges prepared for market whilst other fruits include apricots, peaches, pears, lemons and grapefruit; and vineyards produce sultanas, raisins, and grapes for wine making. The scenic attractions of the River and town are also seen."
