        "A study of one of Gaudier-Brzeska's most important sculptures, seen in different aspects of movement and light. The structure of the film is based on the characteristics found in a roll of film offcuts: random rhythms, interrupted movements, repeated movements, and the image relationships created by those movements and the static shots. Electronic sound track devised by Arthur Cantrill."
