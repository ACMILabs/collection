        "Sequoia Semperivirens, the giant everlasting redwood, is a link with the age of the dinosaurs. But the future of these trees is threatened. This film, a tribute to nature's awesome power to create, is also a testament of man's reckless power to destroy, and it pleads for the establishment of a Redwood National Park in the United States. Narrated by William Turner and Keith Griggs."
