        "Episode of Series \"Industrial Safety\". A new safety officer in a building construction company meets opposition when he introduces a new safety program. He explains the importance of safety measures. Another in the Milton Whitty Safety series in which he has a new safety problem. A short-sighted foreman who thinks he knows all the answers. He does, except for one. And that is how to prevent accidents. Only when tragedy strikes does he realise that \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\"."
