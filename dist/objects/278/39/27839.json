        "This film strikingly conveys the destitution and despair of the depression of the 1930's in the U.S. which gave rise to the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the \"New Deal\". Footage shows dumping of milk to raise prices, children sleeping in the street, people living on the city dump, the march of people to Washington, troops attacking peaceful marchers, the right to organise unions and footage of striking workers at Ford with police firing on strikers. Written by Harold Flender. Narrated by Michael Tolan."
