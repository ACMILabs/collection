        "Direct photography, animation, micro-cinematography and three-dimensional animation are used to tell the story of embryology. The pig - familiar domestic animal - is selected to illustrate the process of generation. The story is fundamentally complete from the formation of the original male and female germ cells, to the active newborn pig, including such processes as fertilization, cleavage, blastulation, formation of neural folds, development of membranes and embryonic circulation and parturition."
