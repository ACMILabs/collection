        "Episode of Series \"Rembrandt\". Sir Kenneth Clark, eminent British art authority introduces the series of three films on the life and work of the Dutch painter, Rembrandt. Rembrandt's early life and work are described in this first film. He was born in Leyden in 1606; his family recognised his talent and sent him to Amsterdam to study. His brilliant drawing and skilful use of oils established his reputation. In 1631 he settled in Amsterdam and married Saskia van Uylenborch three years later. He painted his wife many times and the period of his early married life contains many happy and light-hearted pictures."
