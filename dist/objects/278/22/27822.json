        "Much of the work of an orchestra and its conductor is done in shirt sleeves, in an empty hall. In this film we go behind the scenes with conductor Paul Scherman as he prepares a Montreal orchestra for a performance of a new composition by Canadian composer Harry Somers. Mr. Somers himself is on hand to hear this rehearsal of his Suite for Harp and Chamber Orchestra."
