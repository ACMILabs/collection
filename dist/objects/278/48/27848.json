        "The ancient practice of acupuncture, used for over fifty centuries in the treatment of variety of human ailments, is noted by the narration to be the standard form of medicine for over half the world's population. Based on the concept that human ills, be they migraine headache, insomnia, backache, deafness and other afflictions, may be cured or eased by the artificial manipulation of certain energy flows in the body. The film covers diagnostic methods, the insertion of needles, their manipulation to increase or decrease the energy flow, the use of herbs used with this treatment. Studies are being conducted in which acupuncture and Western medicine are being integrated for even greater results in the treatment."
