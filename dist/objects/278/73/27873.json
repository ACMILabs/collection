        "A gang of boys break into a rival group's club house and destroy much of the contents. Instead of seeking revenge, the boys who suffered the damage seek the help of a local policeman who explains to them the meaning of private and public property. They relate their own loss to the damage they have done on school property and realise that public property is owned by everyone and not just one individual."
