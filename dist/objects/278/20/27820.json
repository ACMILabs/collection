        "A study in the loneliness of a stranger confronted with the vastness of a foreign city. A first impression of London is captured with a fresh, eager eye, and the gradual realisation of their lack of concern is beautifully established in a series of encounters with a newspaper seller, a policeman, and most effectively of all, a man mowing his lawn in a suburban street."
