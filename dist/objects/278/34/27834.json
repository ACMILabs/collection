        "Australian research into the behaviour of milk proteins during heating and mixing has led to new techniques for processing stable skim-milk powders rich in protein. This powder can be transported relatively cheaply to recombining plants in tropical areas, where it is mixed with anhydrous milk fat and water, with or without sugar, to produce sweetened condensed milk or unsweetened evaporated milk. Traces the recombining techniques from pilot plant to full-scale commercial production."
