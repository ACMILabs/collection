        "Beginning with the notion that all life on earth depends on critical balances in networks and cycles of ecology, the film demonstrates how particular forms of pollution are critically threatening the earth's ability to sustain life. The report also shows how short-term attempts to avoid the biological consequences of pollution have already failed and puts forward new hypotheses about hitherto unsuspected effects of nuclear bomb testing. Narrated by Victor Henry."
