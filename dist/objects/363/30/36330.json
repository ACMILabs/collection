        "Lady, a pampered cocker spaniel, and Tramp, a jaunty mutt with a heart of gold, join an equally delightful cast of characters for an animated masterpiece. It's an enthralling story, breathtaking animation and memorable songs, (written and performed by the legendary Peggy Lee) provide unparalleled romance, adventure and enchantment. Rated: G"
