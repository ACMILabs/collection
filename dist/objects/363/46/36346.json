        "During a stay in Salzburg for the Salzburg festival, Jose Carreras discovered the chapel where \"Silent night\" was first played by Gruber and Mohr. Produced on location in the winter-wonderland of Oberndorf, Jose Carreras is the first opera singer to present this famous Christmas carol from the original setting. He also performs other famous Christmas songs, including \"White Christmas\", \"Ave Maria\" and \"Adeste fideles\", his tenor voice creating magic for listeners of every age."
