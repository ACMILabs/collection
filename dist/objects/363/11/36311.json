        "Seen but not Heard probes the often-hidden feelings, attitudes and beliefs of kids in the formative and volatile stages of the early teens. It is a time when privacy, independence and experimentation create a separate world for young people; a world into which adults only rarely get a glimpse. For adolescents, it is a provocative examination of their own lives. For parents, it is an eye-opening insight into the lives of their children. For younger children it is a hint of things to come."
