        "A man of the sword. A man of the cloth. A clash of civilisations. A fight to the death. A political parable and portrait of 18th century missionary works. Shot on location in the breathtaking jungles of South America. \"The Mission\" is a movie experience to be shared by all. Stars Robert de Niro and Jeremy Irons."
