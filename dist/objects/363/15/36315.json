        "Episode of Series 'More Winners''. At school, Mark meets Annie who believes she is the reincarnation of Australia's most famous racehorse - Phar Lap. Mark is fascinated by the concept of being someone else and becomes convinced he is the reincarnation of Henry Ford. His friends at school also get into the act believing they were Queen Victoria and Albert Einstein. At first they revel in their new identities especially when a major new school assignment is to research the life of a prominent historical figure. When their research reveals that their past lives were collectively responsible for quite a few of the world's current problems, the children set out on a daring mission to make up for what they have done. Rated: G"
