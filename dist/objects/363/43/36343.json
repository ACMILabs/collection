        "Planes, Trains, Boats and Cars: Sparky, Amy and Alex discover floating bikes, underwater boats, trucks without drivers, trains without trucks, cars that become boats and planes that become helicopters. But can Alex really turn his BMX bike into an excavator to drill a hole to China? \"Water, Water, Everywhere\": Planet Earth should be called Planet Water says Sparky, as he flies Amy and Alex around the world to see why. From the Amazon River to the River Nile and even Antarctica, Amy and Alex see how water is a wonderful gift - to be used, enjoyed and shared by everyone."
