        "Episode of Series 'More Winners'. In the Enchanted Realm the Faeries are in trouble. According to the Charters of the Grand Masters, they must give away seven wishes to the humans every 100 years or they will lose their magic powers. The last wish was given away 99 years and 364 days before. Prince Wilton is sent to earth to dispose of the 7 wishes to a sceptical and disbelieving human and before sundown. The only human being who will believe in him and make any wish is Christopher Walter Pratt (C W). C W doesn't realise, however, that the last wish lasts forever. The lessons C W has taught and learnt leave their mark on him and those he meets on his journey through a truly magical day."
