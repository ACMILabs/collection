        "Elda Hartley set out to make a film about ageing and realised, as a senior citizen herself, she would make a good subject for her film. She candidly examines her own life - \"Its not death that bothers me - it's the deterioration of my mind and body.\" Elda sorts through her experience with other cultures and religions, illustrating certain points from many films, and takes an intimate look at her relationship with her husband, Irving, whose failing health demands her complete attention. A personal, yet comprehensive approach to the issues of aging."
