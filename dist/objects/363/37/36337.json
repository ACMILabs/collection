        "Episode of Series 'More Winners'. A vacation music camp at an old country estate brings together a group of children, not all of whom have come with music foremost in their minds. The estate has an air of mystery about it and when mention is made of a live-in ghost, some of the children, especially Flea, become fascinated. Flea's obsession in tracking down the ghost and playing practical jokes leads him into constant trouble with the teachers. Meanwhile, Jason, a rather serious boy is, against some purist opposition, trying to get his Concerto for the Rock Group and Orchestra, which has a very difficult solo passage, played in the final concert. Between these two stories floats the estate's caretaker, a figure of mystery and fascination. Rated: G"
