        "Dr. Ellis challenges Gloria's absolutes - her \"awfullising\" and \"catastrophising\" - that make her feel so unhappy with herself and that sabotage her relationships with others. He teaches her that the irrational things she says to herself causes her negative feelings and her consequent behaviour. Gloria begins to discover that she can correct her irrational thoughts and reverse her negative feelings and behaviours."
