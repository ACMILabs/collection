        "The story of two men on the run from the police in outback NSW, \"Backroads\" was the first feature film in which Aborigines made a major creative contribution other than fine acting. The dialogue between the two main characters elevates the film into an angry polemical statement about white responsibility for the poverty and destitution of Aboriginal people. Essie Coffey, playing herself, talks about her people's struggle for land rights. Also stars Gary Foley, Bill Hunter and Julie McGregor and features photography by Russell Boyd."
