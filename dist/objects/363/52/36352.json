        "A woman has been beaten by her husband. Should neighbours, friends or police intervene? Should the woman leave and break up the family? If so, where can she go and how can she live? Survivors, police and experts discuss the nature of domestic violence, the effects on victims and their children, barriers to leaving and legal rights of victims. It also highlights how victims can become survivors. The video is accompanied by a workbook giving background information and discussion questions."
