        "Episode numbers 7 and 8 of Series \"Civilisation\". Part 7. Sir Kenneth Clarke presents Rome of the Counter-revolution - the Rome of Michelangelo and of Bernini. The Catholic Church in its fight against the Protestant North developed a new splendour symbolised by the glory of St. Peter's. Part 8. The telescope and the microscope revealed new worlds in space and in a drop of water. The realism of Dutch painting took the observation of human character a stage further."
