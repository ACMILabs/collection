        "Episode of Series 'More Winners'. Justus Zukermann, a wealthy prospector, lives with his 12 year old daughter, Ada on a windswept mountain plateau. Since Ada's mother died, Martha and her step-daughter, Agnes, have been employed to run the household. One day Justus is fatally injured in a fall. Before he dies he orders Ada to journey south to find her true inheritance. Agnes is to accompany her. Martha (who is in fact a witch) has for years envied Justus' wealth. She determines to secure the hidden fortune for herself and orders Agnes to kill Ada and steal the map once they reach the forest. Agnes is unable to kill Ada and the two girls are drawn together. After several adventures the girls find a secret cave, unearth the buried treasure and a letter from Justus, which makes the purpose of their journey very clear. Rated: G"
