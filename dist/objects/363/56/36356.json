        "In July 1986 Estate Agent, Suzy Lamplugh, disappeared while on a client appointment. The Suzy Lamplugh Trust was set up to encourage increased awareness among employers and staff of the potential danger from attack in the workplace. The Trust is engaged in comprehensive research in the field of personal vulnerability, and is developing courses to promote greater understanding of the ways to minimise risk. There are practical steps that everyone can take. First, AVOID potential risk by following cautionary procedures. TALK in ways that will placate rather than provoke customers or clients who are aggressive. WALK away from danger. DEFEND yourself if all other methods fail."
