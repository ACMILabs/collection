        "Episode number 3 of Series \"The World at war\". Part 5: \"Barbarossa\" - Germany, now master of all Europe, including the Balkans, turns against Russia. The early stages are composed of devastating German victories as the Panzers sweep with appalling speed deep into Russia. But the German High Command delays, fatally, and the advance is held a few kilometres from Moscow when the mud and then the fierce cold takes a grip. Part 6: \"Banzai\" - Japan, seeking unrestricted access to raw materials she needs for expansion, tires of negotiations and strikes at Pearl Harbour inflicting a severe blow to American naval power. In a few months, Japan demonstrates how ill-prepared the Allies are, sweeping forward to capture Hong Kong, Burma, Malaya, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. Narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier. Also available on DVD [318986]."
