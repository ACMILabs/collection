        "Attention me hearties! Here's another chance to watch that bravest of buccaneers, Captain Pugwash, and his trusty band of pirates, in nine salty tales from the hugely popular 1960s and 70s series. Thrill to their swash- buckling adventures aboard the Black Pig as cunning cabin boy Tom helps Captain Pugwash and his loyal crew battle against their arch-enemy Cut Throat Jake. Their adventures involve an hilarious smuggling escapade, doughnuts for dodos and even a promising career in the theatre ... but is it the end for Captain Pugwash when he faces the chopper? Rated: G"
