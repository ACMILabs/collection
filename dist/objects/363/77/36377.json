        "This program shows office staff how fires can be extinguished when you know what to do. It features the water hose reel and three extinguishers commonly used on infant fires. The safety of all people, informing the fire brigade, possibly evacuation and attacking the fire are all dealt with. This will give staff confidence to act appropriately and will show how simple it is to pull the pin and squeeze the lever."
