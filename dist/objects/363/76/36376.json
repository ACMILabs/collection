        "The late Dr. Perls, founder of Gestalt Therapy, uses an entirely different approach from Dr. Rogers, equally effective, with a similar goal. Dr. Perls frustrates Gloria into standing on her own two feet and abandoning her roles and games. He frustrates her into being real, knowing and owning her feelings and being in the here and now."
