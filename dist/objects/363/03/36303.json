        "The police are baffled when the world's largest diamond is stolen from its top security museum display. Jeffrey, a 12 year old blind boy is present when the crime is committed. His mother, a museum administrator, is one of only three people with access to the diamond through the voice-print-security system, and she's the chief suspect. To complicate matters, Jeffrey's divorced father is assigned to the case and ignores Jeffrey's crime-solving efforts. It's up to Jeffrey to piece together the puzzling clues."
