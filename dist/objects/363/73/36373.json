        "Dr Beck is the primary leader in Cognitive Therapy. He is University Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and is Director of the Centre for Cognitive Therapy. He is noted for his work with anxiety and depression. Cognitive Therapy, in part, deals with the thoughts, the negative things we tell ourselves, that lead to bad feelings and clinical symptoms. Dr Beck teaches Richard how to identify his negative thoughts and to rebut them to help his anxiety, his anger and his depression. This is a valuable film for the patient as well as the professional in providing immediately effective skills to reverse such debilitating maladies."
