        "One dim moonlit night, a small band of rabbits leave the comfort and safety of their warren and set out on a long and dangerous journey after a premonition of a terrible disaster that will overtake them if they stay. None of them knows where they are heading, or the dangers they will face in their search for a new warren where they can live in peace. Adapted from Richard Adams' modern classic. Voiced by actors including: John Hurt, Richard Briers, Ralph Richardson, Denholm Elliott, Zero Mostel, Nigel Hawthorne, Michael Hordern, Joss Ackland."
