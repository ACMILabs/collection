        "Episode of Series \"Famous Five\". Five go on a Secret Trail - \"Julian! Dickl! Wake up!\" called George. The boys awoke at once and so did Anne. They listened to the weird noise, a high wail that would die away only to start again a few seconds later. Someone is trying to frighten the Five. Who can it be? And what are they looking for? The Five are determined to find out. \"Five Go To Billycock Hill\" - The Five are on a camping holiday on Billycock Hill, and everything seems peaceful at first. But a visit to nearby Butterfly Farm brings them into contact with some strange characters, and the Five are curious about the aeroplanes that take off from a secret airfield - but they get a real fright when they explore the long and dangerous tunnels of Billycock caves. Rated: G"
