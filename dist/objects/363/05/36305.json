        "This enthralling production, using the intricacies of colour separation overlay, captures all the magic and humour of Swift's brilliant spoof on the follies of mankind. \"Gulliver's Travels\" has been a bestseller since it was first published over 250 years ago and tells the story of Gulliver's adventures among the tiny Lilliputians who are obsessed by petty rivalries and trivia. It is both a timeless political satire and a fascinating tale of extraordinary travels in strange lands, which can be enjoyed by both adults and children. The adaptation is tight and amusing and the special effects really are something. Rated: G"
