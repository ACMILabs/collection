        "This program looks at the dilemmas faced by many children, teenagers and adults, who are torn between a need to fit in with the Australian way of life and following the customs of their homeland. We meet the members of a Turkish family who share a wide range of problems including a teenage boy who wants to be accepted by his peers, his sister who wants to date boys and his parents who feel that he is ashamed of them and their culture. Issues raised include racism, multiculturalism and assimilation, name calling, the problems of living in a new country, the greater difficulties faced by women, peer group pressure, the generation gap and how migrant parents can cope."
