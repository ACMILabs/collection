        "Kermit and his Muppet theatrical troupe attempt to stage a musical on Broadway, but are shunted around by unscrupulous producers. In desperation the Muppets each go their own way to make a living but reunite when a young producer discovers their script. Kermit, however, comes down with a case of amnesia and emerges as an agency big shot. Miss Piggy, jealous of Kermit's friendship with a waitress, karate chops him back to reality and it's \"On with the Show\"."
