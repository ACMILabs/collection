        "On her birthday a little boy is given a piggy bank with a shiny new coin, a picture book and two dolls, an angel and the soldier boy. She makes sure the angel and the soldier boy are safe on her pillow but at night the pirates jump out of the picture book and steal the coin from the piggy bank. The noise wakes the soldier and he chases after them and is taken prisoner. When the angel wakes she goes in search and knows there is something wrong when she finds his sword by the empty piggy bank. Rated: G"
