        "This film exemplifies the genius and wisdom of the Rogerian system that revolutionised psychotherapy, and that has had such a positive and irreversible effect on those who learn it. Gloria's dilemma regarding the conflict between her beliefs, her feelings and her actions, a universal plight of the human being, is heard and understood by Dr. Rogers without judgement or authoritarian directiveness. It is this understanding and the affirmation of her own worth and ability that gives Gloria the strength to cope with her problems, make her own decisions and feel able."
