        "The unforgettable friendship of two unforgettable men. The tension and the terror of South Africa is powerfully portrayed in director Richard Attenborough's sweeping story of black activist Stephen Biko (Denzel Washington) and liberal white newspaper editor Donald Woods (Kevin Kline) who risks his life to bring Biko's story to the world. In this explosive, emotional and thrilling film, Woods slowly learns the true horrors of apartheid through Biko's eyes. When the South African authorities begin to view Biko as a major threat to their government, he is arrested and silenced by the police. Determined not to let Biko's message go unheard, Woods, himself now under house arrest, undertakes a perilous quest to escape South Africa. This riveting true adventure offers a stirring account of man at his most evil and most heroic."
