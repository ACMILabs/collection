        "Episode of Series \"Writers Talking\". Poet and novelist David Malouf was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during the coldest winter there for 50 years, and in Sydney during a steamy summer. To write, he says, you must turn your back on even the most beautiful landscape. Malouf talks about the influences on his work and how he gets into the writing process."
