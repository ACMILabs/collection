        "It's fun! It's magical! It's adventure filled! It's a spellbinding Emmy Award winning anthology about animals, humans, and their relationships. In 'Call of the Wild', Jack London's thrilling tale of the Alaskan Gold Rush, John Thornton rescues Buck, a husky who has been beaten unmercifully by his former master, an 11 year old boy nurses a wounded raccoon back to health in Sterling North's touching \"Rascal\". Through many adventures the two become best friends until young Sterling realises that he loves Rascal enough to give him the greatest gift of all. \"The Flight of the White Wolf\" based on Mel Ellis' novel, is the action packed story of 15 year old Russ and the wolf he's raised from a pup. After Gray kills a Great Dane in a fight and escapes to the forest, circumstances force Russ to perform a selfless act of courage that may tear them apart. Rated G."
