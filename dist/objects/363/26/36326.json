        "Marina, a mermaid princess, is so curious about the human world after saving the life of a handsome prince that through the magic of the witch of the sea, she turns herself into a beautiful young woman. She returns to the castle to find her prince but her problem is that she can no longer speak, so how can she convey her deep love for her beloved prince? \"The little mermaid\" commemorates the centenary of the death of Hans Christian Anderson as the world of the fantastic and incredible adventures of Maria unfolds with beautiful colour and music."
