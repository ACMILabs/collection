        "Episode of Series 'More Winners'. Twelve year old Cherry Williams befriends Mr Edmund, who is one of the rather impoverished guests at her mother's boarding house. Mr Edmund has a dream that one day she will be a lawyer. Cherry's mother believes these are foolish dreams and urges the two of them to grow up. Mr Edmund, Cherry and her younger brother, Sam, save old Mrs Finkel from a bag snatcher. She is grateful and when she hears of Mr Edmund's dream insists on hiring the Opera House Concert Hall for him for one night. They are all to participate in the concert. On the big day Mr Edmund, Cherry and Sam learn that Mrs Finkel is dying in hospital and that she did not really have the money to hire the Concert hall. Cherry thinks that her mother has been right all along: dreams are for kids. Mr Edmund, however, is determined to have his moment on the Concert Hall stage partly in memory of Mrs Finkel but also as a celebration of hope. Rated: G"
