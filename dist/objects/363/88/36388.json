        "Eye protection is often one of the most important features in a company's safety program.. Clearly designated areas, regulations and warnings are not always observed, with the result that many employees put themselves at risk of injury to one of the most vital senses. \"I Can't See\" is a powerful film which rejects the attitude of some employees that eye protection is a nuisance its need overstated, the \"won't happen to me\" attitude. At the same time, we see it being used correctly in several different industrial situations."
