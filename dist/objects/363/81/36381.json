        "Trainers and occupational health and safety managers will welcome this training package for employees which has been made in Australia expressly for Australasian conditions. Aimed particularly at the induction level employee, it is equally useful as a general refresher program or as an educational introduction to occupational health and safety. Hosted by Margaret Throsby, the issues covered by the program include management and employee responsibilities under the new legislation; the role of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission; factors contributing to major health and safety problems such as RSI; functions of safety committees, quality circles and industrial democracy; and legal safety standards."
