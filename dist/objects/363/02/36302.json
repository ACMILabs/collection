        "Welcome to the eerie library of Vincent Price, journey with him into a world of ghosts, ghouls and \"things that go bump in the night\". The Master of macabre has conjured up a reading of classic and contemporary ghost stories that are vividly brought to life. There is mystery and wonder in these three famous tales of the supernatural. In Richard Peck's \"The Ghost Belonged to Me\", meet 13 year old Alexander, a farmboy who discovers he has his very own ghost! And see Ichabod Crane from Washington Irving's classic \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\", who doesn't believe in ghosts - until the Headless Horseman takes his last ride. Then there's John Bellair's \"The House With a Clock in its Walls\", where a doctor and his nephew race against an evil spirit to find a clock before it destroys the world."
