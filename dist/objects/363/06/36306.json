        "Random Harvest is a romantic masterpiece. Based on the novel by James Hilton (who also wrote \"Lost Horizons\" and \"Goodbye Mr Chips\") this is a story of a man's loss of, and search for identity and a woman's undying love and devotion. Consummate film artistry and intelligence make what we see and hear enthralling and moving. Stars Greer Garson and Ronald Colman. Rated: G"
