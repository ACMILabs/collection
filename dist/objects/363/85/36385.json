        "The Story - Fifteen year old Jessica is partially deaf. When her hearing parents leave on an overseas trip, Jessica is left in the care of her profoundly deaf grandmother, with whom she has difficulty communicating. Embarrassed by her own hearing impairment, Jessica now finds herself caught between two worlds, belonging to neither. The Company - Gestures Theatre-of-the -Deaf comprises 14 deaf actors under the direction of Sarah Werfel (hearing) and Leonora Martin (profoundly deaf). The company devises plays based on events of importance to the deaf community. These plays are performed in mime and an Australian sign language (Auslan) for both deaf and hearing audiences."
