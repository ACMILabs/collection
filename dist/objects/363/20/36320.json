        "Episode of Series \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". A breath-taking live action of C. S. Lewis' powerful fantasy for all ages using stunning special effects to recreate the most exciting and enchanting adventure of them all. Narnia is a magical world of dwarves, nymphs and giants, a bewitched land where fauns carry umbrellas and brew tea, where animals talk and horses fly. It is the land of Aslan, the great lion who can warm the coldest heart. But it is also the land of his arch-enemy, the White Witch, who ensures that in Narnia it is always winter but never Christmas."
