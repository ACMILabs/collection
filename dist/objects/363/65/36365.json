        "Greta and Freda Chaplin are English identical twins who dress alike, try to walk in step and, for much of the time, speak the same words in unison. They are inextricably bound to each other and, if separated, they wail and scream. There are many twins who dress alike and behave somewhat alike, but the Chaplin twins are described as being amongst the most uncanny. Estranged from their mother and sharing a house with a sympathetic man who read of their strange case in a newspaper, the twins live a curious, fragile and somewhat fearful existence. Their story sparkles with the crazy quirkiness of the far edges of humanity, yet it resonates with the essence of every human. It is impossible not to be fascinated by this film."
