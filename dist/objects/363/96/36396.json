        "Episode numbers 11, 12 and 13 of Series \"Civilisation\". Part 11. Christianity was the chief creative force in Western civilisation until about 1730, when it became eclipsed by the worship of nature. Part 12. The French Revolution led, not to freedom, but to terror, the dictatorship of Napoleon and the bureaucracies of the 19th century. Part 13. The final program shows how the heroic materialism of the past hundred years has been linked with an equally remarkable increase in humanitarianism."
