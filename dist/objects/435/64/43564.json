        "The subject of this video is the recent discovery in New York by Dr Benoit Mandelbrot of the Mandelbrot Set. This discovery led to the development of a new mathematical discipline- fractal geometry. Mandelbrot's discovery was aided by the development of the silicon chip in the 1970's. It was in the 1980's, assisted by a super computer at IBN laboratories in New York that Mandelbrot's startling discovery was made. Author and inventor Dr Arthur C Clarke explores the Mandelbrot Set and fractal world along with fellow colleagues Dr Benoit Mandelbrot, Professor Stephen Hawking, Dr Michael Barnsley and Professor Ian Stewart. Clarke (who wrote the script) postulates on the effect these discoveries will have on the future."
