        "This documentary takes the film-clip biography to new heights. Narrated by 'Rock' it wittily dissects the late star's screen career in the light of the now known facts of his life-- that he was gay and died from AIDS. The film presents a new image of Hollywood's leading romantic screen idol of the 50s and 60s by closely examining his screen roles for 'hidden meanings' Both poignant and funny it exposes the 'queerness' the sits just below the surface of mainstream Hollywood film."
