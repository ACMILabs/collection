        "Nuclear weapon testing resurrects a relic from the Jurassic age, Godzilla, and the creature is heading for Japan. This is the story that American reporter Steve Martin (Raymond Burr), is investigating. He is hot on the trail of a series of mysterious disasters off the coast of Japan, which leads him to Godzilla. Godzilla wreaks havoc over Tokyo nights, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Dr Serizawa discovers a weapon that will mean the end of Godzilla, but Japan will have to pay a high price; the annihilation of Tokyo Bay. Originally released in Japan as 'Gojira' (1954), this version inserted scenes with Raymond Burr. Based on the long running series created by Inoshiro Honda."
