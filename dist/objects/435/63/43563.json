        "There are many examples in nature of dependence amongst orhanisms. This film illustrates some examples of this cooperative dependence. Sea anemone and damsel fish, yucca and yucca moth, lichens, termites and protozoa, and ants and aphids are all examples that give insights into the relationship called symbiosis. Music by David Blumberg."
