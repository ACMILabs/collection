        "This tape contains episodes four to six of this discworld adventure. If someone thrust a new-born baby into your arms and told you to look after it, what would you do? And suppose you had a sneaking suspicion it was no ordinary baby? And suppose again you were Granny Weatherwax - the most practical and pragmatic of a trio of ill-assorted witches. For it is these three that become involved in not just witchcraft but good and evil, ghostly torment and worst of all - amateur dramatics!"
