        "Author, broadcaster and aspiring steam train enthusiast Nigel Farrell sets off on a steam train journey through Britain, starting on the North Yorks Moors Railway. He disembarks to board the Princess Margaret Rose, en route to Holyhead, and spends some time on the famous Ffestiniog Railway in Wales, the Tallylin and Severn Valley Lines and the Bluebell Line in Sussex. Along the way Nigel tries to find out what inspires such passion in men and women alike for steam trains."
