        "'Ashes of Time' is a highly original fantasy, swordplay movie from cult Hong Kong film director Wong Kar-Wai. The film skillfully weaves a handful of stories together through the device of the central character of Ouyang Feng (Leslie Cheung), a mercenary swordsman who owns an inn in the middle of a desert. With his usual flair Wong Kar-Wai (with the help of Australian cinematographer Chris Doyle), creates a visually sumptuous and highly original film. A stylish mix of spaghetti western, epic landscapes and Chinese fantasy folktales and swordfights the film includes a who's who of Hong Kong film stars. Cast includes Leslie Cheung, Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, Carina Lau, Tony Leung and Jacky Cheung. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
