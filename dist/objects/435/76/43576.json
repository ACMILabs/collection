        "Co-director and star Bruce LaBruce's sleazy and explicit tour of the LA hustler and porn scene is a humorous and twisted take on Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard and\" the more unsavory moments of \"Whatever happened to Baby Jane\". Model Tony Ward stars as Monti- a hustler who becomes the lust object and obsession for Bruce Labruce's melodramatic journalist, Jurgen Anger. \"Hustler White\"'s use of real life hustlers and gay porn actors, along with Labruce's own gay porn background (he has directed and stared in the underground and very pornographic, Super 8 1/2 and No Skin off my Arse) gives the film a candid documentary feel. Hustler White was co-directed by gay photographer Rick Castro."
