        "Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is about to come out, big time, on National Television, only he doesn't know it. School teacher Brackett, along with family and friends are watching the Academy Awards when one of his former students makes a revealing acceptance speech when he wins the award for best actor. He thanks his former teacher, Brackett, as providing the inspiration behind his award winning role as a gay soldier. This is startling news to Howard, his fiancee (Joan Cusack), but seems to explain things to Howard's students and friends who seem to have found an explanation for Howard's neat ways and Streisand fascination. Howard is desperate to get married to refute his sexuality but hot on his tail is the national press and in particular is an aggressive television reporter (Tom Selleck), who wants Howard to come out for himself on television. Howard has some thinking to do. Cast includes Debbie Reynolds, Matt Dillon, Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart."
