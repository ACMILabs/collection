        "Introduced by Galarrwuy Yunupingu, chairman of the Northern Land Council, this magazine style video describes the current structure of the Council and discusses recent developments such as the move to regionalisation and the decisions of the full council meeting held on October 1-3, 1996. It also looks at the Wik decision on native title and the Larrakia native title claim. Includes footage from the celebrations of twenty years of land rights, and music clips by the Mills Sisters, Warumpi Band, Yothu Yindi and Belkbala Mujik."
