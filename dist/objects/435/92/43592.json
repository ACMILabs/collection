        "Forty years after the fact, choreographer Jeroen Boman (Jeroen Krabbe), recalls his childhood experiences as an adolescent in wartime Holland. Evacuated from Amsterdam to a country village, young Jeroen (Maarten Smit) is troubled by the isolation from his family and the sexual curiosity of the girls and boys around him. Once the Allied Forces move into the village, Jeroen enters into a tender relationship with Canadian soldier, Walt (Andrew Kelley). Never stooping to sensationalism, this gay 'coming of age' film is delicately handled and beautifully written. From the novel by Rudi Van Dantzig. In Dutch with English subtitles."
