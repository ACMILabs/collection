        "A young aristocratic military cadet gets a dose of reality when he is called to fight in the Spanish Civil War in this French anti-war drama. It is 1936 and Rafael is the sixteen year old son of a senior officer in the pro-Franco ranks. His father decides that his son, heir to a family traditionally dedicated to the army, must \"do his duty.\" Before going to the front, Rafael is placed under the command of Colonel Massagual, a cynical and derisive character who has made a profession of war. Massagual takes charge of Rafael's military training, while Celia, a beautiful English nurse, concentrates on his sentimental education. In French with English subtitles. Cast includes Jean-Louis Trintignant, Gregoire Colin, Marc Lavoine and Jean-Philip Ecoffey."
