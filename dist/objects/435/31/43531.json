        "Martin Landau and Miriam Margolyes narrate \"Echoes that remain\" a moving documentary about the people of the shtetl and their lives before the Holocaust. Director Arnold Schwartzman combines past and present as archival footage is intercut with live action sequences filmed at the sites of former Jewish communities in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania. The production crew's research and admiration for the subject matter is evident and echoes of the film will remain with the viewer. Presented by one of America's leading Jewish cultural institutions, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. Music performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra."
