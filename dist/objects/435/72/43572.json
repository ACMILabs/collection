        "Brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm (Laurence Harvey and Karl Boehm) are commissioned to write a family history for a local Duke; the setting, the nineteenth century. The task seems doomed as Wilhelm is far more content creating stories about fairies, elves, knights and princesses to include in a collection of folktales. Jacob reluctantly agrees to help his brother, provided it doesn't interfere with the serious task at hand. This fictionalised account of two of the world's greatest story tellers is interspersed with adaptations of some of their stories. An international cast brings to life some of the Brothers Grimms' best loved fairy tales including \"The Dancing Princess\", \"The Cobbler and the elves\" and \"The Singing bone\". The cast of these fairy tales includes Claire Bloom, Karl Boehm, Walter Slezak, Oscar Homolka, Barbara Eden, Yvette Mimieux, Jim Backus and Beulah Bondi. A delightful account that will be enjoyed by viewers of all ages."
