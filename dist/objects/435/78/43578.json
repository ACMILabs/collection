        "One of the most discussed questions in history, \"what really happened to Hitler?\" is the subject of this investigative documentary, written and produced by Cyril Jones. He uses footage obtained from the Russian Film Archives to support his case as well as the testimony of Elena Rjeveskaia, last surviving member of the SMERSH team. The documentary also covers the fate of Hitler's chosen successor, Dr Joseph Goebbels, and his family."
