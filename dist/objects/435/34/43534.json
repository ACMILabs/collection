        "Blue eyed is a confronting documentary which follows Jane Elliott at work as she conducts a workshop about prejudice and racism. She does this by dividing her audience into two groups; blue eyed and brown eyed as uses the colour distinction to demonstrate the powerful impact of discrimination and the effect is has on the victim's emotions. Designed for use by schools and businesses to illustrate the anatomy of prejudice and the effects of racism."
