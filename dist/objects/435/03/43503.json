        "Throughout history, the rape of innocent women during war time has been a common, but hidden occurrence; it is only now that an international court, The Hague, is trying to convict someone for rape as a war crime. This video follows four women who courageously recount their stories of rape and confinement in Bosnia during the recent conflict. It also conducts interviews with the legal personnel behind The Hague Trial. Archival footage from hearings in Nuremberg, Nanking, Rwanda and Bosnia are interspersed with images of Western art and culture which present a confusing portrayal of rape and attempt to legitimize rape during war time as an inevitable outcome. Previewing is recommended."
