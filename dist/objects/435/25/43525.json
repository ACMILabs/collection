        "This video explores the Allied campaign to liberate Europe and Hitler's genocidal war against the Jews. It combines film footage, music, radio broadcasts and interviews. It uses 1942, (a time when Hitler was still at the heights of his power) as a starting point, and ends at V-E Day. Narrated by Ben Kinglsey, Miriam Margolyes, Patrick Stewart, Jean Boht and Whoopi Goldberg."
