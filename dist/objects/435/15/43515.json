        "For anyone interested in Old Roses, Peter Beales should be a familiar name as his nursery contains one of the world's largest collections of Old Roses. In this documentary Peter takes the viewer on a potted history of Old Roses, from Species through to the Teas. He looks at their place in history and their evolution. The process of hybridizing is explained by Peter's daughter, Amanda Gipp, and we watch the Beales family at the Sandringham and Royal Norfolk Shows. An eleven minute pictorial index of the roses discussed throughout the video is presented following the credits."
