        "Qiuyi and Xiaoe are friends and prostitutes, working in a Shanghai brothel at the end of the 1940's. It is a time of social upheaval as the Communist Revolution forces them to change their profession and assume 'normal' lives. With this normalacy comes trouble, as they both fall in love with the same man. The strain begins to show in their relationship and the two become separated when Quiyi escapes imprisonment by hiding in the home of a former client and Xiaoe becomes trained as a uniformed factory worker. Described as belonging to the renaissance of Asian Cinema, \"Blush\" is as much about the challenges faced by women during social upheaval as it is about revolutionary change. Cast includes He Saifei and Wang Zhiwen In Mandarin with English subtitles."
