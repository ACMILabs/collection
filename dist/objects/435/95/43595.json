        "Great A'Tuin is a giant turtle, floating through space, and on his back stand four elephants, on their backs, there rests the Discworld. This is the setting for Terry Pratchett's adventure, the 'Discworld'. In this concluding parte of the story of The Band with Rocks In, the questions are answered; Did the Archchancellor do the rite stuff? Will Death imbibe enough alcohol to forget? And will he ever return to duty? Will The Band with Rocks In get to play a free festival? And can Susan save buddy from the music? This tape includes a twenty minute interview with Terry Pratchett."
