        "This video uses the architecture of yesteryear to analyse what it says about the social, cultural and economic history of Tasmania; Australia's second oldest colony. There is a variety of architecture and classic buildings examined, from grand homes, public buildings, humble cottages and split paling cabins. Produced in consultation with the National Trust, Tasmania, this video will be enjoyed by anyone interested in historic buildings or the history of Tasmania."
