        "The focus of this documentary is the endangered sea eagle. Haliaeetus Leucogaster, or the white bellied sea eagle has suffered a massive decrease in population due to man's presence and encroachment into the eagles' natural habitat. As a result of this intrusion, the birds have had to move from their natural habitat of the seashore to inland lakes and rivers. Director Frank Muscolino follows two pairs of sea eagles who have made this inland migration and are nesting in the Yan Yean reservoir. It was a project that took him five years. Frank also films sea eagles at Eildon and Metung, both in Victoria."
