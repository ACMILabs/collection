        "With \"Gabbeh\" Mohsen Makhmalbaf creates a romantic parable of universal resonance. A gabbeh is an Iranian carpet produced by the nomadic Ghashghai tribe of southern Iran. This episodic tale is framed with exquisite interludes on the colours of nature, painting each scene with landscapes and vistas of breathtaking beauty."
