        "Producer/director/author and broadcaster Nigel Farrell leaves the chaos of the city in his Morris-Minor in search of the perfect, tranquil, village. Does it exist? Nigel is determined to find out. On his mission he locates beautiful villages in Sussex, Wiltshire, Devon, Essex and North Yorkshire, none of which seems to fit his impression of the perfect village. Nigel does eventually solve the puzzle of a tranquil idyll, but not where you expect it."
