        "A film of the Royal Melbourne show as seen through the eyes of a family group. Grandfather, a retired farmer, takes his daughter and her two teenage children to the show. To people like breeders of livestock, farmers and agricultural equipment salesmen, the show is an important yearly event, but for the family there is something to interest each member. Cooking demonstrations, displays of horsermanship, and the extensive pavilions showing domestic pets as well as farm animals all have their appeal."
