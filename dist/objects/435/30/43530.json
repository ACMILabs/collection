        "Cameraman and director Frank Muscolino spent seven years in the Great Dividing Range and foothills recording the life cycle of a pair of eagles. There are four eagles in total that he follows, one pair lives in thick forest of the Great Dividing Range near Mount Disappointment. The second pair live in quite a different situation, nesting near farm land and having plenty of access to food. The director is able to win the trust of these majestic birds of prey, thus allowing him to capture close ups of mating, nest building and chicks growing up and being nurtured."
