        "This is a gangster movie quite like no other which is more concerned with character study, friendship and betrayal. Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp), also known as Joe the Jeweller, befriends Mafia small man and former assassin Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino). Lefty sees in the young Donnie a chance to rise in the Mafia ranks, something the aging Lefty, with his drug addicted son and passive wife is no longer capable of. Unbeknown to Lefty, Donnie Brasco is an under cover special agent, working with the FBI to infiltrate the New York Mafia underworld. What at first seems a simple case of undercover work is complicated by Donnie's genuine feelings of friendship towards Lefty and Lefty's loyalty towards Donnie. Based on the book by Joseph D. Pistone with Richard Woodley. Also starring Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo and Anne Heche."
