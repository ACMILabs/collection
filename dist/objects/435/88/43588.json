        "This tape contains two short documentaries about the culture surrounding football. \"Game girls\" (directed by Miriam Cannell), follows the role of women in Australian football and the often silent but loudly significant role they have played. Rated PG. \"Heathens\" (directed by Megan Spencer), confirms that there are really passionate and vitriolic supporters out there as director Megan Spencer follows St Kilda supporters with names like Thommo and Chook. Watch out for the language, which is alot more colourful than the red white and black. Rated R, for reasons which become very apparent from the first five seconds."
