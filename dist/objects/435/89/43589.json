        "This comic melodrama follows a group of maladjusted scriptwriters who work together on 'The Love Judge', a trashy daytime TV show set in a California divorce court. Mark is still grieving for his lover Kenny, but he's in with a chance for a production job and is besotted with Bill who's just broken up with his girlfriend. Leslie prefers Ben, the photocopier repair man while the boss Jo is preoccupied with the mysterious stains on her office couch. Fully of campily enjoyable scenes, the film is also genuinely touching. Glatzer delineates a complex set of relationships with assurance in this well structured, carefully nuanced film."
