        "This documentary proposes that the Hemp plant (Cannabis Sativa Marijuana) could be the solution to several of our major environmental problems. It would meen a shift from the present unsustainable, petrochemical-based economy towards a sustainable plant based economy. A move which could only occur if the drug was legalized. This programme covers the history and varied usage of the plant as well as alternative options in response to the \"war on drugs\". Interviews feature Dr Andrew Weil, Dr Lester Grinspoon, Terence McKenna, Dr Kate Short, Professor Peter Dale Scott, Dr Andrew Katelaris and Gatewood Galbraith."
