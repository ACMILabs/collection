        "Episode of Series \"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection\". In the year 2000, a 10 millimeter meteorite that was moving close to the speed of light smashed into Antarctica. This collision resulted in massive environmental changes and the death of nearly half the population of Earth. It was also the herald of the Angels, a group of malevolent space aliens. After 15 years, the Angels have returned, but mankind hasn't been idle. Gigantic artificial life forms called Evangelion have been developed. However, these genetically engineered life forms require a human 'brain', and not just anyone will do. The 'brain' must be a 14 year old, that is, someone who was born 9 months after the Angels first appeared. Shinji Ikari is one such person. For years he was ignored by his father, who was busy at NERV, the organization that is responsible for the development of the Eva units. One day he is called by his father to come to NERV headquarters located in, or rather under, Toyko 3. Shinji does not really get along with his father, and does not find it simple to make friends, but he is one of the very few people in the world that can pilot an Evangelion unit. At the same time NERV struggles to pierce the veil of mystery surrounding the enigmatic Angels. Why was the Earth attacked? And why were the only Evangelion-qualified pilots all born exactly nine months after the meteor's destructive impact? Dubbed in English. Also available on DVD [319275]."
