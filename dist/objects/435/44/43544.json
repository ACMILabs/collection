        "In this world there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it (Oscar Wilde). Stephen Fry stars as Oscar Wilde, one of the most controversial writers of our time. A man brimming with wit and honesty, but a life tragically plagued by scandal. This video traces the rise and fall of Oscar, including; his relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas, \"Bosie\" (Jude Law), and the loving relationships he had with his devoted wife, Constance (Jennifer Ehle) and two children, and his publicized trial and imprisonment. What emerges is a portrait of a man of incredible literary talent, fierce love and passion, loved by those of whom he gave his affection but ultimately denigrated by conservative society for his perceived amoral and hedonistic lifestyle."
