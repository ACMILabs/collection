        "Based on the cartoon series, \"George of the jungle\" is an action/comedy version of the characters created by Jay Ward. George (Brendan Fraser) is lost to the jungle as a young boy and is subsequently raised by apes and other jungle creatures. As George grows to manhood it transpires that he is a brave but none too bright young man. An intrepid American woman, Ursula Stanhope, travels to the jungle to satisfy her longing for adventurous experiences. Stanhope's snobbish boorish fiancee follows her to the jungle and becomes embroiled in a tug-of-war with George for Stanhopes' affection. But can George leave his gentle animal family for the urban jungle of San Francisco? The comedy is broad and slapstick in style, with Fraser revelling in the pratfalls of the lead role. Also featuring the voice of John Cleese (as Ape the ape) and 1970s blaxploitation icon Richard Roundtree."
