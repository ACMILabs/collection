        "A mind bending film that melds 3D and 2D animation, science fiction, 20th century pop culture, and, most prominently, hip-hop. \"Wave twisters\" was the idea of superstar hip-hop DJ Qbert, who created an album, \"Wave twisters\", which he hoped to fashion into a film of sorts. Three years later it became a reality with this film that is set entirely to the soundtrack of his album. The story joins the Inter Dental Space Commander and his assistants, Honey and Rubbish, who are having a messy day at work when their spaceship comes under attack from the thuggish Redworm. The Dental Space Commander and his assistants escape with the prized artefact the Wave Twister, which came from the hip-hop planet Quasar 16.33.45.78. The band of heroes, with B-Boy Grandpa, go to the planet hoping to revive the lost arts of hip-hop (scratching, rapping, breakdancing, and graffiti) which has been outlawed by the tyrannical Lord Ook and enforced by his Octobots and the master turntablism of DJ QBert, D-Styles, and Yoga Frog. Full of references to the new (virus scanners, internet, music downloads), and old (muscle cars, old video games, and schlocky science fiction), \"Wave twisters\" is a film that is a must for hip-hop and animation fans alike."
