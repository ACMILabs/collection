        "This film was made in 1967. For 14 years it was banned by the censorship. In choosing its present form I am treating it as a diary to see if along this ago record and jottings from spring 1981 can answer the questions: Who were we? Who are we?...Jerzy Skolimowski Jerzy Skolimowski, Polish filmmaker renowned for his political messages and innovative filmmaking, wrote, directed and starred in this rather unusual, somewhat surreal, and yet quite compelling film. The plot centres around five doctors (four men and a woman) who meet up at a medical school reunion during the mid-sixties, ten years after their graduation. A set of circumstances eventually leads the five to finding themselves on board a sealed railway carriage where a drama of a psychological kind begins to be played out by each of the protagonists. Bitter memories of the Stalinist Communist regime which ruled Poland during the 1950s and the effects it had on their profession are re-enacted over and over in their minds and are played out in a drunken haze as each of the five try to come to terms with the past. Cast includes Jerzy Skolimowski, Joanna Szczerbic, Tadeusz Lomnicki, Adam Hanuszkiewicz, Bogumil Kobiela, Margarethe von Trotta, with guest appearances by Alan Bates, Fred Zinneman, Jane Asher, David Essex."
