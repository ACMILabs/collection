        "Three shorts from famed comic duo, Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel. \"County hospital\": When Oliver accidentally breaks his leg, Stanley visits him in hospital wreaking chaos on the hospital and his sick friend. Once ejected for the ensuing havoc they've created, Stan drives home perilously unaware that he is under the influence of a powerful sedative. \"Them thar hills\": Heading up to the hills for a health jaunt to alleviate Ollie's gout, Stan and Ollie drink from a stream tainted with bootleg liquor. As the two friends make lunch in an increasingly inebriated state, they encounter a married couple in need of fuel. Stan and Ollie accidentally get the wife drunk, causing the uptight husband to fly into a terrible rage. \"Tit for tat\": Stan and Ollie buy an electrical goods store and fall into a bitter rivalry with the grocers across the way, each attempting to sabotage the other's business. The owners of the grocery store are the same married couple that Ollie and Stan encountered on the mountain in \"Them thar hills\"."
