        "Directed by one of the few women to have become prominent in China's film industry, this film depicts the head-on collision between socialist and market ethics in 1980s Beijing through the work and romantic lives of a group of young adults. The equilibrium between three friends who work as bus conductors is disturbed as they seize upon new challenges and opportunities that open up to them as a result of economic reforms. Cast includes Ma Xiaoqing and Wang Quan'an. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
