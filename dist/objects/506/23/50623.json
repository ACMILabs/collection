        "Episode of Series \"The Avengers\". The Town of no return: Steed and Mrs Peel are sent to the sleepy seaside town of Little Bazeley to investigate the disappearance of four agents. In a town where nobody is what they seem, Peel and Steed disguise themselves as a primary school teacher and property developer and stay at a local hotel called the Gremlin. The highlight of the episode is a leather clad Peel tied down with horse riding apparel. \"The Gravediggers\": there's interference in sector three on the radar, leading to a fear of undetected nuclear weapons. Steed and Mrs Peel head to the town of Prinby, located in the heart of sector three and the burial place of Dr Hubert Marlowe, recently deceased expert in the field. Peel goes undercover as a Nurse at a hospice for railwaymen while Steed visits the benefactor of the establishment. Highlights of the episode include a miniature train ride and Mrs Peel tied to the railway tracks, complete with accompanying music, fitting for a damsel in distress. \"The Cybernauts\": three electronics experts are killed by a tall man with brute strength and the number is increasing. They all had an appointment with the Harachi Corporation, an electronics company who have created a new circuit element for transistors. The trail leads Steed and Mrs Peel to United Automation where a wheelchair bound scientist is building an army of radio controlled cybernauts. A highlight of the episode involves Mrs Peel doing karate - in a skirt."
