        "Production of this landmark film began in 1948 but was halted by the Kuomintang authorities when they discovered that the submitted script was not being followed and was heavily anti-KMT. In the interval before it resumed production in September 1949, it was rewritten to be even more hostile to KMT authorities. The film centres on the joys and disasters experienced by the inhabitants of a boarding house comandeered by a KMT official. The film's basic form is derived from the modern drama tradition of China. The casual naturalism has been compared with neo-realism. Cast includes Zhao Dan, Wu Yin ans Sun Daolin. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
