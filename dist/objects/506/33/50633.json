        "Roy Amundsen (Robert Skjaerstad) suffers from dubious personal hygiene and a terminal sense of curiosity. While on his daily postal rounds, Roy discovers a set of keys belonging to a beautiful deaf woman, Line (Andrine Saether). With the same lack of scruples that allows him to read and dump other people's mail, Roy lets himself into her apartment, and unwittingly unravels a dangerous secret. Before long Roy is entangled in an ominous chain of events - a mugging, a suicide attempt, a sack of money, and a hilariously lacklustre performance of 'Born To Be Wild' in a karaoke bar. Combining equal parts realism and black humour, 'Junkmail' (Winner of the Critics Week Prize, Cannes Film Festival 1997), is part of a new wave of Scandinavian filmmaking that highlights the bleakness and eccentricity of northern life. Through his choice of run-down locations and hopeless characters, director Pal Sletaune has created both a sense of foreboding and oppression, and a gentle and sympathetic humour. In Norwegian with English subtitles."
