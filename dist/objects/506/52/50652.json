        "Set in 1996 at the time of the Bill Clinton re-election era, \"Bulworth\" is a political satire about one man's re-invigorated will and desire to live. Bulworth (Warren Beatty) is a corrupt senator, campaigning for re-election within a system dominated by business investments, right-wing interests and concerns of the wealthy. Jaded, depressed, disillusioned and disgusted with himself and those around him, Bulworth takes out life insurance of 10 million dollars then orders a hit on himself. The knowledge that he only has 48 hours to live spurs Bulworth to speak freely and honestly to his constituents, laying bare the corruption, greed and self-serving nature of American politics. The fallout from these events is mammoth and quite unexpected for Bulworth and those that surround him. Bulworth's revived will to live honestly and with integrity is reflected in his embracing of Afro-American rap culture, a move that confounds his staff and the public. \"Bulworth\" astounded audiences upon it release with its sharp and witty script, and scathing denouncing of American politics. Beatty won an Oscar nomination for his script that he collaborated on with Jeremy Pikser."
