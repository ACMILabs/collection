        "Directed by Stephen Frears (High Fidelity, The Van, The Grifters, The Snapper) \"Liam\" is the story of a working class Catholic family, living in Liverpool in the 1930s. Liam (Anthony Borrows), is a seven year old boy, whose parents, older sister and brother, live in conditions that could best be described as poor but happy. Liam's father (Ian Hart) works on the Liverpool docks, a job he holds with great pride. Liam is a mostly silent child, pathologically shy with a terrible stutter. With his First Holy Communion looming, Liam faces his religious fears as he is constantly reminded of the fires of hell awaiting sinners. Meanwhile Teresa, Liam's sister, has been employed by a wealthy Jewish family as a maid and faces a moral dilemma as she becomes embroiled in the extra-marital affairs of her boss. When Liam's father loses work, his world is thrown into chaos, and looking for direction Dad is drawn to fascism. Con, Liam's brother, threatens Dad's role as breadwinner as he is employed and keeping the family afloat financially. Liam's mother gallantly tries to hold the family unit together in the face of ensuing violence and division. Written by Jimmy McGovern (Priest, Go now)."
