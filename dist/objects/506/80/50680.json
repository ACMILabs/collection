        "A young group of Scarfies (local slang for students at Otago University, Dunedin) move into a squat but get more than they bargain for after discovering a crop of marijuana in the basement. Their initial exuberance gives way to panic when the owner returns for his crop. The group lock him into the basement while they figure out what to do. Starting as a light comedy, \"Scarfies\" shifts a gear and becomes increasingly black, resulting in a nightmarish thriller where the central characters' morale and logic having fallen apart give way to desperate behaviour. Cast includes: Willa O'Neill, Neill Rea, Ashleigh Seagar, Taika Cohen, Charlie Bleakley, John Brazier, Mark Neilson and Mark Dudfield."
