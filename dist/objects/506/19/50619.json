        "A successful career woman, the manager of a Chinese-Japanese joint venture sesame oil factory, seeks comfort from the stress of her business, a violent, alcoholic husband, and a mentally retarded son in the arms of a married man. When the young girl she has arranged to marry her son discovers her affair, she responds with sympathy to her future mother-in-law's problems. A surprisingly close relationship develops between the two women as they struggle together against tradition and circumstance to take control of their lives. Cast includes Siqin Gaowa, Wu Yujuan, Lei Kesheng and Chen Baoguo. The film won the Golden Bear and Film Critic awards at the 43rd Berlin Film Festival 1993. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
