        "The second feature by Christopher Nolan accomplishes what seems impossible: to tell a movie backwards. Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a former Insurance Investigator whose successful career was cut short by a violent incident which deprived him of his ability to make new memories, transforming his life into an epic quest for vengeance. But his mental condition makes him vulnerable to those who would take advantage, and the lengths to which he'll go to give his life some logic prove frightening. A disorienting but ultimately ingenious thriller. Cast also includes Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss."
