        "With many small villages in rural China lacking funding for education, country teachers are hired with poor salaries and limited benefits. The national government encourages young teachers from the city to volunteer their services in these rural areas to overcome teaching shortages. This touching and sensitive film focuses on the efforts of one such dedicated young teacher to gain government funding to attract more qualified teachers to her small village school. Set in a remote, mountainous region of China, the film documents daily life in the village, through the teacher's evolving relationship with the local children and elders. Cast includes Li Baotian, Ju Xue, Xiu Zongdi and Wang Xueqi. (Awards: Best Feature Film, Best Actor at the 14th Golden Rooster Awards 1994.) In Mandarin with English subtitles."
