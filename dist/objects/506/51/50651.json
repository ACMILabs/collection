        "This powerful Polish drama about the methodical, psychological brutalization of a woman prisoner in totalitarian 1950s Warsaw was originally banned on its release in 1982 by the Polish government (then under martial law) who declared it to be inflammatory and dangerous. Director Ryszard Bugajski escaped to Canada with a smuggled copy of the film enabling him to show it at various film festivals until 1990 when the Cannes Film Festival awarded its Best Actress Award to Krystyna Janda for her riveting performance in the leading role of Tonia Dziwisz. Tonia is married, a cabaret singer out to enjoy life, rather naive and A-political. After a drunken one night stand with a military officer Tonia awakens the morning after to find herself in a prison cell with several other women prisoners, and with no knowledge as to how and why she is there. The story takes a chilling turn and we are witness to some of the most horrifying abuse and torture, relentless in its intensity and disturbing in its graphically realistic images. The vicious interrogations which Tonia is continually subjected to only increase her inner strength to survive, to maintain her dignity and her sanity and to never give up. As harrowing and confronting as it may be, this film is compulsory viewing, brilliant in its directing and its cast with Janusz Gajos and Adam Ferency in the roles of the interrogators - Gajos as the meticulous but sadistically cruel Citizen Major and Ferency as the second but more sympathetic interrogator, Morawsky. \"Interrogation\" will stay with you long after you have seen it. Cast also includes Agnieszke Holland and Anna Romantowska. WARNING: CONTAINS MANY DISTURBING IMAGES, VIOLENCE AND NUDITY."
