        "Directed by Garry Marshall \"Pretty woman\" was the film that helped make a star of American actress Julia Roberts. Originally conceived as a film with a much darker tone, \"Pretty woman\" is a fairly light-hearted comedy. Edward Lewis, (Richard Gere) a businessman whose speciality is company takeovers, is on assignment in LA when he picks up a prostitute, Viv (Roberts), for the night. In the morning Lewis decides he likes what he sees and decides to hire Viv for a week's round of polo parties and sex. Despite being somewhat gauche in her dress and manner, Viv is groomed for the part of the society lady, in a Pygmalion like transformation. Challenges ensue for the couple as they take a liking to one another beyond the bounds of their business arrangement. Each is drawn to the possibility that at the week's end their partnership may blossom into a relationship. Also stars Laura San Giacomo as Viv's housemate (also a prostitute) and Jason Alexander who plays Lewis' sleazy lawyer. This special edition version of \"Pretty woman\" is the director's cut."
