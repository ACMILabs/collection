        "Produced and directed by Alexander Korda, \"The Private life of Don Juan\" was to be screen legend Douglas Fairbanks' final film. Fairbanks was a star of the silent era whose fame was much diminished when he made this comedy, one of his few lead roles in a talkie. In the film aging lover and womaniser Don Juan returns to his hometown of Seville, only to discover that a young rogue has been wooing ladies in his name. Don is determined to regain his crown but has difficulty convincing locals that he is the legendary lothario. As Don Juan, Fairbanks appears to be reflecting his own status as an icon of a by-gone era, a man past his prime, longing for the passion and energy of youth. In imitation of many of his silent era roles, Fairbanks is depicted swashbuckling along streets and swinging gallantly through windows. Merle Oberone stars as Antonita, a beautiful dancer who Don is determined to seduce."
