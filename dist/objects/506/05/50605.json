        "One of the first Chinese films to be selected to participate in the Berlin International Film Festival, 'Xiang Qing' set a new standard in Chinese film realism. Made on location in Guangong Province, the film tells the story of a young man who has been brought up in the country by a foster mother. On registering to marry his childhood sweetheart, a foster child from the same family, he suddenly discovers his true identity and is reunited with his real parents, high ranking city officials from whom he was separated at birth. The film deals with the discrepancies between rural and city life, and the conflicting loyalties the young man feels towards his two families. Cast: Xiaolei Huang, Yexiang Ren, Wenghua Wu, Zhong Deng. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
