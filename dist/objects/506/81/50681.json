        "Brian De Palma's \"The Fury\" is a schizophrenic genre fusion of horror, action, political intrigue and supernatural thriller. De Palma revisits the realm of telekinesis which he first explored in Carrie (1976), giving it a kinetic spin this time around. Kirk Douglas plays Peter Sanza, a government agent who's psychic son Robin (Andrew Stevens) is kidnapped while they are on holiday in the middle east. Fearing for his own life Peter goes into hiding and enlists the help of another Psychic (William Finley) to help him track down his son. Meanwhile Chicago teenager Gillian (Amy Irving) enrols into the Paragon Institute for Psychic research as she struggles to control her unruly telekinetic powers. However Gillian soon finds herself in danger as she begins to uncover a government plot involving her and Peter's son Robin. Cast includes: John Cassavetes, Carrie Snodgress, Charles Durning, Fiona Lewis."
