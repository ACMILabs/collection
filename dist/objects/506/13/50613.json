        "In China, shortly after the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II, a small group of Chinese soldiers encounter a large group of starving Japanese soldiers hiding in a remote cave. Cut off from outside contact, they do not know that the war is over. There follows a tense standoff, as the Chinese soldiers try, unsuccessfully, to convince the Japanese to surrender. This intense saga is conveyed in a taciturn, almost abstract, symmetrical style which never plays up the sensationalism of the subject nor privileges a particular point-of-view. Rather Ziniu lets the images provide eloquent testimony to the cruelty and violence that ensues. One of the 5th Generation of contemporary Chinese film directors, Wu Ziniu won the Silver Bear Award at the 19th Berlin International Film Festival for \"Evening bell\". Cast includes Tao Zeru, Zhao Qi, Peipei Chong and Sun Min. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
