        "Episode three of the American television mini-series adaptation of Frank Herbert's cult novel \"Dune.\" In the final instalment of the series Paul has become Maud'dib - leader of the Freman peoples - and is fated to lead them into battle against the Harkonnen rulers. All the contingents of the universe call for a war against the Fremen, who are turning themselves into a fierce guerrilla group. Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, continues to live among the Freman, having borne a daughter who possesses powers beyond her years. At the palace, Baron Harkonnen and his nephew Rabban battle over the leadership of the planet, whilst the Fremen people sabotage the spice industry, destabilising the Harkonnen rule. Stylishly designed, this series has an impressive aesthetic quality, ably capturing the otherworldliness of the book's milieu, enhanced by extensive use of CGI. The mini-series format allows for a greater exploration of Herbert's saga than the film version \"Dune\" (Lynch, 1984). Like much science fiction, this futuristic tale has medieval and Biblical overtones with exotic sets, bizarre costumes and stilted dialogue that tends toward the florid and metaphoric. An interesting and engaging series. Cast includes William Hurt, Alec Newman, Saskia Reeves, James Watson, Jan Vlasak, Giancarlo Giannini."
