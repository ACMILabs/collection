        "A lively comedy by Australian filmmaker, and Swinburne graduate, Robert Luketic. Reese Witherspoon stars as fashion merchandising graduate, Elle Woods, eagerly anticipating a marriage proposal from her politically ambitious boyfriend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis). When he dumps her to search for a woman more suited to the role of senator's wife, Elle sets out to win him back. Determined to improve her chances by becoming his intellectual equal, she enrols into Harvard Law School after her vibrant application impresses the admissions board. Her Southern Californian Bimbo appearance, bubbly personality and casual approach to study set her apart from the other Ivy League students. Initially an outcast, Elle's blonde ambition eventually secures her reputation as a force to be reckoned with, propelling her to the top of her class. Cast also includes: Luke Wilson, Selma Blair and Raquel Welch. Screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, based on the book by Amanda Brown. Cinematography, Anthony B. Richmond."
