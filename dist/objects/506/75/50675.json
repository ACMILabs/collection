    "description": [
        "In production at the same time as \"Cop shop\", \"The Sullivans\" proved to be phenomenally successful for Crawford Productions running for six years (1115 episodes, 1976-1982) and exported to over 70 countries. \"The Sullivans\" whet the British appetite for Australian soap and paved the way for a long and healthy relationship between Australian soap (Prisoner, Neighbours, Home and Away) and British viewers. Originally screened on Channel 9, most production took place in the Melbourne suburb of Canterbury due to its proximity to the studios. The series prided itself on historical accuracy and was from the perspective of an \"average\" Australian family and their experience on the home front during World War II - Dave and Grace Sullivan, their only daughter Kitty, and sons Tom, Jo, and Terry. Also populating the family's milieu are nosy neighbour Mrs Jessup, Dave's pub companion and war buddy, Norm, and local publican Maggie Hayward. This DVD contains the first four episodes of the series and depicts the countdown to war: beginning September 1939, the third last day of peace. Kitty and Terry lose their father's watch whilst trespassing on the hermit's property that Mrs Jessup is horrified to discover Kitty has befriended. Mrs Jessup takes on new boarders with a mysterious past and the family of Jo Sullivan's fiancee, Anna, are being persecuted because of their German origins. Also included on the disk is the episode \"The Court martial\" in which Mel Gibson guest stars as Lieutenant Ray Henderson who has to represent Kitty's friend, Eddie, charged with being a deserter. Cast includes Lorraine Bayly, Paul Cronin, Vivean Grey, Susan Hannaford, Andrew McFarlane, Ingrid Mason, Richard Morgon, Steven Tandy and Norman Yemm."
