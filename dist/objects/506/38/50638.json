        "The third film version of the Raymond Chandler novel (after Murder My Sweet (1944) and The Falcon Takes Over (1942)) with Marlowe (Robert Mitchum) in search of the missing girlfriend of a brutish ex-con recently released from jail. The film pays homage to the noir thrillers of the 1940s with immaculately recreated settings and the casting of Mitchum who made his name as an actor in such classics. Mitchum takes on Marlowe's world-weary persona with ease and while the pace of the film occasionally lags, strong performances, a moody colour palette full of dark browns and shadows, and labyrinthine plot turns keep it interesting."
