        "Filmmaker Sally Potter returns to her dancing roots ('The Golddiggers' was her first musical) by casting herself as a film director suffering from writer's block who sets out to take tango lessons from a Paris-based teacher (Pablo Veron, playing himself). Veron has always dreamed of being in a movie and Sally is starting to dream of a film about tango. Potter's film is divided into twelve lessons during which the two protagonists learn about each other, fight over who is leading who, start a love story, and eventually end up in Buenos Aires to learn from the tango masters. The film is shot mostly in black and white, except for some dream sequences in which Sally fantasizes about an ill-fated film project. Veron performs many modern dance numbers, including tap and ballroom dancing, as part of his tango repertoire."
