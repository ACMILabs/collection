        "Unhappy with her job and her loser boyfriend, Tess McGill takes a secretarial position at a major Wall Street firm. Her boss, Katherine Parker, is an outwardly affable yuppie whose grinning visage hides a wicked and larcenous propensity for exploiting the ideas of her employees. While Parker is incapacitated, Tess is compelled by circumstances to pose as her boss. Her inborn business acumen and common sense enable Tess to rise to the top of New York's financial circles, and along the way she wins the love of executive, Jack Turner. Things threaten to take a sorry turn when Parker returns, but it is she who suffers from the consequences of her own past duplicity. Cast includes: Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver, Joan Cusack, Alec Baldwin, Philip Bosco, Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt and Olympia Dukakis. Music, Carly Simon. Editing, Sam O'Steen. Script, Kevin Wade. Cinematography, Michael Ballhaus."
