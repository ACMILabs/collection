        "Episode of Series \"The Avengers\". Death at bargain prices: When a murdered agent is found carrying a receipt from the children's section of Pinter's department store Mrs Peel finds herself working in lingerie. Steed discovers the mysterious disappearance of food from the store as well as regular customer Professor Popple. \"Castle De'ath\": Mrs Peel goes undercover as a publicity consultant with ABORCASHAAT (Advisory Bureau on Refurbishing Castles and Stately Homes as a Tourist Attraction) at De'ath Castle; Steed is a kilt wearing historian investigating the 13th Laird of De'ath, Black Jimmy. There's ghosts of traitors past, mysterious pipers, a dungeon and plenty of tartan from the Avengers. Gordon Jackson stars. \"The Master minds\": When Sir Clive Todd is found to be involved with a string of burglaries the government is keen to solve matters quietly and quickly. Mrs Peel plays Florence Nightingale to the amnesiac Sir Clive who was shot in the latest robbery and Steed attempts to find the mastermind behind the successful outfit."
