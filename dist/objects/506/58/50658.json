        "Episode two of the American television mini-series adaptation of Frank Herbert's cult novel \"Dune.\" Having ruthlessly taken over the planet Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen hands over the reigns to his brutal nephew Rabban, who instantaneously starts to rule the planet with an iron fist, in contrast to Atreides' benevolent approach. Atreides' partner and son, believed dead, have taken refuge in the desert with the Fremen, a nomadic tribe for whom Paul swiftly becomes a leader. Paul strengths as a visionary are increased as he starts to comprehend his destiny and becomes affected by the power of the spice. Back at headquarters the treachery continues amidst those who seek power and glory. Stylishly designed, this series has an impressive aesthetic quality, ably capturing the otherworldliness of the book's milieu, enhanced by extensive use of CGI. The mini-series format allows for a greater exploration of Herbert's saga than the film version \"Dune\" (Lynch, 1984). Like much science fiction, this futuristic tale has medieval and Biblical overtones with exotic sets, bizarre costumes and stilted dialogue that tends toward the florid and metaphoric. An interesting and engaging series. Cast includes William Hurt, Alec Newman, Saskia Reeves, James Watson, Jan Vlasak, Giancarlo Giannini."
