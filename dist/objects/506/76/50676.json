        "New doctor Harry Callaghan (Andrew McFarlane) arrives for his first day of work with the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) at Coopers Crossing, resplendent in his white suit. At the same time, New Yorker Liz Drever (Lorna Patterson) makes travel arrangements with her mother to visit the \"land down under.\" Immediately flying to an emergency with local legend and resident Doctor Harry Sinclair (Keith Eden), the brash Dr. Callaghan finds himself struggling to break through a seemingly impenetrable veneer of locals to gain acceptance, particularly after what transpires on his first day. Presented here is the original four-hour mini series as the medics of Coopers Crossing contend with an array of medical complaints and social situations, not afraid to shy away from topical issues such as domestic abuse, racism and unionism, albeit conservatively. Originally screened in 1985, the series ran successfully on Australian television (and over 50 countries overseas) for five years at a total of 221 episodes - was briefly revived in 1992 as \"RFDS\" - but only lasted 3 episodes. The series proved profitable for the real RFDS of Australia who earned royalties from the series as well as international exposure. Features a glittering array of Australian actors as regulars and guest stars, including Bill Hunter, Maureen Edwards, Gil Tucker, Lenore Smith, Steve Bisley, Pat Evison, Max Cullen, Maurie Fields, Val Jellay and Bruce Barry to name just a few. Series written by Terry Stapleton."
