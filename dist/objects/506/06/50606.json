        "Three loggers raft down a river in Hunan province. The picturesque scenery belies their harsh experiences: a painful reunion with a former lover for one; the loss by the youngest of his fiancee to another man; the struggle of a middle-aged father to make ends meet. Underlying the drama is the now recurrent theme in Chinese cinema of the hardships faced by the people during the Cultural Revolution, here expressed in very human terms. Cast includes Li Wei, T'ao Yu-ling and Sung Bao-sen. The film is also known as \"Uncharted river\" and \"On a river without navigation marks\". In Mandarin with English subtitles."
