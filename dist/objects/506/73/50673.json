        "A 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California. It was one man's love, his passion, and his fault he didn't lock the garage when Ferris Bueller wanted the day off. One day, towards the end of his senior year, Ferris (Matthew Broderick), cuts school and heads for downtown Chicago with his girl Sloane and his best friend Cameron, to show what a little ingenuity, a lot of nerve, and a red Ferrari can do. From John Hughes comes a contemporary comedy which follows Ferris' wildly audacious and nearly flawless plan to take it easy. Featuring a soundtrack from artists including Yello, Big Audio Dynamite, Sigue Sigue Sputnik, The Beat, The Beatles and The Dream Academy. Also stars Alan Ruck and Mia Sara. Cinematography, Tak Fujimoto. Script, John Hughes."
