        "From humble beginnings the Tropfest film festival first ran in 1993 at the Tropicana Caffe in Sydney's Darlinghurst. The festival was founded by actor/director John Polson. In it's tenth year Tropfest has swelled considerably. In 2002 the Intel Tropfest attracted an audience of over 100,000 in Australia (90,000 were at the Sydney screening alone!). The festival attracted a record amount of entries totalling 611 of which 16 finalists were screened. Each year a theme is set for entrants to the festival - this year's theme was 'Match'. This video contains the works of the 16 finalists of 2002 and includes the following titles: \"Hommes du jour\" (dir. Brian Moses); \"The Arsonist's riddle\" (dir. Ben West); \"Boomerring\" (dir. Carla Drago); \"Late night shopper\" (dir. Tim Bullock); \"The Flying nut\" (dir. Dean White); \"Lamb\" (dir. Emma Freeman); \"Wilfred\" (dir. Tony Rogers); \"Murbah swamp beer\" (dir. Gary Doust); \"The Thing in the roof\" (dir. Walter Repich); \"FA\" (dir. Marie Craven); \"Tragic love\" (dir. Gary Eck); \"Tiny little pieces\" (dir. Trent O'Donnell and Phil Lloyd); \"Clouds weep on the greenness\" (dir. Suda Narayana); \"Matchbox\" (dir. Julius Avery); \"How am I driving\" (dir. Tim Dean); \"I Can't get started\" (dir. Charles Williams). Website: www.tropfest.com"
