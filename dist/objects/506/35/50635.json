        "'Whatever' is a coming-of-age film set in the mundane suburbia of New Jersey in the early 1980s. Anna (Liza Weill) hopes she will never be ordinary. Her dream is to escape to an art school in New York. Brenda, (Chad Morgan) her best friend, is both an exciting companion and a destructive force. Together they explore sex, drugs and rock'n roll, their experiences often proving less than positive. Anna comes to realise that the road to adulthood can involve some hard decisions, and that friendships can't always last forever. With a soundtrack that includes Blondie, The Ramones, Motorhead and The Patti Smith Group, 'Whatever' portrays a gritty slice of suburban teenage life."
