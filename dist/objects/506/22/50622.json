        "Despite 'accident prevention' campaigns, millions of cars continue to crash each year. This documentary argues that legislation needs to be introduced to address better safety standards in car and highway designs. Uses footage of highway crashes, controlled safety tests, and potential highway hazards to demonstrates how injury and property damage can be reduced through design. Demonstrates features designed to reduce personal injury such as seat belts, air bags, laminated windscreens, padded daashboards, shock absorbing steering columns, anchored seats and head rests. Also looks at highway design, demonstrating good and bad examples of traffic islands, barriers, signage poles and lamp posts."
