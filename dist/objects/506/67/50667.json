        "Denzel Washington stars in this true life story of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, a top ranking boxing champion many people thought would be the next world champion. One night on leaving a nightclub with a fellow patron, he is pulled up by the police and accused of murdering 3 people. Despite professing his innocence and a lack of police evidence as well as motive, Carter is given 3 consecutive life sentences in prison. What was very clear to some was that this was a case based on racism and revenge, resting in the mind of a disturbed police officer who had it in for Rubin since he was 11. Having twice had his appeal and right to a re-trial turned down, it is not until Rubin receives a letter from Lesra that his luck and life begins to change. Lesra discovers a copy of \"The Sixteenth round\", a book written by Rubin, in a second hand book store. Reading the book inspires the youngster, who, along with the help of three friends decides to devote their time and money to getting Rubin a fair trial. Denzel Washington received an Oscar nomination for best Actor at the 1999 Academy Awards for his excellent portrayal of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter."
