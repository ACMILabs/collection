        "The Powder room journeys through a number of ladies restrooms throughout Canada and the United States, interviewing women and capturing through their tales an often invisible part of our cultural life. Through observations of her own, director Ann Kennard felt the need to document this female ritual and in doing so manages to explore an important way in which women socialise and impart information about their personal lives. The intimacies and morals of women find their way into the bathroom and therefore find a voice and an antidote to their isolation. Subjects discussed include sexuality, orgasm, dating, sex, boyfriends, infidelity, teenage pregnancy, sexual attitudes, body image, sexual practices."
