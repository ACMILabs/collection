        "Neither a feature film or documentary, \"Home of the brave\" is a concert film, essentially a record of Laurie Anderson's \"Mister Heartbreak\" tour of 1986. Joined by some exemplary performers, Anderson's legendary show combines computer synthesized music, video, slides and provocative monologues. Having an international reputation since the 1970's for her use of cutting edge technology in her avant garde performances and music, Anderson is on show with some of her most well-known and energised works to date. Featuring William S. Burroughs as himself with his introduction to Sharkey's Night, Won-Sang and Sang-Won Park delivering dialogue accompanied with traditional Japanese instrument, the kayageum, \"Home of the brave\" presents a poetic collaboration of Western and Asian aesthetics with 'attitude'. Other musicians include: Joy Askew, Adrian Belew, David Van Tieghem, Richard Landay, Richard Landry IV, Dolette McDonald and Janice Pendarvis."
