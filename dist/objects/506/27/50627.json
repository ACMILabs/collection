        "This cult retro-pop-classic based on the book by Nick Hornby takes the audience back to the pop culture of the 80's. Enter the jaded Rob (John Cusack), owner of Championship Vinyl, a man in his late 30's whose passion for music and Peter Pan approach to life has caught up with him. When present girlfriend, Laura (Iben Kjejle), leaves him, he names his top 5 most memorable break-ups. The audience is taken on a loop of youth culture as well as being offered a glimpse into the male view of matters of the heart. The film uses Rob's side-kicks (the \"musical moron twins\"), Dick and Barry (played by Todd Louiso Jack Black respectively), to help play homage to the music scene, never faltering, the two pastiche' musical obsession to new heights, peppering the film with their top 5's and hilarious musical anecdotes and showdowns. With a guest appearance by Bruce Springsteen, the cast is well courted with actors including Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Lisa Bonet, Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Video also includes a 6 minute interview with John Cusack about the making of the film."
