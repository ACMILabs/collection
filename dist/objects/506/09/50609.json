        "Directed by one of China's most prominent female directors this highly expressionistic, psychological drama, based on a true story, focuses on the unconventional career of a famous Chinese Opera actress. Told in flashbacks, the film traces her life on the stage from the 1950s to the 1980s. The initial hostility she receives from the public for embracing male roles, turns to admiration when, defying traditions and conventions, she becomes the first woman to play the lead male role in the Peking Opera. She becomes famous in her role as Zhong Kui, a great mythical character of Chinese theatre. The character gradually takes on a life of its own becoming an alter ego and sounding board for the actress. Impressive performances and cinematographic artistry combine to create a powerful, visually stunning tale. Cast includes Xu Shouli and Li Baotian. In Mandarin with English subtitles."
