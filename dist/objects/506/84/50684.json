        "Episode number 3 of Series \"Prisoner [Cell block H]\". Ep. 600 (dir. Steve Mann, wri. Ian Smith): Top Dog Lou Kelly (Louise Siversen) takes control of the prison and unleashes a reign of bashings, execution and intimidation. The episode culminates in an orchestrated fight to the death between The Freak (Maggie Kirkpatrick) and Rita Connors (Glenda Linscott). \"Ep. 601\" (dir. Kendal Flanagan, wri. Alister Webb): The siege is over and there are repercussions for ringleader Lou. Will anyone break the prisoners code of silence? The search is on for a new Top Dog. \"Ep. 691\" (dir. Sean Nash, wri. Quincy McQuade): Concludes the storyline of the relationship between supporting characters Kath and Merle. Rumours spread of Rita's cancer as well as concern at her purported friendship with The Freak. \"Ep. 692\" (dir. Sean Nash, wri. Marie Trevor, Ian Smith): In the climatic final episode Rita carries out the robbery planned in collaboration with The Freak. Retrieving the money appears hard though as Rita is captured and placed under close observation. Each section of episodes are introduced by Peter McTighe who explains what has transpired in the missing instalments. PLEASE NOTE: date recorded is copyright year and usually preceeds the screening year."
