        "The disillusion of a disappointing marriage leads a young mechanic into a relationship with a fellow motor cyclist in this often perceptive study of masculinity, shot on a small budget in a London working class environment. The homosexuality at the heart of the relationship is sympathetically (for the time) brought into the open, negating the myth of the buddy relationship as a neutral escape route from the role playing in male-female relationships. Based on the novel by Eliot George. Cast includes Colin Campbell, Rita Tushingham and Dudley Sutton."
