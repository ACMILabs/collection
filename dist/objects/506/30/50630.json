    "description": [
        "These three teleplays, produced in 1953, 1954 and 1955 display James Dean's mastery of playing the young angst-ridden loner who longs for a better life for himself. \"Something for an empty briefcase\": A young drifter and ex-jailbird pines to be a respectable gentleman in life, the type who carries a briefcase to work, instead of a thief. One night he meets a young dancer who displays to him that it is possible to live with passion for life, not just for money. \"The unlighted road\": Jeffrey is an ex-army serviceman drifting from small town to small town hoping to find a connection somewhere or with something. One night he is offered a job in a diner but suspects foul play amidst some of the more seedy customers. When Jeffrey falls for a local girl, their future together is threatened by his boss' dodgy dealings. \"I'm a fool\": an older man laments his youthful folly when as a simple farm boy he put on false airs and graces in order to win the attention of the lovely and sophisticated Lucy. Also stars: Natalie Wood. All three short films retain the advertisements from the show's sponsor inserted at intermission."
