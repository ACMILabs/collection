        "Episode number 2 of Series \"Bayside reflections: Port Phillip Bay on film\". Final part of a most comprehensive and fascinating two part history of Port Phillip Bay, dating back from the 1880s to present times and incorporating archival footage, both professional and amateur, to cover over a century of settlement in Port Phillip Bay. Part two focuses on the northern end of Port Phillip Bay, particularly the areas of Port Melbourne and St Kilda reflecting on their maritime histories and the inevitable changes each city has undergone over the last hundred years or so. From the days of royal visits arriving at St Kilda Pier to the huge passenger liners and warships docking at Port Melbourne's Station Pier, through to remembering St Kilda when it was \"the place in which to be seen\" - Melbourne's favourite playground for fun and leisure, swimming and sailing - to today's commercial developments and resident protests to maintain the architectural heritage of both Port Melbourne and St Kilda. Broken up into six segments, this documentary also covers some of the Bay's well-known sea baths, piers and beaches, famous (and some infamous) celebrities, politicians and sporting personalities, historical landmarks, buildings and events and provides some rare and nostalgic images of bygone times. Commentary by Paul Higgins."
