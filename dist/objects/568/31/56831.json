        "An introduction to the basic techniques of recording an event on camera. In the first section a humorous dramatization of a retirement ceremony shows how not to do it. The second section shows how these mistakes can be easily avoided by proper research and planning. A series of graphics is used to demostrate how the program-makers can organize the positioning of camera, lights and participants well in advance of filming. The tape ends with a shorter, punchier, much improved version of thr ceremony."
