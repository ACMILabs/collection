        "Two boys work part-time packing fish on the docks. However, one continually abuses his friendship with the other by failing to keep appointments and not honoring promises. He dismisses his unreliability by saying that his friend will understand and that's what friends are for. His casual attitude towards his responsibility eventually causes both himself and his friend to lose their jobs. A good discussion starter for addressing issues about expectations of friendship, dishonesty and sexism. Suitable for middle secondary level."
