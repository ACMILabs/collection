        "Censored version. Presents a view of Odyssey House in Sydney and its drug rehabilitation program told by the residents undergoing treatment. Addresses the cynicism of many people to problems of addiction and cure. In particular the reasons for addiction are highlighted and shown not to be the easy of access to drugs but lack of emotional development within the individuals."
