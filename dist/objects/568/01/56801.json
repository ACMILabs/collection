        "Gives a general introduction to the UN, a brief history of the reasons for its establishment, and an overview of the functions and work of its various organs. Includes the role of the Security Council, UNICEF, FAO and the General Assembly. It is realistic in that it indicates that the UN is not able to solve all problems but that its value is as a forum to air disagreements. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
