        "An adolescent negro works part-time in a night-club as a dishwasher so that he can be near the musicians and foster his desire to play the saxophone. However, both his school and dishwashing suffers in his quest for recognition as a saxophonist. Raises issues surrounding work priorities, self concept and the expectations of parents, teachers and peers. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
