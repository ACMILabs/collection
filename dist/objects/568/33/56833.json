        "Episode of Series \"On camera: the BBC video production course\". Two versions of an item about a factory that has introduced morning exercises for its workers. Shows how the same material can be edited in different ways to change the shape of the story. There is also a demonstration of how interviews can be edited to greatest advantage and how shots can be juxtaposed to make the best use of materials."
