        "Highlights the need to be aware of one's limitations and to know when to say \"no\". An adolescent girl at high school takes on too much work on the local school magazine and as a result her school work suffers. Unable to handle her poor examination results, she lashes out angrily and irrationally at those around her. Raises issues regarding the need to accept responsibility for one's actions and to be assertive as opposed to weak or aggressive."
