        "Gives an up-to-date account of the changing forces and the topical issues confronting Australia's aluminium industry. It considers such topics as the economic benefits Australia will derive from an expanded aluminium industry; why power prices for smelters must be kept low; the extent to which Australia's enormous coal resources will be devoted to this industry; why smelting is becoming more important than the export of raw bauxite; and the overall competitiveness of Australia's aluminium industry. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
