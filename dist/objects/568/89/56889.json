        "Consists of five programs that look at the lives of five very diverse people, each giving an insight into life in Indonesia today. Examines the trans-migration program, the plight of Java's low income groups, the administrators of one of Indonesia's poorest provinces and a Dalang man who is trying to keep alive his ancient Hindu religion where Islam is the official state religion."
