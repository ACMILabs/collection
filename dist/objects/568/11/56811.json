        "Looks at the situation of a young Turkish woman who finds herself in an impossible marriage. Explores her dilemmas, her conditioning both as a migrant and as a woman, and shows how she eventually deals with these. The program is told from a migrant's perspective, having been written, produced and directed by a group of six migrant women from different countries and backgrounds. Raises issues about migrant women's lives in Australia, particularly domestic violence."
