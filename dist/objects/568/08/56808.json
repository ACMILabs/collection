        "An open-ended dramatization designed as a discussion starter about a father who is stunned to learn that his teenage son is not interested in taking over the family business. Sam decides to work in his father's bakery after leaving school only because his father wishes it. When Sam's father becomes ill, Harvey decides to help his friend Sam in the bakery. Sam copes well but Harvey is totally unsuited to the job."
