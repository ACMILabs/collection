        "Filmed in Russia, this feature-length production of the tale of Jack frost involves many stock characters such as an ugly witch, a cruel stepmother, a long suffering husband, an obnoxious daughter, a mistreated stepdaughter and of course, the \"handsome prince\". The prince is in the form of a vain young man who subsequently abandons his narcissistic ways. Originally in Russian; dubbed into English. Suitable for middle and upper primary levels."
