        "Most of the moving images produced for science, industry, commerce and medicine are seen only by specialised audiences and are then discarded soon after they are made.   `The Rumour of True Things' is constructed entirely from such moving images ephemera, including computer games, weapons testing, production lines, monitoring and marriage agency tapes. `The Rumour of True Things' is a remarkable anthropological portrait of a technologically-based society obsessed with imaging itself.  Taken from PROOF exhibition November 2004"
