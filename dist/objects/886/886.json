        "A family spends the day at the beach. The tensions between mother, daughter and father lead all three characters to isolate themselves as much as they can from each other - creating interior worlds within the larger open expanse of sand, surf, sand and horizon. This intimate and elegantly executed short film is a moving examination of one seemingly ordinary day that will change the dynamics of the family for all time."
