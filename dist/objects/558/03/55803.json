        "Episode number 4 of Series \"Pioneers of photography\". Julia Margaret Cameron was an outstanding photographer of her day. Despite the restrictions of her social position, she became a recognised artist of portrait photography. Many notable individuals such as Charles Darwin and Alfred Lord Tennyson, were included amongst her subjects. The film gives insight into the social and cultural environment and the moral attitudes that affected concepts of beauty. Demonstrations of photographic procedures used during the 1800's such as the sliding box camera, plates etc., is also shown. Narrated by Brian Coe."
