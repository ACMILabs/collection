        "Uses animation and live-action to illustrate the history of atomic theory, the structure of the atom and its nucleus, how nuclear energy is generated, radiation and the problems of nuclear waste disposal. Although basically factual, the program stresses the fact that the atom is neither good nor evil, and that it is man's responsibility to decide whether atomic power will either create or destroy. Made pre Chernobyl but an excellent introduction to atomic theory. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
