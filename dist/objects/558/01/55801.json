        "Restored by the National Film and Sound Archive, this film represents a substantial proportion of the original footage produced by Harry Southwell in 1920. Starring Godfrey Cass as Ned Kelly, the film includes both outdoor scenes and badly dressed roofless studio interiors that reflect Southwell's inexperience as a producer."
