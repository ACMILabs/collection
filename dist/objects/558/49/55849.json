        "This dramatic recreation of the reign of Elizabeth I of England is a study of political power used for noble ends. Elizabeth inherited a troubled and divided country. A Protestant ruler in a predominantly Protestant country, she held out as long as she could against Parliament's desire to pass anti-Catholic laws. When she discovered there was a plot against her life, Elizabeth signed the execution order against her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots even though she feared this would divide England firmly into two camps - Protestants and Catholics. Elizabeth I forged a great nation - a military power second to none, a glorious home for the arts, commerce and exploration, and a symbol of the Renaissance belief in the worth of man. Cast: Frances Cuka as Elizabeth I. Filmed at Hever Castle, Kent, England. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
