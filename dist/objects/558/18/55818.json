        "Gives step-by-step lessons in roller skating through the story of a roller-rink skater who teaches her younger brother how to move on skates. In turn, the brother teaches his sister how to move safely on skates outside the rink. Emphasises that safety and etiquette are more important than the mechanics of the sport. Outlines the selection and adjustment of equipment, use of protective pads, how to fall, stop and turn. Suitable for middle and upper primary and lower secondary levels."
