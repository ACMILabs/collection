        "Highlights a day in the life of a ten-year-old boy who lives in the slums of Bangkok, Thailand. Examines the problems of rural people who have moved to the city without job skills or money. Motivates discussion about the rights and responsibilities of children in different types of family and community situations. Helps to build understanding and appreciation of other cultures. Stimulates concern for children who are denied basic rights and opportunities. Suitable for upper primary and lower secondary levels."
