        "A look at the 1980 Olympics for the disabled held in Arnhem, Netherlands because Moscow declined the offer to stage the event, in which thousands of handicapped people competed in a wide range of events. The first Disabled games was held in London 1948, only 16 competetors, 1960 in Rome - 400 competetors, but, in 1980 over 42 countries competed. The partcipants included paraplegics, quadraplegics, amputees, people who have cerebal palsey, polio and varying degrees of blindness. It was at these games that users and wheelchair designers explored and exhibited new designs to assist the handicapped. H.R.H.Princess Margaritte opened the games which had the ideals of friendship, unity and sportsmanship. Many world records were broken. This program was narrated by Richard Morecroft."
