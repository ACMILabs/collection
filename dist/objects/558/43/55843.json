        "This full length version of one of the most important films in the history of silent cinema portrays the mutiny aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin and the role of the sailors and citizens of the Port of Odessa in the abortive revolution of 1905. It brought to the attention of the world the theories of Sergei Eisenstein, his emphasis on montage, stress on intellectual content and his treatment of the mass instead of the individual as protagonist. Suitable for Upper Secondary-Tertiary level students."
