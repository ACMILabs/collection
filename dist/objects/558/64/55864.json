        "This BBC documentary narrated and presented by Michael Rodd demonstrates a sample of technology and technique musicians and sound recordists have used to come up with a \"new sound in music\". The use of early oscillation and voltage control sound effects, computers, music synthesisers, multi-track-recording techniques, including tape manipulation are shown. Some early-automated musical instruments such as the Pianola and a programmed mechanical robotic violin are also seen. The presenter demonstrates how the electronic music theme to \"Dr Who\" was created in the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop and other musical themes for television are shown in their creation. Archival footage showing a stage performance of an unattended computer that can make unique musical composition choices is included along with its inventor Peter Zinovieff (the founder of EMS: Electronic Music Studios) at home in his studio. Musician and inventor David Voorhaus demonstrates the \"Maniac\", a unique analogue sequencer and an instrument that uses magnetic tape in the place of strings he created."
