        "World War II propaganda film, outlining the Negro soldier's participation in war and America history from 1776 to 1944, glossing over issues such as racism and segregation. Acclaimed for its dignity and sincerity when it was released, it now offers a historical perspective of stereotypes and racial attitudes held by the military and the public during the war. Music by Dimitri Tiomkin performed by the Army Air Force Orchestra. Written by Carlton Moss."
