        "The Titanic carried 2208 passengers, 705 were saved, 1503 died. This film re-constructs the sinking of the boat and the terror of the passengers using drawings and old photographs. The horror of the disaster, the victims, the rescue and the safe arrival of survivors in port is linked by a song."
