        "\"The Adoration of the Kings\", \"The Mocking of the Christ\" and \"Ecce Homo\" are the three paintings of the Flemish artist Bosch simply and carefully analysed. Excellent color and absence of dramatisation distinguish this short art film. The three paintings are in the Johnson Collection in the Philadelphia Museum of Art."
