        "A beautifully animated puppet version of Hans Christian Andersen's beloved tale of the graceful little maiden no bigger than your thumb. Escaping from marriage to an ugly toad, Thumbelina finds refuge with a good natured field mouse who arranges a marriage between Thumbelina and a mole. With the help of a swallow, Thumbelina escapes to a far away land where she finds happiness with the King of the Flower Angels."
