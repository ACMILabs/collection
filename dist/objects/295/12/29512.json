        "Part of a trilogy concerning the problems of young people in Australia. Judy is a young girl who lives in a large provincial city. Like most girls of her age, she longs to get out and see life, to find the fun, romance and adventure. She wants to go to the big city to work. The film shows the last few weeks before she leaves home. We meet her parents, workmates and boy friend. In their comments we discover some of the problems a teenage girl has to face when living in a large country town."
