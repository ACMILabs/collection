        "An aimless afternoon becomes a melodic adventure when a small boy retrieves a discarded trumpet from an alley rubbish basket. Oblivious of the stares of passers-by, he pretends to play the horn as he skips and struts down the busy street, lost in a jazz fantasy of his own imagining. Recalled to reality by his mother's voice, he scampers home, still tightly clutching his new-found prize."
