        "The term \"toolmaker\" in enginerring does not mean the maker of ordinary hand tools such as hammers and screwdrivers. The film illustrates this fact by showing the operation of the special tools that make coins. It shows the production of other special tools, drill jigs, press tools, multi-progression tools and gauges. The film shows the progress of a would-be toolmaker and describes the type of work and training that an apprentice does in an engineering works and also at apprentice classes in a technical college."
