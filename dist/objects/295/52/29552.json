        "A study of our living environment in all its variety. Capturing the mood of today's living, grasping at images of a graceful, more leisurely past, and examining alternative paths into the future. Without commentary, this deeply perceptive film establishes a basis for comparison of environmental situations, and asks the viewer to make their own choice. Begins with the documentation of Christo's wrapping of the Sydney cove coastline (shot through a rose coloured lens in the final scenes)."
