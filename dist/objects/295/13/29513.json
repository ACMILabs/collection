        "Part of a trilogy concerning the problems of young people in Australia. Michael has to make decisions in the complex but permissive world of today. His friends have followed a relatively straight and narrow path of conformity. Michael has more or less taken this course, but knows that other ways exist. He is prepared to listen to the prophets of change and revolution and is taken on an excursion into the world of the young radical. In which world does Michael belong? Features Grahame Bond. Also available on DVD [319174]."
