        "A report on the Republic of South Africa - its peoples, cultures and transitions from yesterday into today. The overall socially and economically complex structure is light-heartedly parodied as something which can only too easily appear vastly different to differing observers. A public relations representation of South Africa in the late 1960s ignoring the contemporary political and racial tensions of the time."
