        "Some of the tigers trained for Soviet circuses come from the Far East tiger country where they are trapped by groups of skilled hunters. The film shows the hunters, accompanied by dogs, trail their prey which, generally, prefer to elude rather than turn on their pursuers. After the dogs have cornered the tigers the hunters pin them down with forked branches."
