        "A farmer's wife discovers three little kittens with their mother in the barn. When they are two weeks old, the mother cat carries them to a new home in an old buggy, where they learn to feed and clean themselves and to play. As they grow, they meet other animals and learn to catch mice. Two of the kittens are given to local tradesmen to catch mice in their shops while the third stays on the farm with its mother to help catch mice in the barn."
