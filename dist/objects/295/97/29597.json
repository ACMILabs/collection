        "Episode of Series \"The Earth and mankind\". This, to the privileged, is a fine-sounding principle; but to the underprivileged it is a call to action. Riots in Africa, India's violence, China's new dynamism, Japan's intense industrialization - all these are seen as part of a great movement. Good historical overview of the rise of industrialization, with particular emphasis on the social affects (the growth in wealth brought on by industrialization)."
