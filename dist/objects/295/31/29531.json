        "Academy award winning documentary by Lindsay Anderson and Guy Brenton about the problem of educating children who are born deaf, and stresses the mutual trust and spontaneity of expression that deafness gives these children in compensation. Narrated by Sir Richard Burton, the Royal School for the Deaf in Margate is used to demonstrate how children must first be introduced to the idea of words, understand when words are spoken and to reproduce sounds they cannot hear. A masterpiece of sensitivity and dignity."
