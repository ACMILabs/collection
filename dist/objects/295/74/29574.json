        "How does time move, what is \"now\", what is reverse, or \"backward\" time? This account of modern theoretical and practical physical science examines concepts of time dilation, the entropy principle and astronomical time, relation of subjective and external time and the definition of a second. Scientific timepieces are shown, such as an atomic clock and a waterclock, as well as a brief glimpse of a cyclotron."
