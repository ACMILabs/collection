        "Dramatises aspects of the work of the American Cancer Society, showing possible indications of cancer, and the importance of seeking medical advice. A woman suspects that she has cancer and (as sometimes happens) does not dare go to a doctor, fearing above all that the suspicion will be confirmed. However, after a talk with a representative of the American Cancer Society, she takes the more rational course and has an examination, with negative results."
