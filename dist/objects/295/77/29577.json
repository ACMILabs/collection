        "A map shows the areas of the richest tin deposits in Malaya. Scenes of prospectors locating the deposits are followed by illustrations of the two main mining methods. Open cast by means of the hydraulic method or by power shovel and dredging using an enormous dredge. The dredging is considered the most productive and effective. The earth is processed until from 75 to 77 percent pure tin is derived. This is shipped to Singapore for refining and smelting."
