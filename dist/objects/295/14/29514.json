        "Part of a trilogy concerning the problems of young people in Australia. Toula is a girl in a Greek migrant family living in a Greek community in Sydney. She wants desperately to be a young, modern Australian, but she loves her parents and they demand a different way of life. In spite of family difference, gradually Toula and her brother establish a blend of Greek and Australian, bi-lingual and bi-social, which provides a certain amount of satisfaction for all concerned."
