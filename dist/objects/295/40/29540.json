        "Episode of Series \"Challenge for change/Societe nouvelle\". Cathy, mother of three, is a university department head in a Canadian city. She speaks of the insecurity she experienced because of unpredictable day care arrangements, and of the reflection of the same difficulty in the work of her married students, who do not work as creatively as they could. One of a group of films about working mothers."
