        "A central Australian journey was undertaken by the well-known naturalist, C. P. Mountford. On that journey he was accompanied by a group of Aborigines, who took him to their tribal lands and showed him the legendary rocks and caves and trees and streams, all of which are an integral part of the culture of the desert tribes. Mountford's camera recorded on this journey some of the most beautiful country in the Australian continent - the lands of the original Australians. Companion to \"Walkabout: a journey with the Aboriginals\". Originally filmed in 1946, revised in 1972."
