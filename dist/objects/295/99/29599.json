        "Road safety film. Introduces, with apparent casualness, a young couple about to set off on a motoring trip and a little girl at play. Happy and relaxed, they are planning to make the most of a fine day. A few minutes later the child is dead and the holiday makers numb with shock. The very lack of sensationalism makes the events seem real, leaving one with a sense of lives devastated without warning by pointless, avoidable tragedy."
