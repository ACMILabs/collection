        "A record of a train journey from London to Istanbul by Johnny Morris. On his trip through the continental capitals, he is seen watching an unorthodox fountain in Brussels, steaming blissfully down the Rhine, admiring a rebuiilt Nuremburg, pursuing the ghost of Harry Lime in Vienna in the rain, and visiting Budapest before embarking on a journey through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. He continues to the Golden Horn and Istanbul where he explores the town and samples the pleasures of a Turkish holiday resort and a trip down the Bosphorus."
