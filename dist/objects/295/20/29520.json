        "One of Australia's national sports vividly pictured for those who live far from an ocean beach. Shows ocean beaches along the coast of New South Wales where surfing is more popular than any other sport. Its thrills include surf-boarding, surf skiing and life-savers rowing surf boats. The lifesaving clubs which exist all along the coastline have more than 13,000 rescues to their credit to date (1949)."
