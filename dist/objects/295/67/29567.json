        "The importance of the fork-lift truck and the unit land system of materials handling at various stages of industrial production and distribution are described. The movement of unit loads on pallets by road and rail from factory to warehouse is illustrated in detail. Many types of fork-lift trucks are shown at work, some fitted with ancillary attachments designed for handling particular materials. The savings made possible in time and storage space are shown in 'before' and 'after' examples of working methods."
