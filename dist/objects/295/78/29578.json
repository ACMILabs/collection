        "Covers the life and work of Michelangelo, placing his art in its historical context. This tribute creates a memorable impression of the artist's greatness and the abundant beauty he willed to the world. Adapted in part from Curt Oertel's 'Michelangelo: life of a titan' with a musical score by the noted German conductor Alois Melichar. Described by filmmaker and critic James Agee as \"a new and exciting way to see some of the greatest work ever done\", the film was awarded an Oscar in 1951 for the Best Feature Documentary. Narrated by Fredric March. Presented by Robert Flaherty."
