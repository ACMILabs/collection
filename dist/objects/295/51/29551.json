        "John G. King discusses concepts of time measurement and demonstrates devices used to measure and record time intervals from one second down to .0000000001 second, with possible extension by a further five places in certain cases. Points out the problem of verifying accuracy of a clock and considers briefly psychological time and the possibility of a limit to division of time."
