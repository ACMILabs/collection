        "An animal variation on the loved story of 'Oliver', this version is set in New York and finds Oliver, an orphaned kitten, playing with the likes of pickpocket pooches such as Dodger and Tito, both of whom are controlled by the human, Fagin. Oliver is pitted against Fagin's evil boss and his killer Dobermans when Jenny, the lonely little rich girl who adopts Oliver after he finds his way into her limousine, is kidnapped. It's up to Oliver and his friends to stage a daring rescue mission through the city's subway system. Features music by Billy Joel, Bette Midler and Huey Lewis."
