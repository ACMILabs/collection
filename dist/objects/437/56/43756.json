        "From humble beginnings, Sally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is about to hit the big time. Arriving from a trailer park in Nevada, an overeager and overdressed weather girl, she makes a disastrous debut on national television. All is not lost however as her passion for the job captures the eye of the experienced, and handsome newsman, Warren Justice (Robert Redford). With Warren's help Sally is transformed, Pygmalian style, into a popular and respected journalist. Along the way romance develops, but this is threatened by Sally's newfound success and they must find a balance between love and their successful careers. Cast includes Stockard Channing, Joe Mantegna and Kate Nelligan."
