        "Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a professional. He is meticulous and cautious. He also is a professional robber. After a successful heist, LA cop Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is on McCauley's trail and out to stop him. The two are soon caught in an epic battle and yet they recognise that they are actually essentialy the same. Michael Mann's \"Heat\" is a rivetting action film which also attempts to examine in some depth the lives of the film's characters, in particular Vincent and Neil as well as the other members of his team. By casting dynamic actors like De Niro and Pacino in the lead roles, as well as Val Kilmer and John Voight in supporting roles, the focus on character remains engaging in the midst of the explosive violence of the action sequences which drive the film along."
