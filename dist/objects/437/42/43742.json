        "Episode number 1 of Series \"A History of British art\". Episode one of 'A History of British art' looks at two extraordinary, forgotten legacies at the heart of the British art tradition: the lost tradition of Catholic medieval art, and the tradition of post-Reformation iconoclasm- an entire culture that was devoted to destroying art. Written and presented by Andrew Graham-Dixon."
