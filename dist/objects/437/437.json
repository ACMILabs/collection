        "Chris Cunningham's infamous film clip for electronic artist Aphex Twins is a terrifying trip into the dark side. The clip begins ominously enough with a young girl skipping down a grotty laneway. When an old lady comes across the child, the little girl reveals a creepy mutated face, which bears a disturbing resemblance to Aphex Twin Richard D. James. As the music begins to freak out, with the refrain 'I want your soul' being chanted through the distortion, the helpless old lady ultimately finds herself face to face with sheer horror."
