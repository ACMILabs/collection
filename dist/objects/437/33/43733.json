        "Narrated by Dr Zakaria Erzinclioglu who specialises in using flies as a means of crime detection in forensic science, this program profiles actual cases across the globe and interviews experts in the field to illustrate how the evidence of plants, animals and nature have proven or disproven cases. It takes an in depth look at the procedures and testing that takes place in the laboratories and outlines what different plants, animals and insects can offer in solving crime."
