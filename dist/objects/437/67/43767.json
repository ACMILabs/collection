        "Sister Wendy Beckett has a passion for art and leaves the confines of her religious silence in search of the art treasures she has found in books and on postcards. For Sister Wendy art represents a window to something greater, and when one is looking at art, one is looking at God. In this first part of the odyssey in which Sister Wendy openly shares her first impressions of seeing the art she's admired, she visits galleries in Liverpool, Cambridge and Oxford, stopping to reflect on her favourite pieces. PLEASE NOTE: THERE IS A CLOCK TIMER BETWEEN EACH EPISODE ON THE TAPE"
