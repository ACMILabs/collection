        "Andie (Molly Ringwald) is a girl of modest means, who may have to suffer the humiliation of having no date for the prom. She just wants to express herself through her eccentric fashion sense, but this does not sit well with her peers at the snob-ridden local high school. `Pretty in Pink' is a classic `80s \"teen flick\", which, to quote Adrian Martin, \"sensitizes us to all that is modest, fleeting, fragile in popular cinema and popular culture\". Cast includes Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy and Jon Cryer."
