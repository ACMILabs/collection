        "A most unusual prehistoric adventure set 80,000 years ago when primitive nomadic tribes ruled the land and were sustained by their most prized possession - fire. Starring Everett McGill, Ron Perlman and Nameer El-Kadl, the film follows a tribes attempt to replenish fire when their life-sustaining flame during battle with marauding Neanderthals is extinguished. Three of the survivors set out on a quest for a living flame but before they can learn about the secret of making fire for themselves, they encounter danger from stampeding mammoths, giant bears, saber-toothed tigers and a tribe of cannibals. Annaud's treatment of this film is pure realism, employing anthropologist/body language expert Desmond Morris, with special languages created by Anthony Burgess."
