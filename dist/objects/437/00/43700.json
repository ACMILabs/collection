        "Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro), is an aspiring comedian obsessed with TV talk show host, Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis). After co-ordinating a meeting with his idol, Rupert tells Langford about the comedy material he has written. Langford is as charming as he is dismissive, and after being repeatedly rejected and eventually ejected by Langford's staff, Rupert decides to take matters into his own hands, conspiring a sensationally irresponsible scheme to beat defeat. The 'King of Comedy' is widely seen as Martin Scorsese's cynically black-comic reaction to the media firestorm that followed his 1976 film 'Taxi Driver'."
