        "Dubbed \"America's first female serial killer\", prostitute Aileen Wuornos killed seven men between 1990-91. While she claims self-defence and then is later persuaded by her \"supporters\" to change her plea, Broomfield skillfully reveals the layers of truth that surround the case. By implication, Broomfield disarmingly and ironically identifies himself as one of those attempting to gain from the \"Wuornos Industry\"."
