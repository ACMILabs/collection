        "A peaceful holiday in Paris takes a macabre turn for the Doctor and Romama (Tom Baker, Lala Ward) as cracks start to appear in the fabric of time itself. Uncovering a plot by the sinister Count (Julian Glover), to steal the Mona Lisa, the Doctor goes on a dangerous quest which takes him four hundred million years into the past. These four cleverly written episodes are by David Agnew, a.k.a. Douglas Adams of 'Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy' fame, and includes cameo appearances by John Cleese and Elanor Bron. Douglas Adams would later re-work this story into his novel: 'Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency'."
