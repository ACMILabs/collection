        "All ten of Winsor McCay's films and fragments are on this compilation, transferred from the archive prints at Cinematheque Quebecoise. An important figure in the development of cinema, he developed a stage act at the beginning of this century that incorporated a series of \"lightning sketches\", which in turn led to his creation of moving pictures."
