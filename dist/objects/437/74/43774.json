        "Antonio Banderas; armed with a guitar, singing voice, a way with women and an armament of weaponry is El Mariachi; legend across the desolate wastelands of America. He is driven by revenge, drifting through towns in search of drug dealer Bucho, the one responsible for killing his girlfriend. He has a new woman in his life now, Carolina (Salma Hayek), who has her own reasons for helping him. El Mariachi wages a one man war against Bucho's henchmen, with the onslaught of violence set against a vibrant backdrop of Latin American music. Cast includes Joaquim de Almeida, Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin and Quentin Tarantino."
