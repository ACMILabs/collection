        "A thought provoking short documentary about exercising caution when developing friendships over the Internet and for the level of information that is disclosed. It does this through a discussion between two friends who have met and become friends in real life. This is compared to the relationship that is developing between one of them and someone he has 'met' over the Internet in a discussion room and via email. It questions issues such as what information is volunteered, what is held back, intuition, and whose on the other end of this unknown and faceless form of communication."
