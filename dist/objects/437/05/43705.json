        "In the late 1700's, King George 111 of England orders an ambitious expedition to the Pacific Ocean to observe an eclipse of the sun and to seek the mythical Southern Continent. James Cook (Keith Michell), a relatively unknown petty officer, is controversially appointed as commander, choosing an unlikely collier to carry him and his men into dangerous and unknown waters. After sailing to Tahiti, where the eclipse proves disappointing, Cook proceeds to chart the coasts of New Zealand and Australia beginning a glorious adventure spanning the oceans of the world. Cast includes Keith Michell, Carol Drinkwater, Fernando Ray and Jaques Penot. Based on the novel by Peter Yeldham."
