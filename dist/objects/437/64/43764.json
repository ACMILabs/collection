        "A picture of the Stroud Valley in Western England where weaving is still the principal industry even as it was hundreds of years ago. The sheep that once grazed there are now gone, and wool is imported from Australia, but rushing streams still provide water power and the weavers still produce fine cloth and maintain pride in their ancient craft."
