        "This is a well-made documentary about Kakadu National Park, with beautiful photography of the amazing landscape. Narrated by Jack Thompson, the film gives a fascinating account of the natural history of the area, including the flora and fauna, as well as the Aboriginal history Of equal interest, the film discusses the history of the Park, which was created at the same time as the adjacent Ranger Nuclear Mine began construction. Kakadu is rich in natural wonders, in Aboriginal history and, on the other hand, in mineral resources attractive to mining companies, which makes it one of the world's unique sites."
