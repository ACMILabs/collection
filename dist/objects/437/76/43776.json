        "Jim Carrey again stars as Ace Ventura, the animal sleuth with the gravity-defying hairstyle in this sequel to 'Ace Ventura, Pet Detective' (309280). In the deepest jungles of Africa, two tribes will fight a savage war unless their sacred animal god is found, so they're sending for the only man who can help, Ace Ventura. Africa will never be the same again as Ace discovers the animal within and answers the call of the wild in this out-there comedy. Cast includes Jim Carrey, Ian McNeice, Simon Callow, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Maynard Eziashi."
