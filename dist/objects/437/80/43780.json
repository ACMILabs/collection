        "The poet Hoffmann (Placido Domingo) recounts the sad tale of his three past loves; Olympia, Giulietta and Antonia (sung by Illeana Cotrubas, Agnes Baltsa and Luciana Serra), and reveals how the evil influence of his rival drove the lovers apart. Conducted by Georges Pretre, music by Jacques Offenbach. Sung in French with English subtitles."
