        "This is the Renaissance Theatre Company's production of the play directed by Kenneth Branagh. The cast is led by Richard Briers as Malvolio and Caroline Langrishe as Viola. A brother and sister are separated in a shipwreck and land on the shore of Illyria. The sister Viola disguises herself as a man and takes service with Duke Orsino who has fallen passionately in love with Lady Olivia. Viola is entrusted to plead on her master's behalf and finds that Olivia has fallen madly in love with her. Thus begins the comedy of deception which has delighted audiences for centuries."
