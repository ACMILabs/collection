        "An ordinary English family's life is thrown into turmoil when father resigns and decides that the family is moving to Australia. There is much resistance from within the ranks, but they keep a stiff upper lip for the sake of father. Making the decision is the easy part, explaining to the in-laws why they're going and selling off their belongings proves to be an arduous, but often comic task. As it proves to be more complicated than they anticipate they begin questioning their move. Cast includes Jack Hawkins, Margaret Johnston, Roland Culver and James Hayter."
