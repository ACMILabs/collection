        "Adapted from Gordon Graham's award-winning 1991 play by Stephen Sewell, which was inspired by the horrific Anita Cobby murder case, 'The Boys' is an amazing directorial debut from Rowan Woods. The film follows the events that occur after Brett Sprague (David Wenham), is released from prison after serving time for assaulting the manager of a local bottle shop. Brett's presence creates a constant sense of tension as everybody in the house - his mother Sandra (Lynette Curran), his two brothers Glenn (John Polson) and Steve (Anthony Hayes), his girlfriend Michelle (a fantastic performance from Toni Collete), Glenn's wife Jackie (Jeanette Cronin), Steve's pregnant girlfriend Nola (Anna Lise) and Sandra's boyfriend George (Pete Smith) - treads carefully around Brett's restrained anger. The film ocassionally flashes forward to the arrest and trial of the three brothers, building up the suspense as we wait for Brett to explode into violence. The actual murder is never shown but the suspense of the film and the atmosphere created by a superb cast makes this a chilling experience. The film won 4 awards at the 1998 AFI Awards - Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Screenplay Adapted from Another Source\". Cinematography by Tristan Milani."
