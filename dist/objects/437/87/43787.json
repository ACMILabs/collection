        "The tragic saga of the Wenatchee forest fire, one of history's worst, and the heroic efforts to combat it, is documented hour-by-hour and day-by-day. 8,500 fire fighters faced the flames and dense smoke for 16 days, and bulldozers, aeroplanes and helicopters were also used. Finally there is silence and stillness, after decimation of hundreds of years' growth."
