        "This is the story of Australia's greatest river seen through the eyes of two canoeists on an expedition seeking the history of the river and it's importance in the development of Victoria and New South Wales. It tells of the Aborigines, explorers and town founders; of irrigators, woodcutters and fishermen - all those people whose lives and adventures make up the history of the Murray River."
