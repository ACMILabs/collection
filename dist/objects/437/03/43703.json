        "Undaunted, indeed challenged, by the furore over `Juvenile Liason' Nick Broomfield and Joan Churchill wanted to make another film about young offenders who had been institutionalised for the purposes of rehabilitation and training. Luckily, they found the Director of the California Youth Authority who, disillusioned and on the verge of retiring, was willing to give them carte blanche with the filming."
