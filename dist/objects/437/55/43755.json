Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a New England banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, is sent to Shawshank State Prison where he meets \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a seasoned lifer. Despite twenty years on the inside, the prison bars fail to contain their spirits and the pair forge an unlikely friendship that overcomes pain, suffering and ultimately leads to a chance at freedom."
