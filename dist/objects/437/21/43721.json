        "Former self confessed 'nerds', offer candid views on what it was like to be isolated and bullied in high school and how their lives have turned out. Although those interviewed share their moments of past pain, most of them have gone on to successful and creative ventures, which may have only been possible because of their distinct personalities. An entertaining documentary that nerds and non nerds alike will be able to relate to."
