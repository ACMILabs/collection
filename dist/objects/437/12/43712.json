        "This tape offers a brief but fairly comprehensive introduction to safe workplace practice and back care in both office and industrial settings. For office workers the main cause of back injury is sitting for long periods, without breaks and without varying the pose of the body. This video suggests a series of simple exercises that take just a couple of minutes, and can be performed at the desk or in a restricted area. For workers in industry the main risk is lifting. The video provides a simple and easy to follow checklist of things to remember when lifting. It also provides details of good lifting and carrying techniques."
