        "Mapplethorpe's studies of nude black men were a shameless affirmation of gay sexuality. He has been credited with helping to formulate a sense of gay identity in New York, but as one of the most successful photographers of modern time, his work has also been instrumental in restoring the male nude to mainstream art. This program charts Mapplethorpe's career from student to leading figure in the art world."
