        "In this survey of modern Canadian sculpture, man's desire to give a third-dimensional form to his image is seen both in the child's mudpies and in the greatest commemorative monuments. Techniques of the sculptor's art - carving in wood and stone, clay modelling, making a plaster mold for metal casting - are demonstrated by leading Canadian sculptors, in a survey which extends from totem poles and early French woodcarving to the great war memorial on Vimy Ridge. Included are Jacobine Jones, Frances Loring, Donald Stewart, Louis Parent and Dora Weschler, as well as Emmanuel Hahn with his designs for coins."
