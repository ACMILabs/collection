        "Episode number 5 of Series \"A History of British art\". Having invented modern painting, the British turned their backs on it. The vigour of 19th century engineering is contrasted with the moralising character of its arts, and its need to smother the radical energies of the nation. Written and presented by Andrew Graham-Dixon."
