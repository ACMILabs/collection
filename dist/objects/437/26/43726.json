        "The River Thames has been called \"England's liquid history\". It starts in the Cotswold Hills and winds for over 160 miles, through nine English counties until it reaches London. In the journey downstream, beginning at Windsor Castle, Eton, Datchet, Staines, Walton-on-Thames, Hampton Court Palace, Richmond Hill, Kew Gardens, and so on to London, and Battersea Park, the Tate Gallery, Lambeth Palace, the Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge, Greenwich and finally, Tilbury Docks are shown."
