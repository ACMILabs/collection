        "This is a lively account of the many-sided contribution of engineers, planners, producers, actors, musicians and technicians to the pleasure of Canada's radio listeners. Excerpts from popular programs like Stage '47, The Happy Gang, Prairie Schooner, and The Trio Lyrique are heard. The film ends with an indication of the activities of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's International Service."
