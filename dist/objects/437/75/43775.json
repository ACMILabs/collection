        "Nineteen-year-old Lucy (Liv Tyler) goes to stay in the Tuscan countryside with old friends of her late mother. This is a time of discovery for Lucy: inspired by the free-spirit of the bohemian characters who take special interest in her virginity (or loss of), she explores a romance with a local Italian boy. Her mentor is Alex (Jeremy Irons), who is a writer on the brink of death. Bertolucci is pre-occupied with aesthetics in this film and the focus is very much on the beauty of the Tuscan countryside, and of Liv Tyler. Cast includes Sinead Cusack, Jean Marais, Donal McCann, Stefania Sandrelli, Joseph Fiennes."
