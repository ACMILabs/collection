        "Soldier/Administrator David Collins, arriving in Sydney on the First Fleet is acknowledged as being the first official to acknowledge there is tension between blacks and whites in their struggle over the land. Fighting ends temporarily in Tasmania after a verbal treaty is reached acknowledging partial rights to Aborigines over the land. The Government quickly breaks this verbal promise however and the Aborigines flee into exile."
