        "From its source in the Cotswold Hills, the Bristol Avon River winds its way through quiet pastoral country, presently reaching the city of Bath, famous for its period architecture and its mineral springs. The Avon flows through the industrial city of Bristol, one of the busiest ports of Britain, and near the sea at Avonmouth, the dockyards line the river banks."
