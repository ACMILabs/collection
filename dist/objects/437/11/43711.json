        "A surreal, offbeat and lush sequel to the original cult classic, this is the farcical story of a man whose lascivious escapades lead to serious trouble. In the process of arranging a liason for his son, the hero becomes involved with the 'Mirage Woman', unaware that she is a pursued criminal who extracts the essence of all her sexual partners and kills them. With four wives and the pick of all the women in the country, has he finally met his match? This is a humourous and colourful saga that continues the notoriously explicit style of the original. In Cantonese with english subtitles."
