        "Fallen Angels is another breathtaking film from Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai. The film stylishly weaves the stories of a group of characters who traverse Hong Kong city by night. Wong Chi-Ming (Leon Lai) is a hired killer. His partner is an un-named woman (Michelle Reis) whom he has never seen. A young man who doesn't speak (Takeshi Kaneshiro) videos his father in their tiny Hong Kong flat. Hong Kong, the city, is itself a 'character' in the strange meanderings of the stories. Wong Kar Wai (together with Australian cinematographer Chris Doyle) creates a visually stunning, edgy style which none the less is as much about the characters drawn together as cinematic effects. In Cantonese with English subtitles."
