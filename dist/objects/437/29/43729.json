        "Melvin (Jack Nicholson) has established a regimented lifestyle which enables him to cope with his obsessive-compulsive disorder. His routine existence is interrupted by changes in the lives of his neighbour Simon (Greg Kinnear), and his waitress Carol (Helen Hunt). Caring for Simon's dog, and his involvement in Carol's personal life puts him back in touch with a humanity which has been lacking in his structured life. Powerful performances from Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, who both won Best Actor Oscars for their efforts."
