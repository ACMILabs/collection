        "Based on the novel by Austrian climber Heinrich Harrer, this is the amazing true story of his friendship with the Dalai Lama. Climbing in the Himalayas, Harrer is captured as a POW in China at the start of the second world war. He manages to escape the camp and flees across the mountains into isolated Tibet. As one of the few foreigners to ever enter Tibet, Harrer forms a friendship with the young Dalai Lama and becomes his confidante. The film depicts the most tumultuous period of Tibetan history in which China invades and occupies Tibet - an oppression which continues to this day."
