        "Every year veteran organisations hand out millions of synthetic poppies on November 11 - Remembrance Day - but what about John McCrae, poet and physician, who penned the famous lines \"In Flanders Fields\". The author of the most famous Canadian war poem ever written remains relatively unknown. This documentary tells the story of John McCrae from his childhood in Guelph, Ontatrio, through medical school at the University of Toronto to the second battle of Ypres in Belgium. The war with all it's horrors had a profound effect on McCrae along with the death of a close soldier friend; he penned his most famous poem after his friend's death. McCrae was never the same after leaving the front, his health failed and he died in 1918 without knowing the outcome of the war and was buried in France. This tribute to his life and work will make people remember his life and work and to think about the poem that meant so much to the people who fought and died in that awful war."
