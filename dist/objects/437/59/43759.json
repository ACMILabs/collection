        "Episode of Series \"The Century of cinema\". Typically British. Directed by Mike Dibb and Stephen Frears, produced by Colin MacCabe. Francois Truffaut once observed that the words 'British' and 'cinema' seemed incompatable. In his celebration of 100 years of British Cinema, Stephen Frears shapes an elegant and witty riposte to this statement. In discussion with other British film-makers, Frears explores the wealth of stylish and familiar images created by the British film industry over the last century. \"Irish Cinema: Ourselves alone\". Produced and directed by Donald Taylor Black. Narrated by Gabriel Byrne, this documentary looks at the struggle of Irish people to create an Irish cinema. Carefully intercutting interviews with directors, writers and producers with clips from feature films, location footage and fascinating archive material, Donald Taylor Black compares past and present in order to ask questions about the future of Irish cinema."
