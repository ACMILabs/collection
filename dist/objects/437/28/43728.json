        "A searching study of suburban futility. Shows in painstaking and intricate detail the chilling, deadening aimlessness of an unmarried woman's existence - an existence divided between the exhausting monotony of machine-minding and the nervous strain of caring for her stolid, vacant, fractious parents. The routine is broken by a relative's telephone call wanting to pay a visit and introduce his fiancee. For Alice the natural behaviour of the young couple is a revelation, bringing home to her, her own desperate situation and the implacable passage of time. Cast includes: Alice Spaul, Eunice Phelps, George Wood."
