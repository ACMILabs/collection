        "Red October is a technologically superior Soviet nuclear submarine under the command of Captain Marko Ramius (Sean Connery). It is heading for the United States coastline and has the American government in panic mode who presume that the submarine is preparing for attack. Only one man is prepared to consider the possibility that there is another motive. CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin starring in the role that later featured Harrison Ford) has a different idea; he thinks Ramius is defecting from the Russian navy and it's a race to see whether Ryan can prove his case before the Russians catch up with Red October and the wayward Ramius. Based on the novel by Tom Clancy. Cast includes James Earl Jones, Sam Neill, Scott Glen and Joss Ackland."
