        "The final part in the 'Frontier' series moves North to Queensland where Aboriginal resistance is high. An estimated ten thousand Aborigines lose their lives in the resistance with the law of the day, the Colonial Government, seemingly turning a blind eye. In the face of these massacres, forced assimilation and breeding out, Aborigines started to organise politically and informed white Australia they had no intention of dying out."
