    "description": [
        "Presented with a straightforward charm, Logue's abbreviated portraits of fishermen in Gloucester, Massachusetts are more than mere \"fish stories\". Seen on their boats in the open sea, the fishermen speak directly to the camera, relating anecdotes and observations that are alternately comic or poignant. Logue documents the fishermen's individual characters and evokes a sense of their rituals and traditions. With humor and pride, the fishermen chronicle their close ties to family, the ocean, and their community. Logue applies elegant video effects that heighten the resonance of these brief vignettes."
