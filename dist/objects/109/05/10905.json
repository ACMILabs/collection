        "Asked to \"make a stamp come to life\". Mitchell has created a vibrant, multicolored traffic flow in a stamp featuring Sydney Harbour Bridge.  The price of the stamp rises as the increase of traffic flow occurs across the bridge. Highly Commended. An animated short entered to ACMI's 'Screen It' media making competition for Primary Schools."
