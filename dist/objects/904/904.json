        "'Blow up' is a visual pun. Austrian experimental film-maker, Siegfried Fruhauf, uses discovered footage of a man demonstrating mouth to mouth resuscitation on celluloid. The film is displayed in a way that show-cases the celluloid format as an object, rather than viewing the film with the content frame by frame. As the footage rolls the film is objectively abstracted with penetrating sounds of heavy breathing. As the 'camera' pans closer, the image takes over and we enter the film. It is our breath that now fills the image."
