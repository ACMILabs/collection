        "An indication of the extent and importance of Canada's telecommunications network for air and sea navigation and overseas communications. Designed for the general audience, the film illustrates the operations of the four divisions of the Telecommunications and Electronic Branch of Canada's Ministry of Transport, serving public, private and military airports, coastal marine stations, weather ships, and the Arctic. On-the-spot examples are informative and impressive."
