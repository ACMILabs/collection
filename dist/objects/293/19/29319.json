        "An amateur film designed to demonstrate basic camera technique. The first half of the film, Version 1, is shot entirely in one and the same longshot. A little girl takes a parcel up to the door of a house, leaves it on the porch, runs back to the gate, hides behind it, and watches the lady of the house open the door, pick up the parcel, shake her head and walk in again. The second half, Version 2, is precisely the same story told with the judicious use of medium shots and close-ups. Thus we see the message in the box - `April Fool' - and the reactions of both the little girl and the lady."
