        "An important day in the life of a Tahitian boy, Teiva, living on the island of Bora Bora. He begins his day by seeing his father off on a fishing expedition, explores the waters close to the island, then sets off in his canoe across the lagoon to a volcanic island on the other side. He has set himself the task of climbing the high mountain on the island and returning before nightfall as a test of his manhood. He succeeds and returns home tired but contented."
