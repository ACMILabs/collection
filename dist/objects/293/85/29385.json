        "Many people believe that eighteen footers are the most exciting boats racing on Sydney Harbour. They certainly attract more spectators than any other class of boat. This film talks about sailing on Sydney Harbour. By contrast with those who live in one of the world's capitals, such as London, and who may have to drive some distance to reach their boats, the average Sydney sailor is lucky: there are literally yachts at the bottom of the garden."
