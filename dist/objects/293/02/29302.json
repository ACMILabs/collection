        "Explains the structure of teeth pointing out why they decay and the need for proper care. Dave is not fussy about his teeth and visits the dentist only when he has recurring toothache. The dentist explains the function of the different types of teeth in the mouth, the structure of a tooth and the ways in which decay begins and spreads. The film concludes by stressing the importance of eating proper foods, brushing the teeth regularly and consulting a dentist frequently."
