        "A dramatic reconstruction of many of the historic events of the 1917 Russian Revolution on the locations where they actually happened. Men and women personally involved in the Revolution talk about what happened to them in those dramatic ten days. The producers had access to official Soviet files, film archives and libraries. Some of the newsreel material has not been seen before. Narration is by Orson Welles, supported by the voices of Robert Stephens, Barbara Jefford, Janet Suzman and Hugh Burden."
