Observes several mothers and babies and gives guidance on such subjects as bathing, breast and bottle feeding, teething, potting, sickness after meals, the \"three month colic\", immunization, and hazards in the home. Raises, without trying to resolve, the problem of the psychological impact of a new arrival on older children."
