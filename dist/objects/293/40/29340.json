        "A behind-the-scenes look at the production of the play \"The red devil battery sign\" by Tennessee Williams. Tennessee Williams talks about his career and about writing a play and how he works with a director rather than with the actors. The film shows a press conference, rehearsals of lines and then full rehearsals during which the director conveys his interpretation of some of the important symbols and speeches in the play"
