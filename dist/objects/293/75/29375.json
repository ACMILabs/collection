        "Episode of Series \"History of the drama\". An abridged presentation in English of Pirandello's play in which six characters seek to exchange their fixed, frozen form in art for the uncertainty of life, to distinguish between dramatic reality and dramatic illusion, between acting and artifice in real life, and between reality and truth. Narrated by Joseph Heller."
