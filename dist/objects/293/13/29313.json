        "Provides a general introduction to television programs for schools, and their use in both primary and secondary schools. Two headmasters speak of their experience of using the medium and the childrean are seen \"following up\" the programs both inside and outside the classroom. Valuable for the picture it gives of modern education, new schools, and for its revealing close-ups of children."
