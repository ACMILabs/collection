        "Episode number 1 of Series \"The Commonwealth of Nations\" This is the first of a series examining the Commonwealth of Nations to see what it really is - what the bonds are that unite, and the differences that divide, this great family scattered over the face of the Earth. Edgar McInnis, president of the Canadian Institute of International Affairs and narrator of the series, discusses relationships between individual members of the Commonwealth and how these relationships withstood the strains of the Suez crisis in 1956."
