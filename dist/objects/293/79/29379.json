        "Two high school boys attempting to solve the problems of poverty in a Mexican border town, cause a near riot because of their insensitivity. Back at school one of the boys realises that the whole venture was no more than an ego trip, and tries to escape his feelings by speeding out to the desert on his bike. The bike upsets and he finds himself in the dust, alone unable to take anymore, he cries out to God. Some days later, Carl at peace, is seen alone heading back to spend a few days living among the people in the border town."
