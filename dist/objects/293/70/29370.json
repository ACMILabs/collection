        "Episode of Series \"Man Alive\" Discusses the times in a woman's life when she is faced with change - change in family life when children grow up, change in feelings about herself, more self confident, but at the same time afraid that she is no longer attractive to men, and change in the biological sense of the menopause. It is a time when she's either got everything she ever longed for, or has to face up to never having what she wants."
