        "Produced by the group which also made HARLEM WEDNESDAY and MOONBIRD. Using abstract shapes and colours and animated sketches, it tells amusingly of a girl and boy who meet in a park and, after shy advances and retreats, leave happily together. Music performed by the Oscar Peterson Trio with vocals by Ella Fitzgerald."
