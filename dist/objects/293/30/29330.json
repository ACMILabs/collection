        "Unemployed, a young coloured man living in London borrows ten shillings to see him through until he gets a job. He has no luck at the Employment Exchange, and to add to his troubles, he is `touched' by an out-of-work fellow countryman who needs ten shillings to redeem his guitar from the pawnbroker so that he can play at a dance. While the musician is in the shop, the young man meets a rather snobbish well-off friend from whom he tries to conceal his position - a humorous position well exploited. Sharp evocation of its time - duffel coats and modern jazz score by the Joe Harriot Quintet."
