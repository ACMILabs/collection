        "A study of life in a Greek village community on the island of Simi, a barren rocky island lying in the Aegean Sea off the coast of Turkey, with particular emphasis on the surrendering of traditional means of livelihood because of changing economic circumstances. Migration is a central theme of the film, with special reference to Australia. Scenes of the island reveal that despite a lack of factories, farming and jobs, close cultural and community ties bind the 3,000 inhabitants together."
