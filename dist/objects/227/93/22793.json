        "A childhood fantasy where dreams carry a boy far to adventure. It is an animated film in a contemporary style, employing drawn backgrounds, inserts of photographs, and successions of the same pictures to suggest movement. The most animated figure is the boy. He arrives in Canada on an ocean liner and is, in turn, a hunter of polar bear, a cowboy, a hockey star, and a swimmer. (Award: Toronto.)"
