        "No part of New Zealand is very far from the sea and as a result it has become part of the lives of the inhabitants. Many are engaged in the fishing industry; boating and sailing are popular pastimes; and the numerous beaches within easy reach of the city dweller, provide opportunities for swimming and relaxation."
