        "This film tells the story of a baby elephant from its first day in the jungle, through many weeks of training, to the day it joins a working force of elephants in a lumber camp. Photographed in Mysore, India, the film gives an account of the daily activities of working elephants and of the people who train them, including the shooting of a tiger which came too close to the camp for comfort."
