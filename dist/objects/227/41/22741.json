        "Shows the step-by-step erection of a Bailey bridge by the Country Roads Board over a washaway on the Great Ocean Road, Victoria. In twelve hours, over 11 inches of rain had fallen, causing a gully 110 feet wide and 50 feet deep, thus completely stopping traffic. Twelve hours later traffic was flowing across a prefabricated bridge built by the Board as a temporary measure."
