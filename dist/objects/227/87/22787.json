        "The story of man's use of energy from the days of primitive sun worship to the present time. It took man a long time to find sources of energy - apart from man power - which he could harness to his own ends. For centuries he knew only of the horse, water, wind and fire. Then came coal, the steam engine, the Industrial Revolution, and the internal combustion engine using petrol. Today oil is the greatest source of energy. Commentary by Maurice Denham"
