        "The opening sequence of Olivier's film version of \"Henry V\". A remarkable recreation of Shakespeare's London, showing the first part of the play as it may well have been produced originally on the stage of the Globe Theatre. Olivier's treatment has been very free, and many amusing sidelights on the actors and audiences of Shakespeare's day are included. Cast includes Laurence Olivier, Robert Helpmann, Leslie Banks, Quentin Crisp."
