        "Lake Tyers, which has been home to Aborigines for over one hundred years, was the site of a camp for aboriginal and non-aboriginal boys for ten days. Under the watchful eyes of voluntary skilled instructors the boys swam, sailed, canoed, scuba-dived, went hiking, fishing and played the residents at cricket. They made friends and learned teamwork and co-operation. Narrated by David Johnson."
