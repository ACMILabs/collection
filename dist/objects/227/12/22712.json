        "The film is set in a modern electronics research laboratory where work is seen being carried out on, for example, electron beam machining, high vacuum techniques, cathode ray tubes and microcircuits. The relation between research and production is illustrated, and the end sequence illustrates the many fields in which electronics play a vital part including medicine, telecommunication and defence."
