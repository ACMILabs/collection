        "A comment without words on the ancient theme of love and war: the man called to arms for his country; his sweetheart left behind to mourn; sorrow and separation visited upon the innocent. This is how it has always been, but implicit in the film are the protests of a new generation: Must it always be so? Is not love better than war? Cast includes: Michel Gauthier, Dennis Nadeau, Caroline Price, Paul Sullivan. (Award: New York)"
