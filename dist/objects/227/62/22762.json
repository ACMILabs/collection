        "Encounter Bay, where the Murray River enters the sea, has a colorful history of whaling stations and ship wrecks. Bleached bones, rusty anchors, and museums remain to testify. Now Victor Harbour, Port Elliot, and Goolwa are popular holiday resorts. Luxurious accomodation, miles of surf beaches, golf courses, and natural beauty have made it a playground for people of all ages."
