        "Episode of Series \"Challenge for change/Societe nouvelle\". Part One of this film shows a lively confrontation between Saul Alinsky a professional activist, from the US whose efforts have been directed toward organising the poor, and several members of the Company of Young Canadians. In Part Two some young articulate Indians test their inherently tolerant philosophy against the more pragmatic ideas of Saul Alinsky. Peaceful persuasion is the means by which the Indians hope to bring about change while, contrastingly, Alinsky advocates a more direct development of power."
