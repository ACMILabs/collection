        "Part of the Physical Science Study Committee series. Shows why we believe in the unity of the electro-magnetic radiation spectrum. Experiment shows that the radiation arises from accelerated charge and consists of transverse waves that can be polarised. Interference (Young's double slit experiment) is shown in four different regions of electromagnetic spectrum: X-ray, visible light, microwave and radiowave."
