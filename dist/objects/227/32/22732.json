        "From King's Cross Station, London, to Waverley Station, Edinburgh, is 393 miles. The Elizabethan - a summertime express - does this journey in six and a half hours non-stop - the longest daily non-stop run in the world to be timed at over 60 mph in 1954. This film is about one of those runs and the people behind the service."
