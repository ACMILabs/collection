        "Episode of Series \"Personnel Management\". The importance of the employment interview in getting the right person on the job. A brief review of poor hiring methods is given to illustrate how good workers can be overlooked in favour of less qualified, more aggressive, workers when those who do the hiring are untrained or indifferent. The film then illustrates a good interview, step by step; obtaining information through application forms and friendly discussion, testing, use of rating scale, etc. The function of foreman and supervisors in the interview is discussed, and pre-induction preparation of the applicant hired is shown."
