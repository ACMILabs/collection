        "Part of the Physical Sciences series. By means of various photographic techniques including animation, the hypothesis that electricity consists of unit elementary charges is supported by observation of phenomena associated with the conduction of electricity in liquids, gases, and vacuums. The conclusion drawn is that the fundamental unit of an electrical charge is the electron."
