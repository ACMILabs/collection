        "This film explains that encaustic - hot wax used as a binder for pigment - is an ancient painting technique revised by Karl Zerbe in the late 1930's. Follows the artist in the various steps from the laying of a collage ground on bare masonite through the final touches of blowtorch to the surface of the finished painting."
