        "Episode of Series \"Elements of design\". Straight, curved, S-shaped and circular lines are established as being the basis of linear design. Examples in nature stress the need for being aware of line designs in the physical world. There are illustrations of historical use of line in many ways, times, and places. The elements of repetition and rhythm are pointed out in nature, industrial design and architecture"
