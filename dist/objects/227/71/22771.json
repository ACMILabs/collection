        "Originally photographed at the time of Shackleton's attempt to cross Antarctica from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea, 1914-16. Travelling from Buenos Aires through 2,000 miles of pack ice, the ship 'Endurance' was frozen in and smashed by pressure. Retrieving supplies and three boats the party camped at Elephant Island, while Shackleton and five others set out in terrible cold for sixteen days journey to South Georgia whaling station. Forced to land on the wrong side of the island, they walked 36 hours over a 9,000 foot unexplored ridge to the whaling station. Four expeditions were organised before the main party was rescued without loss. Shows Shackleton's later expedition in the 'Quest' ending with his death in 1922. Photography by Frank Hurley."
