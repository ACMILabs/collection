        "A look at energy and what it is, designed to encourage understanding and experimentation among even the youngest of budding physicists. This film pictures energy in familiar forms - light, heat, motion, etc. - and shows its origin in the sun. The illustration is cartoon-style, with color and movement appealing to youthful imaginations."
