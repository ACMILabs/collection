        "Film follows a farmer as he foolishes fatens his pigs, only to discover on market day that 'Fat pigs are out!'. He is then taken to an abattoir and shown the difference between fatty pork and the lean pork that the 'modern housewife' now demands.  Comical light-hearted tone throughout. Poor acting and dialogue. Good illustrated titles and 'The End'."
