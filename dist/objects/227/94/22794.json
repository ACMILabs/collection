        "Art film on the works of the great French sculptor Rodin. The film, which has no commentary, attempts to illustrate the meeting of two dreams, that of Dante and that of Rodin. Two titles are used, one at the opening of the film, \"Life ... that miracle (Rodin)\" and another before the Descent into Hell \"Abandon hope all ye who enter here ... (Dante)\". Using lighting effects and camera movement, the film brings to life the world of Rodin's statues, working from the two principal sources of the sculptor's inspiration, Love and Pain. His works are grouped according to the following themes:-The Creation of Man and Woman; Love and the Human Passion; Old Age; Poverty and Decay; the Descent into Hell, and the Vision of Hell"
