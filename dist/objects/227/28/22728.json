        "Trams in London are a thing of the past - buses have taken over. The film, completed in London's \"Last Tram Week\", takes you round the streets of South London and along the embankment with 2 cockneys who remember a song about trams that they sang in the music halls fifty years ago. Finally, 20,000 Londoners cheer and sing their goodbyes to the trams which for 91 years have rattled and clanged and swayed by."
