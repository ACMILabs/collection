        "Episode of Series \"Adolescent Development\". A docu-drama depicting the immature behaviour of an adolescent boy who fails to channel his emotions into positive feelings and actions. After being rejected by his girlfriend, Dave seeks revenge by slashing her new boyfriend's tyres. Deeper investigation suggests that Dave's parents have contributed to his 'emotional instability' by treating him like a child."
