        "After many years of careful conservation, Banff and Jasper National Parks have become vast zoological gardens. In this film you see many intimate views of the creatures of the wild, big and small, that inhabit the forested mountain slopes of these parks. Deer, moose, bear, big-horn sheep, birds and small animals that live above the tree-line are natural subjects for the close-up camera, shooting against a backdrop of snowy peaks of the Canadian Rockies."
