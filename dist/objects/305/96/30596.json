        "A study of the habits of woodpeckers. Introduces some of the different species; illustrates methods of nest cutting, photographed through windows cut into the back of the nests; young woodpeckers are fed and brooded by parents, and eventually climb from the nests. Shows the great spotted woodpecker seeking grubs in the hollow braches and harpooning them with its tongue; the green woodpecker obtaining ants by clearing out part of an ants' nest with its tongue; and a woodpecker using a \"woodpecker's anvil\" to crack a nut."
