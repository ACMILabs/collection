        "This film recalls the hey-day of the working horse at the turn of the century, and reflects on the decreasing number used today. The title is from Shakespeare's lines: \"Sometimes he trots, as if he told the steps, with gentle majesty and modest pride\". Narrated by Wynn Roberts. (Award: AFI Silver Award)"
