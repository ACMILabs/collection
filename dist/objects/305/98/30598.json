        "Episode of Series \"Children's Concert\". At one of Ottawa's Saturday concerts for children, the conductor, Eugene Kash, introduces the woodwind and brass instruments and has musicians play each of the main types. Beginning with a willow whistle, he explains that modern wind instruments - flute, clarinet, trombone and others - are just more complex versions of this simple pipe."
