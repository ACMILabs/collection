        "The history of the development of the jet engine by Frank Whittle at the RAF College, Cranwell. The film illustrates some of the hazards and difficulties experienced during the long years of research and experimentation which led, ultimately, to the first successful jet-propelled gas-turbine engine. The film ends with a short summary of the probable uses of jet engines in the future. No other credits available."
