        "Examines the typical animal forms of the rain forest of Latin America against the four distinctive backgrounds created by the structure of dominant trees and plants. Illustrates how the forest functions at four levels, and examines the animals and plant community at each level. Shows camouflage, method of climbing and leaping, and the search for food as animals fulfil their part in the ecology of a specific layer of forest community. Introduces the complex ecology of rain forests from southern Mexico to the Amazon basin. Shows the four distinct communities of the four vegetation levels from highest trees to small plants, with their characteristic birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects and other invertebrates and epiphytic plants."
