        "The 210-foot Parkes Radio Telescope is one of the largest steerable instruments in the world and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, a parabolic antenna suitable for a wide range of wavelengths, which may be directed with high precision over most of the visible sky. How the installation works is explained briefly and the significance of some observations made with it is discussed."
