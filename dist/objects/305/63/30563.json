        "Episode of Series \"Womanpower\". This film was made during the International Women's Year, 1975 and focuses on Sweden as an example of committed government using the full range of tools at its disposal in a real attempt to give substance to equality for women as set down in the United Nations Charter. Discusses women's role in the workforce, sexism in the advertising world, men's role in parenting and sharing house duties, educating primary aged children about gender roles and stereotyping, and basically highlighting the need for equality in all areas of life. Narrated by Joyce Gordon."
