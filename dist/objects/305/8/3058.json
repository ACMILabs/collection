        "Trapped in a cell of fear, Claire's longing for connection propels her beyond the known world. The world of Binary is neither a particular time or place, it is Claire\u2019s headspace. The images, sounds and content of the film always represent Claire\u2019s mental state, they are completely subjective. Digital visual effects were employed in the production of Binary to assist this approach and to portray Claire\u2019s increasingly unstable view of her world. Features Susan Prior as Claire and Briden Aspinall as the young girl."
