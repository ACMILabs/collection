        "This film is concerned with the actual distribution of pressure and wind as they are known to exist on the surface of the earth. After a brief revision of the theoretical distribution of pressure and wind belts, it is shown that the distribution of land and sea, together with variations in the position of the overhead noon-day sun, cause considerable seasonal variations from their destination on the imaginary globe. Africa is then considered in detail, and we watch first the pressure and then the winds change month by month as the belts swing north and south, following the overhead noon-day sun. The seasonal change of the prevailing winds in NW and SW Africa is explained. The monsoon lands of SE Asia and NW Australia are also dealt with in detail, and again we follow the monthly changes in pressure and wind direction in these regions."
