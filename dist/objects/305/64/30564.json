        "Episode of Series \"Womanpower\". Made during International Women's Year, 1975, this film is about an International Women's Forum discussing equal rights for women. In Tunisia, small changes have begun, but more is needed. Women need more education, and employment opportunities; to eradicate illiteracy and teach family planning. The cities and amusements belong to the men - this is to be changed."
