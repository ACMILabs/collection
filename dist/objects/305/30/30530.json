        "Winemaking in Australia. Amongst the new settlers coming to Adelaide in 1844 was Dr Penfold who was to establish the largest winemaking business in the British Empire. Founded in the Barossa Valley, it has branches in Griffith, the Hunter Valley, and Minchinbury. Latest machinery and up-to-date scientific knowledge combine to produce world class wines, which are bottled at Tempe, New South Wales. Champagne, claret, brandy and sherries have a world wide market."
