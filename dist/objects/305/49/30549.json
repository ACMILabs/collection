        "The aboriginal legend of how fire came under man's control, illustrated by aboriginal cave painting. The musical background was recorded in Arnhem Land by Professor Elkin. The story is that at first only one man could make fire, and jealously guarded it. However, by a trick Wirritt Wirritt (an ancestral hero) stole the secret for all men's use. Narrated by Ray Barrett."
