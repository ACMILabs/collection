        "Host Clyde Gilmour introduces pioneer filmmaker Norman McLaren and presents three of his works. McLaren demonstrates and explains the different animation techniques used in each. Seen are: La-Haut sur ces montagnes and C'est l'aviron from the series Les Chants Populaires, and the upbeat short Boogie Doodle. The film ends with a discussion of McLaren's work in India and China while on loan to UNESCO from 1949 to 1950. We see two short educational films made by his students in China, using techniques McLaren has taught them."
