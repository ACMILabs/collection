        "The scenery, industries, and life and customs of the inhabitants of the seven Central American countries, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, San Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. South American Indians constitute a large percentage of the populations and the influence of the old Maya gods and the Spanish conquistadors influences their religion and their dances. The Panama Canal and lie in sophisticated Bilboa which is an opulent cosmopolitan city are shown. In Mexico there is a sharp contrast between life in the country and in Mexico City with its modern buildings as well as the architecture of old Colonial Spain. A popular pastime is bullfighting."
