        "Part 1: A film record of women at the turn of the century and of the suffragette movement's struggle for equal rights. Spearheaded by women like Emmeline Pankhurst, the movement was characterized by imprisonment, demonstrations, and a great following of men and women. Women of all classes, women working during the war, overseas and in North America, are presented in this fine documentary. Part 2: Made in 1958, this part of the film begins and ends in praise of women's acquisition of the vote. In between is a rendition of all the \"equal\" activities of women (and even more than equal in factory work). Much footage is devoted to the UN Status of Women committee, whose mandate does not extend beyond equal political rights under the law."
