        "Sir Colin Mackenzie, famous surgeon and anatomist, thought that the study of Australia's unique animals would help to understand the human body. He designed and made an arm splint after studying koalas stretching for gum tips. His specimens can be seen in the Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. In 1921, 78 acres of land in Healseville, Victoria, was presented to the late Sir Colin Mackenzie, to enable him to study Australian animals. The Sanctuary now shelters kangaroos, emus, platypus, goannas, many kinds of parrots, parakeets and other birds, tiger cats, wombats and koalas. Narrated by James Dibble. Suitable for 11-15 year-olds."
