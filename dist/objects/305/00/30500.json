        "The title of this film is taken from an essay by J. A. Baker. The film like the essay, pleads for the spirit of the wilderness which exists in an estuary. It claims to show the aesthetic values of estuaries as well as their value to birdlife. The film was made as a reply to the claim that \"the siting of London third airport at Foulness is a victory for conservation\"."
