        "A picture of the wildlife on Macquarie Island stressing the harshness of the environment, where one creature preys mercilessly on another. Seaweeds and lichens; elephant seals; cormorants, sea vultures and skuas; black-browed albatross and many species of penguin are seen in the struggle for existence. The savagery of birds of prey is demonstrated as vultures stand by at the birth of a baby seal."
