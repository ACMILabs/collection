        "Based on the drawings and etchings of Aubrey Beardsley, Gustav Klimt, Max Klinger and other artists living about the turn of the century. This film is a tribute to the women of the Edwardian era, and gives a fascinating glimpse of that time. Also of interest as a study of the Art Nouveau, which expressed the prosperity of the period."
