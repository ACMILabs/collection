        "Today in the old German cities we can still meet the Middle Ages. Through their buildings, pictures and documents we can trace the history of their growth, the expansion of trade and development of craftsmanship. The proud and beautiful buildings of medieval cities and towns are a memento of their struggle for liberty and municipal independence."
