        "Through the story of one woman, the film gives an account of the work done by thousands of women in Britain who devote part of their spare time to various voluntary social services. The film is also significant in its exploration of the precursor of what would become the Department of Family and Community Services, staffed not by philanthropic local volunteers but by professional social workers."
