        "A lighthearted study of the wildlife of Central Australia and tropical Queensland. Shows several varieties of lizard, goannas and snakes in the desert, the many kinds of brilliant birds - cassowaries, jabirus and water birds, parrots and bower birds - found in the rain forest. Unusual sequences are the courting dance of the brown snake, the dance of the brolgas and a fight between a kookaburra and a snake."
