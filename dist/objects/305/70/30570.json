        "A fascinating early feminist documentary from India focusing on women and education. Through a framing story of a young girl's graduation from High School and the choices she confronts, the film provides a historical account of female eminence in pre-Hindi Indian culture and society. Further, it describes the contemporary struggle for female emancipation while stressing the opportunities and responsibilities that influence our protagonist's decision. A technically accomplished film with beautiful cinematography and a fine soundtrack of Indian classical music."
