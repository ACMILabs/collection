        "This film dramatises the problems of two women faced with difficult personal situations - financial duress followed by emotional breakdown in one instance and a suicide attempt following desertion and the depressing circumstances which this brought about in the second instance. In both cases the women are helped towards independence by the Widows Training Scheme."
