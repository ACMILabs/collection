        "Episode of Series \"Womanpower\". The developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are mainly agricultural, with 85 percent of their people living on the land. Half of all this manpower is womanpower. But so far women's economic contributions have been largely ignored while their labour has been taken for granted. The women of Sri Lanka are attempting to change this."
