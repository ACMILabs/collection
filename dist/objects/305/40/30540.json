        "A brief history of Guatemala is presented. The descendents of the Mayan Indians are shown on the shores of Lake Atillan, living a life that is largely based on ancient tradition. They work for six days on Chichicastenango to sell their goods and workshop their old Mayan gods on the steps on the church. Scenes are included of the modern city of Guatemala and the luxurious resorts set among the ruins of the past. The fondness of the people for music and traditional dancing is shown."
