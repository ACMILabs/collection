        "Examines the effects of the women's liberation movement in several different organisations and then shows the many ways, both good and bad, in which leaders and managers are dealing with the situation. Shows how a traditionally male-dominated company has adapted to changing sex roles through an organised program. This film can be used to explore the possible attitudes and hindrances to career progress which girls may face. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels."
