        "Bushfires, an annual hazard in Australia, destroy many thousands of hectares of bushland each year. This film traces the progress of a fire from start to finish though the eyes of the men who fight the fires and those who plan firefighting strategy. Also examines the controversy surrounding the claim that fire is necessary for the survival of the bush. Suitable for middle and upper primary and secondary levels."
