        "Shows the manufacture of Australian louvre windows in a Queensland factory. High grade steel is pressed and cut to form the side brackets; clips to hold the glass are stamped, formed and fitted onto bronze bearing completing a simple, rust and weather-proof frame which locks automatically when closed. The installation of louvre windows is shown. Although many louvres are exported to overseas, the home market uses an ever-increasing number of these windows which are ideally suited to Australian conditions."
