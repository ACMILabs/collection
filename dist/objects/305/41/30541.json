        "Principle features and event of the 1962 Farmborough Air Show. British aircraft on display included the Hawker P-1277, Bristol Type 188, Vickers VC10, de Havilland Trident, de Havilland 125 jet and the Beagle 218. Many others craft are seen on the ground and in the air, and supersonic fighters of the Armed Services give a thrilling display of aerobatics as a finale."
