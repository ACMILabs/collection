        "Episode of Series \"Alcheringa (A)\". To the women falls the task of collecting supplementary foods - such as witchetty grubs and yams. Use is made of a sharply pointed stick to dig under bark for grubs and to kill a lizard which wanders across their path; also to dig for yams. The daughter accompanies her mother on her daily walk and learns the art of food gathering."
