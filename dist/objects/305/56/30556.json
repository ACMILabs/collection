        "The story of the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union. Signing his retirement blank, Alexander Brody looks back over the years to 1910 when the ILGWU was founded; he remembers the days of the pickets, the Great Revolt, the harrowing holocaust of the Triangle fire, the days of trouble in the 1920s and finally the emergence of union power. The film also illustrates the present work of the union. With Sam Levene, Arlene Francis and Joseph Wiseman."
