        "Prolific Austrian avant-garde filmmaker and theorist, Peter Tscherkassky, reinvents a 1981 Barbara Hershey horror vehicle, leaving the original's crystalline surface intact only to violently shatter its narrative illusion. Sounds of crickets, static and distorted music give way to explosions, screams, and garbled voices. The actress' face multiplies across the screen as the frame is invaded by sprocket holes, an optical soundtrack, and flashes of solarized imagery."
