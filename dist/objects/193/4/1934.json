        "Overall winner of the 2002 ACMI Infogrames Diegesis, Garden of Eden was described by the judges as 'aesthetically mature' and 'conceptually rich, reminiscent of the brothers Quay'. The filmmaker was attempting to explore the theme of 'nature versus religion' and this rather dark vision features mesmorising characters that occupy a surreal landscape with a haunting original soundtrack of strings."
