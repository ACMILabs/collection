    "description": [
        "Short film made in 1958 by Graham Foster to send to his relatives in New Zealand. Structured as a comic ' Day in the life', the film features footage of Melbourne city and St Kilda and a constant wisecracking narrative from Foster. Of special interest is the segment on Foster's working day at a Melbourne television station featuring the behind-the-scenes action. As television did not reach New Zealand until 1960, this short film was the easiest way to demonstrate to his family, exactly what he did in Australia."
