        "A child is being driven through a real and imaginary landscape. We experience her subtle turmoil as she tries to make sense of these worlds. This beautiful animation depicts the sense of disorientation and isolation felt by a young girl who is a recent immigrant of Australia. The quintessentially Australian backdrop of the wide open road serves to add to her mental and physical unease. The emotional confusion that is expressed in the narrative is realised perfectly in the shifting, sweeping motion of the oil paint animation. MIFF 2000"
